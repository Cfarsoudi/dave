"BAD LIEUTENANT"

                                       FIRST DRAFT

                

               This story takes place during a World Series between the 
               Mets and the A's. Canseco plays for Oakland, and Strawberry 
               is still with New York.

                                         DAY ONE:

                                   GAME THREE: LT WINS

               EXT: EARLY MORNING - LT'S HOME - QUEENS

               This typical QUEENS HOUSE is sandwiched between other 
               neighboring, nearly identical HOUSES.

               The MORNING SOUNDS Of FAMILY BICKERING, LAWN MOWERS, and 
               SHOUTED GOOD-BYES are heard coming from many HOUSES on this 
               close-knit block. A NEW BABY can be heard BAWLING inside 
               LT'S HOUSE.

               LT, hurried and harried, stumbles out his FRONT DOOR. He 
               heads for his CAR, parked askew in the DRIVEWAY.

               LT is some 40 years old. His natural swagger makes up for 
               his lack of conventional good looks. He is obviously hung-
               over.

               LT squints, pained by the SUN. He fumbles with his SHADES, 
               puts them on.

               LT's TWIN EIGHT YEAR-OLD SONS trundle out the FRONT DOOR of 
               the HOUSE, bickering as they run to catch up with their Daddy. 
               The hefty TWINS wear ill-fitting PAROCHIAL SCHOOL UNIFORMS. 
               Their oversize PAROCHIAL SCHOOL BRIEFCASES threaten to trip 
               them up.

               LT's WIFE, BABE in arms, comes out to watch LT's lovely SEVEN 
               YEAR-OLD DAUGHTER head off toward her school on foot. Many 
               other members of LT's EXTENDED FAMILY hang out on the STOOP 
               and the LAWN.

               As the TWINS cross the LAWN, the bickering turns physical. 
               They start whacking each other with the BRIEFCASES. The TWINS 
               pile into LT'S CAR.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT: MORNING - LT'S CAR - EN ROUTE TO/AT PAROCHIAL SCHOOL

               The CAR is obviously LT's home away from home. FOOD DEBRIS, 
               BEER CANS, VODKA BOTTLES and other garbage litter the 
               interior.

               An impressive HAND-GUN is visible between the seats.

               An old ICON of MOTHER MARY rides on the DASHBOARD.

               As the TWINS get in, LT tries to hide the GUN and the illicit 
               detritus.

               To little avail. The TWINS pay no mind to his machinations; 
               they have evidently seen it all before.

               As LT drives the TWINS to SCHOOL, the three play wild rough-
               house.

               The CAR swerves crazily.

                                     LT
                         How many times are you gonna miss 
                         the bus? Huh? All the other kids can 
                         get up in the morning, but you guys 
                         wanna be driven around like the 
                         fucking President. I'm your goddamn 
                         chauffeur!

                                     TWINS
                              (each taking alternate, 
                              overlapping lines)
                         Shit, man. It wasn't our fault! -- 
                         You think Sis is so perfect, well, 
                         if she hadn't hogged the fucking 
                         bathroom, maybe we -- I thought Aunt 
                         Lu was dead! She was in there so 
                         long...

                                     LT
                         Shut up! Listen!

               ON RADIO: Chatter about Mets winning last night's game. It 
               was the THIRD GAME straight that they've won so far. One 
               more game -- set for tomorrow afternoon -- and the Mets will 
               sweep the World Series. All listen. 

                                     TWIN
                         They're gonna win the Series in four!

                                     LT
                         All the way with Strawberry!

                                     TWINS
                              (in unison)
                         Strawberry!

               The TWINS whoop and shout, celebrating LT's -- and their own -- 
               favorite player.

               They pass the PAROCHIAL SCHOOL BUS. It has stopped for a 
               moment taking on KIDS. LT cuts off the TWINS' tirade.

                                     LT
                         Shit, man -- there's your fucking 
                         bus I oughtta make you late! Make 
                         the nuns whack the shit outa ya both.

               LT and the TWINS banter back and forth, poke each other and 
               box around. The apparent hostility of their words is balanced 
               by the laughter and gung-ho play of the rough-housing. The 
               TWINS yell cat-calls as they drive past a BLONDE PEDESTRIAN. 
               LT joins in.

               ANGLE - Through the WINDSHIELD, the PAROCHIAL SCHOOL comes 
               into view. A CROWD of UNIFORMED KIDS is gathered outside. 
               SEVERAL NUNS turn the CROWD into two neat rows, and usher 
               the KIDS inside.

               POV LT - THE NUNS

                                     LT
                         Get going.

               The TWINS get out. Join the line of students entering the 
               SCHOOL.

               The instant the KIDS have left the CAR -- LT takes out some 
               COKE. Snorts it. He takes his GUN out of hiding.

               LT steers with his knees as he drives off toward the City.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT: AFTERNOON - QUEENS - CRIME SCENE

               ANGLE - A CAR WINDSHIELD. Blood-spattered and shot up. The 
               DEAD BODIES of TWO GIRLS are in the front seat.

               LT gets out of his CAR and makes his way through the COPS 
               and GAWKERS.

               The BET COP comes up to LT.

                                     BET COP
                         Two Black kids came up out of nowhere 
                         and shot those chicks. Then they 
                         laughed as they walked away. The 
                         Press is gonna call it the "Giggling 
                         Man Murders." I'll tell ya. What a 
                         world.

               LT gives a cursory glance to the crime scene. A couple of 
               COPS greet him; LT keeps walking.

               The BET COP digs his attitude.

                                     BET COP
                         But hey -- we make the best of it, 
                         man, don't we? Huh? How about them 
                         Mets!

               FOLLOW LT - over to a GROUP of COPS. They greet him and 
               everyone immediately crams into a parked CAR. The CAR stays 
               parked for the duration of their meeting.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT: AFTERNOON - UNMARKED COP CAR (PARKED) - QUEENS

               Now that LT, the BET COP and the OTHER COPS are inside the 
               CAR, they can do business. LT pays several COPS their WINNINGS 
               for last night's game. CASH and congratulatory banter is 
               exchanged.

               Now LT has to take their BETS for tomorrow afternoon's GAME, 
               the FOURTH GAME of the World Series. LT urges the COPS to 
               bet against the Mets.

                                     LT
                         No fucking way they're gonna do it 
                         in four games straight.

                                     COP ONE
                         You serious, man? I wanna go Mets 
                         all the way!

                                     LT
                         Go ahead, man.If you've got shit for 
                         brains. But if you wanna win the 
                         bucks, go with Oakland.

                                     COP TWO
                         I thought Strawberry was gonna --

                                     LT
                         I know that nigger like he's my 
                         brother. He ain't gonna let us off 
                         so easy. He'll make us sweat first. 
                         This game's going to Oakland. Not a 
                         doubt in my mind, man.

               Silence. The COPS think about it for a moment.

               BET COP speaks up first; hands LT some CASH. When he talks 
               to LT, his fawning posture is obvious.

                                     BET COP
                         I'm in. Here.

               COP ONE SHRUGS his assent, gives CASH to LT. The OTHER COPS 
               follow his example, place their BETS on OAKLAND.

               The COP BETS total $800 -- on OAKLAND. LT has obviously been 
               the bookie for this precinct for a long time. He takes care 
               of a lot of action and has these guy's faith.

               LT nods a goodbye, quickly gets out of the CAR. The BET COP 
               and the OTHER COPS remain inside.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT: AFTERNOON - PAY PHONE - MIDTOWN - 38TH STREET & 3RD 
               AVENUE

               LT pulls up alone beside a PHONE BOOTH and phones in the 
               COPS' bets and his own to LITE. More than an anonymous 
               connection to the BOOKIE, LITE is obviously LT's old friend -- 
               and a hustler just like himself.

               LT shouts into the PHONE and holds it close to his ear. The 
               TRAFFIC NOISE is loud and irritating.

                                     LT
                              (into the phone)
                         I got them all going for Oakland. 
                         With bullshit money. We'll cover the 
                         $800.

                                     LITE
                              (OC)
                         All right. What are you gonna do?

                                     LT
                         I want 15 on the Mets.

                                     LITE
                              (OC)
                         How about 7 1/2?

               ACROSS THE STREET - TWO GUYS approach a BUSINESSMAN in a 
               raincoat and flash a KNIFE. The BUSINESSMAN gives up his 
               WALLET and his WATCH.

               LT pays no mind to the robbery.

                                     LT
                         Hey, man. Don't give me that bullshit. 
                         Don't pussy-out on me. The Mets are 
                         a fucking lock. I wanna make some 
                         money.

                                     LITE
                         Are you sure?

                                     LT
                         Yeah. I'm sure.

               LT hangs up the PHONE, heads back toward his parked CAR.

               By this time, the BUSINESSMAN is running into the street, 
               waving his arms and screaming.

                                     BUSINESSMAN
                         Police! Police! Help me! Police!

               LT enters his car, drives off.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT: EVENING - CRACK CITY

               LT arrives, leading a BUST. Lots of COPS. LT chases a handsome 
               young COKE DEALER, JC, cornering him a couple flights up a 
               staircase. Now they're alone and the phony pantomime is over.

                                     LT
                         Hey, man, gimme something cooked!

               JC gives it to him with a PIPE. LT takes a drag of CRACK. 
               Then LT gives JC a large BAG of COKE, labelled "Exhibit A".

                                     LT
                         It's good shit. From when they busted 
                         those Columbians uptown. You can cut 
                         it in half.

               JC nods, bemused by LT's manic behavior. JC, in contrast, is 
               mellow and in control. LT smokes; JC doesn't.

               LT COUGHS and SMOKES as he shouts to COPS downstairs (OFF).

                                     LT
                         I got this guy. But there's someone 
                         across the street on the roof!

               The COPS (OFF) rush out of the building.

               JC watches LT smoking like a fiend.

                                     JC
                         That stuff'll kill you quick, man.

                                     LT
                         What the fuck are you? A drug 
                         counselor or a drug dealer? And you 
                         don't even do your own product! What 
                         kind of businessman are you?

                                     JC
                         The rich kind.
                              (shakes his head)
                         Jeez, man. The way you smoke that 
                         shit is suicide.

                                     LT
                         Fuck you.
                              (takes a deep hit)
                         Just give me back a little something 
                         for the road.

               LT takes a handful of the COKE and puts it in a DOLLAR BILL; 
               pockets it.

                                     JC
                         See you in a coupla days. Have the 
                         cash ready.

               JC splits, runs up the stairs.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT: NIGHT - ARIANE'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM

               Religious/hip artifacts abound. It's a nice, if messy 
               apartment.

               However, it is definitely not large enough to merit the $3,500 
               that ARIANE quotes as her rent.

               ARIANE is LT's mistress.

               BOWTAY, her girlfriend, lounges on the COUCH. BOWTAY plays 
               the third when LT is in the mood for a menage a trois. She's 
               around a lot.

               BOWTAY is already zonked out on something. Maybe LUDES.

                                     ARIANE
                         Got something good for us?

               LT gives her the COKE. ARIANE takes some immediately. BOWTAY 
               sloppily partakes.

               Before LT can even sit down, the GIRLS start bitching.

                                     ARIANE
                         I'm gonna need some bread, man. This 
                         ain't fair. I'm always here for you, 
                         and you can't even take decent care 
                         of me. My landlord is bitching like 
                         a motherfucker! You're two months 
                         behind on the rent, Lieutenant!

                                     LT
                         Didya ever think of moving to a 
                         cheaper apartment? $3,500 a month is 
                         crazy, man!

                                     ARIANE
                         It's nothing. This is New York, man...
                              (beat)
                         Oh -- I forgot. Bowtay needs some 
                         cash to buy her new acting headshots 
                         out of the developers. It's a good 
                         investment, man. She could make 
                         serious money!

               ANGLE - BOWTAY on the COUCH. It's obvious that she's going 
               nowhere. And fast.

                                     ARIANE
                         We've been rehearsing a new monologue. 
                         From Shad's Saint Joan, you know? 
                         Bowtay does it wonderfully well.

               LT breaks out more COKE and some GRASS.

                                     LT
                         All right, Bowtay. Show us your stuff.

               ARIANE lifts BOWTAY to her feet. BOWTAY staggers into the 
               center of the room, then falls back down on her knees. It 
               happens to be appropriate for the scene.

               BOWTAY begins to recite the monologue from the very end of 
               the play. "When will the world be ready to receive thy 
               saints?", etc.

               BOWTAY messes up a line; ARIANE lashes her with a BELT.

               BOWTAY doesn't move, continues reciting. ARIANE joins in 
               from time to time.

               LT is turned on.

               He begins KISSING ARIANE, then goes down onto the floor.

               BOWTAY is there already.

               Kinky trio sex scene.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT: LATER THAT NIGHT - ARIANE'S APARTMENT - KITCHEN

               It's evidently an hour or so later.

               The KITCHEN is very bachelorette. No FOOD or COOKING 
               IMPLEMENTS in sight.

               LT is messing around, looking for something to DRINK. He 
               opens the REFRIGERATOR.

               POV LT - CU - The REFRIGERATOR is entirely empty, save for a 
               few suspect and peculiar items. There is nothing in liquid 
               form.

               LT hears ARIANE calling to him from the LIVING ROOM.

                                     ARIANE
                              (OC - calling to LT)
                         There's nothing!

               It's clear from the SEX SOUNDS (OC), that ARIANE and BOWTAY 
               are still going at it.

                                     ARIANE
                              (OC - calling to LT)
                         Go out and get some Diet Cokes.

               LT obeys. He leaves the KITCHEN.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT: NIGHT - ARIANE'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM

               LT passes through the LIVING ROOM, putting on his CLOTHING 
               as he heads for the DOOR to OUTSIDE.

               The GIRLS don't miss a sexual beat. They continue what is 
               now a menage a deux. They won't miss LT while he's gone.

               LT splits. No good-byes.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT/INT: LATE NIGHT - KOREAN DELI

               LT approaches the market where he intends to buy the DIET 
               COKES.

               A display of FRESH FRUITS & VEGETABLES extends onto the 
               sidewalk.

               LT notices a SQUAD CAR, parked in front of the MARKET. LT 
               picks up his pace.

               Closer now, LT sees a YOUNG UNIFORMED COP outside, standing 
               with the KOREAN OWNER, an elderly man who doesn't speak much 
               English. The OWNER is agitated and out of breath. He argues 
               fiercely with TWO YOUNG BLACK KIDS.

               A SQUAD CAR is parked in front of the MARKET.

               LT gets an idea. He takes command.

                                     LT
                              (to Cop)
                         What's going on?

               The UNIFORMED COP is a timid rookie.

                                     COP
                         Uh, Lieutenant, Sir -- The owner 
                         says they stole cash from the 
                         register. He was chasing them down 
                         the block when I caught up with them.

               The KOREAN OWNER is still agitated. He tries to give his 
               side of the story, mixing English and Korean. At the same 
               time --

               The TWO BLACK KIDS plead their case. They try to drown out 
               the OWNER. It all gets rather noisy.

                                     YOUNG BLACK KID
                         We didn't do nothing, man !

               LT shouts in the YOUNG BLACK KID'S FACE. It's shockingly 
               loud.

                                     LT
                         Shut the fuck up!

               LT turns to the UNIFORMED COP.

                                     LT
                              (to Cop)
                         Go get me a Bud. A High Boy. And 
                         make sure it's fucking cold.
                              (indicates the 
                              situation at hand)
                         I'll straighten this out.

               The UNIFORMED COP looks at LT for a moment, then goes.

               LT is now alone with the KOREAN OWNER and the TWO YOUNG BLACK 
               KIDS.

               LT turns to the OWNER.

                                     LT
                         How much did they take?

                                     KOREAN OWNER
                         Five hundred dollars cash.

               The TWO YOUNG BLACK KIDS continue protesting their innocence.

                                     YOUNG BLACK KID
                         We didn't --

               LT whips out his GUN and shoots a deafening BLAST between 
               the TWO KIDS' heads.It almost takes off the left ear of one 
               and the right ear of the other.

               The TWO YOUNG BLACK KIDS are stunned. Speechless.

               The YOUNG UNIFORMED COP rushes out of the MARKET, GUN raised 
               in one hand, BEER CAN in the other. He's relieved that a cop 
               wasn't shot, but the whole situation makes him uneasy.

               LT grabs the BEER, points to the KOREAN OWNER.

                                     LT
                              (orders the Cop)
                         Take this guy down to the Precinct. 
                         I need to talk to him.

               The OWNER protests wildly in Korean as the flustered COP 
               ushers him into a waiting SQUAD CAR. They drive off.

               Now LT is alone with the TWO YOUNG BLACK KIDS.

               LT takes the KIDS inside at gunpoint.

               INT: The store appears to be deserted.

                                     LT
                         Gimme the money! Now!

               The TWO YOUNG BLACK KIDS have regained some of their cool.

               They are still belligerent.

                                     YOUNG BLACK KID
                         We told you, man. We didn't take no --

               LT jams his GUN down the PANTS of one of the KIDS. At the 
               same time, he whips out his BADGE and thrusts it into the 
               other KID'S FACE.

                                     LT
                         Give me the fucking money, assholes!

               They give LT the CASH. The KIDS stand there.

                                     LT
                         What the fuck are ya standing there 
                         for? Be gone!

               The KIDS, stunned, split.

               LT swaggers around the store, GUN in hand, drinking the BEER, 
               assessing the inventory with a proprietary air. He pretends 
               to SHOOT at various products. Plays around.

               In the back aisle, LT aims his GUN at a BIG BOX of TOILET 
               PAPER.

               While he holds the TOILET PAPER at bay, a THIRTEEN YEAR-OLD 
               KOREAN KID rises up from behind it, his hands up, terrified.

               LT LAUGHS, then puts the GUN away.

                                     LT
                         Take over until your boss gets back. 
                         Gimme a 6 of Diet Cokes and a 6 of 
                         Budweiser.

               On LT's smiling face, we --

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT: DAWN - ARIANE'S APARTMENT

               BOWTAY is curled up on the floor, asleep.

               ARIANE is busy with a GOBLET, some TIN FOIL and other esoteric 
               stuff.

               LT comes through the door with the SIX-PACK of DIET COKES 
               and the SIX-PACK of BUDWEISER.

               He puts them down, takes a BEER for himself. ARIANE doesn't 
               turn around. She's busy preparing drugs.

                                     ARIANE
                         I got you a present. Better shit 
                         then you got, cop!

               LT comes and looks over her shoulder. He sees --

               A PILE of BROWN HEROIN on a TIN FOIL SHEET. ARIANE is 
               preparing the implements for "chasing the dragon."

               BOWTAY rolls over, sprawls on the floor in an even sexier 
               position.

               On her face, an expression of utter bliss.

               LT abandons the BEER.

                                     LT
                         Brown Downtown... There hasn't been 
                         any smoking brown on the street in --

                                     ARIANE
                         Who said anything about the fucking 
                         street. I've got more connects than 
                         you have, Lieutenant...

               ARIANE helps LT with the thin, TIN FOIL PIPE. She burns the 
               SMACK on the TIN FOIL SHEET for him so that he can manage to 
               inhale the PLUME OF SMOKE in time.

               He gets a nice, deep hit.

               ARIANE gracefully takes a hit of her own.

               They are both very high, already. Beginning to NOD OUT.

               ARIANE goes back to the IMPLEMENTS and prepares another hit.

               This time she catches the SMOKE in a SHERRY GOBLET and LT 
               drinks it.

               LT is very high now. A meditative, hallucinatory state.

               ARIANE takes a DIET COKE and lies down on the BED.

               She slowly sips soda through a straw. Her eyes are closed.

               LT sits in an EASY CHAIR by the WINDOW.

               LT NODS OUT while watching the SUNRISE. What we see appears 
               to be HIS DREAM. From the melting RED SUN, we --

               INT: LATE AFTERNOON - LT'S HOME - QUEENS

               ANGLE - CARTOONS on TV.

               LT has overslept, out cold on the COUCH. A LITTLE GIRL sits 
               on the floor, two feet from the TV, watching CARTOONS. Various 
               other members of LT's over-extended FAMILY can be seen moving 
               around the house, going about their business.

               A CARTOON EXPLOSION wakes LT. He jumps up in a panic.

                                     LT
                         Did I win? Shit! The game!

               LT bounds off the COUCH, Still half-asleep, he crawls to the 
               TV, turns on GAME FOUR. The LITTLE GIRL starts CRYING.

                                     LT
                              (to background family

                         What's the score? What's the fucking 
                         score?

               An ANCIENT AUNT pokes her head into the LIVING ROOM.

                                     ANCIENT AUNT
                         I dunno...

               She disappears again.

                                     LT
                              (to himself)
                         Why me, man?

               LT leans into the TV, transfixed, as --

               ON TV: STRAWBERRY makes a fantastic catch of a Canseco drive 
               with runners on base. LT CHEERS.

               DOORS SLAM (OFF). The TWINS have come home from school.

               They burst into the LIVING ROOM, loud as Hell. Furious about 
               something they out-curse each other.

                                     LT
                              (to the Twins)
                         Shut the fuck up! Did you see that?

                                     TWINS
                              (shrug - in unison)
                         It's 7-0: Oakland.
                              (single Twin)
                         That nigger could have let it drop 
                         and gone home.

               LT curses and stomps around. The TWINS mimic his every move. 
               All three are pissed. The rest of the FAMILY pays no mind.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT: EVENING - LT'S CAR

               LT is furious. He COKES UP. DRINKS heavily.

               Tired of the SPORTS STATIONS, LT turns on 911. There is a 
               call for an uptown MURDER SCENE.

                                                               HARD CUT TO:

               EXT: NIGHT - 153RD/MARTIN LUTHER KING - CRIME SCENE

               CU - A YOUNG BLACK DEALER, eyes open, shot dead.

               LT drives up, sizes up the scene. It's fresh territory. He'll 
               milk it for what it's worth.

               LT ignores his colleagues, the COPS ON THE SCENE. He knows 
               some of the DEALERS and STREET CHARACTERS on the sidelines.

               He heads straight for them.

               LT greets an impressively beautiful, six foot tall 
               TRANSVESTITE. He takes her aside.

                                     LT
                         Hey, Veronica baby, looking good! 
                         What's going down?

               LT slips a HUNDRED DOLLAR BILL into VERONICA'S well-filled 
               BRA.

                                     VERONICA
                              (confidentially - to 
                              LT)
                         Willie got shot by one of his boys.
                              (giggles)
                         But there's a ki under the back seat.

                                     LT
                         I'll put it in my trunk.

               LT saunters up to the MURDER CAR, DEAD WILLIE still in the 
               front seat. LT is obviously berserk to get the KI, but he 
               can't show it. LT susses out the situation.

               Around him, POLICE TECHNICIAN-TYPES are busy lifting 
               fingerprints and analyzing the CAR and WILLIE -- to no 
               apparent avail.

               LT uses his Lieutenants' privilege to enter the MURDER CAR 
               and begin his own investigation.

               TIRE TRACKS are discovered nearby. The OTHER COPS are 
               distracted.

               LT takes his shot. He reaches for and finds the KI of COCAINE 
               under the BACK SEAT. LT slips it under his COAT and emerges 
               from the MURDER CAR.

               Outside the MURDER CAR, LT makes to stand up. In the act, he -- 
               DROPS the BAG of COKE!

               LT is stunned. He can't believe the KI is actually in the 
               shitty, gutter water, in plain view of the other COPS.

               The COPS spot the KILO of COKE. Even those COPS that were 
               far away, somehow know what has happened. They quickly gather 
               round the MURDER CAR, LT, and the KI.

               The PLASTIC BAG filled with WHITE POWDER floats on the DEEP 
               PUDDLE.

               LT is silent wrath incarnate.

                                     LT
                              (soft, sardonic)
                         I guess he was a bigtime dealer...
                              (beat)
                         What d'ya know... A kilo of 'caine...

               Among the gathered COPS, only a SERGEANT is not quite 
               convinced.

                                     SERGEANT
                         Where the fuck did that come from?

               The other COPS ignore the query.

               LT walks away.

               LT has successfully covered himself, but he walks off cursing 
               and mumbling.

               VERONICA is laughing demonstratively in the background.

                                     LT
                              (to himself)
                         I can't fucking believe it...

               LT is further away now from the scene of WILLIE'S murder and 
               his own debacle. LT overhears something. Cuts off his 
               muttering.

               A group of COPS are talking about the big news from the early 
               morning.

                                     COP A
                         But I still can't fucking believe 
                         they'd rape a nun, man...

               LT stops in his tracks. The erotic import of this conversation 
               has seized LT's imagination. He heads toward the cluster of 
               COPS, cuts in.

                                     LT
                              (to the Cops)
                         What's this shit about a nun getting 
                         raped?

                                     COP B
                         Where the fuck have you been? It 
                         happened this morning, up at St. 
                         Dominiek's in Spanish Harlem. A coupla 
                         punks tore up the place and then 
                         gave it to the nuns but good.

               The COPS turn away, continue to talk among themselves. LT 
               walks away.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT: NIGHT - A CITY HOSPITAL PARKING LOT

               LT pulls up. Parks near a group of OTHER COPS, waiting by 
               their CARS.

               HOSPITAL fauna passes by in the background: DOCTORS, NURSES, 
               PATIENTS in all stages of recovery or relapse. The HOSPITAL 
               itself rises in the background. It looks like a prison.

               LT leaves his CAR, heads for the GROUP of COPS. He joins 
               them, sits down on the HOOD of a nearby CAR. The COPS are 
               all DRINKING heavily.

               Present are the BET COP, and several other FAMILIAR COPS 
               from previous scenes.

                                     LT
                         What's going on?

                                     FIRST COP
                         They raped a nun and tore up the 
                         church -- they even took a crap on 
                         the altar. Up in Spanish Harlem.

                                     SECOND COP
                         She was only seventeen...

               A COP opens his TRUNK -- he has a BAR inside. The COPS, 
               including LT, respond enthusiastically. DRINK UP.

                                     FIRST COP
                         Who the fuck could do this?!

                                     OLD IRISH COP
                         The young nun's just a kid from 
                         Ireland. Imagine having to come here 
                         to have that happen!

                                     SECOND COP
                         Jesus... What's she gonna tell her 
                         mother?

                                     OLD IRISH COP
                         I'm gonna kill those motherfuckers.

               The COPS keep DRINKING. All of them lounging around on or 
               beside the CARS.

               LT watches quietly, taking it all in. As if following the 
               motto: "He who defines himself, confines himself."

                                     THIRD COP
                         The Church already put up a $50,000 
                         reward!

                                     FIRST COP
                         Well, one of us is gonna get it. I 
                         mean -- get them.

               The FIRST COP raises a TOAST.

                                     FIRST COP
                         Here's to payback for the nuns!

               The COPS all whoop and cheer.

                                     SECOND COP
                         Anyone got any leads, at all?

                                     FIRST COP
                         We got shit to go on. Only that list 
                         of inventory -- what they stole from 
                         the church.

                                     THIRD COP
                         Y'know they actually stole those 
                         wacky purple robes? And they took 
                         the chalice -- with the Host still 
                         inside!

                                     SECOND COP
                         What did they want with the Host?

                                     THIRD COP
                         They were hungry. I dunno. They didn't 
                         want to hock the Host, they wanted 
                         to hock that golden chalice.

               COPS avoid each others' eyes. Competition has begun. No one 
               shares information, each after the reward for himself.

               LT bursts out, swings into high gear.

                                     LT
                         Leave it to the Catholic Church, 
                         man. Girls get raped everyday, and 
                         now they're gonna pay 50 G just 
                         because these chicks wore penguin 
                         suits!

               Some of the COPS laugh, others are offended.

                                     OLD IRISH COP
                              (to LT)
                         What's your fucking problem?!

                                     LT
                         The Church is a racket.

                                     OLD IRISH COP
                         So what. Are you a Catholic?

                                     LT
                         Sure!

                                     OLD IRISH COP
                         Do you believe in God?

               LT doesn't reply. He's thinking.

               The BET COP and a couple of OTHER, FAMILIAR GAMBLER COPS 
               move in. They've got nothing on their minds but the World 
               Series.

                                     BET COP
                              (to LT)
                         To Hell with this God stuff. How's 
                         that Strawberry? He does what ever 
                         you want him to, huh Lieutenant? 
                         Even strike out!
                              (beat)
                         I bet you won a shitload on Oakland. 
                         How much, huh?

               LT comes down off the CAR HOOD. Now he has to feign pride in 
               his supposed big bet on OAKLAND.

               LT has to convince the COPS to keep betting -- he can't afford 
               to pay them all off. Unfortunately, the COPS all think LT 
               just scored big, himself.

                                     LT
                         More than you did.

                                     GAMBLER COP TWO
                         Well, let's see some green!

                                     LT
                         If you know what's good for you, 
                         you'll keep staying on Oakland!

                                     BET COP
                         Oakland? Is that how you're going?

               LT nods "yes." An outright lie.

                                     LT
                         Yeah. Sure. Don't you get it? The 
                         series has gotta last seven games. 
                         The last two did, didn't they? It's 
                         a racket. Do you have any idea how 
                         much money they make selling 
                         television-time for commercials during 
                         the series? Especially if it's a New 
                         York team? They won't close the gold 
                         mine after only four games. It'll 
                         last a full seven. Too many people 
                         wanna milk it for what it's worth. 
                         You'll see!

                                     BET COP
                         All right... I'm in. After all, you're 
                         the expert. Ain't that right, LT?

               SEVERAL COPS, including some of the COPS who have been hanging 
               out in front of the HOSPITAL, go double or nothing on OAKLAND. 
               LT takes their BET MONEY -- $900.

               One COP doesn't go along with the deal. LT painfully pays 
               him off.

                                     LT
                         You'll be sorry, man. But if you 
                         wanna be a sissy, here's your bread.

               LT sits back on top of his CAR, DRINKING heavily. He toasts 
               STRAWBERRY. The others are uneasy. Why toast STRAWBERRY?

                                     COP ONE
                         Strawberry? I thought we were going 
                         with Oakland.

                                     LT
                         We are, man! That's the point! If 
                         the Mets win, it's thanks to 
                         Strawberry. If Oakland wins, it's 
                         thanks to Strawberry. Nothing can 
                         happen out there on the field that 
                         don't gotta do with Strawberry. So 
                         here's to Strawberry!

               The others join in the TOAST, but are uneasy.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT: LATE NIGHT - CORRIDORS OF A CITY HOSPITAL - HUNTING FOR 
               THE NUN

               The HOSPITAL is an inferno. LT exploits his cop privileges; 
               shows his BADGE to the GUARDS.

               He wants to get into the inner sanctum. Beyond where even 
               COPS were allowed to go. He wants to get to the NUN.

               A sexy NURSE stops him.

                                     NURSE
                         Can I help you?

               LT can't help but check her out and flirt.

                                     LT
                         I'm in charge of the investigation. 
                         Just checking security.

                                     NURSE
                              (Suspicious)
                         Security?

                                     LT
                         Do you want those guys coming back? 
                         For the nun? Or for you?

               The NURSE looks at him, unsure, then walks off down the 
               CORRIDOR.

               LT continues his hunt.

               He comes upon a DOOR that is plastered with "QUARANTINE" 
               SIGNS. One too many, perhaps. LT senses the NUN is inside.

               He has to open the DOOR, but hopes he won't get a blast of 
               disease in his face. He CROSSES himself -- wearing a smirk, 
               but nonetheless. Going on instinct, LT opens the door a crack.

               He's right. It's the NUN. He positions himself outside the 
               DOOR, keeping it open a few inches. He peeks inside without 
               being seen.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT: LATE NIGHT - THE NUN'S HOSPITAL EXAMINING ROOM

               From just outside the door, LT peep-toms on the NUN while 
               she is being examined. He sees her stark naked, laid out on 
               a table, her legs spread wide apart.

               The DOCTORS, NURSES, COUNSELORS work on the NUN as if they 
               are automatons. They don't grasp either the humanity or the 
               trotitism of the scene. LT does. The image of The Alabaster 
               Nun turns him on no end. Yet there is also a deeper pathos 
               to the scene.

               And the NUN is spectacularly beautiful. She doesn't speak. 
               Looks like a Pieta.

               A DOCTOR in a WHITE-COAT reads the MEDICAL REPORT to a FEMALE 
               COP. The FEMALE COP writes down the details on a hard-backed 
               pad. As if it's a parking ticket.

               The moving contrast between the words and the image seems to 
               be apparent to LT -- and the NUN -- alone.

                                     DOCTOR
                              (to Female Cop)
                         They inserted a crucifix eleven 
                         centimeters into her vaginal aperture, 
                         breaking the hymen membrane. Then 
                         they pursued the same course with 
                         their natural organs of sexual 
                         penetration. They used a sharp object, 
                         probably a hunting knife with a curved 
                         blade, to carve a cross between her 
                         shoulder blades, entering the flesh 
                         an average of nearly one centimeter 
                         throughout the area of the wound. 
                         They --

               Finally, as if she knew he was there all along, the NUN looks 
               up at where LT is hiding and boldly meets his eyes.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT: VERY LATE NIGHT - ARIANE'S APARTMENT

               LT has been there for some time. They are alone. They've 
               both been DRINKING and COKING.

               LT is carrying on about the NUN. As he speaks about various 
               subjects, his tone changes radically. From contempt and 
               cynicism to profound reverence. From decadence -- to awe. 
               ARIANE, too, manages to switch from one attitude to the other.

                                     LT
                         Have you ever seen a naked nun? I 
                         tell you, man, I went to school with 
                         the nuns, I've seen hundreds since 
                         then and I've never even seen a nun's 
                         belly button, you understand? But 
                         this nun, let me tell you. What a 
                         beautiful lady...
                              (snaps out of his awe)
                         And where'd the Church get the 50 G 
                         in the first place? The fucking Church 
                         is the biggest scam going. You know 
                         what's the real killer? It costs 
                         $8,000 per kid for them to go to 
                         parochial school. I've got three 
                         kids in there already, with two on 
                         the way! Christ. That fucking reward 
                         is my money, man! But that's Church 
                         policy. The Pope is the world's 
                         biggest bookie. Makes people bet on 
                         their own salvation! Double or nothing 
                         on Heaven. You go to Hell -- then go 
                         to Hell. In the beginning was the 
                         Word, and the Word was bullshit.

               ARIANE can't stop thinking about the rape.

                                     ARIANE
                         I can't get over what those guys did 
                         to her. I just can't.

                                     LT
                         They're alive, aren't they? Come on, 
                         man! Everyone's making such a fucking 
                         fuss, just because she's a nun. Just 
                         because she wears a penguin suit, 
                         the church puts up 50 G for the guys 
                         who dared to rape her. Do you think 
                         they'd put up a dime if you got raped? 
                         Of course not. Or even for your little 
                         sister? The virgin? Like shit they 
                         would.

                                     ARIANE
                         Susie's not a virgin anymore.

                                     LT
                         She's fucking nine years old! Jesus 
                         Christ.

               ARIANE suddenly starts up.

                                     ARIANE
                         And the nun's not a virgin anymore, 
                         either. Will they make her leave the 
                         convent?

               LT thinks for a moment.

                                     LT
                         Who knows? Who knows what their policy 
                         is.
                              (sudden dreamy 
                              reverence)
                         But I'll tell you, man, that nun... 
                         She was beautiful. Just beautiful... 
                         Tall... Real tall... I've never seen 
                         anything like it...

               LT snaps out once again, grabs the TELEPHONE. He dials LITE.

               He's not in. LT leaves ARIANE'S NUMBER on LIMELITE'S BEEPER.

               Hangs up.

                                     LT
                              (to himself)
                         Lite, man... Where the fuck are you?

               ARIANE can't get the image of the rape out of her mind.

                                     ARIANE
                         It's horrible. They burned her breasts 
                         with cigarettes. Christ.

                                     LT
                         Yeah? At least she's alive! I see 
                         people get killed every day! Worse 
                         yet, tortured first and then killed! 
                         The nuns got off easy. Jeez. Cigarette 
                         burns. Everyone's all upset about 
                         fucking cigarette burns. I'll show 
                         you cigarette burns!

               LT stubs out his CIGARETTE on the back of his hand. He does 
               the move with intensity and bravado.

               ARIANE responds by calmly doing the same. But she does it 
               entirely impassively, and rubs the CIGARETTE into her flesh 
               longer than LT did.

               ARIANE comes over to LT and starts kissing and licking his 
               CHEST.

                                     ARIANE
                         Do you believe in God? Do you believe 
                         that Jesus Christ is the Son of God?.

               LT hesitates.

               ARIANE kneels down in front of LT. As if in prayer.

               She starts giving him head.

               Before he can answer The Question, he is saved by the bell. 
               The PHONE RINGS. LT picks up immediately. It's LITE.

               As LT speaks to LITE, ARIANE continues to give him head.

                                     LT
                              (to LITE; over the 
                              phone)
                         Yeah, I know, I know all about it. 
                         Enough already about the fucking 
                         nuns. Yeah. Yeah. So just take the 
                         bet. Don't give me any hassles, man. 
                         Just put in my bet. 30 G's. Yeah. 
                         And I got $900 from the cops on 
                         Oakland. Yeah. Right. Strawberry's 
                         gonna knock em dead. Of course he 
                         is! You know that! Yeah. Yeah. Have 
                         faith, man! OK. Right.

               LT hangs up, thinks ARIANE won't resurface the God Question.

               ARIANE does, even as she gives him head. Every time she 
               speaks, she pulls away and it frustrates him. This dialectic 
               continues throughout the scene.

                                     ARIANE
                         Do you believe in God?

               LT thinks about it, even as ARIANE gets him hotter and hotter.

                                     LT
                         The Church is a fucking racket. I 
                         know how they operate. I've been 
                         part of the racket since the first 
                         time some faggot priest spilt water 
                         on my head. My Aunt Lu says I was 
                         crying all the way through. Yeah, I 
                         know their game inside out. Now I'm 
                         free of it and I'm gonna stay that 
                         way.

                                     ARIANE
                         I'm not talking about the fucking 
                         Church. Fuck the Church. But tell 
                         me. Do you believe in God?

                                     LT
                         What's to believe?

                                     ARIANE
                         That Jesus Christ was the Son of God 
                         and he came to die for your sins.

               LT can't respond. He's distracted by his own pleasure.

               ARIANE does something OC that causes LT sudden pain.

               LT cries out. Snaps to attention. Looks at ARIANE.

                                     ARIANE
                         Your sins, Lieutenant!
                              (beat)
                         And look around you! Where do you 
                         think all this shit came from?

               ARIANE gives him head again. LT is more excited now than 
               before she hurt him.

                                     LT
                         People.

                                     ARIANE
                         You believe that man is the be-all 
                         and end-all?

                                     LT
                         Yeah.

                                     ARIANE
                         OK. OK. Fine. But -- do you believe 
                         in God?

               As if in answer. LT begins to RECITE THE ACT OF CONTRITION

                                     LT
                         I believe in God the Father Almighty, 
                         Creator of Heaven and Earth...

               This turns on ARIANE. She stops talking. Writhes and grapples 
               him.

               LT is reaching climax. When describing Jesus rising again --

               LT has an orgasm.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT INT: VERY LATE NIGHT - LT'S CAR

               LT drives, DRUNK and fired-up. He has a BOTTLE of VODKA in 
               the CAR.

               POV LT - A CAR with only one TAILLIGHT. A Cyclops in the 
               darkness. Under a STREETLIGHT, JERSEY PLATES are visible. So 
               are the two inebriated, leather-clad GIRLS inside. LT pulls 
               them over.

               LT comes on to them. He's way out there. The GIRLS are 
               smashed.

               LT notes their "Heavy Metal" CROSSES, and questions them.

                                     LT
                         You wouldn't put some religious trip 
                         on me, would you?

                                     JERSEY GIRL
                         Uh-uh... What?

                                     LT
                         Good. Show me your papers.

               LT looks at their PAPERS. Points to the name to which the 
               CAR is registered.

                                     LT
                         Who's this person? It ain't you, and 
                         it ain't you, so who is it?

                                     GIRL
                         My Aunt.

                                     LT
                         So you took the car from you Aunt. 
                         Stole it. Am I right?

                                     GIRL
                         We were gonna give it back! We're on 
                         our way home, now!

                                     LT
                         Yeah, yeah.

               LT gets into the CAR, looks around. He finds a BAG OF POT.

               LT waves the POT in front of the GIRLS.

                                     LT
                         Now why don't I just call up your 
                         Aunt right now and tell her what's 
                         gone down. How about that?

               The GIRLS are petrified.

               LT grins. He takes out his own ROLLING PAPER, starts to ROLL 
               a JOINT with their POT.

                                     LT
                         Well, I'm sure we could arrange 
                         something... Unless you fancy a few 
                         days in jail...

               He blackmails them into humiliating sex scenes. On a side 
               street off Eleventh Avenue, LT plays it out until dawn.

                                                                    CUT TO:

                                        DAY THREE:

                               GAME FIVE: LT LOSES $30,000

               EXT INT: DAWN - THE CHURCH/CONVENT

               LT drives up erratically and parks his CAR in front of the 
               CHURCH/CONVENT.

               LT stumbles into the CHURCH. Alone now, he notes various 
               aspects of the DESECRATION, but can't see much because he's 
               blind drunk.

               The enormous, graphically bloody CRUCIFIX confronts him.

               He collapses immediately into a PEW. Sleeps.

               TIME PASSES

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT: MORNING - CHURCH/CONVENT

               LT wakes up. Ruckus all around him. The COPS are there in 
               force -- including some of the guys from the BAR, the UPTOWN 
               MURDER and the HOSPITAL PARKING LOT. They are privately 
               checking out the Scene of the Crime, looking for leads that 
               will give them an advantage. Everyone wants the TWO NUNS to 
               talk. The NUNS are in a circle of interrogators. At first, 
               LT can't even see them.

               The ELDERLY NUN was attacked but not raped. They carved 
               crosses on her.

               In the background, the questioning has already begun. The 
               interrogators become increasingly frustrated. It can be heard 
               in their voices. They want the reward, and -- despite a 
               certain constipated "respect" in their attitude -- the COPS 
               are willing to browbeat the NUNS to get it.

               LT silently bums a COFFEE off a COP and staggers into the 
               ring.

               LT hangs back in the crowd, staring at the YOUNG NUN as the 
               COPS interrogate both NUNS.

                                     COP 1
                         Can't you tell us anything? Sisters? 
                         Anything at all?

               The ELDERLY NUN speaks up.

                                     ELDERLY NUN
                         They broke my glasses. I didn't see 
                         anything, but I did hear them. They 
                         were young. And there were two of 
                         them. They spoke Spanish. One of 
                         them was named Julio.

               LT, on the sidelines, turns to an OLDER COP. LT mutters his 
               commentary

                                     LT
                              (to Older Cop)
                         Julio. Great. There are 20,000 spics 
                         named "Julio".

               The ELDERLY NUN lowers her head. Shamed.

                                     ELDERLY NUN
                         I would tell you more if I could. I 
                         am so sorry, Officers.

               Now the COPS are magnetized by the YOUNG NUN. She does not 
               appear to need GLASSES. Evidently, she could give the COPS 
               what they want.

                                     COP 2
                         What about you, Sister? Won't you 
                         tell us anything?

               LT watches the YOUNG NUN as --

               POV LT - The YOUNG NUN smiles a quiet, intractable smile.

               COP 2 is screaming mad, but tries to hide it.

               LT has observed their interaction. Though he would have loved 
               to have heard some information from the YOUNG NUN, her 
               defiance gives him even more pleasure.

               The MONSIGNOR comes forward to "translate" the NUNS' stubborn 
               silence. He is possessed by a conventional sort of ambition -- 
               this is his big chance. He would like to be Cardinal some 
               day, but never will be. He enjoys the spotlight as he 
               pontificates.

                                     MONSIGNOR
                         Listen. One nun is nearly 80 years 
                         old. I'm not from this Church, of 
                         course, but I assume they'll be 
                         getting her a new pair of glasses. 
                         Apparently she's legally blind without 
                         them. The Sister who suffered a rape 
                         is just 17. She arrived from Ireland 
                         only a couple of months ago. This -- 
                         event -- is just too much for them 
                         to take!

               The MONSIGNOR clears his throat demonstratively, takes a 
               dicitous tone.

                                     MONSIGNOR
                         Listen. The Church would like to 
                         know who did it just as much as the 
                         NYPD. These arrant criminals broke 
                         the laws of man, and the laws of 
                         God. The Church wants nothing more 
                         than to see them behind bars. That's 
                         why we're offering the $50,000 reward 
                         to whomever brings them in. I'm sure 
                         our hero will be one of New York's 
                         Finest.

               The YOUNG NUN shoots the MONSIGNOR an offended look.

               It appears for a moment as if the YOUNG NUN makes eye contact 
               with LT. But he can't be sure.

               LT leaves the crowd, disappears out the DOOR.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               FIFTH AVENUE

               LT is driving through HEAVY TRAFFIC while listening to GAME 
               FIVE on the RADIO. He COKES UP. He mumbles to himself.

               GAME FIVE is close, and features STRAWBERRY. As LT listens, 
               he reacts physically to the changing status of the game.

               He drives crazy through the streets, pounds the ceiling. 

               He's so COKED, he's bouncing out of his skin. LT drinks VODKA 
               out of a PINT BOTTLE in his COAT.

               STRAWBERRY overthrows a sacrifice fly from Canseco and the 
               A's WIN.

               LT shoots out the CAR RADIO. LT LOSES! He's $30,000 down. 

               Covering himself, he puts the LIGHTS on top of his CAR. Turns 
               the SIREN on. Screaming CURSES, he drives through the streets, 
               careening like a madman. PEDESTRIANS run away in terror.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               first time.

               LT is dressed to kill. Looks like a corpse.

               He watches his DAUGHTER'S First Communion and is truly moved.

               Remembers his own past.

               While the rest of the attendant EXTENDED FAMILY, FRIENDS, 
               and SOME COPS enter the COMMUNION PARADE, LT stands alone at 
               the back of the CHURCH like an usher. He holds the COLLECTION 
               BASKET and quietly watches the whole scene.

               LT, his betting friend who is not a cop comes up beside him.

                         and Strawberry is ready to break

               LITE looks his friend up and down as if he's lost his mind.

               LITE gestures assent, but is not happy. He waits a moment, 
               looks around.

               POV LITE - LT'S FRIENDS and FAMILY. LT'S DAUGHTER in her 
               COMMUNION DRESS.

               From the pristine interior of the "WHITE CHURCH" we --

                                                               HARD CUT TO:

               INT: AFTERNOON  THE CHURCH/CONVENT

               The interior of the CHURCH/CONVENT is still desecrated. In 
               stark contrast to the "White Church" (above, Scene 22).

               POLICE ROPES have cordoned off certain desecrated areas of 
               the CHURCH. In other places, MOPS and SLOPPY BUCKETS of SHIT- 
               WATER wait for someone to finish cleaning up.

               LT appears to be entirely alone in the CHURCH. He is desperate 
               for clues. He searches for leads and perhaps, for something 
               else...

               CU - He lights a CANDLE, gives a QUARTER --

               Then LT lights his CRACKPIPE ever the FLAME.

               Suddenly the NUN appears.

               LT hides, watches as the NUN enters the CONFESSIONAL Once 
               she is ensconced inside, LT stealthly approaches the 
               CONFESSIONAL and from right outside -- a tantalizing proximity -- 
               he listens as she confesses to the PRIEST. (This is an elderly 
               PRIEST with a striking, unusual voice. Not the MONSIGNOR 
               from the COPS' interrogation of the NUNS. Scene 20.)

                                     NUN
                         Forgive me Father, for I have sinned. 
                         It has been two days since my last 
                         confession. Father, my sin is a 
                         terrible sin. A sin of omission. 
                         There was another sin that happened 
                         at the same time, and in the same 
                         place, but my sin I think was graver

                         Sister, we all know what happened to 
                         you yesterday morning. I expected 
                         that you would want to speak to me 
                         about it. But you could have come to 
                         my office. Your being here, in the 
                         confessional, implies that you, 
                         Sister, have done something wrong. 
                         You haven't. I assure you. I feared 
                         you might have misplaced feelings of 
                         guilt. If you condemn yourself because 
                         you experienced feelings of... 
                         curiosity or even... pleasure, you 
                         mustn't --

               The NUN LAUGHS. At first, it sounds like crying. But it is a 
               strange, low laughter.

                                     NUN
                         Father, if it was so trivial, so 
                         natural, so -- No. I have sinned. 
                         And you must listen if you are to 
                         prescribe an appropriate act of 
                         contrition, and to absolve me. Father, 
                         what would you do if you had but one 
                         day in which to use your arms to 
                         serve God?

                                     PRIEST
                         It's funny, you knew. But the first 
                         thing I think of is kneading the 
                         bread that I help bake for the soup 
                         kitchen. Maybe that's because my the 
                         muscles in my arms still hurt.

                                     NUN
                         I also thought of that bread, Father. 
                         And of that night six days ago when 
                         the Mother Superior died, and I kept 
                         the cool, damp cloth on her forehead 
                         freshly moist. Father, what would 
                         you do if you had but one day in 
                         which to use your legs to serve God?

                                     PRIEST
                         I think of running for help, and 
                         falling to my knees in prayer.

                                     NUN
                         As I have prayed day and night since 
                         the desecration of this church 
                         yesterday morning -- and my sin. You 
                         see, Father --

                                     PRIEST
                         Yes, Sister?

                                     NUN
                         Yesterday morning, God gave me but 
                         one chance to use something else to 
                         serve Him. Not my arms or my legs, 
                         but something I used for the first 
                         time, for the last time, and will 
                         never use again. My vagina.

               Outside the CONFESSIONAL. LT reacts to the explicit word. 
               Shock. Titillation and fascination.

                                     NUN
                         Those boys, those sad, raging boys... 
                         They came to me as the needy do. And 
                         like many of the needy, they were 
                         rude. Like all the needy, they took. 
                         And like all the needy, they needed.
                              (beat)
                         Father. I knew them; They learn in 
                         our school. And play in our 
                         schoolyard. And they are good boys.

                                     PRIEST
                         You knew them?
                              (beat)
                         Who were they, Sister? Who are these 
                         boys? What are the names of these -- 
                         good boys you knew?

               Outside the CONFESSIONAL, LT stiffens. This could be the 
               clue he needs to solve the case.

                                     NUN
                         I could tell you their names now, 
                         and I know you'd be bound by a sacred 
                         vow to keep my secret. But I cannot 
                         tell you their names. For I, too, am 
                         bound. As I am bound now to confess 
                         my sins. So listen, Father Listen.
                              (beat)
                         I am a nun. What did I give those 
                         boys that they could not have found 
                         elsewhere? Nothing. Nothing at all. 
                         There were always two of us in the 
                         act. The act was half my own. It 
                         does not seem to me the act was half 
                         the act of a once of Christ.
                              (beat)
                         It is the lost chance that will remain 
                         on the ledger of my sins. Not the 
                         loss of my virginity. The rape forced 
                         upon me a choice. As a vessel of the 
                         spirit. I could have imbued my vagina 
                         with God. Or, I could have turned 
                         away from God and voided my body of 
                         spirit, so that all that was left 
                         for those boys was a lump of flesh. 
                         I chose the second path. The easier, 
                         path. The path of the material world. 
                         The path no nun has the right to 
                         take. And so, I sinned.
                              (beat)
                         My vagina spread, but spread no word. 
                         It opened, on nothingness. It gave 
                         nothing at all and left nothing 
                         behind. No trace of my act, yes my 
                         act. For I was there, too, remains 
                         in the landscape of God.

               The NUN'S description of the RAPE is both a turn on for LT 
               and a matter of profound curiosity. Something divine. His 
               silent reactions embody both decadence and awe. This apparent 
               paradox can find unified expression in his character, though 
               at other moments it threatens to tear him apart. The tension 
               between the two polarities will propel him toward his destiny.

                                     NUN
                         Jesus turned water to wine. I ought 
                         to have turned bitter semen to fertile 
                         sperm -- hatred to love. And maybe 
                         to have saved their souls. They did 
                         not love me. I ought to have loved 
                         them. As Jesus loved those who reviled 
                         him. I ought to have surprised those 
                         boys. Instead, they surprised me, 
                         and got no surprise at all. No, they 
                         did not rape a nun. But a nun has 
                         been raped. And the nun must now 
                         atone for her sin. For a God-given 
                         part of her was wasted. A part which 
                         other women use for procreation, for 
                         conjugal fulfillment, for expressions 
                         of love. I had but one chance. And I 
                         did nothing but react in pain.
                              (beat)
                         When those boys placed their hands 
                         upon my breasts, they had nothing 
                         but an assortment of skin cells in 
                         their grasp. They ought to have felt, 
                         through me. The bosom of their 
                         Redeemer. When they lay on top of me 
                         and looked down into my eyes, they 
                         saw fear. They should have met the 
                         eyes of a lover, And felt the presence 
                         of the Prince of Peace...
                              (beat)
                         My vagina. I shall never have again. 
                         And never again shall I encounter 
                         two boys whose prayer was more 
                         legible, more poignant, more 
                         anguished. Two young men who threw 
                         themselves upon the altar and took 
                         me with them. And I did nothing for 
                         them. I can only hope that someone 
                         will.

               LT can't help but start up. As if, telepathically, the NUN 
               knew he was there and cried out to him. Asked him to complete 
               her mission.

               LT senses the confession is over. As the PRIEST begins to 
               speak again, LT snaps to and returns to his original hiding 
               place, near the CANDLES.

               LT watches as the NUN exits the CONFESSIONAL, KNEELS, holds 
               her ROSARY BEADS, and begins to whisper the ACT OF CONTRITION -- 
               what LT recited as ARIANE gave him head.

               The NUN does penance. LT watches her, still hidden, and 
               transfixed.

               Cut from THE NUN to --

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT: EVENING - ARIANE'S APARTMENT

               CU - LT fucking a NUN.

               Its ARIANE.

               This time LT doesn't rebel against the religious import of 
               these last days. Rather, he incorporates it into their sex. 
               He has dressed ARIANE as a NUN. Now it is silent pantomime 
               that expresses both decadence and awe.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               FOLLOW LT as he walks through his home late at night. Each 
               room has several FAMILY MEMBERS in it, all asleep. Even the 
               TWINS sleep in tandem, on matching BUNK BEDS.

               LT sits down in the KITCHEN. All is silent, peaceful.

               A moment passes.

               LT stands up and goes over to the REFRIGERATOR. He takes out 
               a CARTON OF MILK.

               Sits back down. DRINKS the MILK.

               LT calmly looks at what's on the KITCHEN TABLE.

               A PILE OF BILLS, note attached from his WIFE: "Pay These."

               A GROUP OF PHOTOS from the COMMUNION, already quickie 
               developed. They are spread out all over the TABLE.

               A MORNING TABLOID NEWSPAPER, STRAWBERRY featured on the COVER.

               LT finishes looking at the various artifacts of his life. He 
               sighs, leans back, appears to be -- dare we say it -- at 
               peace.

               WORLD SERIES

               The MASSIVE CROWD ROARS.

               The STADIUM is decked out in the RED, WHITE, and BLUE BUNTING 
               signifying the WORLD SERIES. A ROW OF UNIFORMED COPS is in 
               the front row. Among them --

               LT. He watches STRAWBERRY as --

               With winning runs on, STRAWBERRY takes strike three, to lose 
               the game.

               As STRAWBERRY walks off the field, he and LT face off.

               One on one.

               LT has lost the $60,000 bet. He knows how heavy this is. 
               That his life is new in danger.

               The CROWD vents its rage. The deafening SOUND takes on a 
               sensuous rhythm and becomes DANCE MUSIC, as --

               From EXTREME CU - the BLACK FACE OF STRAWBERRY, we --

               FADE TO BLACK;

               INT: EVENING - LIMELIGHT NIGHTCLUB

               Half-nude DANCERS whirling in and out of sight, round and 
               round in the strobe-flashed darkness.

               The DANCE MUSIC steals ones senses, makes conversation nearly 
               impossible. People communicate in pantomime.

               LT pushes his way through the CROWD He cranes his neck, 
               desperately searching for someone. At last, he spots his 
               target.

               POV LT - A RESIDENT COKE DEALER. His FACE is visible, floating 
               above the writhing crowd.

               LT pursues him. Finally catches him.

               They mime the deal. LT buys some COKE for immediate use.

               LT does the COKE off his wrist as he moves through the CROWD.

               LT trembles, frantic and manic-high, as he goes to his meeting 
               with LITE. LT plows his way through the CROWD, heading toward 
               the back of the club and the entrance to the V.I.P ROOM.

               Even this state, when he sights ACQUAINTANCES. LT turns on 
               the charm and works the room.

               LT nears the V.I.P. ROOM.

               POV LT - The entrance to the V.I.P. ROOM is guarded by a 
               PURPLE VELVET ROPE and an effete DOORMAN.

               When the DOORMAN sights LT, he lifts the ROPE, nods 
               respectfully at the habitual patron.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT: EVENING - LIMELIGHT NIGHTCLUB - THE V.I.P. ROOM

               LT arrives.

               The V.I.P. ROOM is more laid-back, less populous than the 
               throng-filled cave outside. The MUSIC is muted here, and 
               more interesting.

               PARTIERS sit at the BAR, or at COCKTAIL TABLES. CHIC WAITRONS 
               serve the clientele: HOTSHOT BOHEMIAN REGULARS, DRUG DEALERS 
               and HOPEFUL RICH ADDICTS. In the privacy of the V.I.P.ROOM, 
               drug use is hardly concealed.

               LT sashays over to LITE'S table, sits down. LT has taken on 
               an attitude of false bravado. He greets LITE with a crazy 
               grin. LITE is grim, doesn't respond in kind. He's not amused.

               LT orders a VODKA.

                                     LITE
                         Do you have the money?

                                     LT
                              (giggles)
                         What money?

                                     LITE
                         Don't bullshit me.

               LT keeps doing COKE off hs wrist, even as ne speaks to LITE. 
               LT can't seem to wipe the smile off his face.

                                     LT
                         I don't got it. Not tonight. You 
                         can't get blood from a stone.

                                     LITE
                         This psycho can.

                                     LT
                         Oooo... Big fucking scary guy. Just 
                         put $120,000 on tomorrow's game.

                                     LITE
                              (laughs in his face)
                         You're a fucking joke, you know that?
                              (turns grim)
                         He's been waiting for the money since 
                         the fucking game ended. And I've 
                         been waiting here since -- forget 
                         it. Listen up. You're gonna get us 
                         both fucking killed. You know that!

                                     LT
                         Uh-uh. I'm gonna win. Just make sure 
                         the bet gets in.

               A COCKTAIL WAITRESS delivers LT's VODKA. LT orders another 
               one, flirts with her -- she's gone in a flash. LT downs the 
               VODKA in one shot.

                                     LITE
                         You do know that he's gonna blow up 
                         your house, kill your wife and kids --

                                     LT
                         Good. I'll give him an extra 10 grand 
                         for his trouble. I hate that 
                         motherfucking house and --

                                     LITE
                         He's gonna kill you, man. Do you 
                         hear me, motherfucker? You. Dead. 
                         Get it?

                                     LT
                         I've been dodging bullets since I 
                         was fourteen. No one can kill me. 
                         I'm fucking blessed. I'm fucking 
                         Catholic.

               This breaks LT up. He laughs until he cries. LITE watches 
               the spectacle. Falls silent. They sit quietly for a moment.

               LT, impatient with the delivery of his second VODKA, takes a 
               bottle cut of his COAT and re-fills his GLASS. DRINKS it 
               down.

               LITE tries changing the subject.

                                     LITE
                         How's the case going?

                                     LT
                         What case?

                                     LITE
                         The fucking rapists, man. The punks 
                         who raped that nun. The $50,000 reward 
                         from the Church! Remember?

                                     LT
                         Yeah. Sure. Yeah. We're on it bigtime. 
                         Lots of leads. You bet.

                                     LITE
                         That 50 G could help you --

               LT looks as LITE as if he's crazy. He shakes his head. Sing-
               songs at him as if trying to teach an impaired student.

                                     LT
                         The Mets are gonna win the Series. 
                         They're a lock.

               A change comes over LT. He leans in, gets seriously excited. 
               LT is possessed by his memory of this afternoon's game.

                                     LT
                         Get this, man. I was at the game 
                         today. Face to fucking face with 
                         Strawberry! Jesus! I saw him 
                         strikeout. And you know what? He 
                         looked at me, and I looked at him, 
                         and he laughed and I laughed and it 
                         was like we were all alone in that 
                         whole stadium and only we understood 
                         that it was all a racket, that he 
                         struck out on purpose, and that he's 
                         saving it up for the Big One. 
                         Tomorrow. Today I understood for the 
                         very first time that --

                                     LITE
                         You've really got a problem.

               LT shakes his head. Repeats himself in that sing-song, 
               didactic way.

                                     LT
                         -- that there was never any other 
                         way it could have gone.
                              (beat)
                         Never any other way. So you had better 
                         just put in my fucking bet. $120,000 
                         on the last game. The Big One. Come 
                         on! Are you a bookmaker, or fucking 
                         what?

                                     LITE
                         Here. Look I'll give you the psyho's 
                         number You call him yourself and 
                         tell him wnat you want.

               LITE stands up. He writes the BOOKIE'S NUMBER on a MATCHBOOK 
               and gives it to LT.

               LITE leans over and gives LT a final warning.

                                     LITE
                         You couldn't pay 60. You lose, you'll 
                         be in for 180. To a guy who kills 
                         people for nothing.

               LT LAUGHS. He's already onto the next thing. He checks out 
               the GIRLS at the other TABLES.

               LITE takes to go. Then decides to try once more to get LT's 
               attention.

                                     LITE
                         I was supposed to meet him at midnight 
                         with the 60. It's already 1:00 AM. 
                         Be careful. I mean it.

               LT is still laughing as LITE leaves the V.I.P ROOM.

               Before going out the door, LITE turns to look one more time 
               at his friend.

               POV LITE - LT is engaged in a clumsy come-on. Oblivious. The 
               last thing LITE sees is LT grabbing a COCKTAIL WAITRESS' LEG 
               and falling out of his chair. LT LAUGHS all the way to the 
               FLOOR.

               LITE lowers his head and exits.

               LT gets up a moment later, brushes himself off, and swaggers 
               out of the V.I.P. ROOM.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT: NIGHT - THE LIMELIGHT CLUB

               LT is in the throng again. The MUSIC blasts, the PARTIERS 
               push and shove...

               LT elbows his way through the crowd.

               He makes moves on GIRLS. Banters with PATRONS. At the DOOR, 
               he hesitates before going out, dallies with the BOUNCER.

               LT felt safe in the CLUB. New he's gotta go OUTSIDE. He's 
               shit-scared.

                EXT. LT leaves the CLUB for the STREET, looking over his 
               shoulder all the way.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT: NIGHT - STAIRWELL OF J.C.'S APARTMENT BUILDING

               LT enters an APARTMENT BUILDING, faces a dark and sinister 
               staircase.

               STRANGE NOISES come from the APARTMENTS ABOVE.

               LT climbs. He hugs the wall, GUN at the ready. To LT, it 
               seems some gothic horror may await him at any turn.

               On one landing, he comes upon a PIT-BULL. A GRANDMOTHER pulls 
               him back inside an APARTMENT by the LEASH.

               On another landing, he sees a JUNKIE SHOOTING UP in the 
               shadows. On another landing, a BIG GUY comes barreling out 
               of his APARTMENT and down the stairs, almost bringing LT 
               down with him.

               On another landing, a guy is taking out very PECULIAR GARBAGE. 
               It might be body parts to an active imagination. At last, he 
               reaches the DOOR to the APARTMENT for which he's been looking.

                                                               HARD CUT TO:

               INT: NIGHT - J.C.'S STRAIGHT PUERTO RICAN APARTMENT

               A cheerful apartment. Quite different in atmosphere from the 
               STAIRWELL, above.

               A large, multi-generation PUERTO RICAN FAMILY sits around 
               the dinner table, eating CHICKEN ON RICE AND BEANS. JC is at 
               the table.

               RELIGIOUS ARTIFACTS abound.

               A CODED KNOCK on the DOOR.

               JC jumps up to answer it.

               It's LT. (The hideous stairs led here.)

               JC lets him in.

                                     JC
                         How are you doing, man?

                                     LT
                         Very good. Very good. The Mets are 
                         gonna win tomorrow.

               JC notes LT's bizarre manner. Decides to humor his paranoid 
               catatonia.

                                     JC
                         I know. Here. Just a moment.

               JC reaches into a bookcase, looking for something.

               Meanwhile, LT looks around the room.

               POV LT - A SHRINE is in the corner. CANDLES are lit before 
               PLASTER SAINTS, AFRICAN DEITIES, other icons abstruse and 
               exotic. A large "MADONNA AND CHILD", painted on black velvet, 
               hangs above the SHRINE. The MADONNA AND CHILD are BLACK.

               LT takes this all in. JC startles him.

               JC is holding a CIGAR BOX. He opens it. It's full of CASH. 
               JC hands it to LT.

                                     JC
                         This should be it. Oh, wait.
                              (to an old woman at 
                              the table)
                         Mamacita?

               MAMACITA takes some VIALS of CRACK out of her APRON.

               SMILES. JC takes them from her, give them to LT.

                                     JC
                         There. Now you've got your profit 
                         and more. You'll have more product 
                         day after tomorrow, right?

                                     LT
                              (very spaced)
                         Uh - right. Sure. The Mets are gonna 
                         win tomorrow.

                                     JC
                         I know.
                              (beat - looks at LT 
                              with concern)
                         Take care of yourself, man, OK? Be 
                         cool.

               LT nods, puts MAMACITA'S CRACK VIALS in his pocket. He notices 
               that --

               POV LT - CU - The CIGAR BOX is inlaid with a CROSS, made of 
               costume jewels. Other strange symbols surround it. It could 
               be cursed -- or blessed.

               LT turns to go. The DOOR closes behind him. He's gone.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT: NIGHT - STREET NEAR ARIANE'S APARTMENT

               LT walks through the streets on the way to ARIANE'S. He 
               carries the CIGAR BOX.

               Suddenly, a SHOT rings out.

               ZOOM IN ON - CU LT  Horror. Doubtless it was meant for him. 
               LT panics. Freezes. As in a dream, he cannot run.

               POV LT - RAPID. ERRATIC. HAND HELD - LT looks for SNIPERS in 
               the anonymous dark WINDOWS on the anonymous darks walls that 
               create the mescarole canyon of the STREET.

               LT is entirely alone. He is stock-still, victim of his own 
               terror.

               Suddenly. LT can move. He takes out his GUN, presses himself 
               against the nearest WALL. From that position, he hears --

               A BRASH FEMALE VOICE, coming from somewhere in the darkness.

               It is almost as loud as the "SHOT".

                                     BRASH FEMALE VOICE
                              (OC)
                         Hey motherfucker! Take that backfire 
                         up the ass!

               LT can't believe that there is no "SNIPER", there was never 
               any SHOT. It was a BACKFIRE!

               ANGLE - The CAR in question passes by. It HONKS, defiantly.

               Evidently, it is the CAR that had BACKFIRED.

                                     BRASH FEMALE VOICE
                              (OC)
                         Fuck you.

               LT is still pressed against the wall, GUN at the ready. He 
               cannot be relieved. The terror is with him.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT: LATE NIGHT - ARIANE'S APARTMENT

               LT rushes in, triple bolts the DOOR behind him. He immediately 
               pulls the DRAPES.

                                     LT
                         Someone just took a shot at me...

               Ariane laughs.

                                     ARIANE
                         Sure, baby Sure And you don't do 
                         cocaine, either.

               LT turns on her. Adamant. Pleading with her to believe him.

                                     LT
                         It's not the drugs, Ariane, it's -- 
                         it's someone who wants to kill me.
                              (beat)
                         You gotta believe me!

                                     ARIANE
                              (shrugs)
                         Why?

               ARIANE walks away, speaks with her back to LT.

                                     LT
                         Just kick back, baby. Make yourself 
                         at home.
                              (suddenly pissed)
                         But of course it won't be nobody's 
                         home, if you don't come through with 
                         the fucking rent!

               LT lays his COAT down on the BED. Puts the CIGAR BOX of MONEY 
               under it.

               LT sits down near the PHONE. He lights his CRACKPIPE with a 
               MATCH from the MATCHBOOK on which LITE wrote the BOOKIE'S 
               NUMBER. Then he tries to reach the BOOKIE. Some sort of wacky 
               Mob joint answers.

                                     LT
                         Hello? Is LARGE there?

                                     MOB VOICE
                              (OC)
                         No.

                                     LT
                         Look, man. Lite gave ne this number. 
                         OK? Just take a message. Tell Large 
                         to fucking call me right away at 123-
                         1234. Got it?

                                     MOB VOICE
                              (CO -- phony humble)
                         Sure, I get it...
                              (laughs)

                                     LT
                         I'm a good friend of Lite's, man. 
                         It's urgent that --

               The MOB VOICE (CO) HANGS UP ON LT.

               LT tries to strangle the PHONE.

               LT REDIALS.

               The line is BUSY.

                                     LT
                         Christ! Shit! I could kill them all 
                         with my bare hands.

                                     ARIANE
                         Who?

                                     LT
                         Those fucking Mob assholes.

               LT makes the strangulation gesture again. ARIANE laughs at 
               him.

                                     ARIANE
                         C'mere. You got some good blow, right?

                                     LT
                         Yeah.

                                     ARIANE
                         Then c'mere. I got something for 
                         you.

               ARIANE pulls out a pristine NEEDLE.  LT comes but flinches 
               at the sight.

               Apparently BOWTAY overheard that drugs are on the way. BOWTAY 
               appears out of the KITCHEN.

               BOWTAY sits down near by, awaiting her DOSE.

               ARIANE starts preparing the DOSE. She's got all the 
               paraphernalia: SPOON. COTTON, a CANDLE FLAME, etc.

                                     ARIANE
                         First I'll put your Uptown in the 
                         spoon, then, to make it more exciting, 
                         I'm gonna add some Downtown. They 
                         call this thing a speedball, honey, 
                         but then you must know that...
                              (beat -- she leans in)
                         First time shooting up?

                                     LT
                         Nah...

                                     ARIANE
                         Sure it is. You're a virgin. Just 
                         like that nun. And I'm gonna rape 
                         you.

               That decides it for LT. He sits down like a little boy and 
               lets ARIANE shoot him up with the potent mixture of COCAINE 
               and HEROIN.

               ARIANE shoots up BOWTAY, next.

               They do it on the BED, exploiting all possible erotic 
               connotations.

               When LT rushes, he gets totally paranoid. Jumps at sounds, 
               sneaks to the WINDOW, hears noises that aren't there.

               Then he flips, and becomes crazy-bold. Opens the DRAPES. 
               Sticks his head out the WINDOW, waves his GUN at specters.

               Then he becomes shit-scared, again. His behavior is lunatic.

               ARIANE LAUGHS at his antics.

               Finally LT becomes wildly sensual. Revealing himself with 
               total abandon. Dances. In the midst of this --

               The PHONE RINGS LT is seriously startled. Then he realizes 
               who it may be. He slowly answers the phone.

               LT can hardly speak. He is NUDE, and communicating from 
               another world syllable by syllable.

                                     LT
                              (into the phone)
                         Large?

                                     LARGE
                              (OC)
                         All right, cop. I want my money.

                                     LT
                         It's still my money. If you want to 
                         have a chance at any part of it, 
                         shithead, you will take my $120,000 
                         and bet on tomorrow's game.

                                     LARGE
                              (OC)
                         What about the money you owe me on 
                         yesterday's game?

                                     LT
                         Fuck yesterday's game. The World 
                         Series is seven games not six. Put 
                         in my bet.

                                     LARGE
                              (OC)
                         Let me think about it.

                                     LT
                         There's nothing to think about. Either 
                         you put in my bet or you ain't getting 
                         nothing.

               BIG SILENCE on the PHONE.

                                     LARGE
                              (CO -- lethal)
                         Oh, really?

                                     LT
                         Yeah, really. I'm no fucking asshole, 
                         man. I'm a fucking cop!

                                     LARGE
                              (OC)
                         OK, cop. I want you to give yourself 
                         and your friends on the force a 
                         message. Tell them I've got my own 
                         reasons to be very interested in 
                         whomever did the job on the nuns. 
                         I'll double the Church reward if you 
                         bring those punks direct to me. 100 
                         G cash. Get it?

               LT absorbs this, then bursts out.

                                     LT
                         Fuck the nuns, man! I'm talking about 
                         Strawberry! Is the bet down?

               LARGE takes a moment.

                                     LARGE
                              (OC)
                         Here's the deal: You meet me tonight 
                         across from the Garden. 33rd & 8th. 
                         At the beginning of the Ninth Inning. 
                         We'll listen to the end of the game 
                         together. You bring your cash, I'll 
                         bring mine.

                                     LT
                         Yeah, sucker. You better be there!

               LT HANGS UP, turns to ARIANE.

                                     LT
                         Can you believe the nerve of this 
                         fucking guy? He kills people for 
                         fun, and then, he puts up 100 G to 
                         bring in some guys who raped a nun. 
                         What a sick fuck. Man...

                                     ARIANE
                         Who?

                                     LT
                         A wiseguy. Paying 100 Grand for the 
                         rapists if I turn then over direct 
                         to him.

               ARIANE'S eyes light up.

                                     ARIANE
                         But you could do it, baby. We could 
                         use the bread...

                                     LT
                         You mean you could use it.

               ARIANE SHRUGS, waves his dig aside.

               LT leaps up. He's on a manic roll. Conceives an insanely 
               captivating, impossible idea. As he speaks, he speeds more 
               and more until he seems to be reciting a rapid-fire tongue 
               twister perfect.

                                     LT
                         I got it, man! I will find those 
                         kids. And I'll get the 50 G from the 
                         Church! Then the kids'll go to jail.
                         I'll be in charge, of course. After 
                         a little while, I'll break the fuckers 
                         out -- and I'll turn them in to 
                         shithead I was just talking to. And 
                         pick up his 100 G. No. I'll hit him 
                         up for 200 G. Or 250 G. l can do it -- 
                         'cause I've got the kids. Then, of 
                         course, there's the 180 G I'm gonna 
                         pick up on the Game tonight -- when 
                         the Strawberries win!

                                     ARIANE
                         "The Strawberries"?

                                     LT
                         The Mets. So anyway, chalk up another 
                         180 G for the Game. Jesus Christ! 
                         That's almost half a million dollars. 
                         Ariane! Wait. That's not good enough, 
                         I'll ask the shithead for 280 G for 
                         the kids. Then it'll be a perfect 
                         500 thousand. Yeah. Perfect. 280 G 
                         for the kids. Yeah, it's good I 
                         prepared, or I wouldn't have thought 
                         to --

               ARIANE has been grooving on it until now. She sees a problem 
               they've overlooked.

                                     ARIANE
                              (cuts in)
                         How come all those guys who're looking 
                         to get 50 from the Church haven't 
                         come up with shit? You got some kinda 
                         inside track?

                                     LT
                              (nods -- dead serious)
                         I'm a Catholic.

               ARIANE LAUGHS, decides to go with it.

               LT, out of breath from his tirade, lets the Downtown half of 
               his dose kick in but good.

               He sits down in the same EASY CHAIR in which he nodded out 
               the morning of the desecration.

               Nodding out, he stares out the same WINDOW. His eyes close.

               As it was that morning only four days ago, the SUNRISE is 
               blood red.

               As if it is LT'S DREAM, we --

                                                                    CUT TO:

                                        DAY FIVE:

                     GAME SEVEN: LT GETS DOUBLE OR NOTHING: $120,000

               INT: DAWN THROUGH HIGH NOON  CHURCH/CONVENT

               CU - The ALABASTER NUN. She is lying cross -- probably has 
               been all night.

               VARIOUS ANGLES. The still-desecrated CHURCH in all its 
               enduring glory. Shafts of blood-red dawn-light. The NUN.

               TIME PASSES. 

               VARIOUS ANGLES. Mid-morning; The NUN is still lying cross.

               TIME PASSES.

               VARIOUS ANGLES. High Noon. The NUN is still lying cross.

               Suddenly --

               LT appears in the doorway, a black silhouette against the 
               white light of noon. For a moment, he watches her from a 
               distance.

               The NUN knows he is there. After a time, she gets up, goes 
               to the altar, kneels. As if waiting for him.

               LT staggers down the center aisle. He's carrying the CIGAR 
               BOX.

               LT joins the NUN, kneeling next to her at the altar.

               ANGLE - The CHALICE is still missing.

               They are all alone. At the ALTAR, before the CRUCIFIX, LT 
               confronts the NUN face to face. The NUN holds her ROSARY 
               BEADS.

               LT finally speaks. He thinks she'll be turned on by his offer 
               of "help".

                                     LT
                         Listen to me, Sister, listen to me 
                         good. The other cops'll just put the 
                         guys through the system. They're 
                         juveniles. They'll walk! Get it? But 
                         I'll beat the system and do justice. 
                         Real justice. For you.

               The NUN turns to run.

                                     NUN
                         I have already forgiven them.

               LT is desperate. He lunges forward. Pleads with her.

                                     LT
                         Come on lady! They put out cigarettes 
                         on your tits, man! Get with the 
                         program! Don't you want them behind 
                         bars? Or away from the world for 
                         good? How could you forgive these 
                         motherfu -- excuse me. These guys. 
                         How could you? Deep down, don't you 
                         want them to pay for what they did 
                         to you? Don't you want the crime 
                         avenged?

                                     NUN
                         I have forgiven them.

                                     LT
                         Nun! These boys still have their 
                         weapons, Sister. Your forgiveness 
                         will leave blood in its wake. What 
                         if they do it to other nuns? Other 
                         virgins? Old women who die from the 
                         shock? Do you have the rights let 
                         these boys go free? Can you bear the 
                         burden. Sister?

               The NUN turns to him, simple and pure, pure and simple.

                                     NUN
                         I have prayed for days, Lieutenant. 
                         I have prayed for the souls of the 
                         boys who raped me. And I have prayed 
                         for my own soul, too. I know what I 
                         must do. And I know what I must not 
                         do.
                              (beat)
                         But you -- you -- it is you who needs 
                         to pray. Now, why do you want to 
                         kill these boys? Why -- really?

                                     LT
                              (takes yet another 
                              tack)
                         Look. Sister. No one has to get 
                         killed. We can solve this together. 
                         You and me -- as one. These boys are 
                         lost sheep. Both Catholic -- did you 
                         know that? And they're sick, Sister. 
                         With a stress of the mind and of the 
                         soul. They need help. Not just jail. 
                         Not just psychiatry. They need the 
                         help that only the Church can give. 
                         Please help me to help them. Help me 
                         find them before the others do. The 
                         night is full of evil men, chasing 
                         these boys with guns and clubs. We 
                         have charity and love on our side. I 
                         know that together, we could find 
                         them first, even in the dark...

                                     NUN
                         The good reasons are not always the 
                         real reasons. Talk to Jesus, 
                         Lieutenant. Pray.
                              (beat)
                         You do you believe in God -- don't 
                         you? That Jesus Christ died for your 
                         sins?

               This blows him away. He has nothing to say to that.

               The NUN has finished her morning prayers.

               For a moment, she looks deep into LT's eyes.

               Then she gets up and leaves LT alone in the CHURCH.

               LT comes face to face with the mammoth CRUCIFIX. He is 
               transfixed.

               POV - LT - JESUS on the CROSS.

               Soon, LT hears a VOICE.

               LT is not shocked or even surprised. He speaks to JESUS as 
               to someone he's known all his life.

                                     JESUS
                              (OC)
                         I forgive you.

                                     LT
                         Me?

                                     JESUS
                              (OC)
                         I forgive you.

                                     LT
                         You can't forgive me. After what 
                         I've done.
                              (beat)
                         I've fucked up bigtime. I've been 
                         bad. Real bad.

                                     JESUS
                         I forgive you.

                                     LT
                         Please. Please don't forgive me. 
                         I've always hated you for that.

               POV LT - The CRUCIFIX takes on an hallucinatory radiance. 

               Taking that aura with him, JESUS comes down off the CROSS, 
               and moves toward LT, who is still kneeling at the ALTAR.

                                     JESUS
                         I forgive you.

                                     LT
                         Why? Why can't you hate me? Hate me! 
                         Please! Help me!
                              (confused)
                         Hate me! Help me! Hate me!

                                     JESUS
                         I forgive you.

                                     LT
                         Why? Jesus! Why me? Why can't I wash 
                         the ashes from my forehead, year 
                         after year after year? And why am I 
                         still drunk on your blood, the taste 
                         of your flesh on my tongue? Worst of 
                         all, why can't I feel the nails in 
                         my palms, the spear in my side, the 
                         crown of thorns round my head? Why 
                         do I have to know, over and over, 
                         that it was you. You who died; died 
                         for my sins! And that I will die for 
                         nothing. Why?

               JESUS kneels down, knee to knee, face to face with LT.

                                     JESUS
                         I forgive you.

                                     LT
                         Why do I dream every night of the 
                         whore who brought you water on your 
                         road to death? And why have I never 
                         forgotten that if she, then I --

               LT averts his eyes. When he looks up again --

               JESUS is back on the CROSS. Inert, and yet --

               LT rises, moves around the interior of the CHURCH. He 
               stumbles, struggles, pleads. Falls, rises, falls and rises 
               again -- as if wrestling with an invisible assailant.

               He collapses in a corner.

                                     LT
                         Oh God, my God. it's goddamn good to 
                         be good. Forgive me. Father, for I 
                         have sinned. It's still goddamn good 
                         to be good.

                                     JESUS
                         I forgive you.

               EPIPHANY. BLOODY CHRIST ON THE CROSS. HALLELUJAH!

               In the aftermath of his revelation, he notices, cleanly, a 
               hunched, ELDERLY BLACK WOMAN carrying something toward the 
               ALTAR.

               He staggers toward her. Yes. The ELDERLY BLACK WOMAN has the 
               CHALICE!

               LT grabs the CHALICE. The ELDERLY BLACK WOMAN doesn't let 
               go.

                                     LT
                         The chalice. Tell me! Who gave it to 
                         you! Tell me where the fuck you got 
                         it! Take me there! Now!

               At first, she doesn't speak at all. LT begins to CRY. Begs 
               her to tell him. Then he wields his PISTOL, repeats his plea. 
               Then breaks into TEARS.

               She speaks at last.

                                     ELDERLY BLACK WOMAN
                         I can't tell you.

               Gun in hand, LT gets down on his knees.

                                     LT
                         In the name of God, you must.

                                     ELDERLY BLACK WOMAN
                         My husband will give me Hell, Mister.

                                     LT
                         We've already got Hell, Sister.

               She meets LT's eyes, seems to understand something. Calmly, 
               she tells him what he needs to know.

                                     ELDERLY BLACK WOMAN
                         It's very hard. He's a -- you're not 
                         a cop, are you?

                                     LT
                         No. Not a cop.

                                     ELDERLY BLACK WOMAN
                         My husband is a fence. He got this 
                         chalice from a couple of kids. Just 
                         yesterday, I think. I stole it out 
                         of his shop so as to return it to 
                         where it ought to be. It's a holy 
                         thing, you know. A holy thing.

               The ELDERLY BLACK WOMAN lets go of the CHALICE. Now LT holds 
               ten CHALICE in his hands, alone. He speaks as if entranced.

                                     LT
                         A holy thing.
                              (beat -- snaps to)
                         Let's go.

               Suddenly purposive, LT grabs the ELDERLY BLACK WOMAN by the 
               arm. Starts pulling her out of the CHURCH. He holds the 
               CHALICE with the other arm, picks up the CIGAR BOX on his 
               way out. Manages to carry both items.

               When LT and the ELDERLY BLACK WOMAN reach the door to outside, 
               they both pause to GENUFLECT.

               Then LT grabs her again and they rush out.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT: AFTERNOON - BARRIO STREETS - EN ROUTE TO THE FENCE

               LT walks the ELDERLY BLACK WOMAN swiftly through the streets 
               toward the FENCE'S SHOP.

               He still holds the CHALICE and the CIGAR BOX.

               PEOPLE watch them pass and make way. As if they realize that 
               something is happening -- on several levels at once. The 
               GAME has begun. It is on TV in every BAR and SHOP WINDOW. In 
               both English and Spanish. Slowly but surely, the Mets are 
               losing.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT: LATE AFTERNOON - THE FENCE'S SHOP

               LT and the ELDERLY BLACK WOMAN enter the SHOP. LT is wielding 
               the CHALICE and the CIGAR BOX. He has true madness m his 
               eyes.

               POV LT - The GAME is playing on a couple dozen TV's in the 
               FENCE'S SHOP' The Mets are still losing!

               The FENCE, and elderly Black man, is sitting in one of many 
               EASY CHAIRS. He doesn't seem surprised to see his WIFE. Or 
               the CHALICE. Or LT! It's as if he expected them.

                                     FENCE
                         You took the chalice.

                                     ELDERLY BLACK WOMAN
                         Yes.

                                     FENCE
                         You brought it back to the Church. 
                         And then it made it's way back to 
                         me, again.

                                     ELDERLY BLACK WOMAN
                         Yes.

               Th» FENCE bursts out LAUGHING.

                                     ELDERLY BLACK WOMAN
                         Are you all right, honey?

                                     FENCE
                         I was gonna bring it back myself.

               The ELDERLY BLACK WOMAN is obviously relieved.

                                     FENCE
                         Jesus, woman! What did you think? 
                         You thought I'd get mad like I did 
                         that time you took that set of pots 
                         and pans? That was twenty years ago. 
                         And how do you compare pots and pans 
                         and a chalice?

               LT speaks up suddenly.

                                     LT
                         They both hold stuff you eat.

               After a beat, the FENCE and his WIFE start LAUGHING. LT joins 
               in.

                                     FENCE
                              (to LT)
                         So what are you doing here?

                                     ELDERLY BLACK WOMAN
                         He wants to know who brought in the 
                         chalice.

                                     FENCE
                         That's no mystery. Julio and Paolo 
                         brought it in,
                              (beat)
                         You don't want to hurt those boys, 
                         do you? I mean, they sure as Hell 
                         have got something coming, but it 
                         ain't what the Law wants to give 
                         them. You understand?
                              (beat -- shakes his 
                              head)
                         No. How could you understand.

               The FENCE seems to study LT.

               POV FENCE - LT. Wretched.

               The FENCE thinks again.

                                     FENCE
                         Well -- maybe you do. But I don't 
                         know where those boys are at right 
                         now. You'll have to ask around. Those 
                         boys on the corner'll know. You'll 
                         have to get it out of them. But they 
                         know.

               POV LT - Through the WINDOW of the FENCE'S SHOP, a busy DRUG 
               CORNER is visible.

                                     LT
                              (spaced)
                         Thank you. And I'll make sure the 
                         chalice gets back where it belongs.

               LT leaves. CHALICE in hand.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT: LATE AFTERNOON - THE STREETS IN THE BARRIO - MONTAGE

               LT stumbles through the streets, questioning people about 
               "JULIO and PAOLO". No one knows anything. LT stops people at 
               random, getting really desperate. He shows people the CHALICE, 
               asks them if they've seen it before. No one has.

               LT plays both ADDICT and COP as it suits his needs. By now, 
               he looks more like a homeless man than anything else. But 
               none of his play-acting or lethal threats get him anywhere.

               The GAME is everywhere, and the Mets are still losing.

               Finally, LT approaches a hustling STREET DEALER. He cops. 
               The STREET DEALER is wearing a WALKMAN, so the deal goes 
               down in mime.

               Now, LT speaks and wants to be heard.

                                     LT
                         Hey -- Have you seen Paolo or Julio 
                         around?

               The STREET DEALER uses his WALKMAN and the resulting 
               "deafness" to excuse his total lack of response.

               LT starts MOUTHING WORDS silently at the STREET DEALER. No 
               response. Then, he -- silently -- begins to shout.

               The STREET DEALER's alarmed that he seemingly can't hear at 
               all above the WALKMAN music. He moves the WALKMAN away from 
               his ears but doesn't take it off.

                                     STREET DEALER
                         What the fuck you want.

                                     LT
                         You know, my Uncle used to wear a 
                         walkman all the time. The walkman 
                         looked just like yours. And you look 
                         something like my Uncle. But one day 
                         he was standing in a puddle -- the 
                         puddle locked just like that one --

               LT points to a PUDDLE in which the STREET DEALER is now 
               Standing.

                                     STREET DEALER
                         And what?

                                     LT
                         And he got electrocuted.

               The STREET DEALER tries to consider what this crazy guy has 
               just told him, but before the STREET DEALER can even react. 
               LT leans in on him, shows his GUN and then his BADGE.

                                     LT
                         Look -- I don't know you, and you 
                         don't know me, but I'm really in the 
                         mood to kill someone today and you 
                         are at the end of my gun.
                              (beat)
                         Have you ever had days like that? 
                         Yeah, you have, so now you understand 
                         where I'm coming from.
                              (beat)
                         Tell me! Where is Julio and Paolo ?

               The STREET DEALER answers with absolute ease. That was all 
               it was about? No problem.

                                     STREET DEALER
                         They were at that abandoned building 
                         last night. Second floor. They're 
                         probably still there now. It's next 
                         to the old Convent. Downtown a ways. 
                         You know the place...

               CU. LT - It hits him. The CRACKHOUSE where the kids hang out 
               has always been right next to the CHURCH/CONVENT where it an 
               began! It suddenly makes sense to him.

               LT completes re transaction, pays the STREET DEALER for the 
               DRUG BAGS. He takes the CASH out of the CIGAR BOX, revealing 
               dozens of thousands of dollars.

               The STREET DEALER stares at the wretched man with a box full 
               of cash.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT: EVENING - EN ROUTE TO THE CRACKHOUSE

               LT, carrying the CHALICE and the CIGAR BOX, heads back 
               Downtown toward the CRACKHOUSE -- and the CHURCH/CONVENT.

               In BARS, TV STORE WINDOWS, in snatches of strangers' 
               conversation, the FINAL GAME IS EVERYWHERE. The whole city 
               has stopped to watch it. LT is practically the only person 
               in the street.

               Worst of all, the Mets are seriously behind. They are 
               definitely LOSING.

               LT drags himself onward.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT INT: EVENING - THE CRACKHOUSE

               LT busts in. Fires shots, collars the KIDS. The KIDS are 
               wearing the PURPLE ROBES from the CHURCH/CONVENT. They also 
               wear gold CROSSES. LT HANDCUFFS them.

               The other CRACKHEADS race out.

               There is even a TV in the CRACKHOUSE -- playing the GAME! 
               The SOUND is Off. The Mets keep losing. If anything will 
               force LT to kill/and or take the KIDS into custody, this 
               would seem to be it.

                                     JULIO
                         Who the fu--

                                     LT
                         Shut up. Let's watch the game.

               LT sits down next to the KIDS. SMOKES with them, watches the 
               Game. LT must hold the PIPE for them, as they are HANDCUFFED.

               LT gets them super-high, and himself likewise. He still holds 
               his GUN.

               The KIDS go along with it. Taking it moment to moment.

               All three, despite the situation, are heavily into the Game.

                                     LT
                         Strawberry...

                                     PAOLO
                         Yeah...

               After a moment, LT gets up. The KIDS understand that they 
               must do the same.

                                     LT
                         Give me the robes.

               The KIDS hand over the PURPLE ROBES and LT puts them on.

                                     JULIO
                         You're not a cop are you?

                                     LT
                         No.

               LT exits. Taking the KIDS along. He carries the CHALICE and 
               the CIGAR BOX.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT INT: EVENING - LT'S CAR AND STREETS EN ROUTE TO RENDEZ-
               VOUS

               VARIOUS ANGLES - LT drives toward the fatal rendez-vous with 
               the BOOKIE. He is wearing the PURPLE ROBES from the 
               CHURCH/CONVENT and has the CHALICE and the CIGAR BOX.

               LT has the KIDS handcuffed in the back seat. (The Scene 
               mirrors Scene 2. in which LT drove his own TWINS to school.)

               The FINAL GAME (SEVEN) is on the RADIO. LT is listening, but 
               also not listening.

               LT talks wildly about Jesus Christ. And about the misery 
               they pass in the street. He waves his GUN wildly, punctuating 
               his speech with potentially lethal gestures. He aims the GUN 
               at JULIO and PAULO, then at himself, then out the window, 
               then at the KIDS, again.

                                     LT
                         Jesus died for your sins, you 
                         motherfuckers! Not me. No. I didn't 
                         die for your sins. No, not me. Jesus 
                         went and did it.
                              (beat)
                         So why did you do what you did? If 
                         you want to live, tell me now, 
                         motherfuckers! Tell me now!

               LT turns around and looks at JULIO and PAOLO, both of them 
               HANDCUFFED in the back seat.

               POV LT - CU - JULIO and PAOLO both have TEARS running down 
               their cheeks. Silently.

                                     LT
                         I forgive you.

               LT starts CRYING too, at the same time CURSING at the TRAFFIC.

               He drives wildly toward the Port Authority Terminal.

               The Mets are coming up from behind -- but it is a long shot. 
               LT doesn't seem to care. He stares into space.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT:/INT: EVENING - LTS CAR - THE PORT AUTHORITY TERMINAL

               LT stops his CAR -- next to a BUS in an underground tunnel.

                                     LT
                         Get out.

               The KIDS do. LT follows fast.

               AT THE BUS: He makes them board at GUN POINT.

                                     LT
                         If you think you're not getting on 
                         this bus, you're dead wrong. No 
                         fucking way are you gonna miss this 
                         bus, man! You were probably the kind 
                         of kids who had your father drive 
                         you to school cause you couldn't 
                         catch the fucking bus. But no more, 
                         man. You're getting on this bus and 
                         you're taking it to the last fucking 
                         stop. So get on the fucking bus, 
                         man, 'cause you're life ain't worth 
                         shit in this town.

               LT uncuffs them and the KIDS get on the BUS, dumbstruck.

               LT hands JULIO the CIGAR BOX. His "salvation."

               The KIDS don't even know what is inside. They take it.

               LT gets back into his CAR, takes off.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               But not on the face of LT. He is dressed in the PURPLE ROBES, 
               the CHALICE beside him in the CAR.

               The BOOKIE pulls up and -- without getting out of his CAR -- 
               He SHOOTS LT in the head.

               The BOOKIE speeds off. (We never saw him behind the dark 
               windows,} LT is dead in his CAR.

               On the RADIO, the GAME is ending. STRAWBERRY hits a HOME RUN 
               and the -- Mets win, the CROWD ROARS.

               END CREDITS.

               FADE IN:

               Snow flakes falling against a black sky.

               CAMERA FOLLOWS THEM DOWNWARD TO REVEAL

               EXT. MILWAUKEE BAR - NIGHT

               It looks like a warm cozy place out of "It's A Wonderful 
               Life". The window is flocked with fake snow, and hung with 
               colorful Christmas lights, wreaths and ornaments.

               CAMERA PUSHES SLOWLY IN

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               INT. MILWAUKEE BAR - NIGHT

               CAMERA CONTINUES MOVEMENT IN SAME DIRECTION

                                       TITLES BEGIN

               The barman, wiping down the counter, gives an occasional 
               semi-furtive glance toward the far end of the bar.

               Other patrons chat near the bartender and also give occasional 
               glances toward the far end of the bar. It is early evening -- 
               happy hour -- and the clientele is well-heeled and sociable.

               A customer says something interrogative to the bartender, 
               who looks down the bar and shrugs.

               REVERSE - CAMERA CONTINUES MOVEMENT (Notes the combination 
               of the HIGH ANGLE and the tilt of Santa's head keep his face 
               from being clearly revealed in this scene).

               Sitting alone at the far end of the bar, given a wide berth 
               by the other customers, a man (WILLIE) stares morosely into 
               his drink. The drink is clearly not his first.

               He wears a red velvet suit and red velvet hat with a white 
               pom-pom. He has shiny black boots with red velvet trim. His 
               long white beard is not real and is in fact pulled down below 
               his chin to facilitate drinking. It exposes heavy black 
               stubble.

               Swaying slightly, he raises the drink to the vicinity of his 
               lips. Once it gets close he must navigate it in with some 
               effortful coordination. He takes a sip and sets the drink 
               carefully back down.

               After another long, staring, morose beat, he starts weeping.

               It is loud, dolorous, and unself-conscious.

               EXT. ALLEYWAY BEHIND THE MILWAUKEE BAR - NIGHT

               Santa staggers out the back door...

               CAMERA FOLLOWS BEHIND HIM still hiding his face.

               Santa gets about ten feet, then pauses and leans with one 
               hand against the alley wall, uses the other to hold his pom-
               pom out of the way, and vomits.

               Having vomited, and spit, he staggers off toward the street.

               SUPERED TITLE OF THE MOVIE:

                                        BAD SANTA

               INT. SANTA ORIENTATION ROOM - DAY

               An upbeat woman TRAINER presides over a half-dozen SANTAS 
               sitting at school desks. On the blackboard the Trainer is 
               writing out the sixth "Santa Commandment".

                                 SANTA'S TEN COMMANDMENTS

               1) No alcoholic beverages before or during your shift.
               2) Know the names of your reindeer.
               3) Do not smoke in your costume.
               4) No swearing.
               5) Absolutely no flirting.
               6) Coax a smile from the child.
               7)
               8)
               9)

                                     TRAINER
                              (as she writes)
                         Coax... a... smile... from... the 
                         child.
                              (turning to face them)
                         Remember, parents don't want photos 
                         where their child isn't smiling. 
                         Some children may not want to smile. 
                         It is your job to coax a smile out 
                         of them. A good line to remember is:
                         "Santa thinks everybody should be 
                         happy. Can you smile for Santa?" A 
                         camera can only copy a child's smile -- 
                         it will take you to put it there.

               As she talks we

                                                                    CUT TO:

               ANGLE FROM BEHIND

               one of the Santas (WILLIE). His HAND reaches into a boot and 
               pulls out a pint of Smirnoff. We FOLLOW UP IN C.U. to see 
               this hand pour a few ounces into a can of Coke he holds behind 
               his desk.

                                     TRAINER
                         If the child will not smile, the 
                         Photo Elf will go ahead and take the 
                         picture anyway. Now, it is a good 
                         Santa's job to smile as well -- I 
                         know with the big white beard your 
                         smile will be partially hidden, so 
                         you must learn to smile with your 
                         eyes. They show warmth and can be 
                         very expressive.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               WILLIE'S FACE

               as he finishes off the can of Coke to REVEAL: his eyes colder 
               than those of a dead fish.

                                     TRAINER
                         Remember you have been chosen for 
                         the starring role of Santa Claus. 
                         Your portrayal of this beloved 
                         character will have a major impact 
                         on every child you meet. Keep in 
                         mind at all times that to them, you 
                         aren't a man dressed up like Santa, 
                         you are Santa.

                                                               CUT BACK TO:

               WILLIE'S FACE. His expression reads: "Please kill me".

               EXT. DOWNTOWN MILWAUKEE SHOPPING DISTRICT - NIGHT

               Wintry night. Ray Coniff's "Jolly Ole Saint Nicholas" scores 
               views of the downtown blanketed in snow and decorated for 
               the holiday. It is Christmas Eve, and the sidewalks throng 
               with people rushing to do their last-minute shopping.

               A MOTHER and her two absurdly bundled CHILDREN emerge from 
               the crowd.

                                     MOTHER
                         Hurry boys, we're gonna miss Santa! 
                         She drags them across the street 
                         toward the looming art-deco monolith 
                         that is the big-city department store.

               INT. MILWAUKEE DEPARTMENT STORE - TOP FLOOR - NIGHT

               Mother and children crest the escalator to emerge on the top 
               floor.

                                     OLDER CHILD
                         There! 

               The older child is pointing at a prop gate with a candy-cane 
               letter sign: TO SANTA'S WORKSHOP.

               He runs and Mom shoos her younger child to join him.

               The boys cross the threshold of the gate and their eyes filled 
               with wonder.

               A winding path cuts through a flocked and candy-striped 
               forest, past a workshop filled with mannequin-elves busily 
               cobbling Christmas toys, and finally arriving at...

               Santa, seated on his throne like a scarlet Messiah. The 
               younger child staggers forward to join the line of a hundred 
               other leaky-nosed worshippers awaiting an audience.

               At the head of the line the next waiting child is escorted 
               to Santa's chair by a smiling tiny man (MARCUS) dressed as 
               an elf.

               INT. MILWAUKEE DEPARTMENT STORE - MAIN FLOOR - NIGHT

               An imitation BACK STREET BOYS quintet sings Christmas Carols.

               Grown-ups busy themselves draining their wallets as a VOICE 
               comes over the intercom:

                                     INTERCOM (V.O.)
                         Attention shoppers: the store will 
                         be closing in five minutes. We hope 
                         tomorrow is a pleasant Christmas and 
                         thank you for shopping with us, your 
                         friends.

               Purposeful haste eddies the crowd.

               INT. MILWAUKEE DEPARTMENT STORE - SANTA'S WORKSHOP - NIGHT

               C.U. PHOTO PRINTING OUT

               The Photo Elf takes the digital photo and presents it to a 
               MOM.

                                     PHOTO ELF
                              (dutifully reciting 
                              his spiel)
                         My, what a darling picture! Are you 
                         certain you only want the single? 
                         Additional photos come in handy as 
                         gifts for grandma and grandpa or a 
                         wonderful remembrance for friends.

                                     MOM
                         That's all right, I'll just take the 
                         single.

               He takes her credit card as CAMERA MOVES OVER TO SANTA. On 
               his knee is a YOUNG BOY who whispers excitedly in his ear.

                                     SANTA
                              (disinterested)
                         Uh-huh... yeah... done.

               Young Boy climbs off and runs away, A BRATTY KID jumps up on 
               Santa's lap.

                                     BRATTY KID
                         I saw you in another mall.

                                     SANTA
                              (not even looking at 
                              him)
                         Right... Good for you.

                                     BRATTY KID
                         You're not really Santa. If you were 
                         Santa you could do magic.

                                     SANTA
                              (looks at him)
                         You want magic?

               Santa pushes him off his lap and shoves him on his way.

                                     SANTA
                         There, I just made you disappear.

               Santa turns to his Elf,

                                     SANTA
                         ...That it?

               The Elf nods as he peels off a pointed prosthetic ear. Santa 
               pulls a fifth of Old Grandad from the cushions of his throne.

                                     SANTA
                         ...Thank fuckin' Christ.

               He takes a swig.

               INT. MILWAUKEE DEPARTMENT STORE - NIGHT - LATER

               With the sound of closing circuits, banks of lights 
               systematically shut down in the various departments of the 
               now empty store.

               INT. MILWAUKEE DEPARTMENT STORE - EXIT AREA - NIGHT

               Downstairs the last of the store employees file out the door 
               past an old SECURITY GUARD. Eventually Santa emerges.

                                     SECURITY GUARD
                         Merry Christmas, Willie.

                                     SANTA
                         Up your ass.

               The guard chuckles.

                                     SECURITY GUARD
                         Have it your way, Willie.

                                     SANTA
                         Don't tell me which way to have it.

               The Security Guard heads for a panel near the doorway and 
               punches a key labeled ARM. An L.E.D. readout labeled "ARMING" 
               counts down from 30 seconds.

               The guard exits the store, locks the door and heads home.

               INT. MILWAUKEE DEPARTMENT STORE - SANTA'S WORKSHOP - NIGHT

               A large Teddy bear sits under a Christmas tree.

               Suddenly - it moves, bolting upright and sprinting from the 
               room.

               INT. MILWAUKEE DEPARTMENT STORE - DOWNSTAIRS - NIGHT

               The alarm continues to count down -- 15... 14...

               The Teddy bear slides down the space between the railing of 
               the escalators. Landing on its feet, it barrels toward the 
               door.

               10... 9... 

               The Teddy bear scrambles for the door, crashing into 
               everything in its path.

               7... 6... 

               Running past a clothing display, it rips the arm off a 
               mannequin without breaking stride.

               5... 4... 

               It skids to a stop at the base of the alarm box, too short 
               to reach the controls.

               2... 

               It raises the mannequin arm, using the pointed finger on its 
               hand to press the "CANCEL" key on the keypad.

               Mission accomplished, the teddy bear rips off its head to 
               reveal his true identity: Santa's Elf -- in civilian life 
               known as MARCUS SKIDMORE. He is covered in sweat and panting 
               like an asthmatic.

               INT. MILWAUKEE DEPARTMENT STORE - SHIPPING AREA - NIGHT

               A hasp flips open and Marcus swings the door wide to reveal 
               a beer-guzzling Santa-in-the-off-season known as WILLIE T. 
               SOKE. He finishes the beer, crushes the can and drops it to 
               his feet next to eight more empties.

                                     WILLIE
                         Ready.

               Marcus sneers at him as he lumbers past:

                                     MARCUS
                         Jesus.

               INT. MILWAUKEE DEPARTMENT STORE - SANTA'S WORKSHOP - NIGHT

               Marcus and Willie tear open the prop presents on the workshop 
               set and remove several tools.

               INT. MILWAUKEE DEPARTMENT STORE - NIGHT

               Marcus reaches into jewelry cases and removes a few particular 
               items. He drops them into a stock cart then checks a typed 
               list before moving on.

               Marcus pushes the cart through the store, gathering an odd 
               array of items that range from furs to gowns to shoes to 
               makeup.

               INT. MILWAUKEE DEPARTMENT STORE - BACK OFFICES - NIGHT

               Marcus arrives outside a doorway and looks in to see Willie 
               manning a large water drill and putting it to work on the 
               store's vault.

                                     MARCUS
                         How's it goin'?

                                     WILLIE
                         I'm finished when I'm finished.

                                     MARCUS
                         I'm goin' downstairs...
                              (referring to list)
                         I need a melon-bailer and a loofah.

               The drill suddenly revs higher, getting Willie's attention.

                                     WILLIE
                         Got it.

               Marcus moves closer as Willie pulls back the drill on the 
               track. He places a screwdriver into the exposed lock assembly 
               and hits it with a sledgehammer.

               Suddenly, the door swings open and bundled cash spills to 
               the floor. Both men are impressed.

                                     MARCUS
                         Fuck the loofah, let's go.

               EXT. MILWAUKEE DEPARTMENT STORE - SHIPPING DOCK - NIGHT 

               Marcus and Willie wheel out two carts and roll them through 
               the open doors of a waiting van. As they slam the doors --

               INT. VAN - NIGHT

               Willie settles on the rear bench as Marcus gets into the 
               passenger seat next to his Pillipina Mail-order wife of 
               several years, LOIS, who is dressed in expensively ugly 
               clothes, and whose mouth is ever down-turned in pruney 
               distaste.

                                     LOIS
                         Marcus, did you get the loofah?

                                     MARCUS
                         Drive.

               EXT. DOWNTOWN MILWAUKEE STREET - NIGHT

               The van speeds away through the Christmas Eve night and 
               disappears into the distance, like the down of a thistle.

                                                                  FADE OUT:

               CAMERA ROCKETS INTO C.U. of An alarm clock ringing with a 
               jolt.

               INT. RATBAG APARTMENT - DAY

               Willie, in bed, blearily wakes to the insistent alarm. He 
               tries to turn it off, but his fingers are still clotted with 
               sleep.

               In a series of frustrated grunts and groans he becomes more 
               and more aggravated until, finally --

                                     WILLIE
                         FUCK YOU, YOU FUCKING PIECE OF SHIT!

               He bolts out of bed and throws the clock into the wall.

               He stoops for some beer bottle empties and hurls them at the 
               clock debris.

                                     WILLIE
                         Fuck you! Fuck you! Fuck you!

               One final scream and it's out of his system. He finds one 
               last bottle in his hand, half-full with a cigarette butt 
               floating in it.

               He downs the beer and steps into the adjoining bathroom to 
               brush his teeth.

               EXT. KEY BISCAYNE STREET - DAY

               Willie, sipping a cup of coffee, meanders down the street 
               scratching his ass.

               EXT. RESTAURANT - DAY

               Willie's walk brings him to a fancy eatery at lunchtime. As 
               he passes, he casually snatches a handful of car keys from 
               the parking valet key-box and moves on.

               As he rounds the corner into the lot he pushes on the various 
               key fobs, identifying various cars when their alarms chirp.

               He seems dissatisfied until a brand new Cadillac chirps.

               Willie gets in and drives off.

               INT. CADILLAC - MOVING - DAY

               Willie drives. He reaches over into the glove compartment 
               and pulls out the registration. He focuses on the car owner's 
               address.

               INT. UPPER-CLASS HOME - HALLWAY - DAY

               Willie, eating a corn dog, saunters down an opulent hallway, 
               a beer swinging in one hand.

               INT. UPPER-CLASS HOME - BATHROOM - DAY 

               In long shot, through the open door of an extravagant marble 
               bathroom, we see Willie sitting on the toilet, leafing through 
               a magazine, beer bottle on the counter next to him. Pants 
               around his ankles.

               INT. UPPER-CLASS HOME - BATHROOM - MINUTES LATER 

               Willie, standing by the toilet, finishes buckling his belt 
               and flips the flush lever.

               Nothing happens; no whoosh of rushing water.

               Willie, looking down into the toilet, gives the lever a couple 
               more clanking tries, and then grabs his beer and ambles off.

               INT. UPPER-CLASS HOME - STUDY - DAY

               Sucking on his beer, Willie paces the periphery of the room, 
               methodically knocking painting after painting off the walls.

               INT. UPPER-CLASS HOME - MASTER BEDROOM - DAY

               Willie arrives in the bedroom still knocking down paintings 
               until, finally, he exposes a wall safe.

               A smile, and he pulls out a stethoscope.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               The safe door swings open to reveal stacks of cash.

               INT. STRIP BAR - NIGHT

               Willie scratches a lottery ticket. He's now wearing a Rolex 
               and some gaudy ring.

                                     WILLIE
                         Goddamn it!

               He reaches for another one and we see that on the bartop in 
               front of him are neat stacks of lottery tickets as yet 
               unscratched, and an untidy jumble of scratched ones.

               On the other side of the bar a MIDDLE-AGED STRIPPER vies for 
               his attention. Willie's ticket hits for $5.00.

                                     WILLIE
                         Yeah baby!

               He tucks it into the Stripper's G-string, swigs a drink, and 
               resumes scratching.

               INT. RATBAG APARTMENT - NIGHT

               Willie and the Stripper stagger into his apartment, drunk.

               As he passes his blinking answering machine:

                                     WILLIE
                         I got messages. Go wash yourself.

                                     STRIPPER
                         I'm a dancer, I sweat.

                                     WILLIE
                         Well you smell like a bum's nutsack.

                                     STRIPPER
                         Fuck you.

                                     WILLIE
                         Yeah, yeah.

               As she exits, he activates the machine.

                                     VOICE (V.O.)
                         Mr. Soke, this is Andrew Kaplan again
                         from the collection agency -- BOOP!

               Willie skips to the next message.

                                     ANOTHER VOICE (V.O.)
                         Willie, I don't care man, I'm not 
                         looking to blame anyone, but that 
                         diamond isn't a real stone, man. I 
                         took it to -- BOOP!

               Willie skips to the next message.

                                     WOMAN'S VOICE (V.O.)
                         Uh, hello, this is Helen Axelrod -- 
                         you ran into my car last week? Well 
                         I called State Farm but they have no 
                         record of any insurance policy for 
                         you and -- BOOP!

               Willie skips to the next message.

                                     MARCUS' VOICE (V.O.)
                         Willie, it's Marcus. It's that time 
                         of year again. Pack your shit. 
                         Phoenix.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. PHOENIX, ARIZONA - DAY

               To the chimey chords of "Sleigh Ride," we see Phoenix, Arizona 
               in MONTAGE / dressed for Christmas but sweltering under its 
               oppressive winter heat.

               EXT. SAGUARO SQUARE MALL - PARKING LOT - DAY

               Through the heat ripples rising off the pavement two mirage-
               like figures cross the infinite asphalt of the Saguaro Square 
               Mall parking lot -- Willie and Marcus in Santa and Elf 
               regalia, sweating and panting in the heat. Willie polishes 
               off a pint of Smirnoff's and flips it towards a nearby trash 
               can. It misses and breaks loudly on the pavement.

                                     MARCUS
                         Jesus Christ! Can you maybe keep it 
                         together for just ten minutes?!

               He pulls some Tic Tacs out of his pocket.

                                     MARCUS
                         For crying out loud, chew a few of 
                         these... you drunken, fuckin' 
                         imbecile!

               Anchoring the huge mall complex is the large and upscale 
               Chamberlain's Department Store.

               INT. CHAMBERLAIN'S - MAIN FLOOR - DAY

               Amid the bustle of holiday shopping, an angry heavy-set man 
               with a Grizzly Adams beard stomps away from the pursuing 
               store manager, Bob Chipeska.

                                     CHIPESKA
                         Harrison, please I Just let me 
                         explain. Financially, the --

                                     HARRISON
                         You get what you pay for, Chipeska! 
                         Five Christmases I've given my heart -- 
                         my soul -- my love to these kids, 
                         and now what? Now you flip me for 
                         some stranger who'll do it for peanuts 
                         and happens to work with a real 
                         midget! Lemme tell you something: 
                         nobody cares! Nobody comes here for 
                         the elf, Santa's the attraction! I 
                         do Burl Ives songs; does this schmoe 
                         even play guitar?

                                     CHIPESKA
                         Harrison, it's not the money or the 
                         midget. Believe me, if it was, I -- 
                         I don't think they like "midget". I 
                         think you're supposed to call them --

                                     HARRISON
                         Aw, forget it!

               Harrison stomps away and right toward Marcus and Willie as 
               they enter the store.

                                     HARRISON
                         ...Hacks!

               Willie and Marcus stop in their tracks and watch the burly 
               man storm out. Bob Chipeska watches with them.

                                     CHIPESKA
                         Hi. Bob Chipeska. I, please, I, uh -- 
                         please don't listen to him. Great 
                         resume and photo by the way.

                                     MARCUS
                         Thanks... you know, we been at this 
                         a long time an' all, so we like to 
                         think we do a good job...

               A Beautiful Girl wearing skin-tight pants walks by, catching 
               Willie's eye. He stares wantonly at her ass, off in his own 
               little world.

                                     CHIPESKA
                         You two are the best men for the 
                         job. Truly. So do not let his... 
                         unpleasantness affect your performance 
                         in any way.

                                     MARCUS
                         Oh no, we're fine, w --

                                     WILLIE
                              (irked, snapping out 
                              of his daydream)
                         Performance?

               Willie's reaction worries Marcus.

                                     CHIPESKA
                         Yea. Your performance... you know, 
                         the...

                                     WILLIE
                         Performance. Like sexual?

                                     CHIPESKA
                         Excuse me?

                                     MARCUS
                         Willie no, he --

                                     WILLIE
                         You saying there's something wrong 
                         with my gear?

                                     MARCUS
                         Willie...

                                     CHIPESKA
                         I'm sorry. Your gear?

                                     WILLIE
                         You know... fuck stick.

                                     MARCUS
                         OKAY! We're gonna head upstairs now.

               Marcus shoves Willie, who stalks off. Marcus lingers to smooth 
               things over. He forces a grin and shakes his head.

                                     MARCUS
                         Such a card.

                                     CHIPESKA
                         He's not gonna say "fuck stick" in 
                         front of the children, is he?

                                     MARCUS
                         No, no, no. Joke. Adult joke. For 
                         us. Adults.

               A long, long, long silence.

                                     MARCUS
                         ...Joke.

               Another beat. Marcus pantomimes helpless laughter, noiselessly 
               throwing his head back and holding his gut as it heaves with 
               mirth.

               He is instantly composed.

               INT. CHAMBERLAIN'S - WINTER WONDERLAND - DAY

               On an upper floor of Chamberlain's the theme is "The Desert 
               as Winter Wonderland." Cacti and tumbleweeds are wrapped 
               with lights and flocked with snow, and a team of nine stuffed 
               burros are hitched to a sleigh. Rudolfo the Red Nosed Burro 
               is tended by several Santa's elf mannequins. One in cowboy 
               wear and another in a poncho and sombrero.

               Again there is a line of waiting children. Marcus makes his 
               way through the line as kids gasp and cheer. He plays to the 
               crowd.

                                     MARCUS
                         Merry Christmas! Santa's coming!

               Yayyyyyy! Marcus gets to the head of the line, ducks under 
               the velvet rope and goes behind the flimsy cardboard set.

               Willie sits there morosely, head slumped, forearms on knees, 
               red velvet hanging limply from one hand.

                                     MARCUS
                         What the fuck you doing, "fuck stick" 
                         in front of the boss?

                                     WILLIE
                         I don't like that guy.

               He takes a bottle from the floor by his feet and swigs off 
               it. Marcus stares at him.

                                     MARCUS
                         You don't like any guy. You think I 
                         can't find another portly motherfuck 
                         can run a water drill?

               Willie just slumps there apologetically.

                                     MARCUS
                         Don't tempt my hand. You blow this 
                         and we're broke for the year. So 
                         stop acting like you know something 
                         because, pal of mine, you don't know 
                         squat. You're gum on my shoe.

                                     WILLIE
                         Yeah, yeah.

                                     MARCUS
                         Now put on your fuckin' hat and get 
                         out there.

               He grabs the hat, slams it into Willie's chest and, as Willie 
               rises, kicks him in the ass. Willie just takes it, shambling 
               off.

                                     MARCUS (CONT'D
                         ...And try to act professional. For 
                         Chrissake!

               EXT. SAGUARO SQUARE MALL - PARKING LOT - DAY

               On the outskirts of the Saguaro Square Mall's parking lot a 
               city bus stops with a hiss. The doors swing open to reveal a 
               pathetic EIGHT-YEAR-OLD KID, overweight, snot-nosed, badly 
               dressed and probably smelling of pee.

               As the kid nears the mall entrance he passes a group of older 
               children doing skateboard stunts. They notice him.

                                     KID
                         Loser!

               One of them throws an empty can that hits him in the head.

               The kid walks on, it seems without noticing.

               The bullies, disheartened by the lack of reaction, go back 
               to their skateboarding.

               INT. CHAMBERLAIN'S - WINTER WONDERLAND - DAY

               Marcus leads a LARGE HEAVYSET BOY over to the throne. The 
               boy eats a chocolate ice cream cone which is smeared all 
               over his mouth and T-shirt. Marcus lifts him with effort and 
               a groan onto Willie's lap.

                                     WILLIE
                         All right, wuddya want?

                                     HEAVYSET BOY
                         Nintendo Deer Hunter 3.

                                     WILLIE
                         Fine. Next.

               The HEAVYSET BOY hops off onto Willie's foot by mistake.

                                     WILLIE
                         YOWWWCH! Watch the toenails willya?

               Marcus puts a young girl on his lap. She looks up at him in 
               awe.

                                     WILLIE
                         ...Wuddya want?

                                     LITTLE GIRL
                         ...Santa?

                                     WILLIE
                         Yeah, c'mon, c'mon, wuddya want?

                                     LITTLE GIRL
                         Um... Barbie?

                                     WILLIE
                         Fine. Next.

               Marcus puts another young boy on his lap.

                                     WILLIE
                         ...What do you want?

                                     BOY
                         Fraggle-stick car.

                                     WILLIE
                              (to himself)
                         Fuck is that?
                              (back to the kid)
                         Fine, whatever, next.

               No one is next.

                                     WILLIE
                         ...Next. Next!

               Still nothing.

                                     WILLIE
                         ...Next, goddamnit! Let's move it 
                         along -- this is not the DMV!

               Marcus walks over to the rope. The snot-nosed Kid is next in 
               line, frozen by fear. Marcus pulls on his hand.

                                     MARCUS
                         It's okay. C'mon.

               The Kid stays put.

                                     MARCUS
                         What's your name?

               The Kid shakes his head meekly.

                                     MARCUS
                         ...You can tell me...

               No response.

                                     MARCUS
                         ...How about Santa? If you don't 
                         tell him, you won't get a present.

               This penetrates the Kid's fear. He moves.

                                     MARCUS
                         ...That's right. Let's tell Santa.

               Marcus leads the Kid up to the throne and places him on 
               Willie's lap.

                                     WILLIE
                         What do you want? C'mon, wuddya want? 
                         A snot rag?

               The Kid just stares, motionless except for the flowing rivulet 
               of snot. Willie can't help but stare at it.

                                     WILLIE
                              (to himself)
                         ...Another fuckin' mongoloid.
                              (shouts)
                         Marcus I get him outta here before 
                         he pisses on me.

               Suddenly the Kid is moved to yank Willie's beard. He holds 
               it stretched below Willie's chin.

                                     WILLIE
                              (whispered to the kid)
                         ...Let it go, you little bastard.

                                     KID
                         It's not real.

                                     WILLIE
                         It was real. The hair fell out when 
                         I got sick.

                                     KID
                         How'd you get sick?

                                     WILLIE
                         I loved a woman who wasn't clean.

                                     KID
                         Mrs. Santa?

                                     WILLIE
                         No, her sister.
                              (whispers through 
                              clenched teeth)
                         Let the fucking thing go.

                                     KID
                         What's it like at the North Pole?

                                     WILLIE
                         Like the suburbs.

                                     KID
                         Which one?

                                     WILLIE
                         Apache Junction. What the fuck do 
                         you care?

               Willie shoves the Kid:

                                     WILLIE
                         Get the hell off my lap.

               The Kid backs away, looking at him.

                                     KID
                         You are really Santa, right?

                                     WILLIE
                         No. No, I'm an accountant. I wear 
                         this as a fucking fashion thing.

                                     KID
                         Okay.

               The Kid backs away in awe, never breaking his reverent stare.

               As Marcus helps the next child onto Santa's lap Willie hisses 
               at him:

                                     WILLIE
                         Get that kid out of here, he's 
                         freaking me out.

               EXT. CHAMBERLAIN'S - NIGHT

               The Kid sits on a bench watching the entrance to 
               Chamberlain's. After a beat Willie and Marcus walk out in 
               costume and cross toward the parking lot.

               The Kid follows from a safe distance.

               EXT. SAGUARO MALL - PARKING LOT - NIGHT

               Willie and Marcus walk across the huge empty parking lot, 
               followed at a great distance by the Kid.

               They arrive at their cars -- Marcus' van and a beat-up old 
               Chrysler that is Willie's -- parked next to each other.

               As the Kid creeps closer, he is able to hear their 
               conversation.

               Willie motions to the Black Angus in the parking lot.

                                     WILLIE
                         I gotta get a drink on. See ya 
                         tomorrow.

                                     MARCUS
                         Just don't come in to work stinkin' 
                         of booze again.

                                     WILLIE
                         Don't worry about me. Get going, 
                         you'll be late for your Wizard of Oz 
                         Candy Bar Guild thing.

                                     MARCUS
                         Lollipop Guild, asshole. Jesus, two 
                         year olds flip me shit better'n you.

                                     WILLIE
                         You tryin' to say something to me?

                                     MARCUS
                              (pauses, then 
                              deliberately)
                         Yeah. I'm gonna stick my whole fist 
                         up your ass.

               INT. BLACK ANGUS BAR - NIGHT

               A large faux rustic bar filled to capacity with loosened-tie 
               middle-management.

               Crammed at the far end of the bar, Willie stands out like a 
               sore thumb in this thirty-ish crowd.

               We follow his gaze all around the perimeter of the room until 
               it connects with the drunken, glowering face of a HINDUSTANI 
               TROUBLEMAKER, sitting right across from him, startling Willie 
               for a moment.

               Willie regains his composure, then gives the guy a puzzled 
               look back, and amused by the guy's unflinching anger, raises 
               his glass in a toast to him as if to say, "whatever... cheers, 
               you nutcase", and turns back to his drink.

               The man stands up and, never releasing his stare, moves right 
               up to Willie, two inches from his face. Willie looks up.

                                     TROUBLEMAKER
                              (Hindi accent)
                         Listen here buddy, let me make 
                         yourself perfectly clear. We don't 
                         like your kind coming around here in 
                         your red silk and satin clothes with 
                         your hunger for same-sex 
                         relationships. Consider yourself 
                         warned.

                                     WILLIE
                         Well fu-uck you!

                                     TROUBLEMAKER
                         I know that's what you'd like to do!

               Willie gears up for a swing.

                                     WILLIE
                         Up yours, yufff --

               A hand grabs his arm.

                                     VOICE (O.S.)
                         Don't.

               Willie follows the hand to find a mature but attractive 
               BARMAID (SUE), an outdoorsy western beauty. Her eyes and 
               Willie's lock -- a source of sardonic amusement for the 
               troublemaker.

                                     TROUBLEMAKER
                         Oh saved by a woman, mister No-Pussy-
                         Please man!

               He stalks off.

                                     SUE
                         He ain't worth it, sugar. He got hit 
                         on last week. Didn't sit too well.

                                     TROUBLEMAKER
                         WHAT ARE YOU STARING AT!?

               By the bathroom, the troublemaker is in another man's face:

                                     TROUBLEMAKER
                         ...This is not Flagstaff!

                                     SUE
                         Another Grandad, Santa?

                                     WILLIE
                         Yep.

               She pours him another and slams it on the bar.

                                     SUE
                         Got a name?

                                     WILLIE
                         Oh yeah.

               He pounds the drink.

               She waits. Nothing else is forthcoming.

                                     SUE
                         What do you do? I mean, after the 
                         holidays?

                                     WILLIE
                         Nothing 'til March. Then I'm the 
                         Easter Bunny.

                                     SUE
                         ...Another?

                                     WILLIE
                         Why not. Buy you one?

                                     SUE
                         Why not.

               She pours two. They both pound them back.

               Her statement is a question:

                                     SUE
                         ...Not a big talker.

                                     WILLIE
                         Nah.

                                     SUE
                         Buy you one?

                                     WILLIE
                         Why not.

               As she pours:

                                     SUE
                         You're pretty regular, for a Santa.

               He shrugs:

                                     WILLIE
                         It's my job, no big deal. I'm an 
                         eating, drinking, shitting, fucking 
                         Santa Claus.

                                     SUE
                         Prove it.

               Willie stares at her.

                                     WILLIE
                         Which?

               INT. WILLIE'S CAR - PARKING LOT - NIGHT

               Willie is on top of the barmaid, humping her, still in his 
               Santa suit. His pom-pom bobs in rhythm with his thrusts.

                                     WILLIE
                         Yes! Yes! Yes!

                                     SUE
                         Fuck me, Santa! Fuck me, Santa!

               The hat is slipping askew. He reaches for it.

                                     WILLIE
                         At least lemme take off the hat!

                                     SUE
                         NO!

               EXT. SAGUARO SQUARE MALL - PARKING LOT - NIGHT 

               In the parking lot the barmaid finishes straightening her 
               clothes and touching up her lipstick in the rearview mirror.

               Willie, leaning against his car, still in his Santa suit, 
               fires up a post-coital cigarette.

                                     SUE
                         I got a thing for Santa Claus, I 
                         don't know, I guess it's from early 
                         childhood.

                                     WILLIE
                              (taking a swig)
                         Yeah, so's my thing for tits.

                                     SUE
                         Maybe because my parents were Jewish 
                         and never celebrated Christmas. Santa 
                         was sort of forbidden, you know?

               She gets out of the car.

                                     SUE
                         I like you. Most of the people around 
                         here are pretty uptight. My name is 
                         Sue. Here's my number.

               She hands him the slip of paper and ambles off, calling back 
               over her shoulder:

                                     SUE
                         ...Don't mothball that suit!

               Willie, nodding understanding, turns to reach for his car 
               door and --

                                     TROUBLEMAKER
                         I AM NOT GAY!!

               -- the accompanying PAN OVER brings in the screaming 
               homophobe.

                                     WILLIE
                         Whoa-Jesus! All right buddy, that's 
                         it...

                                     TROUBLEMAKER
                         Buddy? I said, I am not gay!

                                     WILLIE
                         Look, what's the problem pal, you go 
                         off your meds?

               The man stares at him for a beat.

                                     TROUBLEMAKER
                         ...Yes, but this isn't about that! 
                         You are queer as a ten dollar bill.

                                     WILLIE
                         Now you listen. My brother lost an 
                         arm fighting you people in Vietnam, 
                         so I want you to take a good hard 
                         look at this face...

               Willie pulls back a fist.

                                     WILLIE
                         ...'cause it's the last fuckin' thing 
                         you're gonna see before I knock your 
                         head off and sh --

               WHACK-WHACK-WHACK-WHACK-WHACK! The man surprises Willie with 
               a flurry of effective punches. In moments, Willie is on the 
               losing end of homosexual panic.

                                     TROUBLEMAKER
                         Who is the bitch now, fat man?!

                                     PIPING VOICE (O.S.)
                         Leave Santa alone!

               The Troublemaker stops and looks down to find the Kid beating 
               on his legs.

                                     TROUBLEMAKER
                         Please little boy, I am doing this 
                         for all of us!

               Willie gets a chance to regain composure. He wipes the blood 
               from his mouth, raises his fists and... promptly collapses.

                                     TROUBLEMAKER
                         I think he has finished his cruising 
                         for tonight, hm?

               The Hindustani hothead wanders off. The Kid shuffles over to 
               the prone Willie.

                                     WILLIE
                         You.

               INT. WILLIE'S CAR - MOVING - NIGHT 

               The Kid sits in the front seat next to Willie who drives, 
               stewing.

                                     WILLIE
                         This one time I take you home.

                                     KID
                         Uh-huh.

                                     WILLIE
                         I'm not your fuckin' dada.

                                     KID
                         Uh-huh.

                                     WILLIE
                         It's not as if you helped out with 
                         that nut-job.

                                     KID
                         Uh-huh.

                                     WILLIE
                         And you're right there to grab his 
                         fuckin' balls.

                                     KID
                         Uh-huh.

                                     WILLIE
                         Right height.

                                     KID
                         Yeah.

               Willie demonstrates with a sharp turn of his hand:

                                     WILLIE
                         Twist 'em.

                                     KID
                         Why do you need a car?

                                     WILLIE
                         ...Fuck you talkin' about?

                                     KID
                         This car.

                                     WILLIE
                         Whuh. Which turn is it?

                         Sage Terrace. Where's your sleigh?

               Willie answers absently, his head slightly ducked and his 
               eyes darting side to side, checking for road signs:

                                     WILLIE
                         Repairs. In the shop.

                         I stable 'em. Is it gonna be left or 
                         right?

                              (pointing left)

                                     WILLIE
                         Next to the shop.

                         Who -- the reindeer? Standing up.

                                     KID
                         But the noise, how do they sleep?

                                     WILLIE
                         What noise?

                                     KID
                         From the shop.

                                     WILLIE
                         They, uh, they only work during the 
                         day.

                                     KID
                         I thought it was always night at the 
                         North Pole.

                                     WILLIE
                         Not now. Now it's always day.

                                     KID
                         Then how do they sleep?

                                     WILLIE
                         Well, they -- WILL YOU PUH-LEEEZ 
                         SHUT THE FUCK UP! HOW THE FUCK DO 
                         KNOW?! I'M GONNA -- Whoa! Sage 
                         Terrace!

               He makes a hard left.

                                     WILLIE
                         ...What is it with you? Somebody 
                         drop you on your fucking head?

                                     KID
                         On my head?

                                     WILLIE
                         What, are they gonna drop you on 
                         somebody else's head?

                                     KID
                         How can they drop me onto my own 
                         head?

                                     WILLIE
                         Not onto your own h -- ARE YOU FUCKING 
                         WITH ME?

               EXT. THE KID'S HOUSE - NIGHT

               Willie escorts the Kid along a long walkway that leads to 
               the front door of a large, opulent, new-money Southwestern 
               home.

               Willie admires the surroundings.

                                     WILLIE
                         Nice digs. Daddy home?

                                     KID
                         He's on a adventure 'sploring 
                         mountains. He been gone a long time.

                                     WILLIE
                         Exploring mountains? When's he coming 
                         back?

                                     KID
                         Next year.

                                     WILLIE
                         What about Mommy?

                                     KID
                         She lives in God's house with Jesus 
                         and Mary and the Ghost and the long-
                         eared donkey and Joseph and the 
                         talking walnut.

                                     WILLIE
                         Who the fuck takes care of you then?

                                     KID
                         Granma.

                                     WILLIE
                              (hatching an idea)
                         Really... What's her name?

                                     KID
                         Granma.

               As the Kid lets himself in Willie pulls out a black ski mask 
               and puts it on his head like a stocking cap.

                                     WILLIE
                         Uh-huh. Is Granny spry?

               He unrolls the mask to cover his face and takes out a 
               blackjack.

               INT. THE KID'S HOUSE - NIGHT

               Willie enters the foyer as the Kid walks into the adjoining 
               room. He approaches a figure in a La-Z-Boy watching TV.

                                     KID
                         Granma, Santa's here. Are you spry?

               Grandma rises from her chair with the assistance of her walker 
               and begins to move toward Willie. She wears a bathrobe and 
               thick glasses and has another pair of glasses on a chain 
               around her neck.

                                     GRANDMA
                         Roger! You're home. Let me fix you 
                         some sandwiches.

               He watches as the senile old woman innocently putters away.

               He yanks off his mask and turns to the Kid.

                                     WILLIE
                         So you're tellin' me no one else is 
                         here?

               The Kid shakes his head.

                                     WILLIE
                         ...No aunts, no uncles, no cousins?

               The Kid shakes his head.

                                     WILLIE
                         ...Butler, security guard? Nothin'?

                                     KID
                         Nuh-uh.

               This sinks in. Willie looks to the Kid.

                                     WILLIE
                         Daddy got a safe?

               INT. THE KID'S HOUSE - STUDY - NIGHT

               The sound of a tumbler tripping and, suddenly, light sweeps 
               in as the safe door opens to reveal a smiling Willie with 
               his stethoscope in his ears.

               In the foreground a few stacks of cash and a folio. Willie 
               reaches in.

               Willie grabs the folio and flips through it. Insurance forms, 
               deeds, Social Security cards, birth certificates, etc., all 
               bear the name of the Kid's father, Roger Merman.

               Nothing of value.

               He puts the folio back, grabs the cash.

                                     KID
                         You need money to fix your sleigh?

                                     WILLIE
                         Huh? Yeah, whateverthefuck...

                                     KID
                         You want milk and cookies?

               Willie bends down and faces the Kid with a smile.

                                     WILLIE
                         Daddy got a car?

               EXT. THE KID'S HOUSE - NIGHT

               At the cut a new Mercedes screeches through the frame and, 
               as we hear it recede, we are left looking at the kid, who 
               stands at the curb, waving happily.

                                     KID
                         Bye Santa!

               INT. CHAMBERLAIN'S - SECURITY OFFICE - NIGHT

               CLOSE-UP: the glowing ash of a cigarette burning down. The 
               inhale lasts as long as comic timing will allow -- about six 
               or seven seconds.

               ANGLE ON:

               A wiry, hard-bitten, sun-baked saddlebag of a man, GIN SLAGEL 
               sits behind his cluttered desk sucking on a filterless Pall 
               Mall. We can hear his in-taken breath rattling over and around 
               the phlegm, growths, and polyps that line his embattled 
               trachea. His words come out on an exhaled cloud chamber's 
               worth of smoke:

                                     GIN
                         "Fuck stick"?

               Bob Chipeska sits opposite.

                                     CHIPESKA
                         Yes, I thought it was strange too, 
                         but you know, I, I, I, I, uh, I, his 
                         little friend promised he wouldn't 
                         say it in front of the children. 
                         Which is fine because, you know, 
                         urn, there's an adult world and a 
                         child's world and that's okay. I'm 
                         not a censor.

                                     GIN
                         Little friend?

                                     CHIPESKA
                         Yes, a, a, a dwarf. Or midget... a, 
                         a, I don't know what he's called 
                         exactly but... a little guy. Little. 
                         Billy Barty. God rest. But thin 
                         fingers. Not the fat sausage fingers.

                                     GIN
                         "Little people," that's what they 
                         like.

                                     CHIPESKA
                         Ah, yes, right.

                                     GIN
                         So "fuck stick," that's all?

                                     CHIPESKA
                         Well, no, there was something else...

               INT. CHAMBERLAIN'S - WOMEN'S BIG AND TALL - (EARLIER) 

               Chipeska walks by a cashier station carrying some paperwork 
               he's absorbed in, but hears some FAINT GROANS that make him 
               pause. Curious, he heads in the direction of the sounds.

               They're coming from the dressing room area.

               Chipeska curiously makes his way towards a corridor of 
               dressing rooms.

                                     CHIPESKA (V.O.)
                         ...A couple of days ago I was in 
                         Women's Big & Tall? --

               A sign reads: "Three Times A Lady".

               INT. CHAMBERLAIN'S - DRESSING ROOM AREA - (EARLIER)

               He goes down a corridor of dressing rooms.

                                     CHIPESKA (V.O.)
                         and I heard these, urn, you know, 
                         these... noises.

               The sound of throttling lust builds in volume. He follows 
               his ears until he arrives at a dressing room door. A Big or 
               Tall woman within screams with pleasure:

                                     FEMALE VOICE (O.S.)
                         Oh yeah! Oh yeah!

                                     WILLIE'S VOICE (O.S.)
                         Yeah! Yeah! You ain't gonna shit 
                         right for a week!

               He looks underneath and spots black Santa boots with red 
               velvet pants around the ankles.

               INT. CHAMBERLAIN'S - SECURITY OFFICE - NIGHT

               Bob Chipeska holds up one hand.

                                     CHIPESKA
                         Now don't get me wrong. I was against 
                         the Clinton impeachment. What a man 
                         does with his penis -- Oval Office, 
                         Women's Big & Tall -- it's not for 
                         the American people to say.

                                     GIN
                         Right.

                                     CHIPESKA
                         But when you're dealing with children, 
                         a tender sensibility, a position of 
                         trust -- then perhaps, someone who 
                         has screaming orgasms with large 
                         women --

                                     GIN
                         Mm.

                         Though I can't fire him for that.

                                     GIN
                         No.

                         Sizisra. They'd say.

                         Sure.

                         Not true. I am no siziat. But I can 
                         see the picket line now.

                                     GIN
                         Yeah, a big fuckin' fat one.

                                     CHIPESKA
                         They'd all say, If it had been a 
                         supermodel or, uh...

                                     GIN
                         Heeyeah. Unfair practices. A lot of 
                         special pleading. Bitch, bitch, bitch. 
                         Fuckin' broads.

                         But -- I can't help it -- the guy 
                         makes me uneasy.

                                     GIN
                         Well sure. Santa fuckin' someone in

                         So maybe there's something I could 
                         fire him for.

                                     GIN
                         Yeah. Yeah. I getcha.

                         Do you? Do you think you could find 
                         something?

                                     GIN
                         Oh shit yeah. There's always 
                         something.

               INT. SAGAURO SQUARE MALL - VIDEO ARCADE - NIGHT

               POV through the arcade's window shows Willie talking in 
               pantomime to a young girl -- a very young girl -- at one of 
               the pinball machines. Willie has his hands out to either 
               side and is either demonstrating the kind of body English to 
               apply to the machine, or else is describing an elaborate 
               sexual encounter -- either recalled or prospective. The girl, 
               giggles.

               A REVERSE shows Marcus halted at the arcade window staring 
               in with disbelief that gives way to jaw-grinding anger:

                                     MARCUS
                         ...Motherfucker... Oh, you lousy 
                         fucking motherfuck...

               Willie and Marcus walk to their cars.

                         That's just the kinda shit that's 
                         gonna get us pinched!

                              (apologetic)
                         She said she was eighteen.

                                     MARCUS
                         You promised no arcades! You said 
                         you'd only hustle Big & Tall!

                                     WILLIE
                         Ah, it's like shooting fish in a 
                         barrel -- there's no sport,

                                     MARCUS
                         How many times, you fuck? "The bigger 
                         the store, the bigger the take." 
                         Well, we can't work the big stores 
                         with your big fucking train wrecks!

                                     WILLIE
                              (pulling out his keys)
                         You got some nerve you little shit 
                         ya! You my mom now?! You shat me out 
                         your womb, is that it? You gotta 
                         take care of me!? Well I can take 
                         care of myself and I don't need no 
                         lectures! I know how to keep a low 
                         profile!

               BOOP-BOOP! Willie uses his key fob to deactivate the car 
               alarm to the Mercedes.

                                     MARCUS
                         What the fuck is this?!

                                     WILLIE
                         Mind your own fucking business.

               Willie opens the door and an avalanche of beer bottle empties 
               tumbles out, rolling everywhere.

                                     MARCUS
                         You cocksucker!

               Willie starts the engine and pulls out, and Marcus yells to 
               the receding car:

                                     MARCUS
                         ...EVER HEAR OF THE OPEN-BOTTLE LAW?!
                              (then, to himself)
                         -- You dumb Dipshit Motherfucker!

               EXT. RESIDENCE MOTEL - NIGHT

               Willie parks the Mercedes in the front of a rundown motel 
               complex. He walks past hookers and junkies until he gets to 
               his unit.

               He pulls out his key and just as he's about to insert it in 
               the lock he sees a flashlight beam shining inside the window.

               Surprised, he backs off cautiously and presses up against 
               the wall.

               Someone inside is rifling the room.

               Willie hisses at a nearby hooker:

                                     WILLIE
                         Opal, come here.

               Opal looks at him with disdain.

                                     OPAL
                         Screw you, Willie -- last time I 
                         didn't shit right for a week.

                                     WILLIE
                         No, not that -- come here!

               Reluctantly, she sidles over.

                                     WILLIE
                         Who the fuck's in my room, did you 
                         see someone go into my fuckin' room?

                                     OPAL
                         Yeah some guy askin' 'boutcha -- 
                         looked like a cop.

                                     WILLIE
                         Ah fuck.

               INT. MARCUS' APARTMENT - NIGHT

               Marcus is on the phone with Willie.

                                     MARCUS
                         What guy?! You get a look at him?

                                                                  INTERCUT:

               EXT. RESIDENCE MOTEL - NIGHT

               Willie is at a pay phone.

                                     WILLIE
                         No, I think it's a cop though. You 
                         think someone's onto us?

                                     MARCUS
                         Is there anything in the room? 
                         Anything professional?

                                     WILLIE
                         No. Clothes.

                                     MARCUS
                         Just ditch. You got anywhere to sack 
                         out for a while?

               INT. THE KID'S HOUSE - FOYER - NIGHT

               The Kid swings the door open to Willie, who stands on the 
               stoop holding a small grip.

                                     KID
                         Santa!

                                     WILLIE
                         Yeah.

                                     KID
                         You're bringing my present early?

                                     WILLIE
                         NO.

                                     KID
                         But I never told you what I wanted.

                                     WILLIE
                         I said I didn't bring it, dipshit.

                                     KID
                         Okay. Good. I want a stuffed elephant. 
                         A pink one.

                                     WILLIE
                         Yeah, well...

               He brushes past the kid into the house, eyes darting this 
               way and that.

                                     WILLIE
                         ...wish in one hand and shit in the 
                         other, see which fills up faster.

                                     KID
                         Okay.

               The Kid follows Willie like a puppy dog as Willie checks out 
               the house, bumping open doors, looking around.

                                     WILLIE
                         I'm gonna be staying here a while. 
                         Things are all fucked up at the North 
                         Pole. Mrs. Santa, she... she walked 
                         in on me fuckin' her sister. So I'm 
                         out on my fuckin' ass. She's taking 
                         half of everything... This'll do.

               INT. THE KID'S HOUSE - MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT

               Willie has discovered the master bedroom, by appearances 
               long unused. He tosses his grip onto the double bed.

                                     WILLIE
                         ...I'm gonna crash here. You and me, 
                         like, you know, bachelors.

                                     KID
                         Do you and Mrs. Santa have kids?

                                     WILLIE
                         No. Thank the fuck Christ.

                                     KID
                         What about the elves?

                                     WILLIE
                         Yeah, well, them. They stay with 
                         Mrs. Santa. I get 'em on weekends. 
                         Run me a bath, will ya?

                                     KID
                         What about the reindeer?

                                     WILLIE
                              (pleading)
                         Don't start with the fucking reindeer.

               INT. THE KID'S HOUSE - MASTER BATHROOM - NIGHT

               The Kid sits on a stool, hands on his knees, staring, 
               motionless.

               Finally:

                                     KID
                         ...What're their names?

               Willie lies in the tub, also motionless, a wet washcloth 
               over his face, fingers of one hand resting against a tumbler 
               filled with ice and amber liquid that sits on the edge of 
               the tub.

               From under his washcloth:

                                     WILLIE
                         ...Who?

                                     KID
                         The elves.

                                     WILLIE
                              (to himself)
                         Oh, fuck...
                              (then, to the Kid)
                         I -- I can't remember... Sneezy, and 
                         Dopey --

                                     KID
                         That's the Seven Dwarves.

                                     WILLIE
                         Shit, is that not...? I just -- fuck, 
                         I don't know, I'll just say, Hey, 
                         Bub -- Look, I...

               He drags the washcloth off his face and looks at the kid.

                                     WILLIE
                         ...FUCK ME! I DON'T KNOW THIS FUCKING 
                         SHIT! WHY IS EVERYTHING A FUCKING 
                         TEST WITH YOU?!

               The Kid looks at him, unperturbed.

                                     KID
                         -- How old are they?

               INT. THE KID'S HOUSE - MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT 

               Willie staggers in, a towel around his waist, the empty rock 
               glass in one hand, a bottle tucked under the other arm, the 
               Kid trotting after.

                                     KID
                         You want cookies?

                                     WILLIE
                         No.

                                     KID
                         Warm milk?

                                     WILLIE
                         No.

               Willie carefully, carefully puts glass and bottle down on 
               the nightstand and slowly raises both hands in a "Don't... 
               Move" gesture to keep them from flying off.

                                     KID
                         Should I fix you some sandwiches?

                                     WILLIE
                         What is with the fixing sandwiches? 
                         No.

               Satisfied that the bottle and glass are not going anywhere, 
               Willie climbs unsteadily onto the bed and stares at the 
               ceiling.

                                     KID
                         Okay. You want anything else?

                                     WILLIE
                         No. As soon as the bed stops moving 
                         I'm going to sleep...

                                     KID
                         Okay.

                                     WILLIE
                         ...Wake me up... when the little 
                         hand is on the...

               A long beat.

               The ragged breath of drunken sleep.

                                     KID
                         Okay.

               INT. CHAMBERLAIN'S - MAIN FLOOR - SCARF AREA - DAY

               Marcus's wife Lois stands in front of a mirror, trying on a 
               cashmere scarf. Her look of pruney disapproval is in place, 
               as ever. She takes off the scarf and writes something in a 
               small spiral notebook...

                                     SALESWOMAN
                         Can I help you, ma'am?

                                     LOIS
                         Just looking.

               Across the store, she spies the jewelry counter.

               INT. CHAMBERLAIN'S - MAIN FLOOR - JEWELRY AREA - DAY

               Lois stands looking intently down through the glass case in 
               pruney disapproval.

                                     SALESMAN
                         Help you with anything, ma'am?

               Without bothering to look up:

                                     LOIS
                         Just looking.

               As he drifts away she takes out her spiral notebook and makes 
               more notes.

                                     MARCUS
                         You said that last night you stupid 
                         fuck!

                                     WILLIE
                         Ah, shit! Fuck you!

               Lois appears with a salad on a tray and a look of pruney 
               disapproval. She sits next to Marcus and, in the way of old 
               couples comfortable with each other, he rests a hand on her 
               knee and continues to talk, ignoring her, while she picks 
               through her salad, ignoring him.

                                     MARCUS
                         You are by far the dumbest most 
                         pathetic piece of maggot-eaten shit 
                         that has ever slid from God's gilded 
                         ass! What if the kid has one of those 
                         fucking play-dates they have now?

                                     WILLIE
                         You shittin' me?! He doesn't have 
                         fucking friends! Not even an imaginary 
                         one! Unless he got ditched by him! 
                         He's just a fuckin' misfit! Lives 
                         with his grandma who sits drooling 
                         in front of the TV! Every once in a 
                         while she gets up to play soccer 
                         with her tits! What, she's gon' rat 
                         me out? She don't know her ass from 
                         last Tuesday!

               Marcus thinks a moment.

                                     MARCUS
                         You fuck her?

                                     WILLIE
                         Jesus! Why is everything sex with 
                         you?

                                     MARCUS
                         With me? I fuck one person, I ain't 
                         out there serial fornicating, trying 
                         to float my liver! Drinkin' myself 
                         silly 'cause I can't stand what a 
                         piece of shit I am!

               Lois, chewing on her salad, notices someone walking by with 
               a Chamberlain's bag. She glances in as the person passes 
               and, still chewing, gets out her notebook and jots something 
               down.

                                     WILLIE
                         What're you, fuckin' Sigmund Sawed-
                         Off Freud? The shrunken fuckin' 
                         shrink?

                                     MARCUS
                         Yeah, that's right, shit-for-brains, 
                         talk about my height. Make it about 
                         something safe. 'Cause you're an 
                         emotional fucking cripple. Your soul 
                         is dog shit. Every single fuckin' 
                         thing about you is ugly.

                                     WILLIE
                         Yeah? Well... fuck you.

               Marcus and Lois get up to leave.

                                     MARCUS
                         I've seen anal warts more attractive 
                         than you.

               They walk off. Willie sits there for a moment. Goes back to 
               eating his hamburger. A WOMAN comes up with her TODDLER in 
               tow.

                                     WOMAN
                         Oh, look who's here Jimmy! It's Santa! 
                         Let's tell him what you want for 
                         Christmas.

                                     WILLIE
                              (shouting, food flying 
                              out of his mouth)
                         I'M ON MY FUCKING LUNCH BREAK HERE!

                                     WOMAN
                              (putting her hands 
                              over the Toddler's 
                              ears)
                         Are you insane?!! How dare you talk 
                         like that in front of a child! The 
                         management is going to hear about 
                         this... I'm going to have you fired!

                                     WILLIE
                         That's a threat? You think you can 
                         make my life any worse, you go ahead, 
                         be my fucking guest!

               He throws his hamburger back down on his tray and storms 
               off, leaving the woman shocked.

               INT. THE KID'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 

               Willie and the Kid sit opposite each other over a game of 
               checkers. Willie scowls as the Kid thinks for an eternity 
               about his next move.

               The silence is deafening. Endless.

               Then... CLICK! CLICK! CLICK! CLICK! CLICK!

                                     KID
                         King me.

               Willie stares at the board for a long beat.

               He leaps up screaming and flings the board across the room.

                                     WILLIE
                         FUCK YOU! YOU FUCKING CHEATER!

               Willie throws checkers one by one against the wall, 
               punctuating each throw with an insult.

                                     WILLIE
                         Son of a BITCH! ...you LOUSY... 
                         STINKEN... ROTTEN... CHEATING... NO 
                         GOOD...

               ANGLE ON Kid's face, unfazed, still smiling.

               INT. THE KID'S HOUSE - KID'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

               Later. The kid lies in bed, sleeping peacefully.

               Distant sounds of the slosh of water.

               EXT. THE KID'S HOUSE - BACK YARD - NIGHT

               Churning water.

               The sloshing of water is now accompanied by a rhythmic 
               slapping sound.

               Willie bangs Sue in the Jacuzzi. He is wearing his Santa 
               hat.

                                     SUE
                         YES! YES! YES SANTA YES!

               INT. THE KID'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

               Two tall water glasses are set down on a sideboard.

                                     WILLIE (O.S.)
                         Refill?

                                     SUE (O.S.)
                         Mm.

               A splash of orange juice is dolloped into each of the glasses, 
               and then both are filled to the top with vodka.

               WIDER on the living room reveals Sue looking around. Her 
               speech -- and Willie's -- is somewhat impaired:

                                     SUE
                         Nice place you got. Needs a bit of a 
                         woman's touch, but it's really nice.

                                     WILLIE
                         It's okay. Just renting.

               Sue accepts her refilled glass and sits on the sofa.

                                     SUE
                         Thanks... So how long will you -- 
                         urn...

               She reaches down to fish under her ass in the sofa cushion, 
               and pulls out a red checker. She dully inspects it.

                                     SUE
                         ...How long you gonna be here?

                                     WILLIE
                         Through the holidays.

               Sue flips the checker away.

                                     SUE
                         So what's the thing, you like kids?

                                     WILLIE
                         Fuck no! Whaddya think I'm some kind 
                         of pervert?

                                     SUE
                         Wha? I'm talking about you being 
                         Santa.

               He sways, looking at her.

                                     WILLIE
                         Oh. No, see, the thing is... I'm not 
                         really Santa.

               Blearily she gazes back. After a moment:

                                     SUE
                         Oh.
                              (pause)
                         ...Well -- still -- I gotta thing 
                         for you anyway -- c'mere...

               He leans down to kiss her.

               INT. THE KID'S HOUSE - FOYER - NIGHT

               The door opens to reveal Sue on her way out. Willie sways in 
               the foyer, a three-quarters-empty bottle of Old Grandad in 
               hand.

                                     SUE
                         So I'll see you soon I guess, right?

                                     WILLIE
                         Yeah, I'm gonna send you some flowers. 
                         Real good expensive ones.

               He closes the door. He then tips back the bottle and polishes 
               it off with a series of quick gulps.

               Ever so daintily, he puts the bottle down. A beat later --

               WHAM! He faints dead away, hitting the floor like a felled 
               tree.

                                                                  FADE OUT:

               Faintly, distantly, a blood-curdling scream.

               FADE IN:

               INT. THE KID'S HOUSE - FOYER/HALLWAY - MORNING

               Willie wakes on the floor to the sound of the scream.

                                     WILLIE
                         Whuh...

               He looks blearily up and immediately grabs his head, feeling 
               his hangover.

               Following his ears he heads toward the hall. He passes 
               Grandma.

                                     GRANDMA
                         Roger! You're home! Let me fix you 
                         some sandwiches.

               A bedroom door crashes open and the Kid emerges screaming 
               and runs right into Willie. He immediately caroms off and 
               goes screaming down the hall.

                                     WILLIE
                         What the...

               He looks down at his T-shirt. There is a bloody palm-print 
               on his stomach.

               He turns the corner to the hall, There is a row of fresh, 
               bloody palm-prints down one side of the hall. The Kid, 
               screaming, is just disappearing at the far end.

               Willie follows.

               INT. THE KID'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - MORNING

               Willie enters.

               The Kid is screaming, jumping up and down and clutching one 
               hand -- the bloody one -- with the other.

                                     WILLIE
                         What the fuck did you do?

               He goes up and tries to yank the hand, which the hysterical 
               Kid yanks away.

                                     WILLIE
                         ...Lemme look at it. What the fuck 
                         happened?

               As Willie drags him to the sink and runs water over the cut, 
               the Kid takes great gulping breaths and finally manages to 
               say:

                                     KID
                         ...I cut myself by mistake.

               Willie grabs a vodka bottle standing open on the counter and 
               liberally pours some on the hand. The Kid shrieks.

                                     WILLIE
                         I forgot to tell ya, that'll sting. 
                         Okay now!

               The Kid yanks his hand away and runs off screaming. Willie 
               is left alone in the middle of the kitchen.

                                     WILLIE
                         ...Well fuck.

               He calls after the boy, sincerely trying to help:

                                     WILLIE
                         ...Don' t you want me to wrap it in 
                         a T-shirt or something?

               EXT. SAGUARO SQUARE MALL - PARKING LOT - MORNING

               It is early morning and the parking lot is empty except for 
               Marcus' van. The Mercedes eventually pulls in, parking beside 
               him. Windows roll down. In the driver's seat, Marcus looks 
               up from his watch with a scowl.

                                     MARCUS
                         You're late.

               VAN DOORS

               Marcus throws open the back of the van, revealing the 
               components of the water drill in various prop gift boxes.

               Willie wears a forbearing smile:

                                     WILLIE
                         Kids, lemmme tell ya...

               He shakes his head and chuckles as Marcus tosses him an empty 
               red Santa sack.

                                     WILLIE
                         ...They'll run ya ragged.

               Marcus stares.

               EXT. CHAMBERLAIN'S - ENTRANCE - MORNING

               Jesse, the security guard unlocks the door and opens up for 
               Willie and Marcus. They enter in costume. Willie lugs the 
               filled sack and seems to be straining.

                         Morning boys.

                                     MARCUS
                         Morning Jesse.

                                     JESSE
                              (to Willie)
                         Ho! Ho! Ho!

               Willie pants under the weight of his bag:

                                     WILLIE
                         Up your ass.

               EXT. SAGUARO SQUARE MALL - PARKING LOT - MORNING

               As Willie and Marcus enter the store Gin Slagel drives by 
               their cars, carefully noting their tags.

               INT. CHAMBERLAIN'S - WINTER WONDERLAND - DAY

               Willie drops the bag with a loud thud.

                                     WILLIE
                         GOD dammit!

                                     MARCUS
                         You tear your ball again?

                                     WILLIE
                         No, it's okay.

               Together they unload the extremely heavy gifts.

                                     MARCUS
                         Let's do the other thing.

               Willie follows Marcus behind the Wonderland backdrop. Marcus 
               points to an air duct in the ceiling.

                                     MARCUS
                         There.

               Willie crouches and Marcus climbs on his shoulders.

               INT. CHAMBERLAIN'S - AIR DUCT - DAY

               The duct pops open and Marcus climbs in, shimmying down to a 
               junction and continuing on.

               INT. CHAMBERLAIN'S - CUSTOMER SERVICE OFFICES - DAY

               A long row of cubicles, each one occupied with Customer 
               Service Operators. As they work, the loud squeaks and popping 
               metal sounds of a dwarf crawling through a duct are heard 
               above them.

               Each operator in succession notes the racket, looking up 
               curiously as the sounds pass overhead.

               Suddenly, the sounds stop. Everyone returns to work.

               Then...

               SQUEAK! POP! SQUEAK! The sounds resume. The operators look 
               up again as the noises fade away.

               INT. CHAMBERLAIN'S - SURVEILLANCE ROOM - DAY

               The sounds continue until Marcus' face appears at the ceiling 
               duct of an unmanned surveillance room.

               He focuses on the wall of a hundred identical VCRs and squints 
               to see the brand name: SONY HVR-3200.

               EXT. ELECTRONICS STORE - DAY

               Lois exits an electronics store with a box slung under her 
               arm, her mouth turned down in pruney disapproval. She places 
               the box on the hood of her car and we see its printings SONY 
               HVR-3200.

               She opens the box, fishes out the remote, then tosses the 
               box and VCR into a nearby trash can.

               EXT. ARIZONA STATE PRISON - DAY

               Gin Slagel walks through the main gate of the heavily 
               fortified penitentiary, leaving a huge trail of cigarette 
               smoke.

               INT. PRISON - WAITING ROOM - DAY

               Gin Slagel sits, smoking and waiting with family members and 
               lawyers. A guard enters and motions.

                                     GUARD
                         Alright Gin, come on.

               INT. PRISON - VISITORS' ROOM - DAY

               Gin sits down in one of the booths across from a middle-aged 
               prisoner.

                                     PRISONER
                         Who are you?

                                     GIN
                         Your name Roger Merman?

                                     PRISONER
                         Yes, but --

                                     GIN
                         Doing three-to-six for embezzlement?

                         ...Many accounting questions are not 
                         cut-and-dried --

                                     GIN
                         You live at 41 Sage Terrace?

                                     PRISONER
                              (suddenly tense)
                         Is it Granma? Is my son alright?

                                     GIN
                         They're fine. Do you have any house 
                         guests?

               The man is bewildered:

                                     PRISONER
                         ...House guests?

                                     GIN
                         Thanks much for your time. God bless.

               He gets up and walks away.

                                     PRISONER
                         ...Who are you? WHO ARE YOU?

               INT. CHAMBERLAIN'S - SECURITY OFFICE - DAY

               Gin sits at his desk sucking in a Pall Mall filterless. Bob 
               Chipeska sits opposite. Finally Gin exhales like a 
               crematorium.

                                     GIN
                         Well, it's fucked.

                                     CHIPESKA
                              (hopeful)
                         ...Yeah?

                                     GIN
                         Yeah. Fucked. Frankly.

                                     CHIPESKA
                         He's...

                                     GIN
                         Clean.

                                     CHIPESKA
                              (disappointed)
                         Oh.

                                     GIN
                         As a fuckin' whistle.

                                     CHIPESKA
                         Nothing?

                                     GIN
                         No. Nothing. I mean, shit, he curses, 
                         yeah. But never around children.

                                     CHIPESKA
                         Oh.

                                     GIN
                         No criminal record, no parking tickets 
                         f'Christ's sake, no bad habits, even. 
                         Sex, yeah. But man is a sexual being.

                                     CHIPESKA
                         Yeah.

                                     GIN
                         Fuckin' Darwinian. Can't do shit 
                         about that, Jack.

                                     CHIPESKA
                         NO.

                                     GIN
                         Wouldn't want to.

                                     CHIPESKA
                         Yeah. No. Of course not. I'm not 
                         advocating celibacy.

                                     GIN
                         Hope not. End of the human fuckin' 
                         race.

                                     CHIPESKA
                         Yes.

               Gin turns one palm up.

                                     GIN
                         Fucks large women. What can I say.

               EXT. SAGUARO SQUARE MALL - PARKING LOT - DAY

               A bus clears frame, revealing the kid as he walks toward the 
               mall.

                                     VOICES
                         Loser! Dipshit!

               CLANG! The kid is hit in the head with a can again. Again, 
               no reaction.

               Someone in the group of frustrated bullies has a fresh idea:

                                     VOICE
                         Wedgie!

               Cheering, the six bullies engulf the kid.

               INT. CHAMBERLAIN'S - WINTER WONDERLAND - DAY 

               Marcus and Willie go about the business of being a Santa-Elf 
               team. Willie sees off another child,

                                     CHILD
                         Pokemon.

                                     WILLIE
                         Done.

                                     MARCUS
                         Next!

               Marcus heads to the velvet rope to find the Kid, mussed up 
               and dirty, the band of his underwear around his chest.

                                     KID
                         Santa here?

                                     MARCUS
                         Oh jeez.

               Marcus unclips the rope and the Kid approaches Willie.

                                     WILLIE
                         Is that your underwear?

                                     KID
                         Part of it.

                                     WILLIE
                         Where's the rest? Never mind. What 
                         do you want?

                                     KID
                         I was thinking I wanted a purple 
                         stuffed elephant, not pink, but now 
                         I changed my mind.

                                     WILLIE
                         What.

                                     KID
                         Now I don't want an elephant at all. 
                         I want a gorilla named Davy for 
                         beating up the skateboard kids who 
                         pull on my underwear and he could 
                         take his orders from the talking 
                         walnut so it wouldn't be my bad thing.

               Willie stares at him.

                                     WILLIE
                         ...You know when I was your age, I 
                         didn't need no fuckin' gorilla, and 
                         I wasn't any bigger than you. One 
                         day I came crying home to Dad because 
                         four kids had beat me up, and you 
                         know what he did?'

                                     KID
                         He make it all better?

                                     WILLIE
                         No. He kicked my ass. You know why?

                                     KID
                         You went bathroom on Mommy's dishes?

                                     WILLIE
                         What the fuck? No.

                                     KID
                         He try to teach you not to cry and 
                         be a man.

                                     WILLIE
                         Nope, it was because he was a mean, 
                         drunk son of a bitch. When he wasn't 
                         busy busting my ass, he was puttin' 
                         out cigarettes on my neck.

                                     KID
                         Uh-huh...

                                     WILLIE
                         The world's fuckin' unfair -- it 
                         don't give ya nothing. You can wish 
                         all you want but you gotta take what 
                         you need. Stand up for yourself... 
                         stop being such a pussy and kick 
                         those kids in the balls or something.
                              (pause)
                         Or don't, I don't give a shit. Just 
                         leave me the hell out of it.

                         Okay, go ahead...

               He slaps the Kid paternally on the ass.

                                     WILLIE

               Marcus returns to the velvet rope to find Gin Slagel waiting 
               stone-faced.

                         Open the rope there, Marcus.

               Marcus, wary, hesitates but then lets him through. As they 
               walk toward Willie:

                                     MARCUS
                         I know you?

                                     GIN
                         Not yet.

               Willie is irked by the arrival of an adult:

                                     WILLIE
                         Santa don't do grab-ass, cowboy.

                         Act natural.

                                     WILLIE
                         Huh? What?

               Gin sits on Willie's knee.

                                     WILLIE
                         ...What the fuck?!

                                     GIN
                         You are Willie Tugboat Soke and you 
                         are Marcus "The Prince" Skidmore. On 
                         Christmas Eve, you're gonna rob this 
                         store blind. What say we go somewhere 
                         private?

               INT. BLACK ANGUS BAR - NIGHT

               Willie, Marcus and Gin sit in a booth.

                                     GIN
                         Research, that's how. I'm a department 
                         store detective Sherlock, that's 
                         what I do. Seven cities in seven 
                         years. Pretty impressive. The stores 
                         change, your names change. You always 
                         get away clean. Yeah, pretty darn 
                         impressive. But let's face facts -- 
                         you all are a couple of half-bucket 
                         small-timers. Because of your physical 
                         attributes you've found a niche. I 
                         respect that. But you've also been 
                         caught. By me. So this is the way 
                         how we gonna do things. I don't want 
                         to take over, I don't even want to 
                         change your scam. Whatever you guys 
                         do, it works. All I want is a taste. 
                         When the deed is done, we part ways. 
                         I buy a ranch in Havasu, you take 
                         your little medicine show back on 
                         the road.

                                     MARCUS
                              (sighs)
                         How much?

                                     GIN
                         Half.

               Willie bolts out of his chair and grabs Gin by the neck.

                                     WILLIE
                         Now you listen here, you --

               Marcus pulls him off.

                                     MARCUS
                         Easy! Easy! Just back off, Willie. I 
                         can handle this.

               After a hard stare Willie settles back into his seat. Marcus 
               turns his attention to Gin:

                                     MARCUS
                         Okay. Thirty percent. There's three 
                         of us. Thirty percent. That's fair.

                                     GIN
                         Half.

                                     MARCUS
                         I meant thirty-three.

                                     GIN
                         Half.

                                     MARCUS
                         And a third.

                                     GIN
                         Half.

                                     MARCUS
                         Thirty-five.

                                     GIN
                         Half.

                                     MARCUS
                         Forty.

                                     GIN
                         Half.

                         Forty-two?

                         Half.

                                     MARCUS
                         Forty-two five.

                         Half.

                                     MARCUS
                         Fooooooorty... eight.

                                     GIN
                         Half.

                                     MARCUS
                         Forty-nine?

                         Half.

                                     MARCUS
                         Well...

               Marcus sighs.

                                     MARCUS
                         ...what's one point.

                                     GIN
                         Down the middle on the dough, and 
                         any merchandise you take I look over 
                         and cherry-pick.

                                     MARCUS
                         No! Money's one thing, but --

                                     GIN
                         It ain't Chinese menu, jagoff. I 
                         tell yea how the way it's gonna be. 
                         This is pricks ficks.

               Gin leaves. Marcus and Willie stare at his retreating back 
               as they talk:

                                     WILLIE
                         ...Pricks ficks?

                                     MARCUS
                         Ah, he's a fuckin' moron.

                                     WILLIE
                         Yeah, well I guess that's how you 
                         got the upper hand.

                                     MARCUS
                         Fuck you.

                                     WILLIE
                         Negotiating.

                                     MARCUS
                         Fuck you -- you don't like it, next 
                         year, fuck off. I can always get 
                         another box jockey.

                                     WILLIE
                         Yeah, and I can get another midget.

               Marcus turns to Willie:

                                     MARCUS
                         Yeah? Where? You see us hangin' off 
                         of fuckin' trees? Like fuckin' crab 
                         apples? And even if we did, you'd 
                         never front your own racket. 'Cause 
                         you got no discipline and zero fuckin' 
                         initiative. You'd fall apart without 
                         me. You're just too fuckin' pathetic --

                                     WILLIE
                         Yeah, yeah.

                                     MARCUS
                         -- too fuckin' pathetic for words, 
                         you fuckin' loser. And you fuckin' 
                         know it.

               INT. THE KID'S HOUSE - NIGHT

               Willie drags his ass through the front door, dejected.

                                     GRANDMA
                         Roger! You're home. Let me fix you 
                         some sandwiches.

               He stares at her. His gaze is far away. Finally, he seems to 
               rouse himself:

                                     WILLIE
                         Ah, fuck it.

               INT. THE KID'S HOUSE - GARAGE - NIGHT

               IN C.U. CAMERA MOVES ALONG

               a hose snaking from an exhaust pipe to the driver's window 
               which is open just far enough to admit it.

               In his Santa suit, Willie sits in the driver's seat of the 
               idling car, staring through the windshield.

               After a long beat, we hear a door opening.

               The kid stands in the doorway from the house. He looks at 
               Willie, motionless in the car.

                                     KID
                         ...Santa?

               Willie's eyes do not leave the spot in space:

                                     WILLIE
                         Yeah.

                                     KID
                         What're you doing?

                                     WILLIE
                         Ah, nothin'.

                                     KID
                         You goin' to work today?

                                     WILLIE
                         Not really.

                                     KID
                         You just gonna sit there?

                                     WILLIE
                         Yeah. Lemme alone.

               The Kid turns to go. Willie bestirs himself:

                                     WILLIE
                         -- Kid.

                                     KID
                         Yeah.

               Willie beckons him.

                                     WILLIE
                         Later today, when the paramedics 
                         come and bag up Santa...

               He displays an envelope.

                                     WILLIE
                         ...make sure the cops get this letter. 
                         It tells about all the bad things 
                         that -- that -- what the fuck happened 
                         to your eye?

               The Kid's eye is indeed black and blue. He reaches self-
               consciously up to it.

                                     KID
                         Umm...

                                     WILLIE
                         Well goddamnit...

               EXT. HILL NEAR SAGUARO SQUARE MALL - DAY

               We are pulling an eight-year-old child who rides his bicycle 
               along the sidewalk, looking off, struck by what he sees.

               He slows and then comes to a stop having pulled even with a 
               group of other children gathered on the sidewalk also looking 
               off at the same spot. They stare for a good long beat, 
               expressions rather neutral. But the sight, whatever it is, 
               holds their attention.

               Finally one in the foreground remarks:

                                     KID
                         I didn't know he did that.

               Their POV: rather distant, on a grassy hill a man in a Santa 
               suit is pounding the shit out of the bullies. One of the 
               bullies throws a punch, but Santa grabs his fist and pushes 
               him down. Santa puts his foot on another bully's butt and 
               sends him flying. After more wrestling and flinging about, 
               the bullies wind up in a heap on the ground.

               INT. CHAMBERLAIN'S - LOCKER ROOM -DAY

               Willie, a faraway look in his eye, sits on a bench near 
               Marcus, who is finishing putting on his elf outfit.

                                     WILLIE
                         I think I've turned a corner.

                              (absent)
                         Yeah? You fucking Petites now?

               Willie, dreamy, refuses to take the bait:

                                     WILLIE
                         No no. No; I beat the crap out of 
                         some kids today -- but, you know, 
                         for a purpose. It really made me 
                         feel pretty good about myself -- 
                         like I did something constructive 
                         for a change. Accomplished somethin'.

               Marcus stares at him.

                                     MARCUS
                         ...You need many years of therapy.

               INT. CHAMBERLAIN'S - MAIN FLOOR - FURS - DAY

               Lois, her face set in pruney disapproval, flips slowly through 
               a rack of furs.

               A salesman approaches from behind her. She somehow senses 
               his presence; without bothering to look around she murmurs:

                                     LOIS
                         Just looking...

               INT. THE KID'S HOUSE - NIGHT

               Willie and Sue come in, carrying a few bottles of liquor.

               Willie closes the door, and freezes, realizing that something 
               is wrong.

                                     WILLIE
                         ...Hello?

               Nothing.

                                     WILLIE
                         ...Granma?

               He hears the TV and heads for the living room. Sue follows a 
               few steps behind.

               Willie finds Grandma in her chair, not moving.

                                     WILLIE
                         Granma...

               He strains through the dim light for any evidence of life.

                                     WILLIE
                         ...Oh jeez.

               He lets out a sigh and leans in close to listen to her heart.

                                     SUE
                         Oh my God...

                                     GRANDMA
                         Roger!

               Willie jumps and screams like a girl.

                                     GRANDMA
                         ...You're home. Let me fix you some 
                         sandwiches.

               She gets up and heads for the kitchen as Willie tries to 
               compose himself.

                                     WILLIE
                              (holding his chest)
                         No thanks.

               INT. THE KID'S HOUSE - KID'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

               The Kid sleeps. He is awakened by the sounds of stumbling 
               and CLANKING BOTTLES. He hears GIGGLING, more STUMBLING. He 
               gets up.

               INT. THE'KID'S HOUSE - HALLWAY - NIGHT

               The Kid discovers some clothes. Then some more. He follows 
               the trail of clothes towards the sounds coming from the Master 
               Bedroom.

               INT. THE KID'S HOUSE - MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT

               Facing the CAMERA, Willie's in his underpants and Santa hat 
               lying on the floor on top of Sue. He's gripping her panties 
               with his teeth -- stretching the elastic while he starts 
               pulling them down. Sue's giggling.

               The bedroom door opens behind them and the Kid walks in. He 
               comes up and stands over them, a few steps behind Willie.

               Willie freezes, panty elastic waistband still stretched out 
               in his teeth. He senses something, and his eyes look up from 
               under his Santa hat, his wolfish smile fades.

               The Kid stands there, hands behind his back.

                                     SUE
                              (lifting her head up)
                         Hello little boy.

                                     KID
                         Hello. Santa?

                                     WILLIE
                              (frozen; teeth still 
                              gripping panties)
                         ...yes?

                                     KID
                         I know that Christmas Eve is in a 
                         couple days and you have to fly around 
                         and give presents to the world and 
                         after that you won't be around no 
                         more.

                                     WILLIE
                         ...Yes?

                                     KID
                         So I thought I'd give you your present 
                         now.

               The Kid takes his hands from behind his back and extends a 
               small present in crudely taped-up wrapping paper.

               This forces Willie to let go of the panties. They SNAP back.

               He sits up. He takes the gift and opens it. Inside is a 
               roughly whittled crescent of brown wood.

                                     WILLIE
                              (mumble)
                         What the fuck is it?

                                     KID
                         A wooden pickle.

               Willie stares at it.

                                     WILLIE
                         Why'd you paint it brown?

                                     KID
                         Not paint. It's blood from when I 
                         cut my hand when I was making it for 
                         you.

               Willie stares at it.

                                     WILLIE
                         ...Thanks.

                                     KID
                         You're welcome. Good night Santa. 
                         Good night Mrs. Santa's sister.

               He leaves.

               Willie still stares at the gift. Sue is looking where the 
               Kid exited.

                                     SUE
                         That was very nice. He's really a 
                         nice kid, isn't he?

               She goes back to grabbing him passionately.

               Willie has trouble speaking.

                                     WILLIE
                         Hold on a minute.

                                     SUE
                         What?

                                     WILLIE
                         Nothin'... it's just... I'm... well... 
                         I'm sorta... fucking... touched.

               He looks from the wooden pickle up to Sue, his eyes brim, 
               and he starts weeping.

                                     WILLIE
                         ...I don't know if I can fuck...

               Sue hugs him and strokes his hair.

                                     SUE
                         That's okay. That's okay.

               Willie abjectly bawls:

                                     WILLIE
                         BABY, I DON'T KNOW IF I CAN FUCK!

                                     SUE
                         There, there... There, there...

               INT. THE KID'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - MORNING

               Willie, hungover, half-dressed in his Santa outfit for work.

               He fumbles in the refrigerator for some orange juice.

               The Kid comes up behind him clutching a document.

                                     KID
                         SANTA!

               Willie jumps with a start.

                                     KID
                         You wanna see my report card?

               Willie takes the report card as he tries to compose himself.

               He looks at it. All C's and one B.

                                     KID
                         Think I did good?

               Willie's eyes drift back to the card and settle on COMMENTS.

               They read, "Thurman has an active, inquiring mind. And no 
               friends."

                                     WILLIE
                         Who the fuck is Thurman? This is 
                         you? Your name's Thurman?

                                     KID
                         Yeah.

                                     WILLIE
                              (incredulous)
                         Thurman Merman?!

                                     KID
                         Yeah.

                                     WILLIE
                         Jesus.

                                     KID
                              (back to the report 
                              card)
                         You think I did good?

               Willie does not want to engage.

                                     WILLIE
                         Whaddya you care what I think, anyway?
                              (pause, relenting a 
                              bit)
                         What do I fuckin' know? Better than 
                         I ever did. I never got any B's,

                                     KID
                         I thought maybe since at least I did 
                         good in school, you'll bring me a 
                         present this year. 'Cause last 
                         Christmas and the one before that 
                         you didn't bring no presents...

               This is a lot for Willie to hear.

                                     WILLIE
                         Oh...

                                     KID
                         ...Even though I'm a dipshit loser.

                                     WILLIE
                              (a beat, then explodes)
                         Jesus Fucking Christ, Kid! Why do 
                         talk about yourself like that? What 
                         the fuck is that about?! What's with 
                         you anyway? I ain't Fucking Santa 
                         Claus! Look at me, I am living fucking 
                         proof that there ain't no Santa Claus!

               Pause.

                                     KID
                         I know there's no Santa. I just 
                         thought maybe you'd wanna give me a 
                         present 'cause we're friends.

                                     WILLIE
                         Oh...

               An uncomfortable silence. Willie is most uncomfortable.

                                     WILLIE
                              (pause, then sincerely 
                              to the kid)
                         Look, kicking the shit out of those 
                         kids, that's as generous as I can 
                         get.

               The Kid just nods and doesn't say anything. Willie can't 
               take it.

                                     WILLIE
                         JESUS FUCKING CHRIST, I GOTTA GO TO 
                         WORK!

               Willie runs out of the room very upset,

               INT. THE KID'S HOUSE - FOYER - MORNING

               Willie grabs a bottle of whiskey off the counter and hurries 
               out, slamming the door.

               INT. CHAMBERLAIN'S - WINTER WONDERLAND - DAY

               Marcus checks his watch impatiently as the endless line of 
               excited children and their parents impatiently murmurs.

               The tension is suffocating Marcus. Finally, a gasp goes up 
               from the crowd.

               Marcus looks up to see Willie, totally shit-faced. His costume 
               is half on, his undergarments are showing, and his hand 
               clutches the neck of a broken bottle.

                                     MARCUS
                         No.

               Willie stumbles over a burro and falls into a pile of fake 
               snow. He rises to his feet and begins to pummel the statue.

                                     WILLIE
                         You fuckin' spic!

               Children scream in horror as mothers cover their eyes.

               Gin enters the Wonderland and takes in the spectacle.

                                     GIN
                         Sweet Jews for Jesus...

               Willie finishes dispatching the burro and stumbles to his 
               Santa chair. Marcus stomps up to him.

                                     MARCUS
                         Holy motherfuck. What do you think 
                         you're doing?

                                     WILLIE
                              (sobbing)
                         I pissed my pants!

               Marcus pounces on him.

                                     MARCUS
                         You son of a bitch!

               Gin pulls Marcus off.

                                     GIN
                         Alright, let's get him out of here. 
                         I'll go smooth this over with 
                         Chipeska. Food poisoning, something.

               The two men face each other, their voices rising. Beyond 
               them we see the line of children staring at them.

                                     MARCUS
                         What do you mean, get him out of 
                         here?

                                     GIN
                         Take him to his car.

                                     MARCUS
                         In case you hadn't noticed, I'm a 
                         motherfuckin' dwarf. So unless you 
                         got a forklift handy, maybe you should 
                         lend a hand.

                                     GIN
                         That figures, you wantin' all kinds 
                         of set-asides and special treatment 
                         'cause of your handicap. You're all 
                         the same.

                                     MARCUS
                         Special treatment? I'm three fucking 
                         feet tall, asshole -- it's a matter 
                         of physics! Draw me a sketch how I 
                         get him to the car!

               Gin notices the line of kids staring. He puts up a sign that 
               reads: "Santa Has Gone To Feed His Reindeer. He'll be back 
               soon".

                                     GIN
                         Bitch, bitch.

                                     MARCUS
                         Sketch it up, fuckin' moron. Fuckin' 
                         Leonardo da Vinci.

                                     GIN
                         What did you call me, thigh-high?

                                     MARCUS
                         I called you a fuckin' guinea Homo. 
                         From the fifteenth fuckin' century.

                                     GIN
                         I could stick you up my ass, smallfry.

                                     MARCUS
                         Yeah? You sure it ain't too sore 
                         from last night?

                                     GIN
                         You got some lip on you, midget.

                                     MARCUS
                         Well it was on your wife's pussy 
                         last night. Why don't you dust that 
                         thing once in a while. Asshole.

               INT. MARCUS' VAN - PARKING LOT - DUSK

               Marcus sits with Lois in the van staking out the door to 
               Chamberlain's, waiting for Gin to leave.

               INT. CHAMBERLAIN'S - WINTER WONDERLAND - DUSK

               WILLIE sleeps it off behind a flimsy cardboard set.

               INT. MARCUS' VAN - PARKING LOT - DUSK

               Marcus and Lois continue their stake-out.

               We see Gin exit the store and head for his car.

                                     MARCUS
                         There he is... that lousy, 
                         leatherfaced, dago motherfucker...

               EXT. QUIET ROAD - NIGHT

               Marcus stands by the side of his van. It's parked on the 
               shoulder with the hood up, jumper cables attached and hanging. 
               Lois is in the driver's seat.

               Gin's Ford 4 X 4 speeds around the corner and Marcus flags 
               him down.

               SCREEEEECH! Gin slams on the brakes, then backs up and pulls 
               over. He emerges from the 4 X 4 with road rage on full brew, 
               and strides over to the van.

                                     GIN
                         Jesus, Mother Mary and Joseph! What 
                         in the name of the holy lord Fuck is 
                         the problem now?

                                     MARCUS
                         Sorry, the van stalled. Give us a 
                         jump will ya?

                                     GIN
                         Well, I'll be dipped in dogshit!... 
                         What am I, your auto mechanic now?

               He shakes his head in disgust. Grumbling, he goes back to 
               the 4 X 4 and drives it into position. He gets out and raises 
               the hood.

               The two vehicles face each other nose-to-nose, several feet 
               apart as Gin opens the hood.

                                     GIN
                              (motions to his battery)
                         Help yourself, small fry.

               Marcus seems to have a little difficulty reaching the battery 
               terminals.

                                     MARCUS
                         It's hard for me to reach...

               Gin grabs the cables from him. Marcus takes a few steps back.

                                     GIN
                         Jesus Christ, give me those!

                                     MARCUS
                         Thanks.

               Gin attaches the cables.

                                     GIN
                              (then, to Lois)
                         Alright, TRY IT!

               Lois turns the key and the van starts right up. Gin takes 
               the cables off the van and closes the hood. He lights up a 
               Pall Mall.

               Marcus signals to Lois. She puts the car into gear and stomps 
               her foot on the accelerator, squashing Gin between the two 
               vehicles.

               ANGLE PROM INSIDE VAN (SLOW MOTION):

               Gin's face as it's squooshed up against the van's windshield.

               A cloud of cigarette smoke escapes his lips.

               Lois continues to step on the gas, trying to crush him.

               ANGLE ON: the tires spinning in the gravel.

               Finally, she takes her foot off the gas. The van eases back.

               Gin falls to the ground with a groan. Marcus steps up and 
               leans over him.

                                     MARCUS
                         Oh my, what a terrible accident!

                                     LOIS
                         Is he dead?

                                     MARCUS
                         No, but it looks like you broke most 
                         of his ribs.

               Then, leaning down to Gin.

                                     MARCUS
                              (for Gin's benefit)
                         I'd say maybe... fifty percent of 
                         them? Or do you think thirty percent?

                                     LOIS
                         I needed more of a running start -- 
                         I couldn't build up any speed.

               Marcus paces around trying to figure out what to do next.

                                     MARCUS
                              (shaking his head in 
                              dismay)
                         Motherfuck!

               He grabs the jumper cables still connected to Gin's 4 X 4 
               and clamps the other ends on Gin's ears. A small jolt and a 
               spark or two. Only a minor shock.

                                     MARCUS
                         Shit!

               He grabs Gin's arm and with great effort drags him over a 
               few feet so that his head is positioned behind the front 
               tire of the van. Gin tries to crawl out of the way.

               ANGLE ON: Gin's feet slipping on the gravel.

                                     MARCUS
                         Put it in reverse.

               ANGLE ON: shift level moving into REVERSE.

               ANGLE ON: Lois' foot stepping on the gas pedal.

               WIDER: Lois drives backwards. There's a bump and the sound 
               of a dull POP.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. CHAMBERLAIN'S - WINTER WONDERLAND - NEXT DAY

               CLOSE-UP: A large bubble gum bubble pops.

               Willie, in a self-medicated stupor, barely managing to hold 
               a wailing toddler on his lap. Bubble gum is all over the 
               Kid's face.

                                     WILLIE
                         'Tendo it is.

               He passes the child off to Marcus, who holds it as Willie 
               gazes off and murmurs;

                                     WILLIE
                         ...Everything I touch turns to shit 
                         and dies.

               Marcus, still holding the child, quickly glances around, and 
               then hisses into Willie's ear:

                                     MARCUS
                         What are you, drinking Sterno now? 
                         'Cause you're sounding like my Aunt 
                         Tilly right before she smeared her 
                         own shit on the bedroom walls and we 
                         had to lock her up and she spent the 
                         rest of her life with a shaved head 
                         and eating lunch through a tube up 
                         her nose...

               Willie continues to stare, head swaying.

                                     MARCUS
                         ...You better be in shape by this 
                         evening, fat man. After tonight, I 
                         don't give a shit. But this is the 
                         time to reach deep down and suck it 
                         up.

               Marcus hands the kid to his Mother. He smiles warmly.

                                     MARCUS
                         ...Lovely boy.

               INT. SAGUARO SQUARE MALL - NIGHT

               "Jolly Old Saint Nicholas" plays as a buzzing throng of people 
               crams the mall.

               One current in this sea of humanity flows into the bedecked 
               entrance of Chamberlain's Department Store.

               INT. CHAMBERLAIN'S - ENTRANCE - NIGHT

               Jesse the security guard is at his post near the doors to 
               the parking lot. He smiles and waves farewell to departing 
               shoppers.

                                     INTERCOM (V.O.)
                         Attention shoppers, the store will 
                         be closing in five minutes. We wish 
                         you all a Merry Christmas, Happy 
                         Chanukah and a joyous Kwanza.

               Behind Jesse, in Men's Wear, is Lois, wearing a frown of 
               pruney disapproval. Seeing that he's not looking, she 
               inexplicably nudges a table of sweaters a few feet over.

               SQUEEEEEEEAK! The table makes a loud noise, but it's too 
               chaotic on the floor for anyone to notice. Satisfied with 
               her placement of the table, Lois heads out the door.

               INT. CHAMBERAIN'S - WINTER WONDERLAND - NIGHT

               Bleary-eyed Willie puts down a little girl and she happily 
               scampers off.

                                     WILLIE
                         Barbie it is...

               Willie turns to Marcus.

                                     WILLIE
                         ...That it?

               Marcus moves the backdrop to reveal the air vent.

                                     MARCUS
                         Let's go.

               Willie cracks open an ampule of Amyl Nitrate and inhales 
               deeply. Marcus grimaces:

                                     MARCUS
                         ...Oh Christ.

                                     WILLIE
                              (red-faced, holding 
                              breath)
                         Let's do it.

               INT. CHAMBERLAIN'S - MAIN FLOOR - NIGHT

               With the sound of closing circuits, banks of light 
               systematically shut down in the various departments of the 
               now empty.store.

               INT. CHAMBERLAIN'S - ENTRANCE - NIGHT

               Exhausted employees file out of the store past Jesse.

               Eventually Willie emerges.

                                     JESSE
                         Merry Christmas, Willie.

                                     WILLIE
                         Up your ass.

               Jesse heads for the alarm panel near the doorway and punches 
               the key labeled ARM. An LED readout labeled ARMING counts 
               down from 30 seconds.

               Jesse exits the store, locking the door and heading home.

               INT. CHAMBERLAIN'S - CUSTOMER SERVICE OFFICES - NIGHT

               The cubicles are now empty and the office is still, but we 
               hear dwarf-shimmy in the ducts overhead.

               INT. CHAMBERLAIN'S ENTRANCE - NIGHT

               By the front door, the alarm continues to count down -- 25...

               INT. CHAMBERLAIN'S - AIR DUCT - NIGHT

               Marcus arrives at the vent above the surveillance room. He 
               reaches in his pocket, pulls out the remote control Lois 
               bought, and aims it down into the room.

               INT. CHAMBERLAIN'S - AIR DUCT - NIGHT

               Marcus arrives at the precipice of a descending duct. He 
               snaps on a biking helmet and takes a deep breath.

                                     MARCUS
                         All right...

               He dives down the duct.

               INT. CHAMBERLAIN'S - AIR DUCTS - NIGHT

               We PAN and WHIP-PIVOT along the outside of several lengths 
               of ductwork, following the muffled SCREAM of a thousand 
               girlies echoing inside.

               The ductwork dimples out along the bottom with the WUBBA 
               sound of flopping aluminum as Marcus's weight travels its 
               length; at turns, Marcus's inertial force makes one side of 
               the duct momentarily dent out.

               We thus follow Marcus's progress as he slides, bumps, 
               ricochets and barrels through the department store.

               INT. CHAMBERLAIN'S - MAIN FLOOR - ENTRANCE - NIGHT

               As the alarm continues to count down, 12... 11... a distant

               scream grows louder until --

               -- in nearby Men's Wear, the vent in the 30-foot ceiling 
               bursts open and --

               -- Marcus drops from the duct.

               THUD! He lands on the table of sweaters placed by Lois.

               In a split-second, he sits up and looks at the alarm box.

               7... 6...

               He hops off the table and pushes it toward the alarm box.

               5... 4... 

               The far side of the table smashes into the wall beneath the 
               alarm box.

               Marcus kicks out the collapsible legs on the near side, making 
               that edge of the table crash to the ground, creating a ramp.

               He sprints away from the table spins, and runs back towards 
               it...

               3... 2... 

               He runs up the ramp and --

               1... 

               -- leaps and slaps the CANCEL button -- just in time.

               INT. CHAMBERLAIN'S - OFFICES - NIGHT

               DING! Elevator doors open to reveal Willie and Marcus holding 
               sections of the disassembled water drill.

               INT. CHAMBERLAIN'S - ACCOUNTING OFFICE - NIGHT

               The lights flicker on in the accounting office as Willie and 
               Marcus wheel the water drill over to the safe. Once they get 
               it there:

                                     WILLIE
                         Oh shit...

                                     MARCUS
                         What? What-What-WHAT-WHAT?

                                     WILLIE
                         It's a Kitnerboy Redoubt.

                                     MARCUS
                         So?

               Willie stares at the safe.

                                     WILLIE
                         ...You know Andy Pitts?

                                     MARCUS
                         Yeah, Andy Pizzarelli?

                                     WILLIE
                         No, Andy Lapitski. Andy Pizzarelli 
                         is Andy Blue Balls.

                                     MARCUS
                         Huh-uh, since he got married they 
                         call him An -- WHAT'S YOUR FUCKING 
                         POINT?

                                     WILLIE
                         Andy Lapitski can get into anything. 
                         Anything. They say he's been in 
                         Margaret Thatcher's pussy.

                                     MARCUS
                         Yeah? YEAH?

                                     WILLIE
                         In the joint he told me that the 
                         Kitnerboy...

               He nods at the safe.

                                     WILLIE
                         ...cannot be cracked.

                                     MARCUS
                         ARE YOU FUCKIN' SHITTIN' ME?! Are 
                         you tellin' me after I've propped 
                         you up and held you together and 
                         smiled for all those kids and danced 
                         for all those fucking housewives in 
                         a fucking lime-green fucking velvet 
                         elf costume YOU CANNOT GET IN THAT 
                         FUCKING SAFE? ARE YOU FUCKING TELLING 
                         ME THAT?

               Willie continues to stare at the safe. He licks his lips.

                                     WILLIE
                         No... I'm saying it's gonna take me 
                         a minute.

               INT. CHAMBERLAIN'S - MONTAGE - NIGHT

               Willie stares at the safe while rubbing sandpaper to his 
               fingertips.

               Meanwhile, Marcus emerges from a stockroom with a cart to 
               begin his shopping spree.

               Willie applies a stethoscope to the safe, tapping with one 
               hand and listening intently.

               Marcus starts in Ladies' Accessories, finding the cashmere 
               scarf.

               Willie applies the drill to the safe.

               Marcus makes his way through Lingerie.

               Willie pulls back the drill. The bit is trashed, the safe is 
               completely unscathed.

               Marcus is in Shoes picking out pumps for Lois.

               Willie is in Home Improvement, flipping tools off the shelves 
               into a cart of his own.

               Marcus is in Evening Wear, jumping to try to pull a stole 
               off a mannequin.

               Willie batters a chisel into the seam of the safe door.

               Marcus continues to leap at the mannequin.

               Willie is atop the safe, swinging a sledgehammer at the lock.

               Marcus swings at the mannequin's knees with a golf club.

               Willie uses a plasma welder on the safe.

               Marcus, having chopped down the mannequin, drags off its 
               stole.

               Willie is back over the safe, battering it with the 
               sledgehammer, roaring with each swing.

               Marcus is in Housewares pilfering crock pots.

               Willie, sweating, drops the sledgehammer clanking to the 
               floor. Wiping his forehead, he circles the safe. When he 
               gets to the back of the safe he stops, thinks.

               Marcus is in Home Entertainment grabbing a stereo.

               Willie is hunched at the back of the safe, stethoscope to 
               its surface, giving exploratory taps with two knuckles.

               Sound perspective through the stethoscope: hollow THUNKS 
               followed by an unnaturally loud and present CREEEEEEEEAK.

               Willie reacts quizzically. After a considering moment he 
               rises. we can see, on the far side of the safe, its door as 
               it finishes creaking open.

               Marcus enters the room. Willie looks at him.

                                     WILLIE
                         Piece of cake.

               Marcus starts removing stacks of cash and loading them into 
               the Santa sack. Willie wipes sweat off his forehead.

                                     WILLIE
                         ...I'll be right back. I gotta grab 
                         one thing.

               INT. CHAMBERLAN'S - TOY DEPT. - NIGHT

               We are looking at a big, fuzzy, smiling, pink stuffed 
               elephant.

               Willie's hand hesitates between this elephant and the one 
               behind, which is purple. We hear him muttering:

                                     WILLIE
                         Shit... which did he say?

               The hand finally leaves with the purple elephant.

               We hold for a long beat.

               The hand reenters to put back the purple and take the pink.

               Willie turns around holding the stuffed elephant.

               Marcus and Lois are standing there presenting a grotesque 
               picture: Lois has a shopping cart filled with shoes, scarves, 
               jewels, a salad spinner, purses, a block of Ginsu knives, an 
               abdomen exerciser. She wears a pair of sunglasses from which 
               a price tag dangles, and a long ermine stole.

               Next to her Marcus holds the Santa bag bulging with -- indeed, 
               sprouting -- cash.

                                     WILLIE
                         Well, I don't think that store dick 
                         is gonna want this.

                                     MARCUS
                         Store dick don't want shit.

               Something in this picture makes Willie uneasy. He licks his 
               lips.

                                     WILLIE
                         Wuddya mean, fucking guy's greedier 
                         than...

               He pauses, searching.

                                     WILLIE
                         ...greedier than fuck.

               Marcus and Lois are statues, staring at him.

                                     MARCUS
                         Store dick dead. Store dick don't 
                         want shit.

               A long silence.

                                     MARCUS
                         ...Fuck the fuckin' store dick.

               Willie's tone is wooden:

                                     WILLIE
                         Dead, huh...

               Again, he licks his lips.

                                     WILLIE
                         ...I didn't even know he was sick.

               Marcus flicks his coat front away and pulls a .45 out of his 
               waistband.

                                     MARCUS
                         Willie. This has been a long time 
                         comin'.

                                     WILLIE
                         Uh-huh.

                                     MARCUS
                         Every year you're worse. Every year, 
                         less reliable. More booze. More 
                         bullshit. More butt-fucking.

                                     WILLIE
                         Sure. The three B'a.

                                     MARCUS
                         You gotta be able to rely, Willie.

               He primes the gun. Willie murmurs, more in sadness than in 
               fear:

                                     WILLIE
                         You're monsters.

               Marcus points the gun.

                                     MARCUS
                         Believe me, Willie: there's no joy 
                         in this for me.

                                     WILLIE
                         Oh, I don't mean layin' me out. I 
                         understand that. But just look at 
                         ya. All the shit... grabbin' all 
                         this shit -- do you really need all 
                         this junk? ...This is Christmas?

               Marcus sneers:

                                     MARCUS
                         Oh please. Don't gimme that trite 
                         "commercialism" crap. This is what 
                         we do, Willie. We get the shit. 
                         Christmas time, we get the shit. 
                         Because we are men. And Lois. It is 
                         Christmas, Willie, and we are men, 
                         and Lois.

               A silence.

                                     LOIS
                         ...Wuddya waitin' for, honey? Plug 
                         him.

               Marcus sighs.

                                     MARCUS
                         Good-bye, Willie.

               He aims. Willie squeezes his eyes shut.

               From nowhere:

                                     MEGAPHONE VOICE (O.S.)
                         Drop the gun, munchkin!

                                     MARCUS
                         Huh? !

               CLACK CLACK CLACK CLACK CLACK -- the sound of many guns 
               priming.

               Police everywhere.

                                     MEGAPHONE VOICE
                         And you, Santa! -- drop the elephant!

               Willie stares. Marcus looks wildly around.

                                     MARCUS
                         ...Where did you come from?

                                     CHIEF
                         Tipped off.

                                     WILLIE
                         Shit!

               CAMERA TRACKS IN ON HIS FACE

               Willie slaps his forehead.

                                     WILLIE
                         ...Fuckin' kid!

                                     CHIEF
                         All three of you are in so much shit 
                         it's almost unbelievable.

                                     LOIS
                         Gevalt.

                                     MARCUS
                         Oh yeah? Well come'n get us, coppers! 
                         Ha-ha-ha-ha!

               BANG! BANG! BANG!

               His .45 roars.

               The cops return fire.

                                     WILLIE
                         Fuck me...

               He ducks, clutching the elephant to his chest, and scurries 
               behind a counter.

                                     WILLIE
                         ...fuck me fuck me fuck me...

               Gunfire fills the air.

               Exploding merchandise chases along the counter behind Willie 
               as the cops seek to put him down.

               Under the gunfire we hear Marcus's maniacal laughter.

               Willie reaches the end of the counter. A brief open space 
               separates him from a stairwell; he dashes across as gunfire 
               redoubles and plunges down the stairs.

               EXT. CHAMBERLAIN'S - LOADING DOCK - NIGHT

               Willie bursts out onto the loading dock still holding the 
               elephant. He dives into his Mercedes and peels out.

               EXT. SAGUARO SQUARE MALL - PARKING LOT - NIGHT

               Rounding the corner of the loading dock, Willie comes upon a 
               fleet of squad cars idling in the street. Cops yell, draw 
               their guns and fire as Willie clips a couple cars, skids and 
               slues, and finally is clear of the pack.

               He roars up the road as policemen leap for their vehicles, 
               crank up their sirens and pursue.

               INT. MERCEDES - MOVING - NIGHT

               Willie drives, his jaw set, a desperate man in a Santa suit.

               He glances up at the rearview which shows many flashing light 
               bars.

                                     WILLIE
                         ...It's Christmas... and the fucking 
                         kid is getting his present.

               EXT. THE KID'S HOUSE - NEIGHBORHOOD - NIGHT

               Willie's car corners onto Sage Terrace on two wheels, slams 
               back down onto four, fishtails up to the kid's house and 
               squeals braking into its driveway.

               The police vehicles, in hot pursuit, squeal, skid, and slew 
               around in a jumble at the foot of the lawn. Cops leap out of 
               their cars just as Willie jumps from his.

                                     MEGAPHONE VOICE
                         Halt, put your hands up!

               Willie is sprinting up the walk toward the front door. His 
               voice echoes lone and weak after the boom of the megaphone:

                                     WILLIE
                         Up your ass!

               He bounds up the stoop.

                                     POLICE VOICE
                         All right, boys -- nail him!

               A ripple of gunfire.

               At the top of the stoop, facing the door, Willie staggers, 
               rolls his eyes, and -- drops.

               NEARBY WINDOW

               Drawn by the noise, an adorable six-year-old in a nearby 
               house slides open his second-story bedroom window to look.

               HIS HIGH POV:

               Frozen in a semi-circle at the foot of the neighboring lawn, 
               an army of cops has guns trained on the felled Santa Claus, 
               who is sprawled on the neighbor's stoop, motionless. His 
               hand stretches toward the front door holding a fluffy pink 
               elephant un-delivered...

               The six year old draws in his breath and SCREAMS.

               He is joined by his equally adorable little brother and sister 
               who look, and SCREAM, with him.

               Somewhere, a neighborhood dog barks.

               A Cop looks up at the window and the three shrieking children.

                                     COP
                         Somebody put a zipper on those fuckin' 
                         kids!

                                                                  FADE OUT:

               INT. THE KID'S HOUSE - DAY

               After a long beat, Willie's voice:

                                     WILLIE (V.O.)
                         Dear kid. I hope that you got my 
                         present and that there wasn't too 
                         much blood on it, although there was 
                         blood on the present you gave me 
                         which didn't keep me from enjoying 
                         it, so maybe the blood doesn't matter 
                         so much I guess.

               We are FADING IN on a shelf in the Kid's bedroom where the 
               stuffed elephant sits, in a place of honor, its fur indeed 
               stiff and stained with dried blood. The Kid's bedroom is no 
               longer in disarray, things are neat and comfy. We PAN OFF of 
               it to find this letter, crudely handwritten, tacked up on a 
               little bulletin board.

                                     WILLIE (V.O.)
                         ...Anyway, just in case they took it 
                         as evidence I am also sending you a 
                         T-shirt. I hope it's the right size. 
                         I am healing up good and they tell 
                         me that I will soon be one hundred 
                         percent even with eight bullets dug 
                         out of me because they didn't hit 
                         any vital organs, just my liver which 
                         is fucked anyway, ha-ha-ha. Anyways...

               Our CONTINUING PAN brings us to the open door of the bedroom 
               and we hear the sound of the TV in the living room. We TRACK 
               toward it.

                                     WILLIE (V.O.)
                         ...Thank you for giving that letter 
                         to the cops. I forgot I asked you to 
                         do it but it's a good thing you did 
                         or Santa's little helper would've 
                         plugged his ass. And now the cops 
                         know I wrote it, which is gonna keep 
                         my ass out of jail. That, plus 
                         everyone agreeing that the Phoenix 
                         police department shooting an unarmed 
                         Santa was even more fucked-up than 
                         Rodney King. The cops are treating 
                         me like fucking royalty now which is 
                         new in my experience. They are gonna 
                         make me a sensitivity counselor so 
                         that tragedies like this will never 
                         again embarrass the whole fucking 
                         department. Whatever.

               Grandma is in the living room watching TV. We TRACK past her 
               towards the Jacuzzi area.

                                     WILLIE
                         ...As for my little helper, I am 
                         sorry to have to tell you that him 
                         and his prune-faced mail-order-wife 
                         are gonna be exploring mountains 
                         with your dad. I hope your dad doesn't 
                         go sucking shit from them like I 
                         did. Meanwhile, I told the cops you 
                         had no one to take the fuck care of 
                         you, so they set it up with Mrs. 
                         Santa's sister watching you till 
                         your Dad gets back in one year and 
                         three months. They made her a Guardian 
                         Pro-Temp or some such shit... anyway, 
                         she makes better money than bartending 
                         and seems to like you and your house 
                         and Jacuzzi.

               Sue is in a towel, holding a highball as she climbs out of 
               the Jacuzzi. The Kid walks by her carrying a bucket. She 
               tousles his hair affectionately as he goes by. He's never 
               looked better.

               WE TRACK TOWARDS THE FOYER. It's empty but the front door is 
               open. We TRACK towards it.

               We go out the front door...

                                     WILLIE (V.O.)
                         ...So I'll be staying in Phoenix 
                         now, telling the police how screwed-
                         up they are which is not a bad job 
                         as jobs go. They're supposed to let 
                         me out of this hospital room soon so 
                         I'll see you when I come over to 
                         fuck Mrs. Santa's sister in the 
                         Jacuzzi. Until then, don't take no 
                         shit from nobody. Least of all 
                         yourself. Anyways... see ya soon...

               The Kid is dipping a toilet-bowl brush into a bucket of soapy 
               water on the front stoop.

                                     WILLIE (V.O.)
                         ...Santa.

               As the Kid turns and hunkers down to scrub the dried blood 
               off the stoop, we see the back of his T-shirt. SHIT HAPPENS 
               WHEN YOU PARTY NAKED.

                                                                  FADE OUT:

                                         THE END
BADLANDS

Final Version
Dialogue and Continuity



FADE IN


INT. BEDROOM 

The time is 1959. HOLLY SARGIS, the 15-year-old heroine, sits on 
her bed, petting her dog. The CAMERA DOLLIES BACK as she talks on 
VOICE OVER. 

HOLLY (v.o.)
My mother died of pneumonia when I was just a kid. My father had 
kept their wedding cake in the freezer for ten whole years. After 
the funeral he gave it to the yardman... He tried to act 
cheerful, but he could never be consoled by the little stranger 
he found in his house. Then, one day, hoping to begin a new life 
away from the scene of all his memories, he moved us from Texas 
to Ft. Dupree, South Dakota.

HOLD on FULL SHOT of bedroom. 

DISSOLVE TO


EXT. ALLEYS AND STREETS - SERIES OF ANGLES - DAWN 

The streets and alleys of Ft. Dupree at dawn. On sound we hear 
the clucking of DOVES. A garbage truck appears. Details of the 
mechanisms at the back of the truck. 

NEW ANGLE 

KIT CARRUTHERS, the hero, a 25-year-old garbageman, kneels beside 
a dead dog. He inspects it briefly. then looks back at his friend 
and co-worker, CATO, a stocky man in his forties. 

KIT
I'll give you a dollar to eat this collie.

Cato inspects the dog. 

CATO
I'm not going to eat him for a dollar... I don't think he's a 
collie, either. Some kind of dog.

They drive off. 

KIT
Watch your heads.

NEW ANGLE 

The truck comes to a stop. Kit bangs on the driver's door. 

KIT
Hey. Woody. Gimme a cigarette.

WOODY waves him off. Kit shrugs to Cato. 

KIT
Woody wouldn't give me a cigarette. (pause) Ever notice he don't 
talk much?

Cato agrees with this. They make a terrible racket, with no 
regard for the sleep of the neighbors. 

EXT. STREET 

Holly, whispering some rhyme to herself, twirls a baton in the 
middle of an empty street. 

HOLLY (v.o.)
Little did I realize that what began in the alleys and back ways 
of this quiet town would end in the Badlands of Montana.

EXT. ALLEY 

Kit tries to sell a passing BUM a pair of shoes. 

BUM
Nah. they wouldn't fit.

KIT
How do you know? You hadn't tried them on yet.

BUM
Nah.

KIT
Gimme a dollar for them... Cost twenty new.

The Bum walks off. Kit pitches the shoes to Cato. 

KIT
Why don't you see if they fit you?

Cato picks them up and looks at them. 

CLOSE ON TRASH CAN 

Kit is culling through a trash can, looking for valuables. 
reading other people's mail, etc. 

KIT (o.c.)
This lady don't ever pay her bills. She's gonna get in trouble if 
she doesn't watch out.

Cato, ignoring him, picks up a magazine that is lying in the 
grass. When the CAMERA returns to Kit, he has stripped off his 
apron. 

KIT
I throwed enough trash for today, Cato.... I'll see you In the 
morning.

He slaps Cato on the back and walks off. Cato throws a mouldy 
loaf of bread at his back. 

CATO
Catch!

KIT
What do you mean?

He throws the loaf back at Cato. 

EXT. ALLEYS 

Kit walks through the deserted alleys of the sleeping town... as 
the MAIN TITLES APPEAR. He balances a stolen mop on his finger; 
he stomps a can and looks around to see if anyone has spotted him 
at this. As the CREDITS end he sees Holly in front of her house 
twirling her baton. He crosses the street and introduces himself. 

EXT. FRONT LAWN 

KIT
Hi, I'm Kit. I'm not keeping you from anything important, am I?

HOLLY
No.

KIT
Well, I was just messing around over there, thought I'd come over 
and say hello to you. (smiling) I'll try anything once. (pause) 
What's your name? I said mine.

HOLLY
Holly.

KIT
Listen, Holly. you want to take a walk with me?

HOLLY
What for?

KIT
Well. I got some stuff to say. Guess I'm kind of lucky that way. 
Most people don't have anything on their minds, do they?

Holly eyes him suspiciously. 

EXT. STREET 

They walk down the middle of the street. Holly has accepted his 
offer. 

KIT
Oh, incidentally, my last name is Carruthers. Sounds a little too 
much like druthers, doesn't it?

HOLLY
It's okay.

KIT
Well, nobody asked me what I thought. They just hung it on me.

Holly breaks the silence that follows. 

HOLLY
You still in school?

KIT
Nah, I got me a job.

HOLLY (o.c.)
Doing what? 

KIT
Well, I don't mind getting up early, so I got a job throwing 
garbage... I'm not in love with the stuff, okay.

In the distance we hear Holly's FATHER calling her. She eases 
off. 

HOLLY
That's my father. I got to run.

KIT
Hey. wait a minute. When am I going to see you again?

Holly isn't sure how to reply. 

HOLLY
Well, I know what my daddy's going to say.

KIT (o.c.)
What?

HOLLY
Can I be honest?

KIT
Sure.

HOLLY
Well, that I shouldn't be seen with anybody that collects 
garbage.

KIT (o.c.)
He'll say that?

HOLLY
Yeah.

KIT (o.c.)
Now what's he know about garbage, huh?

HOLLY
Nothing.

KIT (o.c.)
There you go.

HOLLY
Well, I mean there's nothing he wants to know about it... I've 
got to run.

She waves goodbye and runs off. Kit waves back. 

EXT. HOLLY'S BACK YARD 

Holly walks into the back yard, where her father is working. 
Half-painted signs lean against the garage. 

FATHER
Who was that?

HOLLY
Just some boy.

He throws some paint off his brush onto the ground. 

HOLLY
Is that going to kill the grass?

He flicks his brush teasingly at her feet. She retreats to a 
chair, giggling. 

HOLLY
You got some on my feet.

FATHER
What'd he want?

HOLLY
Just wanted to know if we needed any yardwork done... I said no, 
and for him not to bother us.

INT. EMPLOYMENT AGENCY 

Kit is talking with a CLERK inside an employment agency. 

CLERK (o.c.)
You ever held another job before?

KIT
I used to throw trash for the City.

CLERK
You lost that one?

KIT
Wouldn't be here if I hadn't.

CLERK
What kind of work do you think you would be qualified for? 

KIT
I can't think of anything at the moment... I'd like you to write 
me out a slip, though, proving I came down here.

The Clerk leafs through his papers. 

CLERK
Well, I think we could find you something... working cattle over 
at the pens.

Kit sighs. 

KIT
Well. what the hell. Just hope there's a breeze.

The Clerk gives him a slip of paper. 

EXT. FRONT PORCH OF HOLLY'S HOUSE 

Holly sees Kit approaching the house. 

HOLLY (v.o.)
He was handsomer than anybody I'd ever met. He looked just like 
James Dean.

She walks out the front door. 

KIT
Hi.

HOLLY
Well, stop the world.

KIT
Quit my job.

HOLLY
Great.

KIT
Just seemed like the right move... Whatcha doing?

HOLLY
Spanish.

KIT (o.c.)
How do you say "Quit my Job" in Spanish?

HOLLY
Something mi trabajo.

Kit offers her a cigarette, which she declines. 

KIT
Yeah, well, I'm going to work as a cowboy now... Or thinking 
about it. It's a routine, like anything. What do you think?

HOLLY
I don't know.

He pulls himself up onto the bannister beside her. 

KIT
Well, at least nobody could get on me about wearing these boots 
any more.

She watches him intently. This makes him uncomfortable. 

KIT
You want to go for a ride?

HOLLY
Well, I got homework.

KIT (o.c.)
Bring it along.

His forwardness surprises her. 

EXT. DOWNTOWN STREET IN FT. DUPREE 

They are walking through the downtown area. Kit kicks a paper bag 
that someone has discarded on the sidewalk. 

KIT
Somebody dropped a bag on the sidewalk.

She appears nervous about being seen alone with him. 

KIT
Everybody did that, the whole town'd be a mess ... Hi.

He greets a passing stranger. 

KIT
You're a redhead.

HOLLY
I know.

KIT
Anybody ever call you "Red"?

HOLLY
Yeah, but I don't like it.

KIT
Why not?

HOLLY
Just don't... I've got a headache.

KIT
Yeah?

He steers her toward his car, a customized Mercury. As she gets 
in, he asks her


KIT (o.c.)
Can I come around and see you tomorrow?

HOLLY (startled)
Okay.

EXT. FEEDLOT - SERIES OF ANGLES 

We see Kit at work at the feedlot. throwing hay to the cattle, 
feeding them pills, etc. 

HOLLY (v.o.)
Kit went to work in the feedlot while I carried on with my 
studies. Little by little we fell in love... As I'd never been 
popular in school and didn't have a lot of personality, I was 
surprised that he took such a liking to me, especially when he 
could've had any other girl in town if he'd given it half a try.

The MONTAGE includes a shot of Holly running toward Kit's car for 
some rendezvous. 

HOLLY (v.o.)
He said that I was grand, though, that he wasn't interested in me 
for sex and that coming from him this was a compliment. Held 
never met a fifteen-year-old girl who behaved more like a grownup 
and wasn't giggly. He didn't care what anybody else thought. I 
looked good to him, and whatever I did was okay, and if I didn't 
have a lot to say, well, that was okay, too.

EXT. TREE BESIDE RIVER 

Kit and Holly are sitting under a tree. playing cards on a 
blanket. Holly surveys the area. 

HOLLY
What a nice place.

KIT (absorbed in game)
Yeah, the tree makes it nice.

HOLLY
And the flowers... Let's not pick them. They're so nice.

KIT
It's your play.

SERIES OF ANGLES 

Holly's father paints a picture. using a stereopticon to help 
with his backgrounds. TRACK with Kit driving down a street in his 
Mercury. Holly sits watching football practice. 

HOLLY (v.o.)
Of course I had to keep all this a secret from my dad. He 
would've had a fit, since Kit was ten years older than me and 
came from the wrong side of the tracks, so called. Our time with 
each other was limited and each lived for the precious hours when 
he or she could be with the other away from all the cares of the 
world.

EXT. UNDERNEATH BLEACHERS 

Kit and Holly are necking underneath some bleachers. In the 
distance we hear the NOISE of the football practice. 

HOLLY
My stomach's growling.

KIT
There's an old Fudgesicle over there. You want it?

HOLLY
No.

Kit laughs, and starts her laughing, too. 

KIT
Somebody else is going to get it.

HOLLY
I don't care.

KIT
Kids eat that kind of stuff in Korea.

At this her expression turns serious. 

SERIES OF ANGLES 

Kit in CLOSEUP at a fence in the feedlot, an intense look on his 
face. 

VARIOUS ANGLES of the cattle in their pens. They look numb and 
morose. 

TIGHT SHOT of Holly necking with Kit. 

HOLLY (v.o.)
In the stench and slime of the feedlot, he'd remember how I 
looked the night before, how I ran my hand through his hair and 
traced the outline of his lips with my fingertip. He wanted to 
die with me, and I dreamed of being lost forever in his arms.

EXT. HOLLY'S BACK YARD 

TIGHT SHOT of Holly's pet catfish in a bowl. 

CUT TO WIDE SHOT of Holly with gloves on carrying the fish 
through the garden in back of her house. She looks around warily, 
then throws it out among the melons. 

HOLLY (v.o.)
The whole time, the only thing I did wrong was throwing out my 
fish when he got sick. Later I got a new one, but this incident 
kept on bothering me and I turned to Kit.

EXT. STREET 

Kit and Holly walk down a sidewalk in the residential part of 
town. Kit is consoling her about the fish. 

HOLLY (v.o.)
I didn't mind telling Kit about stuff like this, cause strange 
things happened in his life, too, and some of the stuff he did 
was strange.

EXT. FEEDLOT 

Kit steps on top of a dead cow, as though to convince himself 
that it is dead. 

HOLLY (v.o.)
For instance,. he faked his signature whenever he used it, to 
keep other people from forging important papers with his name...

INT. HOLLY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT 

The CAMERA DOLLIES BACK to reveal Kit lying in bed. His attitude 
suggests that this is a scene of her fantasy. 

HOLLY (v.o.)
And as he lay in bed, in the middle of the night, he always heard 
a noise like somebody was holding a seashell against his ear. And 
sometimes he'd see me coming toward him in beautiful white robes, 
and I'd put my cold hand on his forehead.

EXT. RIVERBANK 

Kit puts on his jacket and heads down a riverbank to the edge of 
the water. Holly comes into view, buttoning her blouse. 

HOLLY
Did it go the way it 'uz supposed to?

KIT
Yeah.

HOLLY
Is that all there is to it?

KIT
Yeah.

Her questions make him uncomfortable. 

HOLLY
Gosh, what was everybody talking about?

KIT
Don't ask me.

Silence. 

HOLLY
Well. I'm glad it's over... For a while I was afraid I might die 
before it happened... Had a wreck, some deal like that.

Kit points to an uprooted tree lying in the water a hundred feet 
away. 

KIT
You see where that tree fell in the water?

He climbs back up the bank. 

HOLLY
Yeah... The river must've washed the roots away... You don't care 
about anything I say, though.

EXT. NEIGHBORING AREA 

Holly walks down the bank of the river. Kit falls in behind her, 
carrying a large stone. The CAMERA DOLLIES with them. 

KIT
You know what I think?

HOLLY
What?

KIT
That we should crunch our hands with this stone. That way we'd 
never forget what happened today.

HOLLY
But it would hurt.

KIT
Well, that's the point, stupid.

She gives him a cold look. 

HOLLY
Don't call me stupid.

KIT
Okay, but I'm going to keep it for a souvenir...

He throws it awav and picks up a smaller one. 

KIT
Or maybe one that's lighter.

He walks over to the car. A bridge is visible in the distance. 

EXT. FIELD 

Kit releases a large red balloon into the evening sky. A small 
basket is fixed to the bottom of the balloon. 

HOLLY (v.o.)
Kit made a solemn vow that he would always stand beside me and 
let nothing come between us. He wrote this out in writing, put 
the paper in a box with some of our little tokens and things, 
then sent it off in a balloon he'd found while on the garbage 
route. (pause) His heart was filled with longing as he watched it 
drift off. Something must've told him that we'd never live these 
days of happiness again, that they were gone forever.

DISSOLVE TO


EXT. CATTAILS 

Holly's dog bounds through a stand of cattails. Holly speaks 
angrily to her father, who walks toward the dog with a gun. We do 
not hear their voices, only music. He shoots the dog and Holly 
runs off in horror. 

HOLLY (v.o.)
Then, sure enough, Dad found out I'd been running around behind 
his back. He was madder than I'd ever seen him. As punishment for 
deceiving him, he went and shot my dog.

EXT. BRIDGE 

Holly's father drags a duffel bag out of his truck and dumps it 
over the side of a bridge, into a river. It goes under briefly, 
then bobs to the surface. The current takes it off. 

DISSOLVE TO


EXT. MUSIC SCHOOL 

Holly sits in the second-story window of a music school. 

HOLLY (v.o.)
He made me take extra music lessons every day after school and 
wait there till he came to pick me up. He said that if the piano 
didn't keep me off the streets. maybe the clarinet would.

DISSOLVE TO


EXT. BILLBOARD 

Kit approaches Holly's father, who is hard at work, painting a 
billboard along a deserted stretch of road. Kit is eating a 
peach. 

KIT
Sure is pretty.

FATHER
What'd you come out here for?

KIT
I wasn't aware there was any law against it.

Kit sees that this kind of talk will not do. He is silent for a 
moment, then throws the peach away. 

KIT
You know Holly... well. she means a lot to me, sir.

Holly's father goes solemnly about his business. 

KIT
You know, before I met her, nobody could ask me how I was doing 
with my girl. Matter of fact, I didn't really have one.

FATHER
Is that right?

KIT
Yeah.

Kit walks off a few paces and leans against the father's truck. 

KIT
It okay me leaning on your Willys here?

Holly's father does not answer. 

KIT
Listen. I got a lot of respect for her, sir. (pause) That's about 
as good a one as I know to tell you.

FATHER
Well, it's not good enough. (pause) Just what do you think would 
happen to her if she stuck around with you, Kit? Guy like you.

KIT
She'd get along okay. And if she didn't, well, she could take 
off, just take off, (and) I wouldn't mind... I'd always tell 
people I deserved it.

Holly's father comes to his feet and fixes Kit in the eye. 

FATHER
You get out of here. I don't want you hanging around any more. 
You understand?

He lets these words sink in, then returns to his seat. 

FATHER
(shaking his head) You're something.

Kit waves goodbye. 

KIT
Takes all kinds, sir.

He walks to his car, looking back once. 

SERIES OF ANGLES 

LONG SHOT of father at work at billboard. Kit approaches Holly's 
house, collects the evening newspaper from the sidewalk, and 
knocks on the front door. Holly's father picks her up from a park 
outside the music school. Kit, when he gets no answer, enters the 
house. The jeep, with Holly and her father, rumbles down a 
residential street. 

INT. HOLLY'S HOUSE 

Kit is going through Holly's dresser, throwing her things into a 
suitcase. A pistol is visible in his back pocket. Suddenly, 
Holly's father appears in the dresser mirror, standing at the end 
of the hall outside the bedroom. 

Kit walks forward to greet him. The CAMERA DOLLIES with him. 

KIT
Hi.

FATHER
What're you doing?

KIT
I've got a gun here, sir. It's always a good idea to have one 
around.

Kit draws the pistol. He is shaken, though he must have seen this 
coming. 

FATHER
What do you think you're doing? Go on, get out of here.

KIT
Well, I got it all planned... and I'm taking Holly off with me.

He looks at Holly, who has appeared on the landing, uncertain 
what her reaction to all this will be. 

FATHER
Okay, boy, I'm turning you over to the authorities.

Kit steps forward as Holly's father starts down the stairs. 

KIT
What for?

FATHER
For coming onto my property... With a gun.

KIT
No, you're not either.

FATHER (o.c.)
Yeah? Why not?

KIT
Cause I can't allow it.

Holly's father stares at him for a moment, then continues down 
the stairs. Kit starts forward. 

KIT
Hey... Hey, wait a minute.

His shout arrests Holly's father at the bottom of the stairs. 

KIT
Suppose I shot you. How'd that be? Huh?

Holly's father does not move. 

KIT
You want to hear what it sounds like?

He fires a shot into the stairs. The report is deafening in the 
enclosure of the stairwell. They exchange looks. Kit's breathing 
is heavy. 

INT. LIVING ROOM 

Holly's father turns and walks into the living room. Kit rushes 
down the stairs. Holly shouts his name. 

KIT
Hey, where you going?

He fires two shots into Holly's father, who slowly sinks to the 
floor. Kit unlimbers his shoulder. Holly rushes down the stairs 
to her father's side. 

HOLLY
Daddy... This is Holly... Are you going to be okay?

Her father does not respond. She looks back at Kit, who avoids 
her gaze. She gets to her feet and walks nto the kitchen. Kit 
follows her. 

INT. KITCHEN 

Kit closes the back door to the house. 

KIT
I came in the front.

HOLLY
How bad off is he?

KIT (o.c.)
I can look and see.

HOLLY
We better call the doctor... Listen. I'll say how it happened, 
part I saw.

KIT (sighs)
Well... I don't think that'd work.

This startles Holly. 

INT. LIVING ROOM 

Kit touches the father's heart. 

KIT
He don't need a doctor.

He walks back into the kitchen. 

HOLLY
Are you sure?

KIT
You don't believe me, see for yourself.

Holly stares at her father.

EXT. HOLLY'S HOUSE - DUSK 

LOW ANGLE of Holly's house silhouetted against the evening sky. 
On sound the NOISE of CICADAS. 

INT. CELLAR 

Kit drags Holly's father into the cellar. sets him down gently, 
then eases out of the room, taking a discarded toaster with him. 

INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT 

Kit comes up the steps from the cellar. Holly stands at the 
drainboard. 

KIT
I found a toaster.

He sets down the toaster and walks over to Holly's side. 

KIT
Listen, honey. I don't want to...

She slaps him across the forehead. He walks into the now darkened 
living room, and sits down at the piano. After a moment Holly 
follows him. 

INT. LIVING ROOM ~ NIGHT 

Holly sits down on the sofa across from Kit. 

HOLLY
Listen, maybe we ought to tell somebody about this.

KIT
You said that once already... Too late now.

HOLLY
Why?

KIT
They're not going to listen to me. You either. Are you kidding?

A silence follows. 

HOLLY
Suppose the neighbors heard the noise?

KIT
Wouldn't be funny... Listen, I'll be back in a while.

He gets up and heads for the front door. 

KIT
Oh... You want to call the police, that's fine. Just won't be so 
hot for me.

There are tears in Holly's eyes now. They exchange looks as Kit 
opens the front door. Then he leaves. Holly settles back on the 
couch. 

EXT. HOLLY'S HOUSE - NIGHT 

The house by night. 

INT. HALLWAY AND BEDROOM - NIGHT 

Holly comes up the stairs, smoking a cigarette. She walks to her 
bedroom window. The CAMERA DOLLIES with her. Outside, under the 
street lamp, she can see two boys trading secrets. 

INT. TRAIN STATION - NIGHT 

Kit puts fifty cents into a gramophone booth. He clears his voice 
as the machine whirs Into operation. 

KIT
My girl Holly and I have decided to kill ourselves, same way I 
did her dad. Big decision huh? Well, the reasons are obvious, and 
I don't have time to go into them right now... One thing, 
though... He was provoking me when I popped him. That's what it 
was like, a POP.

Inserts of the booth's mechanism
a light panel measuring off the seconds and the needle on the 
record. 

KIT
Course nobody's coming out of this thing happy, especially not 
us. You can't deny we've had fun, though. Which is more than I 
can say for some.... Mmmm. that's the end of the message. I run 
out of things to say... Thank you.

He gets these last words in just as his time is up. He gets the 
record and steps outside the booth, into the lobby of a train 
station.

INT. HOLLY'S LIVING ROOM - SERIES OF ANGLES - NIGHT 

Kit slams a ten-gallon can of gasoline down on the piano bench, 
opens it and begins pouring it out over the interior of the 
house, kicking aside everything that comes in his way. 

EXT. REAR OF HOUSE - NIGHT 

Holly comes out the screen door at the back of the house, 
carrying a suitcase and a painting. Kit appears with a lamp on an 
extension cord. He sets it down beside a victrola he has set up 
on a table outdoors. He puts the needle on the record he recorded 
earlier. Holly watches him as she retreats to the car. 

HOLLY (v.o.)
Kit left a record playing over and over for the District Attorney 
to find. He was gambling for time.

Kit unplugs the lamp, lights a book of matches and pitches them 
into a puddle of gas. The back porch of the house explodes into 
flame. Kit runs to the car with the lamp, caught off guard by the 
force of the flames. They drive off. 

INT./EXT HOUSE ON FIRE - SERIES OF ANGLES - NIGHT 

Various objects around the house burst into flames
a picture we saw on the stairs. some peacock feathers, a 
cantaloupe and a pomegranate left on the kitchen table, the 
living room, Holly's bedroom, the bed itself, a doll on the bed, 
an A&W Root Beer sign outside the house, a water can, flames 
swirling out the front of the house. Holly's father in CLOSEUP in 
the cellar, sheet music lifting off the piano. etc. At length the 
CAMERA PANS over the charred frame of Holly's bed. Outside a 
fireman moves with a flashlight through the embers of the house. 

INT. SCHOOL CORRIDOR 

Holly collects her books from a locker at her school and walks 
anxiously down a corridor towards the exit. 

HOLLY (v.o.)
Kit made me get my books from school, so I wouldn't fall behind. 
We'd be starting a new life, he said. and we'd have to change our 
names. His would be James. Mine would be Priscilla. We'd hide out 
like spies, somewhere in the North, where people didn't ask a lot 
of questions.

EXT. SCHOOL - DAWN 

Holly breaks into a run as she comes through the front door of 
the high school. Kit waits for her at the car. There is nobody 
else in sight. 

HOLLY (v.o.)
I could of snuck out the back or hid in the boiler room, I 
suppose, but I sensed that my destiny now lay with Kit, for 
better or for worse, and that it was better to spend a week with 
one who loved me for what I was than years of loneliness.

She gets into the car and they drive off. 

INT. MERCURY - DAWN 

Kit studies Holly for signs of her mood. 

KIT
How you doing?

HOLLY (neutrally)
I'm fine. Kind of tired. 

KIT
Yeah, me too.

EXT. RIVER 

The CAMERA DOLLIES with a tree floating down a swollen river. 
Cottonwood trees cover the far bank. 

HOLLY (v.o.)
We hid out In the wilderness,down by a river in a grove of 
cottonwoods. It being the flood season we built our house in the 
trees, with tamarisk walls and willows laid side by side to make 
a floor. There wasn't a plant in the forest that didn't come in 
handy.

CLOSEUPS OF PLAIQTS - SERIES OF ANGLES 

Details of the cottonwoods, willow and tamarisk. Music continues 
under. 

EXT. TREEHOUSE - SERIES OF ANGLES 

Details of Kit and Holly building the treehouse. Kit pounds a log 
into place wi h a tomahawk; Holly scrapes the bark off a log with 
a piece of flint; Kit weaves tamarisk branches through the frame 
of the house. This MONTAGE ends with a PAN DOWN the four stories 
of the completed treehouse. 

HOLLY (v.o.)
We planned a huge network of tunnels under the forest floor, and 
our first order of business every morning was to decide on a new 
password for the day. ow and then weld sneak out at night and 
steal a chicken or a bunch of corn or some melons from a melon 
patch... Mostly. though, we just lay on our backs and stared at 
the clouds and sometimes it was like being in a big marble hall. 
the way we talked in low voices and heard the tiniest sound.

INT. TREEHOUSE 

The CAMERA PANS off Holly's painting, a Maxwell Parrish, onto Kit 
asleep with his pistol beside him. then onto Holly under a quilt 
with a box of shells beside her. Her hand quivers once. 

EXT. TREE TOPS 

Kit lifts an egg out of a bird's nest at the top of a tree. He 
drops it down to Holly, fifty feet below. 

HOLLY (v.o.)
They hadn't found but one set of bones in the ashes of the house. 
so we knew they'd be looking for us. Kit made sure we'd be 
prepared.

EXT. TRAIL - SERIES OF ANGLES 

Kit cuts a piece of twine that lies across a trail, whereupon a 
ball full of spikes comes swinging down out of the trees. with 
lethal force. Kit ducks out of the way. We next see Kit with a 
dew ag around his forehead, running laps through the woods as 
part of his training. He exhorts himself to greater effort. 

HOLLY (v.o.)
He gave me lectures on how a gun works, how to take it apart and 
put it back together again. in case 1 had to carry on without 
him. He said that if the Devil came at me, I could shoot him with 
a gun.

EXT. TAMARISK 

Holly struggles through the undergrowth witha yoke over her 
shoulders, carrying wood back to the teahouse. 

HOLLY (v.o.)
One day, I carried thirty pounds of wood a distance of five 
miles. Another day, while hiding in the forest, I covered my eyes 
with makeup, to see how they'd come out.

TIGHT ON HOLLY'S EYES 

Holly has made her eyes up with mascara. 

EXT. FRONT OF TREEHOUSE 

Kit and Holly dance the stroll to the sound of Mickey and Sylvia 
on their Zenith portable. Holly shows a better sense of rhythm 
than Kit. 

EXT. MUD FLAT BESIDE RIVER - DUSK 

Kit lifts a fish out of the river with a crude device like a 
lacrosse net. Holly sits on the bank In the b.g. The fish 
wriggles out of the net and falls back In the water. Kit 
struggles in vain to retrieve it. 

HOLLY (v.o.)
We had our bad moments, like any couple. Kit accused me of only 
being along for the ride,while at times I wished he'd fall in the 
river and drown, so I could watch.

Kit throws his net down in disgust, partly at Holly. 

KIT
Take a break. Red... Life of Riley, huh?

Holly ignores him as he walks off down the flat. 

HOLLY (v.o.)
Mostly. though. we got along fine and stayed in love.

EXT. FRONT OF TREEHOUSE 

Holly, in curlers, walks over to where Kit is shaving. 

HOLLY
One of the chickens died last night.

She pats a little water on her face, dries it with a burlap 
towel, picks up a hatchet and walks off into the forest to cut 
the morning's firewood. 

HOLLY
I almost stepped on him.

EXT. UPPER DECK 

Holly sits on the upper deck of the treehouse, reading Kon-Tiki 
aloud to Kit. 

HOLLY
"The Kon-Tiki in motion was a little different from what it 
usually was in such conditions. We had become sensitive to 
changes in the rhythm of the logs. I thought at once of suction 
from the coast, which was drawing near, and was continually out 
on the deck and up the mast..."

KIT
He was nervous.

Holly looks at him for a moment, trying to understand the meaning 
of this interruption, then resumes


HOLLY
"Time passed. At dawn, just before six, Torstein came hurrying 
down from the masthead. He could see a whole line of small palm-
clad islands far ahead..."

EXT. RIVER 

Holly walks down the edge of the river, fresh from her bath. 
wrapped in a white sheet. The river is raging, with white caps 
visible in places. 

EXT. FOREST 

A strange animal, not a deer or a horse, but like them, moves 
languidly through the thick of the forest. Holly puts down her 
binoculars, amazed. 

HOLLY (v.o.)
I grew to love the forest. The cooing of the doves and the hum of 
dragonflies in the air made it always seem lonesome and like 
everybody's dead and gone...

EXT. CROW'S NEST 

Kit sits in the crow's nest at the top of the treehouse, browsing 
through a copy of National Geographic. amused by what he sees, 
looking around to find somebody he can share it with. 

HOLLY (v.o.)
When the leaves rustled overhead, it was like the spirits were 
whispering about all the little things that bothered 'em.

TIGHT ON SLIDES 

An array of stereo slides is spread out on the leaves of the 
forest floor. Holly puts one in her stereopticon and studies it. 
Kit greets her as he walks by with a log over his shoulder. 

HOLLY (v.o.)
One day, while taking a look at some vistas in Dad's 
stereopticon, it hit me that I was just this little girl, born in 
Texas, whose father was a sign painter and who had only just so 
many years to live ...

TIGHT ON SLIDES 

With each of her thoughts a slide appears
a canal in Brazil, a camel boy in front of the Great Pyramid. 
some cows standing in a fjord with a steamship in the distance, a 
mother with her child, a woman playing the piano as another woman 
looks on, a family on a lawn, a soldier in a wheatfield 
whispering something into his girlfriend's ear. 

HOLLY (v.o.)... It sent a chill down my spine, and I thought
Where would I be this very moment if Kit had never met me? ... Or 
killed anybody? This very moment... If my Mom had never met my 
Dad? If she'd of never died?... And what's the man I'll marry 
going to look like? What's he doing right this minute? ... Is he 
thinking about me now, by some coincidence, even though he 
doesn't know me? Does it show on his face?

EXT. RIVER 

Kit is fishing with his crude net. He stops briefly to watch a 
truck passing down the highway In the distance, then goes back to 
work. This stretch of river seems dangerously close to 
civilization. 

HOLLY (v.o.)
For days afterward I lived in dread. At times I wished I could 
fall asleep and be taken off to some magical land, but this never 
happened.

Kit, frustrated draws his pistol from his back pocket and looks 
around for the fish that has been eluding him. He does not see, 
as we do, a MAN watching him from across the river. He fires at 
the fish. misses it and fires again. The Man across the river 
hesitates. then moves back into the undergrowth. 

DISSOLVE TO


SERIES OF ANGLES - TREEHOUSE 

Holly is off somewhere in the forest. putting on lipstick. Kit 
sits on watch in the crowls nest, a pair of binoculars close at 
hand. On sound, over the music, we hear voices whispering to 
them. Kit sees a movement in the brush. A moment later a figure 
appears, a hunter, carrying a gun. Kit shouts a code word to 
Holly. She takes off running, as Kit clambers down the planks of 
the treehouse and collects his shotgun. He tells her to hide, 
runs through the woods and dives in a hole, under a cover of 
leaves. She jumps behind a log. Several shots of the still forest 
follow, then the hunters appear, a shoulder here. pant leg there. 
The music ends as one of them cocks his gun. They pass right over 
the hole where Kit is hiding. Kit rises up slowly, gives them a 
gentlemanly word of warning, then shoots all three in the back. 
He checks to see if anybody else is with them, then calls weakly 
out to Holly. 

KIT
Holly!

Holly picks her way through the brush, back to the treehouse. 

EXT. TREEHOUSE 

They are packed up and ready to leave. Kit slams the trunk of the 
Mercury. 

KIT
Get in the car, Red.

He takes a bird cage off the roof of the car and throws it away. 

KIT
We don't need this.

He climbs a ladder, looks In the cabin of the treehouse to see if 
they've left anything behind, then jumps down. He flips over the 
wicker hemisphere that covers their rooster. The rooster walks 
off, free. He surveys the woods, then looks back at Holly, who 
returns his look and gets in the car. 

HOLLY (v.o.)Kit felt bad about shooting those men in the backs. 
but he said they'd come in like that. and they would've played it 
as down and dirty as they could, and besides, held overheard them 
whispering about how they were only interested in the reward 
money. With lawmen it wouldtve been different. They were out 
there to get a job done and they deserved a fair chance. But not 
a bounty hunter.

EXT. BADLANDS - SERIES OF ANGLES 

We see a flat expanse of the Badlands. The Mercury appears over 
the horizon and heads toward a solitary house. A man appears at 
the door of the house, Kit's friend, Cato. 

HOLLY (v.o.)
We went to hide out with a friend of Kit's from the days of the 
garbage route.

EXT. CATO'S HOUSE. 

Kit gets out of the car, takes a chicken from the back seat and 
walks over to face Cato. He keeps a safe distance. 

KIT
How you doing, Cato?

CATO
Not bad.

Kit steps forward, rifle in hand, and offers Cato the chicken. 

KIT
Take that sombitch.

Cato takes it, a wan smile on his face. 

KIT
What you been doing?

CATO
Running this place for a fella in town. Nothing much to speak of.

KIT
Well, I don't notice us hustling trash, either.

Kit walks over to inspect the interior of Cato's house. 

KIT
Where'd you get them antlers?

CATO (o.c.)
They come with the house.

He refers to a set of deer antlers, mounted over the door. Kit 
looks inside, then back at Cato. 

KIT
Oh, Cato, I want you to meet my girl, Holly Sargis.

Holly smiles and says hello. 

EXT. PICNIC TABLE 

They sit at a picnic table under a tree, having lunch. Holly is 
telling a joke at Kit's urging. 

HOLLY
Did you hear the one about the guy in the nuthouse that went 
around naked, with only a hat and gloves on, and this nurse came 
up to him and said, "Hey, what... You can't walk around that 
way," and the guy says, "What's the matter? Nobody comes around 
here." Anyway, the nurse says, "What do you have the hat and 
gloves on for, then?" And the guy says, "Well, you never know."

Cato bursts into laughter. 

KIT
Isn't that funny?

Cato stops laughing. He wants to give Kit the right answer. 

CATO
Yeah, I guess.

KIT (o.c.)
She plays the clarinet, too.

Holly smiles politely. 

HOLLY
Don't you ever get bored around here?

CATO
Sometimes. The other day, though, an old boy was plowing in the 
field over there, found some old Spanish coins.

KIT
(suspicious)
That's what he told you, huh?

CATO (o.c.)
No, he showed me one.

HOLLY
What'd they look like?

CATO (o.c.)
Kind of round, like so... Gold. I'll show you if you want.

Kit and Holly eye one another. Kit sees the chance to make a 
fortune here. He is careful to conceal his feelings, though. 

KIT
Let me finish my supper.

Holly, big-eyed, bites into an apple. 

EXT. FIELD 

Kit, Holly and Cato walk out to the field where Cato heard the 
coins were found. Holly picks up a pot lid. 

KIT
We're thinking of going down to Texas. Holly wants to visit some 
of her people down there, but after that I don't know... They say 
Mexico's nice.

Cato stops. 

CATO
Kit... Maybe I'd better get a shovel.

KIT
Okay.

CATO
I'll catch up with you.

KIT
Okay.

Kit walks out into the field to join Holly. Cato turns back. 

HOLLY
I found a lid. It was laying on the ground over there.

KIT
Put that down. It's dirty.

Holly tosses the lid at him. He picks up some dirt clods and 
starts throwing them at her. She squeals and dodges. CATO watches 
them for a while, indecisive, then turns and runs. 

HOLLY (o.c.)
Hey, you're throwing big ones!

Suddenly, Kit spots Cato. 

KIT
Cato!

Cato jumps over a trough and comes to a stop in front of his 
truck, a water tanker. 

CATO
The shovel's in the truck.

Kit raises his gun and shoots Cato through the belly. CATO falls, 
then gets to his feet and stumbles toward the front door of the 
house. Kit follows him for a while, then skips forward and opens 
the door for him. 

INT. BEDROOM 

Cato falls on his bed and rolls over to face Kit. Kit walks in 
calmly and picks up a photo on the bureau. 

HOLLY (v.o.)
Kit never let on why he'd shot Cato. He said that just talking 
about it could bring us bad luck and that right now we needed all 
the luck we could get.

Kit sets the photo down. 

KIT (o.c.)
You never told me about her.

He looks under the bed, then walks out the door. 

INT. LIVING ROOM 

Holly stands near a window. smoking a cigarette. Kit sets his 
rifle down and surveys the room, which is cluttered with odds and 
ends. 

KIT
Look at all this junk.

HOLLY
How's he doing?

KIT
(shrugging)
I got him in the stomach.

Holly sits down. 

HOLLY
Is he upset?

KIT
He didn't say anything to me about it.

He takes a drag off her cigarette and gives it back to her. He 
leafs idly through a catalogue on the table, then walks over to 
look in the bedroom. 

KIT
Bunch of junk.

Inside the bedroom Cato is still conscious, but his breathing is 
heavy. Kit walks back to Holly's side. HOLLY is looking through 
the catalogue. 

KIT
He stole that cage. I saw him doing it.

Kit wants this to have been an execution, not a murder. 

KIT
Whatcha looking in there for? We can't afford any of that.

HOLLY (defensive)
Just looking.

INT. BEDROOM 

As they bicker in the other room, Cato inspects his face in a 
mirror. 

KIT (o.c.)
Why don't you go in there and keep him company for a while?

Holly walks in the door. 

HOLLY
Hi.

She sits down. 

HOLLY
That your spider in there? in that bottle?

CATO
Yeah.

HOLLY
What do you feed him?

CATO
Oh, flies... grasshoppers when I can catch 'em.

HOLLY
Does he bite?

CATO
He never bit me.

We hear the sound of a car HORN in the distance. HOLLY
turns and looks. 

EXT. CATO'S HOUSE 

A 1951 Studebaker approaches the house. There are two people 
inside, a BOY and a GIRL. Kit comes out the front door. The Boy 
and Girl get out, but seeing Kit, they wait by the car. 

BOY
Hi. where's Cato?

KIT
Well, he's gone.

BOY
Gone? ... Where?

KIT
He said not to tell.

BOY (o.c.)
Oh yeah?

KIT
Yeah, he said for you to give us a lift into town. You're the 
ones with the Studebaker, aren't you?

The Boy hesitates a second, then starts for the house. 

BOY
Well, I just need to pick up something in the house.

Kit draws his gun. 

KIT
No... You go in there, I'll have to kill you.

BOY
What's going on?

KIT
Can't afford to take chances.

The Girl is baffled. 

KIT (o.c.)
Come on out of there, young lady.

Kit waves them out into the neighboring field with him. 

KIT
Let's us step out in this field here.

The Boy raises his hands. 

KIT
Nah, skip that... I'm going to have to keep an eye on you, 
though.

BOY
Okay.

KIT
You don't mind?

Holly steps out the front door and smiles at the girl. 

HOLLY
Hi.

EXT. FIELD 

Holly and the girl walk through the field toward a storm cellar 
where the boys are waiting for them. The wind is blowing hard. 

GIRL
What's going to happen to Jack and me?

HOLLY
You have to ask Kit. He says frog, I jump.

GIRL
Okay.

HOLLY
What's your friend's name?

GIRL
Jack.

HOLLY
You love him?

GIRL
I don't know.

Holly thinks about this for a moment. 

HOLLY
I've got to stick by Kit... He feels trapped.

GIRL
Yeah. I can imagine.

HOLLY
Well, I've felt that way, hadn't you?

EXT. STORM CELLAR 

Kit guides the couple into the storm cellar. 

KIT
Okay, you two, down in the cellar.

They head down the steps into the cellar, the Girl first. Kit 
stops the Boy for a moment. 

KIT
You promise to stay down there for an hour?

BOY
Yeah.

KIT
You expect me to believe that?

He looks back at Holly, as though to ask whether he should. 

BOY
Yeah.

Kit nods and waves the Boy down into the cellar. The Boy 
disappears. Kit shuts the door. 

KIT
I'm going to shut the door.

Kit sticks a pin through the latch, hesitates, then fires two 
shots down through a seam into the cellar. He retreats to Holly's 
side. a little surprised at what he did. 

KIT
Think I got 'em?

HOLLY
I don't know.

KIT
Well, I'm not going down there and look.

He starts running away from the cellar. Holly follows him. A 
storm is gathering on the horizon. Kit offers Holly his hand as 
they run. but Holly does not see this. 

INT. CATO'S BEDROOM 

Cato lies motionless, on his bed. Holly steps forward and touches 
him with a yardstick, like a child touching a snake. 

HOLLY (v.o.)
Suddenly, I was thrown into a state of shock...

EXT. HOUSE AND BOX CAR 

Kit, rifle in hand, lumbers out a side door of the house with 
Cato over his shoulder. He steers for a nearby box car that 
evidently served Cato as a shed. 

HOLLY (v.o.)
Kit was the most trigger happy person I'd ever met. He claimed 
that as long as you're playing for keeps and the law is coming at 
you, it's considered okay to shoot all witnesses. You had to take 
the consequences, though, and not whine about it later.

Kit opens the doors of the box car. and dumps Cato inside. Before 
closing the doors he checks Cato's shoes. to see if they are the 
ones he gave him. Holly looks on from the side of the house, 
twenty yards away. 

HOLLY
We're in for it now... If they catch us.

Kit looks cornered and defensive. Holly thinks for a moment. 

HOLLY
What'd you put him in there for?

KIT (shrugging)
Just to keep him out of the sun.

Kit heads out of sight around the rear of the box car. Holly goes 
back inside. Kit walks up and down the length of the box car, 
talking under his breath and throwing his rifle from hand to 
hand, in a state. 

DISSOLVE TO


EXT. COUNTRY ROAD 

Kit and Holly travel down a country road in the Studebaker. 

HOLLY (v.o.)
At this moment I didn't feel shame or fear, but just kind of 
blah, like when you're sitting there and all the water's run out 
of the bathtub.

INT. CAR 

Kit, driving, turns to Holly. 

KIT
You tired?

HOLLY
Yeah.

KIT
Yeah, you look tired... Listen, honey. when all this is over, I'm 
going to sit down and buy you a big, thick steak.

HOLLY
I don't want a steak.

KIT
Well, we'll see about that... Hey, lookie.

He nods at a wrecked car lying in a ditch beside the road. 

KIT
They're probably going to blame that on me, too, bastards.

VIGILANTE MONTAGE - SERIES OF ANGLES - BLACK AND WHITE 

Various shots characterizing the Midwest's reaction to Kit and 
Holly
a deserted street, law officers posing with their guns and 
ammunition, children walking from class under armed guard, a 
detective in a trench coat pointing at a pump, a woman calling in 
her children at dusk, a county official posing with the county 
records, the court reporter with a book of signatures, vigilantes 
signing up and being deputized, then riding through the streets 
of their town in the backs of pickups, a priest among them, etc. 

HOLLY (v.o.)
The whole country was out looking for us, for who knew where Kit 
would strike next? Sidewalks were deserted. Stores closed their 
doors and drew their blinds. Posses and vigilante committees were 
set up from Texas to North Dakota. Children rode back and forth 
to school under heavy guard. A famous detective was brought in 
from Boston. He could find no clues ... My clarinet teacher said 
I probably wasn't responsible, but others said I was. Then, on 
Thursday, the Governor of Oklahoma sent out the National Guard to 
stand watch at the Federal Reserve Bank in Tulsa when word got 
out that Kit meant to rob it... It was like the Russians had 
invaded.

EXT. RICH MAN'S HOUSE 

Kit and Holly approach a large Victorian mansion. Kit rings the 
bell. 

HOLLY (v.o.)
We needed supplies, so we went to a rich man's house. Kit figured 
it'd be safer and quicker than shopping in the downtown... A maid 
came to the door.

A MAID opens the door. 

KIT
Hi, I come to check the meter. My tools are in here.

He nods at the suitcase he is carrying. The Maid looks at Holly. 

KIT
Oh, this Is Holly. She's from Texas.

Kit winks at Holly. The Maid brushes her ears to indicate that 
she is deaf, then stands back to let them pass. 

HOLLY (v.o.)
Later we found out she was deaf and we hadn't even known it.

KIT
Excuse me.

They enter the house. 

INT. LIVING ROOM 

Kit leads the others into the living room. The owner of the 
house, a RICH MAN, sits in a chair in the corner, reviewing some 
prints. At the sight of Kit he comes to his feet. 

KIT
Hi.

RICH MAN
Yes?

KIT
This your place?

RICH MAN
Yes.

Kit looks around, overwhelmed by the luxury of the mansion. 

KIT
Sorry to barge in on you. Anybody else here besides you two?

RICH MAN
No.

The Rich Man is wary. Kit nearly forgets to explain himself. 

KIT
Good deal... Oh, uh, we're on the run and we'd like to hang out 
here for a while. Couple of hours, maybe. How'd that be?

RICH MAN
Stay as long as you like.

TIGHT ON MURAL 

The CAMERA PANS across a mural of some pastoral scene. 

INT. HOUSE - SERIES OF ANGLES 

Holly runs her finger around the lip of a crystal glass. It makes 
a soft chiming noise. Kit, sitting at the end of a table opposite 
her, picks up a dinner bell, rings it, then puts It down and 
regards her solemnly. 

KIT
Next time I ring that, it means time to clear out.

Holly, in the next angle, has moved a bust off its pedestal onto 
the corner of a piano. She thinks better of this and restores the 
bust to its original position. 

Kit sniffs at a glass of sherry, then takes a picture off the 
mantel and studies it. 

Holly, at the other end of the room. tests the comforts of a 
chair. This done. she moves to another chair and tests it, too. 
She makes her hand limp. She watches it swing back and forth. 

Kit sits in the chair which the Rich Man occupied earlier. He has 
a thoughtful look on his face. There is a dictaphone on the table 
beside him. 

INT. HALLWAY 

Holly takes a cane out of the umbrella rack, looks around 
furtively, then steps out a side door of the house. 

EXT. LAWN 

Holly walks down the slope of the lawn. 

HOLLY (v.o.)
I left Kit in the parlor and went for a stroll outside the house. 
The day was quiet and serene, but I didn't notice, for I was deep 
in thought, and not even thinking about how to slip off.

Across the way she can see a long driveway, with a border of lush 
greenery and a sleepy cat standing in the sun. 

HOLLY (v.o.)
The world was like a faraway planet to which I could never 
return... I thought what a fine place it was, full of things for 
people to look into and enjoy.

INT. LIVING ROOM - TIGHT ON KIT 

Kit talks into the dictaphone, recording some advice for young 
people. 

KIT
Listen to your parents and teachers. They got a line on most 
things, so don't treat them like enemies. There's always a chance 
you could learn something. (he pauses for a moment) Try to keep 
an open mind. Try to understand the viewpoint of others. Consider 
the minority opinion, but try to get along with the majority 
opinion once it's accepted. (again he pauses) Course Holly and 
I've had fun, even if it has been rushed, and... so far we're 
doing fine. hadn't got caught. (annoyed) Excuse the grammar.

He sets down the dictaphone. puts out his cigarette and leans 
back in his chair, lost in reflection. 

INT. COVERED ROOM 

Holly enters the room where the Rich Man and his Maid have been 
put. The furniture and paintings are covered with sheets, 
suggesting that for some purpose, known only to the family, the 
room has been set aside. 

HOLLY
Hi... Kit's downstairs playing with the dictaphone... Sometimes 
he acts like there's something wrong with his bean.

She leans against the window. behind the couch where the Rich Man 
is sitting. 

HOLLY
Hope nothing ever goes wrong with mine.

RICH MAN
Think he's crazy, huh?

HOLLY
I don't know... He's kind of odd.

She sits down beside the Rich Man. 

HOLLY (shyly)
They claim I've got him wrapped around my little finger, but I 
never told him to shoot anybody.

She looks the room over. 

HOLLY
Gosh, I like your house.

RICH MAN
Thank you.

We hear the NOISE of a doorbell. 

INT. LIVING ROOM 

Kit puts down a copy of the Wall Street Journal and locates his 
pistol. He starts for the door, then remembers that he moved a 
picture from the mantel. He puts the picture back in place, 
checks the chamber of his pistol and leaves the room. 

EXT. FRONT OF HOUSE 

Kit opens the front door to find a VISITOR on the stoop. The 
Visitor carries a roll of blueprints under his arm. 

KIT
Hi.

VISITOR
Hi... ah, Mister Scarborough here?

KIT
Yeah, but the thing about him, he's down with the flu. He's sick.

VISITOR
Really?

KIT
Yeah. I'd invite you inside, except it's contagious. Don't want 
to start an epidemic.

VISITOR
No, of course not. It's only that he called last night and asked 
if I could come by.

KIT
Well, he didn't have it last night.

The Visitor is puzzled by Kit's presence in the house, and even 
more by his behavior. He takes out a note pad. 

KIT
What's that?

VISITOR
Well, I'd like to leave a message, if that's okay.

KIT
Sure.

The Visitor jots something down and hands the note to Kit. 

KIT
You have to excuse me now. I have to go back inside. Bye.

Kit closes the door. 

INT. STAIRWELL 

Kit hides the Visitor's note in a vase and bounds up the stairs 
to the first landing. 

KIT
We're out of here, Tex.

He turns back down the stairs. On a rack at the bottom he finds a 
hat and coat. He takes them with him. 

INT. COVERED ROOM 

Kit walks into the room where he left the Rich Man and his maid. 
He now carries a bag of groceries under his arm, 

KIT
Hi, whatcha doing?

RICH MAN
Just thinking.

KIT
Good a way to kill time as any... She okay?

He points to the Maid with his pistol. 

RICH MAN
Yes.

KIT
Listen, ah ... We're going to take the Cadillac for a while. 
How'd that be?

RICH MAN
Fine.

KIT
Don't worry, I won't let her drive.

He means Holly. 

KIT (continuing)
Oh, and here's a list of everything we borrowed. Car's on there, 
too.

He gives the list to the Rich Man and signals the Maid to 
accompany them out. 

KIT
Okay, ma'am, let's go . . . come on.

INT. HALLWAY 

Kit points the Rich Man and his Maid into a closet. 

KIT
You're my friend, aren't you?

RICH MAN
Yes.

KIT
Okay, no monkey business then.

He locks the door of the closet once they are inside, starts off, 
then remembers something, takes a handkerchief out of his pocket 
and wipes his fingerprints off the door handle. 

KIT
Groceries.

With this reminder he collects his bag of groceries and heads 
down the hall. 

EXT. FRONT PORCH 

Kit and Holly come out the front door. Holly wears a shawl over 
her head as a disguise, Kit wears the outfit he took off the Rich 
Man's coat rack. He carries his groceries, rifle and a silver 
trophy he stole from somewhere in the house. 

KIT
That guy could sell that list I gave him as a sample of my 
handwriting.

Holly starts off, 

KIT (continuing)
Hey, why're you always walking ahead of me?

HOLLY
Well, why you always walking behind me?

Kit grabs the seat of her pants. 

HOLLY
Don't.

KIT
Anybody ever done that to you before?

HOLLY
No.

KIT
Positive?

HOLLY
Yes.

KIT
Guess there's no way I'll ever know. For sure.

They round a corner into the garden. 

EXT. BACKYARD 

They walk down the lawn toward the garage. We the TICKING OF 
SPRINKLERS off camera. 

KIT
That guy must pay through the nose to keep this place up... Lawn, 
the gas and electric... Bagworms. Plus the upkeep on the cars... 
Yeah, you get a little money in your pocket, you think all your 
problems are solved. Well, let me tell you, they're not.

They arrive at the Cadillac. Holly sets down her suitcase and 
waits for Kit to open the door for her. 

Kit, who has forgotten this propriety, hurries back and opens the 
door. He throws the suitcase in the back, goes around the front 
of the car and gets in. 

HOLLY
I'd like to get out of here.

KIT
Soon as I start the car... and fix my hat.

He adjusts his hat, starts the car and they drive off, past a 
Rolls Royce Kit has declined in favor of the Cadillac. 

EXT. BADLANDS - EXTREME LONG SHOT 

The car races across the open prairie. 

HOLLY (v.o.)
Fearing there'd be roadblocks on the highways, we took off across 
that area known as the Great Plains. Kit told me to enjoy the 
scenery, and I did.

INT. CADILLAC 

Holly reads to Kit from a movie fan magazine. 

HOLLY
"Rumor
Pat Boone is seriously considering giving up his career so he can 
return to school full-time and complete his education. Fact
Pat has told intimates that so long as things are going well for 
his career, it's the education that will have to take the back 
seat."

KIT
I don't blame him.

HOLLY
"Rumor
Frank Sinatra and Rita Hayworth are in love... Fact
True, but not with each other."

Kit chuckles at this, which pleases Holly. 

EXT. TELEPHONE POLES 

The Cadillac heads overland, along a line of telephone poles that 
stretches out clear to the horizon. 

HOLLY (v.o.)
Through desert and mesa, across the endless miles of open range, 
we made our headlong way, steering by the telephone lines toward 
the mountains of Montana.

DISSOLVE TO


EXT. MOUNTAIN 

Heat waves rise off the land. A mountain is barely discernible in 
the distance. 

DISSOLVE TO


EXT. BADLANDS 

The Cadillac races through a herd of cows, 

HOLLY (v.o.) Kit'd sometimes ram a cow, to save on ammo, and we'd 
cook it.

CLOSE ON SALT GRASS 

Tight shot of a clump of salt grass. 

HOLLY (v.o.)
Once we had to eat a bunch of salt grass. It tasted like cabbage.

EXT. BADLANDS - DAWN 

THE CAMERA RISES over the Cadillac as it races down a deserted 
country road at dawn, 

EXT. PIPELINE WAYSTATION 

The Cadillac is stopped beside a pipeline waystation. Kit has 
tapped some gas off the head. 

HOLLY (v.o.)
For gas we used the leakage from the valves of the pipelines we 
found along the way. Drip gas is what they call it in that part 
of the country.

DISSOLVE TO


EXT. BADLANDS 

The Cadillac roars through a stand of mesquite and disappears 
into the distance. 

HOLLY (v.o.)
Little by little we approached the border. Kit was glad to leave 
South Dakota behind and cursed its name. He said that if the 
Communists ever dropped the atomic bomb, he wished they'd put it 
right in the middle of Rapid City.

EXT. CAMPSITE 

They are camped out in the middle of the badlands. Kit cooks some 
meat over a fire, Holly, with a map under her arm, points into 
the distance. 

HOLLY
That's Montana over there.

KIT
I never been to Montana... Acquaintance of mine has, but I 
hadn't... Never had any reason to.

Holly sits down and looks at the map. 

HOLLY
State bird's a meadowlark.

EXT. PAN ACROSS BADLANDS 

The CAMERA PANS across the badlands. There Is not a tree or a 
bush in sight. It comes to rest on Kit, who carries his rifle 
over his shoulders the way James Dean did in "Giant". 

KIT'S P.O.V. - SERIES OF ANGLES 

Various sights of the prairie
a distant mountain, a wild turkey, a lizard, a burst of 
lightening in a cloud on the horizon, a falcon. Kit takes all 
this in, then he turns back to the campsite. The sun is down, 
just barely, and the moon has risen behind him. Holly is heard 
over this last shot. 

HOLLY (v.o.)
We lived in utter loneliness, neither here nor there. Kit said 
that solitude was a better word, cause it meant more exactly what 
I wanted to say. Whatever the expression, I told him we couldn't 
go on living this way.

INT. CADILLAC 

Kit and Holly sit in the back seat of the Cadillac. They have 
been necking. Her hair is in curlers. 

KIT (responding to v.o.)
Why not? I mean, I'm having fun... At least I'm not bitching.

HOLLY
Well, I feel kind of like an animal living out here. I mean, 
there's no place to bathe and... no place to get anything good to 
eat.

KIT
Well, I'll catch you a big trout. Soon as we get to the 
mountains.

He kisses her. She gives in reluctantly. After a while they 
break. 

KIT
Everybody loves trout.

HOLLY
I'm serious.

They neck some more. then break again. Kit looks out one window, 
Holly out the other. 

EXT. DISTANT TRAIN 

A train moves slowly across the horizon. 

HOLLY (v.o.)
In the distance I saw a train making its way silently across the 
plain, like the caravan in "The Adventures of Marco Polo." It was 
our first taste of civilization in days, and I asked Kit if we 
could have a closer look.

EXT. KIT - WITH FOOTBALL 

Kit sets a football down on the ground, backs off a few steps, 
squats and shoots a hole through it with his pistol. To his 
surprise. it does not deflate. He moves closer and pounds it flat 
with the barrel of the pistol. 

HOLLY (v.o.)
Before we left he shot a football that he considered excess 
baggage.

TIGHT ON SUITCASE 

Kit is burying some things from Holly's suitcase in a bucket
the trophy he took from the mansion, her stereopticon slides, a 
doll, a spark plug, a pack of Camels, etc. 

HOLLY (v.o.)
Afterwards he took and buried some of our things in a bucket. He 
said that nobody else would know where we'd put them, and that 
we'd come back someday, maybe, and they'd still be sitting here, 
just the same, but we'd be different. And if we never got back, 
well, somebody might dig them up a thousand years from now and 
wouldn't they wonder!

EXT. BADLANDS 

The Cadillac speeds across the plains. A plume of dust stretches 
out behind it. 

EXT. RAIL TRESTLE 

Kit and Holly have parked the Cadillac under a rail trestle. A 
train is approaching. They hide beside the car. The train, a 
streamliner, roars overhead. When it has passed, Holly rushes up 
the grade to watch it disappear into the distance. Kit watches 
from the opposite end of the trestle. 

KIT
Maybe we should've tried to hop it.

HOLLY
It was going too fast.

KIT
I could've pulled the car up on the tracks, slowed it down some.

HOLLY (o.c.)
Yeah, then we'd be stuck here.

KIT
Well, maybe we oughta be stuck here. I'm not saying that I know.

He stoops down and picks up a Pepsi bottle. 

HOLLY
You're crazy.

He climbs over the edge of the trestle, looks back at her oddly, 
then leaps down to the ground. Holly walks down to meet him. 

HOLLY (v.o.)
Kit took the bottle and spun it around, leaving to fate which 
direction we should take.

TIGHT ON BOTTLE 

Kit spins the bottle. 

EXT. BOTTOM OF TRESTLE 

The bottle comes to a stop. Kit inspects its position. He does 
not appear satisfied, though. 

KIT
Well, maybe the slope here is throwing it off some. We ought to 
find a more flat place.

HOLLY
How about over here?

Kit starts toward her, then changes his mind and heads back up 
the grade, to the tracks. The CAMERA DOLLIES and CRANES with him. 

KIT
Never mind. It doesn't matter... If I'm worth a damn, I'll pick 
the right direction. And if I'm not, well, I don't care. See what 
I mean?

HOLLY (o.c.)
No.

KIT
Well, I shouldn't expect miracles, should I?

He stops at the top of the grade and looks out across the 
Badlands. 

KIT
We'll keep on heading for that mountain... Just remember I said 
it wasn't such a hot idea.

DISSOLVE TO


EXT. TRESTLE - DUSK 

The Cadillac pulls out from under the trestle and heads down a 
dusty road alongside the tracks. 

HOLLY (v.o.)
We took off at sunset, on a line toward the mountains of 
Saskatchewan, for Kit a magical land beyond the reach of the law. 
He needed me now more than ever, but something had come between 
us. I'd stopped even paying attention to him. Instead, I sat in 
the car and read a map and spelled out entire sentences with my 
tongue on the roof of my mouth, where nobody could read them.

DISSOLVE TO


EXT. MOUNTAIN - DUSK 

The Cadillac beads off across the plains toward a distant 
mountain. 

HOLLY (v.o.)
That night we moved closer to the border, and clear across the 
prairie, at the very edge of the horizon... 

EXT. REFINERY FIRES - NIGHT 

A refinery fire. 

HOLLY (v.o.)
W could make out the gas fires of the refinery at Missoula, while 
to the south...

EXT. CITY LIGHTS - NIGHT 

HOLLY (v.o.)
... we could see the lights of Cheyenne, a city bigger and 
grander than I'd ever seen.

EXT. CADILLAC'S POV ON PRAIRIE 

The prairie rushes under the Cadillac's headlights. 

HOLLY (v.o.) I felt all kind of things looking at the lights of 
Cheyenne, but most important, I made up my mind to never again 
tag around with a hell-bent type, no matter how in love with him 
I was. Finally, I found the strength to tell Kit this. I pointed 
out that even If we got to the Far North, he still couldn't make 
a living.

INT. CADILLAC - NIGHT 

Kit and Holly's faces are strangely lit by the dash lights. Holly 
is absorbed in her map. The radio is on. 

KIT
(responding to v.o.) I could get a job with the Mounties. The 
Northwest Mounties ... Hell, I got all the qualifications. I can 
ride, shoot and... I don't mind the cold. Fact. I kind of like 
the cold.

Holly looks up from the map. 

HOLLY
What?

KIT
Nothing... I was just running off at the mouth... as usual.

HOLLY
I'm sorry. I wasn't listening.

Holly lights a cigarette. 

KIT
I was just talking about going after a job... Hey. don't lip it.

He reaches over and takes the cigarette out of her mouth. The 
CAMERA PANS to her with this gesture. 

HOLLY
You know... they'd probably ask to see your driver's license 
before they hired you.

KIT (o.c.)
Well. I'm not going to let that stop me.

When the CAMERA PANS BACK to him, he is looking at her cigarette. 

KIT
You smoke Pall Mall?

HOLLY
Yeah.

He is surprised to discover this. 

KIT
Nah, you hadn't seen me when I'm going after something, honey. 
Tough?

He cocks his head just thinking about it. She reaches for the 
radio to change the station. He pats her hand away. 

KIT
Hey. don't touch that... Nat King Cole.

EXT. BADLANDS - NIGHT 

They dance in the headlights to the tune of "A Blossom Fell" 
coming over the car radio. She is wearing the rich man's jacket. 
After a moment Kit whispers in her ear. 

KIT
Boy, if I could sing a song like that... I mean, if I could sing 
a song about the way I feel right now, it'd be a hit.

They continue dancing. 

EXT. CADILLAC ON PLAINS - DAY 

Two shots of the Cadillac heading across the Badlands at dawn. 

HOLLY (v.o.)
Kit knew the end was coming. He wondered if he'd hear the doctor 
pronounce him dead, or if he'd be able to read what the papers 
would say about him,the next day, from the other side. He dreaded 
the iea of being shot down alone, he said, without a girl to 
scream out his name.

INT. CADILLAC - DAWN 

Holly yawns with fatigue. 

HOLLY (v.o.)
Then, for an instant, the sight of the mountains in the dawn 
light got his hopes back up.

Kit shakes his head with admiration and wonder. 

KIT
God, what a sight... Tell me this, honey. What does a little 
Texas girl like yourself think of a sight like that?

She turns to look at the mountains. 

EXT. MOUNTAINS - THEIR POV 

Mountains in the distance closer now than ever before. 

DISSOLVE TO


EXT. OIL RIG 

The Cadillac drives up to an oil rig. Kit gets out of the car. 

KIT
Love this air.

The ROUGHNECK in charge of the rig steps out of his trailer. It 
seems there is nobody else around. 

KIT
Morning... Say, you got any gas?

ROUGHNECK
Maybe.

KIT
Well. I'm sorry. sir. but we've got to ask you for it.

Holly walks over to inspect the rig. 

KIT (o.c.)
See, we're about out... been driving all night. Actually, I don't 
even have time to explain it to you.

ROUGHNECK (o.c.)
Well, matter of fact, I don't have any.

KIT
Just a second now. That's your truck. isn't it?

He points to a truck linked to the front of the trailer. Holly 
looks idly around. Suddenly her expression changes, for what 
reason it is not clear. 

KIT (o.c.)
You didn't walk out here.

ROUGHNECK (o.c.)
It's mine all right.

KIT
Well, listen. I'm going to swap you my Cadillac.

The Roughneck does not understand what Kit is up to. 

KIT
Now don't worry. You're getting a fair deal. Hell. what's the 
blue book value on this thing, Mildred?

He slaps the hood of the Cadillac and looks to Holly. She is 
still preoccupied with whatever it is she has seen, though. 

ROUGHNECK (o.c.)
Who are you?

KIT
Name is Carruthers. Believe I shoot people every now and then. 
Not that I deserve a medal.

Holly signals Kit with a nod at the horizon. 

HOLLY
Kit!

Kit looks up and sees a helicopter in the distance. He hesitates 
a moment, then draws his gun. 

KIT
Okay, friend. start running.

ROUGHNECK (o.c.)
Just gimme a chance.

KIT
Git.

Holly moves around the side of the rig and sits against a tire. 
Kit joins her. 

KIT
Boy. I had a feeling today was going to be the day... Helicopter.

HOLLY
Yeah.

KIT
He's not coming to take us for a ride. either. Come on, let's 
make a run for the car.

He starts off in the direction of the car, but Holly calls him 
back. 

HOLLY
I don't want to.

Kit looks at her. surprised. 

KIT
Have you got a better idea?

HOLLY
I just don't want to go.

KIT
What?

She shrugs. He stares at her for a moment, then bows his head and 
walks off a distance. 

KIT
What is wrong with you, huh?

He kicks wildly at dust. 

KIT
What is the matter with you, huh!?

Meanwhile, the helicopter continues its approach. Kit walks in 
closer to Holly. 

KIT
Boy, I don't know what to make of you. People like you.

He kicks at the rigs then turns back to face her. 

KIT
You want a second chance, then listen. Twelve noon the Grand 
Coulee Dam, New Year'ss Day. 1964. You meet me there... Now you 
got that?

She nods, bewildered. The helicopter is landing. He grabs a 
discarded fender off the truck, hangs it over his arm like a 
shield and runs to the Cadillac, exchanging shots with a State 
Trooper who has arrived in the helicopter. The Trooper is hit and 
falls. Kit jumps in the car and roars off. Holly surrenders 
herself to the pilot of the helicopter and is taken off. 

EXT. GAS STATION 

Kit pulls into a gas station. He gets out of his car and drums on 
the roof. 

KIT
Hey, anybody here?

An ATTENDANT walks out the door. 

KIT
Hi... Say,, you got any shells for a Savage, a .300 Savage?

ATTENDANT
Nope.

KIT
Damn. I pissed all mine away shooting up bottles... You want to 
fill her up for me? Please?

The Attendant nods. Kit pulls Holly's suitcase out of the back 
seat and walks over to a trash can at the edge of the apron. Kit 
throws Holly's things methodically into the trash can. After a 
while he comes upon a book. He opens the book and looks through 
it, then turns to find the Attendant staring at him. As he gets 
to his feet. he nods at the trash can. 

KIT
If you want any of that junk, it's yours.

Meanwhile, a police car approaches the station. Kit sees it at 
about the same time the police see him. He throws his book in the 
car and roars out of the station. The police car goes into a 
bootlegger's turn and takes off after him. 

CHASE - SERIES OF ANGLES 

Kit heads down the highway. After a while he turns off onto a 
dirt road. The police keep up with him.. He flips on the radio 
and fires back at them. The dust is so heavy that they have a 
hard time just keeping track of him. He checks his own appearance 
and general demeanor in the rear view mirror, then swerves off 
the road onto the prairie. The police manage to keep up. Together 
they roar through a herd of cows and barb wire fence. The police 
car slams into Kit, trying to slow him down. Kit slams back into 
the police car. They return to the road. Kit makes a ninety-
degree turn but the police car loses traction and rolls onto its 
side, then back onto four wheels again, stalled. Kit sees that he 
has lost them. He checks himself out in the mirror again, puts on 
the rich man's hat and skids to a stop. The police car gets back 
underway. During these last few moments Holly is heard on VOICE 
OVER. 

HOLLY (v.o.)
Often I've wondered what was going through Kit's head before they 
got him and why he didn't make a run for it while he still had 
the chance. Did he figure theyld just catch up with him the next 
day? Was it despair? He claimed to having a flat tire, but the 
way he carried on about it, I suspect this is false.

EXT. ROAD 

Kit shoots a hole in the tire of the Cadillac, then climbs up on 
the hood. We see how far behind the police are. He checks his 
pulse and jumps back down. He scurries around collecting rocks 
from the shoulder as the police approach from the distance. He 
makes a stack of the rocks to mark the site of his capture for 
posterity, finishing just as the police car skids to a stop. Kit 
throws up his hands and walks forward to meet them. Their guns 
are drawn. 

KIT
Hi.

SHERIFF
Hold it right there.

KIT
I could've held off an army if I could've gotten behind a rock in 
the mountains.

DEPUTY (o.c.)
Oh yeah?

KIT (nodding)
Long as my ammo held out... Right there's where you caught me.

He nods at the stack of rocks. The Sheriff frisks him as the 
Deputy covers. 

DEPUTY
We did it, Ray.

KIT
You better not leave that Cadillac sitting out here.

The Sheriff takes out a pair of handcuffs. 

SHERIFF
Put your hands in back of your head.

The Sheriff claps the handcuffs on one of Kit's wrists. 

SHERIFF
Now put the other one on yourself.

Kit does as the Sheriff asks. The Deputy holsters his pistol and 
walks forward to inspect their prize. He and KIT exchange 
glances. 

DEPUTY (to Sheriff)
Hell, he ain't no bigger than I am.

The Sheriff sticks his pistol in Kit's ear and leads him off 
toward the police car. 

KIT
You're going to give me a cauliflower ear, Sheriff.

The Sheriff gives Kit a shove. 

DEPUTY
He should've thought about that before he got caught... Shouldn't 
he?

The Deputy draws his pistol and fires a shot into the neighboring 
field. Kit is startled. The Deputy makes the same motion, this 
time without firing. 

DEPUTY
Hup!

EXT. HIGHWAY 

The police car sails down an open stretch of highway. 

INT. POLICE CAR 

Kit thinks for a while, then turns to the Sheriff, who is 
driving. 

KIT
Think I'll take the juice?

SHERIFF
Beats me.

The Deputy, fascinated, watches all this from the back seat. Kit 
turns to him. 

KIT
Say, what kind of rifle was that you were shooting at me?

DEPUTY
Thirty aught six.

KIT (o.c.)
You ever had to open it up like that before?

DEPUTY
Nope.

Kit turns back around. 

KIT (reassuringly)
Well, you boys have performed like a couple of heroes... And 
don't think I'm not going to pass it around when we get to town.

The Sheriff lifts the hat off Kit's head and tosses it out the 
window. It rolls to a stop on the highway behind them. 

KIT
You tossed my hat out the window.

SHERIFF (o.c.)
Wanta sue me?

KIT
No.

DEPUTY
Kit... Kit, I've got a question for you.

KIT
Mmmmm.

DEPUTY
You like people?

KIT
They're okay.

DEPUTY
Then why'd you do it?

KIT
I don't know. Always wanted to be a criminal, I guess. Just not 
this big a one... Takes all kinds though.

Kit gets a smile from the Deputy. The Deputy turns to the 
Sheriff. 

DEPUTY
You know who that sombitch looks like? (no reply) You know, don't 
you?

Kit is anxious to hear the answer. 

SHERIFF (o.c.)
No.

DEPUTY
I'll kiss your ass if he don't look like James Dean.

Kit drops his eyes and turns away, deeply gratified by this 
remark. The Sheriff smiles at the Deputy in the rear mirror. The 
car roars past a freight train. 

INT. AIRPORT HANGAR 

Kit stands on the wing of a light plane, inside a large hangar at 
the local airport. He is shackled in a leather transfer vest. He 
takes souvenirs out of his pockets and tosses them out to a crowd 
of Montana State Troopers and National Guardsmen milling around 
on the tarmac ground below him. 

MECHANIC
How you doing there, Kit?

KIT (o.c.)
Fine as can be expected. Just locked up, can't move.

MECHANIC (o.c.)
That's a nice little coat you got on there.

KIT
You think?... it's leather.

He takes out his cigarette lighter. 

KIT
Hey, now here's a real prize. I must've had this about ten years. 
Who's going to get it?

VOICE (o.c.)
Gimme that sombitch.

KIT
There you go.

SECOND VOICE (o.c.)
Where you from?

KIT
South Dakota. Where you from?

SECOND VOICE (o.c.)
Here.

KIT
Want a comb?

He takes a comb out of his pocket and pitches it down to 
somebody. He ignores most of the questions coming at him. 

THIRD VOICE (o.c.)
Joni James is from South Dakota.

KIT
Yeah, she got out of there, too.

FOURTH VOICE (o.c.)
You ever been to Kansas?

FIFTH VOICE (o.c.)
Hey, Kit. whot's your favorite singer?

KIT
Eddie Fisher. Who's yours?

FIFTH VOICE (o.c.)
Eddie Fisher.

KIT
Damn! Want a pen?

He pitches the man a ballpoint. The CAMERA MOVES BACK to a WIDE 
SHOT of the whole scene. 

SIXTH VOICE (o.c.)
How old are you?

KIT
Don't you read the papers?

SIXTH VOICE (.o.c.)
You ever been married?

KIT
No sir, I hadn't.

EXT. HANGAR - SERIES OF ANGLES 

Various SHOTS of the National Guardsmen dozing on the pavement. 
playing cards beside the hangar, a little bored. Also a shot of 
Holly with the Sheriff and Deputy. 

SEVENTH VOICE (o.c.)
Hey, Kit, you afraid of death?

KIT (o.c.)
I hadn't thought about it much.

INT. HANGAR 

The Deputy walks up to Kit with some legal papers. 

KIT
Hey, listen, Tom, I don't mean to tell you how to run your show 
here but these cuffs are pinching. What do you say now? 

DEPUTY
I need to get your signature on some papers here, Kit.

KIT
Well, I've got to read them first. Suppose I could get a Coke 
while I do?

DEPUTY
Sure thing. Come on.

He gives Kit the papers and leads him out of the hangar. Kit 
turns back to the crowd inside. 

KIT
You boys keep out of trouble.

GUARDSMAN
Don't worry about us.

DEPUTY
Holly's over here, Kit. if you want to see her.

KIT
Sure.

EXT. POLICE CAR 

Holly leans against the fender of the police car. She wears 
handcuffs. Kit turns to a State Trooper who holds him by a 
tether. 

KIT
You want to give me a little slack here?

The Trooper pays out the slack. Kit leans against the car. He and 
Holly exchange looks. 

KIT
Don't worry now.. I'm going to get you off these charges... 
There's a whole lot of other boys out there. You're going to have 
a lot of fun.

Holly looks down. 

KIT
Boy, we rang the bells, didn't we?

Holly does not reply. 

KIT
I'll say one thing, though... That guy with the deaf maid? He's 
just lucky he's not dead, too.

Holly does not appreciate the humor of this. Kit, chastened, 
turns serious. 

KIT
Course it's too bad about your dad.

HOLLY
Yeah.

KIT
We're going to have to sit down, and talk about that sometime.

He looks up at the SOUND of an incoming plane. 

EXT. AIRPORT - SERIES OF ANGLES 

The plane that will take them back to South Dakota, a B-25, comes 
in for a landing. The mass of Troopers and National Guardsmen, 
with Kit and Holly, walks out to meet it. A jeep leads it down 
the taxiway. A civilian bystander points Kit and Holly out to a 
young boy he holds in his arms. 

EXT. PLANE 

Kit signs his extradition papers on the back of the Chief 
Trooper, gives them to the Deputy and shakes hands with the 
Chief. 

KIT
Thank you very much, Chief Sims. Sorry if I caused you any 
inconvenience.

CHIEF
You didn't cause me any trouble.

KIT
Thanks anyway.

He turns to shake hands with the Deputy. The planets engines whir 
to life. 

DEPUTY
Well, Kit...

KIT
Tom...

DEPUTY
Good luck to you.

KIT
Thanks.

DEPUTY
I mean it.

KIT
I know you do. Good luck to you, too.

TROOPER
Now we go.

The Trooper pulls him toward the plane. Kit calls Holly. 

KIT
Come on, Red.

EXT. RUNWAY - SERIES OF ANGLES 

The props start turning. The crowd waves goodbye as the boarding 
door is closed. The wheels turn toward the sun. The Guardsmen 
race back to their trucks. A mailman carries off the mail bags he 
collected from the plane. The plane taxies down the runway and 
lifts into the air. 

HOLLY (v.o.)
Kit and I were taken back to South Dakota. They kept him in 
solitary, so he didn't have a chance to get acquainted with the 
other inmates, though he was sure they'd like him, especially the 
murderers. Myself, I got off with probation and a lot of nasty 
looks. Later I married the son of the lawyer who defended me. 
(pause) Kit went to sleep in the courtroom while his confession 
was being read, and he was sentenced to die in the electric 
chair. On a warm spring night, six months later, after donating 
his body to science, he did. 

With Holly's last words we CUT INSIDE the cabin of the plane. 

INT. CABIN 

Kit sits next to the Trooper at the back of the plane. Holly sits 
opposite them, with a Detective behind her. Kit's attention is 
fixed on the military hat in the Trooper's lap. 

KIT
Sir... Where'd you get that hat?

TROOPER
State.

KIT
Boy, I'd like to buy me one of those.

The Trooper smiles. Holly looks up. 

TROOPER
You're quite an individual, Kit.

KIT
Think they'll take that into consideration?

The Trooper smiles and looks out the window. Kit looks to Holly, 
to see if she has taken this remark in the proper spirit. She 
smiles and looks out the window. 

EXT. CLOUDS - HOLLY'S POV - DUSK 

An unbroken sea of clouds stretches out before her. 

FADE OUT.

          INT. A BEDROOM - NIGHT

          It is dark; we don't see clearly.  a man and woman make love 
          on a brass bed.  There are mirrors on the walls and ceiling.  
          On a side table, atop a small mirror, lines of cocaine.  A 
          tape deck PLAYS the Stones "Sympathy for the Devil."

          Atop him... she straddles his chest... her breasts in his face.  
          He cups her breasts.  She leans down, kisses him...

          JOHNNY BOZ is in his late 40's, slim, good-looking.  We don't 
          see the woman's face.  She has long blonde hair.  The CAMERA 
          STAYS BEHIND and to the side of them.

          She leans close over his face, her tongue in his mouth...  she 
          kisses him... she moves her hands up, holds both of his arms 
          above his head.

          She moves higher atop him... she reaches to the side of the 
          bed... a white silk scarf is in her hand... her hips above his 
          face now, moving... slightly, oh-so slightly... his face strains 
          towards her.

          The scarf in her hand... she ties his hands with it...  
          gently... to the brass bed... his eyes are closed...  tighter... 
          lowering hips into his face... lower... over his chest... his 
          navel.  The SONG plays.

          He is inside her... his head arches back... his throat white.

          She arches her back... her hips grind... her breasts are high...

          Her back arches back... back... her head tilts back... she 
          extends her arms... the right arm comes down suddenly...  the 
          steel flashes... his throat is white...

          He bucks, writhes, bucks, convulses...

          It flashes up... it flashes down... and up... and down...  and 
          up... and...

          EXT. A BROWNSTONE IN PACIFIC HEIGHTS - MORNING

          Winter in San Francisco cold, foggy.  Cop cars everywhere.  
          The lights play through the thick fog.  Two Homicide detectives 
          get out of the car, walk into the house.

          NICK CURRAN is 42.  Trim, good-looking, a nice suit; a face 
          urban, edged, shadowed.  GUS MORAN is 64.  Crew-cut, silver 
          beard, a suit rumpled and shiny, a hat out of the 50'sa face 
          worn and ruined the face of a backwoods philosopher.

          INT. THE BROWNSTONE

          There's money here -- deco, clean, hip -- That looks like a 
          Picasso on the wall.  They check it out.

                                    GUS
                        Who was this fuckin' guy?

                                    NICK
                        Rock and roll, Gus.  Johnny Boz.

                                    GUS
                        I never heard of him.

                                    NICK
                               (grins)
                        Before your time, pop.
                               (a beat)
                        Mid-sixties.  Five or six hits.
                        He's got a club down in the Fillmore 
                        now.

                                    GUS
                        Not now he don't.

          Past the uniformed guys... nods... waves... past the forensic 
          men... past the coroner's investigators... they get to the 
          bedroom.

          INT. THE BEDROOM

          They walk in, stare -- it's messy.

          It's like a convention in here.  LT. PHIL WALKER, in his 50's, 
          silver-haired, the Homicide guys; JIM HARRIGAN, late 40's, 
          puffy, affable;  SAM ANDREWS, 30's, black.  A CORONER'S MAN is 
          working the bed.

                                    LT. WALKER
                               (to Nick and Gus)
                        You guys know Captain Talcott?

          They nod.

                                    GUS
                        What's the Chief's office doin' 
                        here.

                                    CAPT. TALCOTT
                        Observing.

                                    LT. WALKER
                               (to the Coroner's 
                               Guy)
                        What do you think, Doc?

                                    THE CORONER'S GUY
                        The skin blanches when I press it --
                        this kind of color is about right 
                        for six or eight hours.

                                    LT. WALKER
                        Nobody say anything.  The maid 
                        came in an hour ago and found him.
                        She's not a live-in.

                                    GUS
                        Maybe the maid did it.

                                    LT. WALKER
                        She's 54 years old and weighs 240 
                        pounds.

                                    THE CORONER'S GUY
                               (deadpan)
                        There are no bruises on his body.

                                    GUS
                               (grins)
                        It ain't the maid.

                                    LT. WALKER
                        He left the club with his girlfriend 
                        about midnight.  That's the last 
                        time anybody saw him.

                                    NICK
                               (looks at body)
                        What was it?

                                    THE CORONER'S GUY
                        Ice pick.  Left on the coffee table 
                        in the living room.  Thin steel 
                        handle.  Forensics took it downtown.

                                    HARRIGAN
                        There's come all over the sheets --
                        he got off before he got offed.

                                    GUS
                               (deadpan)
                        That rules the maid out for sure.

                                    CAPT. TALCOTT
                        This is sensitive.  Mr. Boz was a 
                        major contributor to the mayor's

                               (to Nick)
                        I thought you said he was a rock 
                        and roll star.

                                    LT. WALKER
                        He was a retired rock and roll 
                        star.

                        A civic-minded, very respectable 
                        rock and roll star.

                                    GUS
                        What's that over there?

          We see the white powder laid out in lines on the small mirror 
          on the side table.

                                    NICK
                               (deadpan)
                        It looks like some civic-minded, 
                        very respectable cocaine to me, 
                        Gus.

                                    CAPT. TALCOTT
                               (evenly, to Nick)
                        Listen to me, Curran.  I'm going 
                        to get a lot of heat on this.  I 
                        don't want any... mistakes.

          Nick and Talcott look at each other a beat, then --

                                    NICK
                        Who's the girlfriend?

          Lt. Walker looks at the notepad in his hand.

                                    LT. WALKER
                        Catherine Tramell, 162 Divisadero.

          Nick writes it down.  He and Gus turn, leave.  Captain Talcott 
          watches them.  He looks disturbed.

          INT. THE LIVING ROOM

          As they head out --

                                    NICK
                        Talcott doesn't usually show up at 
                        the office 'till after his 18 holes.  
                        What are they nervous about?

                                    GUS
                        They're executives.  They're nervous 
                        about everything.

                                    LT. WALKER
                        Nick!

          He stops, turns, sees Walker behind them.  Walker comes up to 
          them.

                                    LT. WALKER
                               (to Nick)
                        Keep your three o'clock.

                                    NICK
                        Do you want me to work the case, 
                        Phil, or do you want me to --

                                    LT. WALKER
                        I said keep it.

          EXT. A VICTORIAN ON DIVISADERO - DAY

          It is more a mansion than a house.  They ring the bell.  An 
          Hispanic MAID answers.  They flash their badges.

                                    NICK
                        I'm Detective Curran, this is 
                        Detective Moran.  We're with the 
                        San Francisco Police Department.

          We'd like to speak to Ms. Catherine Tramell.

                                    THE MAID
                               (after a beat, an 
                               accent)
                        Just moment.  Come in.

          She leads them into a lavish, beautifully done living room 
          that offers a sweeping view of the Bay.

                                    THE MAID
                        Sit, please.  Just moment.

          They look around, impressed.  There is a Picasso on the wall 
          here, too.

                                    GUS
                        Ain't that cute?  They got his and 
                        her Pig-assos, son.

                                    NICK
                               (smiles)
                        I didn't know you knew who Picasso 
                        was, Gus.

                                    GUS
                               (grins)
                        I'm a smart sonofabitch.  I just 
                        hide it.

          Nick smiles -- and at that moment a beautiful BLONDE walks 
          into the room.  She looks like she has been asleep.  She is in 
          her early 20's.  She wears a very sheer robe.

                                    NICK
                        We're sorry to disturb you, we'd 
                        like to ask you some --

                                    THE WOMAN
                        Are you vice?

                                    GUS
                               (after a beat)
                        Homicide.

                                    THE WOMAN
                        What do you want?

                                    GUS
                        When was the last time you saw 
                        John Boz? 

                                    THE WOMAN
                        Is he dead?

                                    NICK
                               (after a beat)
                        Why do you think he's dead?

                                    THE WOMAN
                        You wouldn't be here otherwise, 
                        would you?

                                    GUS
                        Were you with him last night?

                                    THE WOMAN
                        You're looking for Catherine, not 
                        me.

                                    NICK
                        Who are you?

                                    THE WOMAN
                        I'm Roxy.
                               (a beat)
                        I'm her -- friend.

          She looks at them a beat.

                                    ROXY
                        She's out at the beach house at 
                        Stinson.  Seadrift.  1402.

                                    NICK
                        Thanks.

          They start to head out.

                                    ROXY
                        You're wasting your time. Catherine 
                        didn't kill him.

          A beat, they look at her, and go...

          EXT. SEADRIFT - STINSON BEACH - DAY

          Foggy.  Cold.  It is an expensive spit of land on the ocean.  
          Multi-million dollar "beach houses" with gardens and swimming 
          pools.  There are two Ferraris in the driveway -- one black, 
          one white.

          They get out of the car in front of the house.  They see a 
          woman in back of the house, sitting on a deck chair, staring 
          at the sea, a blanket around her.  As they get to her --

                                    NICK
                        Ms. Tramell?

          She takes a long look a Nick, then looks away.

          CATHERINE TRAMELL is 30 years old.  She has long blonde hair 
          and a refined, classically beautiful face.  She is not knockout 
          gorgeous like Roxy; there is a smoky kind of sensuousness about 
          her.

                                    NICK
                        I'm De...

                                    CATHERINE
                               (evenly)
                        I know who you are.

          She doesn't look at them.  She looks at the water.

                                    CATHERINE
                        How did he die?

                                    GUS
                        He was murdered.

                                    CATHERINE
                        Really.  Maybe that's why you're 
                        from Homicide.  How?

          Nick glances at Gus.

                                    NICK
                        With an ice pick.

          She closes her eyes a beat and then, still staring out, we see 
          a thin smile.  They see it, too, and glance at each other.

                                    NICK
                        How long were you dating him?

                                    CATHERINE
                        I wasn't dating him.  I was fucking 
                        him.

          They glance at each other again.

                                    GUS
                        What are you -- a pro?

          Catherine looks at him -- that thin smile again.

                                    CATHERINE
                        No.  I'm an amateur.

          She looks away.

                                    NICK
                        How long were you having sex with 
                        him?

                                    CATHERINE
                        About a year and a half.

                                    NICK
                        Were you with him last night?

                                    CATHERINE
                        Yes.

                                    NICK
                        Did you leave the club with him?

                                    CATHERINE
                        Yes.

                                    NICK
                        Did you go home with him?

                                    CATHERINE
                        No.  We had a drink at the club.
                        We left together.  I came here.  
                        He went home.

                                    NICK
                        Was there anyone with you last 
                        night?

                                    CATHERINE
                               (looks at Nick)
                        No.  I wasn't in the mood to have 
                        sex with anyone last night.

          They look at her a beat.

                                    NICK
                        Let me ask you something, Ms.
                        Tramell?  Are you sorry he's dead?

          Catherine looks at him.

                                    CATHERINE
                        Yes.  I liked fucking him.

          They stare at her.  She looks out at the water.

                                    CATHERINE
                        I don't really feel like talking 
                        anymore.

                                    GUS
                        Listen, lady, we can do this 
                        downtown if you --

                                    CATHERINE
                        Read me my rights and arrest me 
                        and I'll go downtown.

          She doesn't even look at them.

                                    CATHERINE
                               (quietly)
                        Otherwise, get the fuck out of 
                        here.  Please.

          A long beat as they look at her.

          INT. A CORRIDOR - POLICE HEADQUARTERS

          The door says Dr. Elizabeth Gardner, Counseling.  Nick opens 
          the door, peeks in.  The receptionist is not there.  A clock 
          says 3.

          INT. THE COUNSELING OFFICE

          He walks in -- sees the inner door open, walks in.

                                    NICK
                        I'm sorry, Beth.  I -- I got hung 
                        up in Stinson.

          DR. ELIZABETH GARDNER, the police psychologist, is a very good-
          looking, dark-haired woman.  She is 30.

                        My sex life is pretty shitty 
                        actually since I stopped seeing 
                        you -- maybe I should think about 
                        my Electrolux again.

          That embarrassed her; she looks away from him.

                        The powder was cocaine, high-

                        I've asked Dr. Lamott to consult 
                        with us.  This isn't really my 
                        turf.  Dr. Lamott teaches the psycho-
                        pathology of psychopathic behavior 
                        at Stanford and is also a member 
                        of the Justice Department's

                        There are two possibilities.  One.  
                        The person who wrote this book is 
                        your murderer and acted out the 
                        killing described in ritualistic, 
                        literal detail.  Two.  Someone who 
                        wants to do the person who wrote 
                        this book harm read the book and 
                        enacted the killing described to 
                        incriminate the writer.

                               (after a long beat)
                        What if the writer did it?  What 
                        are we dealing with?

                                    DR. LAMOTT
                        You're dealing with a devious, 
                        diabolical mind.  This book must 
                        have been written at least six 
                        months, maybe years before it was 
                        published.  That means the writer 
                        planned the crime, at least in the 
                        subconscious, back then.  The fact 
                        that the writer carried it out 
                        indicates psychopathic obsessive 
                        behavior in terms not only of the 
                        killing itself but in terms of 
                        applied advance defense mechanism.

                        in the exact way I've described in 
                        my book?  I wouldn't do that because 
                        I'd know I'd be a suspect.

                        You're dealing then with someone 
                        so obsessed that he or she is 
                        willing to kill an irrelevant and 
                        innocent victim to place the blame 
                        on the person who wrote this book.  
                        We are talking about deep-seated, 
                        obsessional hatred; an utter lack

                        So what do we do -- nothing?

                                    LT. WALKER
                               (after a beat)
                        We bring her in for questioning.

                                    TALCOTT
                        She's got enough money to burn 
                        this whole department down.

                                    LT. WALKER
                        She was the last person seen with 
                        the guy -- I'll take the 
                        responsibility.

                                    TALCOTT
                        It's yours.

                                    CORRIGAN
                        It won't do any good.  She'll come 
                        in with Lee Bailey and Mel Belli 
                        trailing behind her on a solid 
                        gold chain from Tiffanys.

                                    TALCOTT
                        Yes she will.

                                    NICK
                               (after a beat)
                        No she won't.

          They look at him.

                                    NICK
                               (smiles)
                        I don't think she's going to hide 
                        behind anybody.  I don't think 
                        she's going to hide at all.

                                    TALCOTT
                               (after a beat)
                        I think you're as crazy as she 
                        probably is, Curran.

          Nicks says nothing.

                                    GUS
                        You know what they say: It takes 
                        one to know one.

          Nick looks a Gus, grins.

          EXT. HER HOUSE IN STINSON - DAY

          They walk from the car to the door of the big beach house.

          They ring the bell.  They hear typing inside.  The typing stops.  
          She comes to the door in jeans and a tight-fitting sweatshirt.

                                    NICK
                        Ms. Tramell, we'd like you to come 
                        downtown and answer some questions 
                        for us.

                                    CATHERINE
                        Are you arresting me?

                                    NICK
                        If that's the way you want to play 
                        it.

          They look at each other a beat.

                                    CATHERINE
                               (smiles)
                        Can I change into something more 
                        appropriate?  It'll just take a 
                        minute.

          He nods.

                                    CATHERINE
                        Come in.

          INT. THE HOUSE

          It is beautifully done in a Santa Fe motif.  She goes to a 
          bedroom of the living room.

          Nick sits down on a couch facing the bedroom she's walked into.  
          Gus sits across from him, his back to the bedroom.

          There is a coffee table between them.  She leaves the bedroom 
          door halfway open.

          An old newspaper is on the coffee table.  Nick reaches for it.  
          The headline says VICE COP CLEARED IN TOURIST SHOOTINGS.  A 
          headline underneath says GRAND JURY SAYS SHOOTINGS ACCIDENTAL.  
          There is a photograph of Nick.

          He stares at the paper.

                                    CATHERINE
                        How long will this take?

          Nick puts the paper down on the coffee table.  He is lost in 
          his thoughts.  Gus picks the paper up.

                                    NICK
                               (looks up)
                        I don't know.

          Nick, facing the half open bedroom door, sees a mirror near 
          the wall of the bedroom.  The mirror reflects her in the other 
          corner of the bedroom.  She is taking her clothes off.  He 
          stares.  She strips down.  He sees her back. She has a beautiful 
          body.  Naked, she puts a dress on.  She doesn't put any 
          underwear on.

                                    NICK
                        Do you always keep old newspapers 
                        around?

                                    CATHERINE
                        Only when they make interesting 
                        reading.

          And she is suddenly out of the bedroom.  She stands there, 
          smiles.  They look at each other a long beat.

                                    CATHERINE
                               (finally)
                        I'm ready.

          They get up, head out.

                                    GUS
                        You have the right to an attorney.

                                    CATHERINE
                        Why would I need an attorney?

          INT. THE CAR - DAY

          They sit in the front; she is in the back.  The car goes over 
          the winding, two-lane Mt. Tamalpais road.

          The fog is heavy.  It's starting to rain.  We see the beach 
          far below.

                                    CATHERINE
                        Do you have a cigarette?

                                    NICK
                        I don't smoke.

                                    CATHERINE
                        Yes, you do.

                                    NICK
                        I quit.

          She smiles, looks at him.  A beat, and he turns away.  Another 
          beat, and she lights a cigarette up.

                                    NICK
                        I thought you were out of 
                        cigarettes.

                                    CATHERINE
                        I found some in my purse; would 
                        you like one?

          He turns back to her.

                                    NICK
                        I told you -- I quit.

                                    CATHERINE
                        It won't last.

          A beat, as she looks at him, and then he turns away.

                                    GUS
                        You workin' on another book?

                                    CATHERINE
                        Yes I am.

                                    GUS
                        It must really be somehtin' --makin' 
                        stuff up all the time.

          He watches her in the rearview mirror.

                                    CATHERINE
                        It teaches you to lie.

                                    GUS
                        How's that?

                                    CATHERINE
                        You make it up, but it has to be 
                        believable.  They call it suspension 
                        of disbelief.

                                    GUS
                        I like that.  "Suspension of 
                        Disbelief."

          He smiles at her in the mirror.

                                    NICK
                        What's your new book about?

                                    CATHERINE
                        A detective.  He falls for the 
                        wrong woman.

          He turns back to her.

                                    NICK
                        What happens to him?

          She looks right into his eye.

                                    CATHERINE
                        She kills him.

          A beat, as they look at each other, and then he turns away 
          from her.  Gus watcher her in the rearview mirror.

          INT. A POLICE INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY

          It is large, fluorescent-lighted, antiseptic.

          She walks in with Nick and Gus.  In the room are prosecutor 
          John Corrigan, Lt. Walker, Captain Talcott, Harrigan, and 
          Andrews.  There is a police stenographer a plain young woman 
          in her 20's.

          As soon as she comes in --

                                    CORRIGAN
                        I'm John Corrigan.  I'm an assistant 
                        district attorney, Ms.  Tramell.  
                        Can we get you anything?  Would 
                        you like some coffee?

                                    CATHERINE
                        No thank you.

                                    TALCOTT
                        Are your attorneys --

                                    NICK
                               (hiding a smile)
                        Ms. Tramell waived her right to an 
                        attorney.

          Corrigan and Talcott glance at Nick.  She sees the look.

                                    CATHERINE
                               (smiles)
                        Did I miss something?

                                    NICK
                        I told them you wouldn't want an 
                        attorney present.

                                    LT. WALKER
                        Why have you waived your right to 
                        an attorney, Ms. Tramell?

                                    CATHERINE
                               (to Nick)
                        Why did you think I wouldn't want 
                        one?

                                    NICK
                        I told them you wouldn't want to 
                        hide.

                                    CATHERINE
                        I have nothing to hide.

          The two of them keep their eyes on each other.

          She sits down.  They sit around her.  Nick sits directly across 
          from her.  She lights up a cigarette.  They watch her.  

          She is poised, cool, in complete command of herself.

                                    CORRIGAN
                        There is no smoking in this 
                        building, Ms. Tramell.

                                    CATHERINE
                        What are you going to do?  Charge 
                        me with smoking?

          Ever so casually, she blows her smoke across at Nick.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

          INT. THE INTERROGATION ROOM - LATER

                                    CORRIGAN
                        Would you tell us the nature of 
                        your relationship with Mr. Boz?

                                    CATHERINE
                        I had sex with him for about a 
                        year and a half.  I liked having 
                        sex with him.

          She has control of the room; she looks from one man to the 
          other as she speaks.

                                    CATHERINE
                        He wasn't afraid of experimenting.  
                        I like men like that.  I like men 
                        who give me pleasure.  He gave me 
                        a lot of pleasure.

          A beat, as they watch her.  She is so matter-of-fact.

                                    CORRIGAN
                        Did you ever engage in sado-
                        masochistic activity with him?

                                    CATHERINE
                               (smiles)
                        Exactly what do you have in mind, 
                        Mr. Corrigan.

                                    CORRIGAN
                               (after a beat, little 
                               flustered)
                        Did you ever tie him up?

                                    CATHERINE
                        No.

                                    ANDREWS
                        You never tied him up.

                                    CATHERINE
                        No. Johnny liked to use his hands 
                        too much.  I like hands and fingers.

          They stare at her.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

                        You describe a white silk scarf in 
                        your book.

                                    CATHERINE
                        I've always had a fondness for

                        I have a very vivid imagination.

                                    NICK
                        But you said you liked men to use 
                        their hands.

                                    CATHERINE
                        No.  I said I liked Johnny to use 
                        his hands.
                               (she smiles)
                        I don't give any rules, Nick.  I 
                        go with the flow.

          They have their eyes on each other.

                        Did you kill Mr. Boz, Ms. Tramell?

                                    CATHERINE
                        I'd have to be pretty stupid to 
                        write a book about a killing and 
                        then kill him the way I described 
                        in my book. I'd be announcing myself 
                        as the killer.  I'm not stupid.

          She smiles.

                        We know you're not stupid, Ms.

                        Maybe that's what you're counting 
                        on to get you off the hook.

                                    NICK
                        Writing a book about it gives you 
                        an alibi for not killing him.

                                    CATHERINE
                        Yes it does, doesn't it?

          She holds his eyes a second, then --

                                    CATHERINE
                        The answer is no.  I didn't kill 
                        him.

                        Was that fun for you?

          They don't take their eyes off each other for a second.

                        I think that's irrelevant to this 
                        inquiry.

                        I loved him.  I hurt.

          Their eyes are still on each other.

                        How did you feel when I told you 
                        Johnny Boz had died -- that day at 
                        the beach.

                        you were married, Nick?

          A beat; he stares at her, expressionless.

          She lights a cigarette.  He stares at her.

                                    CATHERINE
                        Would you like a cigarette, Nick?

                        I wanted to write a book about the

                        went down to his club and picked 
                        him up.  Then I had sex with him.

                        You didn't feel anything for him.
                        You just had sex with him for your 
                        book.

          She looks at Nick.

                        In the beginning.  Then I got to

          INT. THE POLICE BUILDING - NIGHT

          We see her in a glass-enclosed cubicle with a polygraph 
          EXAMINER.  Nick stands outside watching her with Gus and Lt. 
          Walker.  Her back is to them.  The Examiner shuts the machine 
          down, gathers rolls of papers, and comes out of the cubicle.

                                    THE EXAMINER
                        No blips, no blood pressure 
                        variations, no pulse variance.  
                        Either she's telling the truth or 
                        I've never met anyone like her.

          A long beat, then --

                                    LT. WALKER
                        Well, I guess that's it.

          A long beat, Nick watches her as she sits inside.

                                    NICK
                        How does somebody beat this machine?

                                    THE EXAMINER
                        Ninety-nine point nine percent of 
                        the cases, they don't.  You'd have 
                        to be able to mask the truth from 
                        your own central nervous system, 
                        your circulatory system, your 
                        adrenal glands.  In my opinion, 
                        this woman is telling the truth.

          The Examiner walks away.  They stand there. Catherine stands 
          at the door of the cubicle behind them --

                                    CATHERINE
                        Can I go now?

                                    LT. WALKER
                               (after a beat)
                        Yes.  Thanks for coming in, Ms.
                        Tramell.  I'm sorry to inconvenience 
                        you.

          She says nothing, has a thin smile.

                                    CATHERINE
                        Can I ask one of you for a ride?

          They look at her a beat.

                                    NICK
                        Sure.

                        Thanks.

          And he and Catherine walk away.  Gus and Walker watch them.

          INT. HIS CAR - NIGHT

          It is an old, mint-condition silver Porsche.  It is pouring 
          rain; the wind is blowing a San Francisco winter storm.  Nothing 
          is said a long beat as he drives.  She yawns.  Stretches.  He 
          looks at her.

                                    CATHERINE
                               (smiles)
                        I'm tired.

                        It's got to be tiring to beat that 
                        machine.

          She looks at him and looks away.  A beat.

                                    CATHERINE
                        If I were guilty, and if I wanted 
                        to beat that machine, it wouldn't 
                        be tiring.  It wouldn't be tiring 
                        at all.

                                    NICK
                        Why not?

                                    CATHERINE
                        Because I'm a professional liar.  
                        I spend most of my waking hours 
                        dwelling on my lies.
                               (a beat)
                        For my writing.

          He looks at her.

                                    CATHERINE
                               (smiles)
                        I love the rain, don't you?

          He says nothing, doesn't look at her.

                                    CATHERINE
                        You took a polygraph after you 
                        shot those two people, didn't you?

          He looks at her now.

                                    NICK
                        I passed.

                                    CATHERINE
                        You see?  We're both innocent, 
                        Nick.

          He pulls up in front of her house on Divisadero, stops.  He 
          sees the white Ferrari in the driveway.

                                    NICK
                        How do you know all this stuff 
                        about me?

                                    CATHERINE
                        You know all about me.

                                    NICK
                        I don't know anything that isn't 
                        police business.

                                    CATHERINE
                               (after a beat)
                        You know I don't like to wear any 
                        underwear, don't you, Nick?

          They look at each other a beat.

                                    CATHERINE
                               (smiles)
                        Thanks for the ride.

          And she's out of the car.  He watches her as she hurries in 
          the rain -- his eyes on her until the moment she opens the 
          door and is inside.

          INT. THE TEN-FOUR - NIGHT

          It is a police bar, San Francisco style.  Ferns  Joe Montana 
          and Will Clark posters.  The jukebox has a lot of Tony Bennett.

          He walks in.  He sees Lt. Walker at a back booth with Gus, 
          goes to them, sits down.

                                    LT. WALKER
                        What is all this "Nick" stuff --
                        Nick would you like a cigarette.
                        Nick can you give me a ride.

                                    NICK
                        She didn't ask me for the ride.
                        She asked anybody.

                                    LT. WALKER
                        And you volunteered.

          A BARTENDER stays behind the bar, but yells to him.

                                    THE BARTENDER
                        Perrier, Nick?

                                    NICK
                        Double Black Jack rocks, Harry.

                                    GUS
                               (with concern)
                        What you doin', son?

                                    NICK
                        It's my first drink in three months.  
                        That okay with you, pop?
                               (to Lt. Walker)
                        She doesn't know me.  I never saw 
                        her before Gus and I talked to 
                        her.

                                    THE BARTENDER
                        Here you go, Nick.

          He gets up, gets his drink --

                                    NICK
                        Thanks, Harry.

          He sits back down.  He takes a big slug.  They watch him.

                                    LT. WALKER
                        You sure?

                                    NICK
                        I'm sure.

          He takes another big slug.

                                    NICK
                        Now what?

                                    LT. WALKER
                        What now what? Now nothing.  She 
                        passed the polygraph.  That's it.

                                    NICK
                        She knew she could beat it.  That's 
                        why she asked to take it.

                                    LT. WALKER
                        How the fuck do you know?  What is 
                        it with you and this broad anyway?

                                    NICK
                        Come on, Phil.  You're not gonna 
                        let this slide.  What about her 
                        parents?  What about what else 
                        she's published?  At least we should 
                        get the stuff to see if we find 
                        anything else that's an amazing 
                        real-life coincidence.

                                    LT. WALKER
                        Her parents died in an accident.  
                        I don't care what else she's 
                        written.  What are you -- a book 
                        critic?

                                    NICK
                        How did they die?  Was there an 
                        investigation?

                                    LT. WALKER
                        How you're saying she killed her 
                        parents?  Did she kill Bobby 
                        Vasquez, too?

                                    GUS
                        Not unless she got up in the ring 
                        and turned into one mean 
                        sonofabitch.

                                    LT. WALKER
                        Maybe she did, Gus.  Maybe she 
                        grew herself an Afro and learned a 
                        left hook and put shoe polish on 
                        her face.  Let's polygraph her 
                        again and ask her about it.

                                    NICK
                               (casually)
                        Fuck you, Phil.

                                    LT. WALKER
                        Fuck you, too Nick.

          A beat, then --

                                    NICK
                               (calls to the 
                               Bartender)
                        Can you get me another double Black 
                        Jack, Harry.

          Gus looks at him with concern.  A man in his 50's -- LT. MARTIN 
          NILSEN  is suddenly there.  He is overweight, florid.

                                    NILSEN
                               (to Nick)
                        Hey, shooter -- You back on the 
                        Black Jack, Shooter?

          He grins.  Nick doesn't look at him.

                                    LT. WALKER
                        We're discussing a case, Marty.

                                    NILSEN
                        I know that.  I had no doubt of 
                        that.

                                    THE BARTENDER
                        Here you go, Nick.

          Nilsen takes the drink, hands it to Nick.

                                    NILSEN
                               (grins)
                        Double, huh, Shooter?

          Nick turns to him.  He's sitting in the booth; Nilsen is 
          standing there.  Nick looks like he's barely restraining 
          himself.

                                    NICK
                        I'm off-duty, Nilsen.  You hear 
                        me?  I'm off-duty discussing a 
                        case.  Internal Affairs shouldn't 
                        have any trouble with that.  Maybe 
                        I should put in for overtime.

                                    NILSEN
                               (grins)
                        You do that, Shooter.  Why don't 
                        you send it to me?  I'll give it 
                        special attention.

          A beat, and then Nick gets up, faces him.

                                    NICK
                        I'm gonna tell you once more, Nilsen --

          Lt. Walker and Gus get up and hold Nick back.

          Beth Gardner, the police psychologist, is suddenly there.

                                    BETH
                        What's the problem?

                                    NILSEN
                               (grins)
                        No problem, Doctor.  Here comes 
                        the Doctor just in time to save 
                        her patient.  Take care, Shooter.

          And he walks away.  Nick still looks like he wants to go after 
          him.  Beth pulls him away from the booth.

                                    BETH
                        You okay?

                                    NICK
                               (after a beat)
                        Yeah.

                                    BETH
                               (smiles)
                        You don't look so okay.

          Nick looks at her a beat.

                                    NICK
                               (smiles)
                        What are you doing here?

                                    BETH
                               (smiles)
                        Baby-sitting.
                               (she shrugs)
                        Rookie cop.

                                    NICK
                               (smiles)
                        What else is new?

          A beat.  He looks at her again.

                                    NICK
                        You want to get out of here?

          She looks at him a beat.

                                    BETH
                               (smiles)
                        Yes.

          At the booth, Gus and Lt. Walker watch the two of them leave.

                                    GUS
                        Maybe it's for old-time's sake.

                                    LT. WALKER
                               (watches them go 
                               out)
                        Sometimes I think he started banging 
                        her just to get himself off the 
                        hook with Internal Affairs.

                                    GUS
                               (after a beat, smiles)
                        He ain't that way.  He's got heart.

                                    LT. WALKER
                               (smiles)
                        Yeah.  I know.

          INT. BETH'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

          He is kissing her -- hard, rough.  He forces her against the 
          wall.

                                    BETH
                        Don't -- please, Nick --

          We hear her dress RIP.  He kisses her harder -- we hear her 
          panties RIP.  He gets the dress off, pushes his hands under 
          her bra --

                                    BETH
                        Please don't -- don't --

          He puts his mouth to her shoulder, bites it -- as they move 
          down to the floor.

          INT. BETH'S LIVING ROOM - LATER

          It is dark.  The are still partially dressed.  They are on the 
          floor.  He lies on his back, staring at the ceiling.

          She lies next to him -- the torn dress wound around her.

          There is a bite mark on her shoulder.  A long beat, silence -- 
          then --

                                    BETH
                        What was she like?

                                    NICK
                        Who?

                                    BETH
                        Catherine Tramell.

                                    NICK
                               (after a beat)
                        She said what you said she'd say.

          She sits up, looks away.  He looks at her, puts his finger on 
          the bite mark idly, gently.  A beat, and he kisses her shoulder 
          gently, then lies back down.

                                    BETH
                        I met her at Berkeley.

          He looks at her.

                                    BETH
                        We were in some of the same classes.

                                    NICK
                               (after a beat)
                        Why didn't you tell me?

          She looks at him.

                                    BETH
                        I'm telling you.

          They look at each other a long beat.

                                    BETH
                               (with difficulty)
                        You've never been... like that...  
                        before.

          He says nothing, looks away from her.

                                    BETH
                        Why?

          He doesn't look at her a long beat, says nothing.

                                    NICK
                        You're the shrink.

          She keeps looking at him.  He won't look at her.

                                    BETH
                        You weren't making love to me.

          A beat; he looks at her.

                                    NICK
                        Who was I making love to?

          She looks at him a long beat.

                                    BETH
                        You weren't making love.

          They look at each other, a long beat, then away.  He lies back 
          down.  Beth doesn't look at him, keeps sitting up.

                        I need a cigarette.

                               (after a beat)
                        I thought you quit.

          He says nothing.

                                    BETH
                        Top drawer in the foyer.

                        Get it on your way out.

          He looks at her; she won't look at him.

          INT. THE DETECTIVE BUREAU - MORNING

          He walks in.  He looks hung-over.  He sees Gus with Harrigan 
          and Andrews and Lt. Walker in Lt. Walker's glass-enclosed office 
          at the end of this big room.

          They look at him when they see him.

                                    LT. WALKER
                        You look like dogshit.

                                    GUS
                               (grins)
                        He looks a little shrunk, that's 
                        all.

                                    ANDREWS
                               (after a beat)
                        We got a call from Berkeley P.D.

                               (a thin smile)
                        She was there, wasn't she?

                                    LT. WALKER
                        University records say she was 
                        there.

          He and Nick look at each other a long beat, then --

                                    LT. WALKER
                               (suddenly)
                        Gus -- go over to Berkeley.
                        Harrigan -- find out what else 
                        she's published.  Andrews -- get 
                        the files on her parents' accident.

                        some psychological input on this 
                        Andrews and Harrigan go; Nick is 
                        left there with Gus.

                                    NICK
                        What about me?

                                    GUS

                        input, son.

                                    LT. WALKER
                               (to Nick)
                        Go stick your head in a tub of ice 
                        water.
                               (a beat; then 
                               seriously)
                        See where she leads.

          EXT. THE BEACH HOUSE AT STINSON - DAY

          The black Ferrari is in the driveway.  He sits in an unmarked 
          police car on a hillside above the house, watching.  It is a 
          bleak, leaden gray day.

          Catherine comes out of the house.  She is dressed casually.

          She gets into the Ferrari.

          INT. HIS POLICE CAR

          He stays behind her at a safe distance on the winding panoramic 
          highway -- a two-lane mountain road which leads from Stinson 
          Beach into Marin County.

          She suddenly starts speeding up on this dangerous road, cutting 
          in and out, passing cars very fast.

          He has to start cutting around cars to keep up.  This woman 
          really drives.

          He cuts out and can barely pass a car without hitting a Grey 
          Lines Tour Bus head-on.  Close call: sheer drops on either 
          side.

          He looks frazzled.

          INT. HIS POLICE CAR

          He is behind her at a distance on a hilly Mill Valley road -- 
          little streets, terraced hillsides, sharp turns.

          He goes slowly, looks around, thinks he's lost her.  And then 
          he sees the black Ferrari parked in front of a house obscured 
          by hedges.

          He parks the car a distance behind the Ferrari, sits there a 
          long beat.  He gets out, goes carefully up to the hedges, looks.  
          A small, nondescript house.  He watches.  He can't see anything 
          inside the house.

          A beat, he reaches over to the mailbox and opens it.  He takes 
          an envelope out, looks at the name Hazel Dobkins.

          INT. HIS POLICE CAR - NIGHT

          He watches as she comes out of the house.  A frail old woman 
          in her 70's is with her.  She hugs the old woman, gets into 
          the Ferrari, STARTS it up.

          He waits a beat and then STARTS after her.  He stays behind 
          her at a distance -- she is going slowly.  And then she suddenly 
          GUNS it, cuts her lights -- her wheels SCREECH.

          He GUNS his car after her.  He makes a turn.  She is gone.

          There is a fork in the road.  He turns one way, goes a few 
          hundred feet.

          Nothing.  Blackness.  He stops.

                                    NICK
                               (quietly)
                        Shit.

          INT. HIS POLICE CAR - NIGHT

          He pulls his car up to her house at Stinson Beach.  The black 
          Ferrari is in the driveway.

          A light goes on in an upstairs bedroom.  The curtain is drawn.  
          He sees the outline of her body now.

          She starts to take her clothes off -- there in the window, 
          behind the curtain.  He watches her body as she does an almost 
          languorous strip.  His eyes are intense... ravishing.

          INT. THE DETECTIVE BUREAU - NIGHT

          He is alone, nobody else in the big room.

          He sits in front of a computer.  We see the screen.  He has 
          punched in

          HAZEL DOBKINS, WF, 145 ALBION RD., MILL VALLEY.

          He is waiting for a response.  We see it come on screen

          NOTHING CURRENT.

          A long beat, as he stares at the screen, and then we see these 
          words

          RELEASED, SAN QUENTIN, JULY 7, 1965.

          We see him type in the words

          PRIOR ARREST RECORD.

          A long beat, and then it comes up

          HOMICIDE, JANUARY 10, 1956 - SAN FRANCISCO

          He stares at the screen a long beat.

                                    GUS
                               (behind him)

                        counselor.

          Nick looks at him a beat.

                                    NICK
                        Was she ever suspect?

                        No, sir.  They never even got a 
                        statement from her.

          Nick sits back a long beat, his eyes off somewhere.

                                    NICK

                                    GUS
                               (grins)

                        financial problems.  One day -- 
                        outta the clear blue sky -- she 
                        does 'em.  All of 'em.  Used a 
                        knife. He got for a wedding present.  
                        Didn't even deny it.  Sweet as 
                        honey.  Said she didn't know why 
                        she done it.

          Nick just stares at him.

          EXT. THE STINSON BEACH HOUSE - NEXT DAY

          He pulls up to the house, gets out of his unmarked police car.  
          He stands there a beat, thinking.  He walks down to the beach 
          entrance of the house.  He hears a Rolling Stones SONG playing 
          inside.  He stands there.  The door suddenly opens.  Catherine 
          stands there, smiles.  She wears very tight-fitting spandex 
          leotards.

                                    CATHERINE
                        Hi.

          He looks at her a beat, then --

                                    NICK
                        Am I... disturbing you?

                                    CATHERINE
                        No.  Come in.

          They have their eyes on each other.  A beat, and she turns to 
          go in.

          INT. THE STINSON BEACH HOUSE

          She goes in ahead of him -- he follows her inside.  He watches 
          her body.  His movements are tentative, off-balance.  She turns 
          the Stones DOWN.

          On a table by the window, he sees a word processor.  Spread 
          around it are newspaper clippings.  They are all about him.

          We see the headline on one KILLER COP TO FACE POLICE REVIEW.  
          She sees him glancing at the clips.

                                    CATHERINE
                        I'm using you for my detective.  
                        In my book.  You don't mind, do 
                        you?

          She smiles.  He looks at her, expressionless.

                                    CATHERINE
                        Would you like a drink?  I was 
                        just going to have one.

                                    NICK
                        No, thanks.

          She goes to the bar.

                                    CATHERINE
                               (smiles)
                        That's right.  You're off the Jack 
                        Daniels too, aren't you?

          She is making herself a drink.  She takes the ice out and then 
          opens a drawer and gets an icepick.  It has a fat wooden end.  
          She uses the icepick on the ice, her back to him.  He watches 
          her.

                                    NICK
                        I'd like to ask you a few more 
                        questions.

                                    CATHERINE
                        I'd like to ask you some, too.

          She turns to him, icepick in hand, smiles.

                                    CATHERINE
                        For my book.

          She turns back to the ice, works on it with the pick.  She 
          raises her arm, plunges it.  Raises it, plunges it.  He watches 
          her.

                                    NICK

                        What kind of questions?

          She puts the icepick down, pours herself a drink, turns to 
          him.

                                    CATHERINE
                        How does it feel to kill someone?

          He looks at her a long beat.

          A long beat, as they look at each other.

          She looks at him a long beat, sips her drink, never takes her 
          eyes off him.

                                    CATHERINE

                        Only in theory.
                               (she smiles)
                        You know all about homicidal 
                        impulse, don't you, shooter?  Not 
                        in theory -- in practice.

          He stares at her a long beat.

                                    CATHERINE
                               (quietly)
                        What happened, Nick?  Did you get 
                        sucked into it? Did you like it 
                        too much?

                                    NICK
                               (after a beat)
                        No.

          He stares at her, almost horrified.

                                    CATHERINE
                               (quietly)
                        Tell me about the coke, Nick.  The 
                        day you shot those two tourists --
                        how much coke did you do?

          She steps closer to him.

                                    CATHERINE
                        Tell me, Nick.

          She puts her hand softly on his cheek,  He grabs her hand 
          roughly, holds it.

                                    NICK
                        I didn't.

                                    CATHERINE
                        Yes, you did.  They never tested 
                        you, did they?  But Internal Affairs 
                        knew.

          They are face to face.  He is still holding her roughly by the 
          hand.

                                    CATHERINE
                        Your wife knew, didn't she?  She 
                        knew what was going on.  Nicky got 
                        too close to the flame.  Nicky 
                        liked it.

          He twists her arm back behind her -- their bodies are pressed 
          against each other -- their eyes digging into each other.

                                    CATHERINE
                               (in a whisper)
                        That's why she killed herself?

          He is twisting her arm, staring at her, pulling her against 
          him.  We hear the DOOR behind them.  A beat, and he lets her 
          go, turns away from her.

          Roxy stands there, staring at them.  Her hair is up.  She wears 
          a black motorcycle jacket, a black T-shirt, and black jeans 
          and cowboy boots.

                                    CATHERINE
                               (brightly)
                        Hiya, hon.  You two have met, 
                        haven't you?

          Roxy looks at Nick.  Catherine goes to her, kisses her briefly 
          on the lips, stands there with her arm around her --both of 
          them looking at Nick.

          He walks by them, opens the door to go, his face a mask.

                                    CATHERINE
                        You're going to make a terrific 
                        character, Nick.

          He doesn't look at her; he's gone.

          INT. BETH GARDNER'S OFFICE - DAY

          He comes in.  He looks like he's going to kill someone.  A 
          RECEPTIONIST sits there.

                                    RECEPTIONIST
                        She's on the phone -- she'll be 
                        right with you, detective --He 
                        sweeps by her into Beth's inner 
                        office.  She hangs up when she 
                        sees the look on his face.

                                    NICK
                        Who has access to my file?

                                    BETH
                        What are you talking about, Nick --
                        what's wrong with you?

                                    NICK
                        Who's got access to my goddamn 
                        file?

          She gets up -- he goes closer to her; she backs away from him.

                                    BETH
                        Nobody.

          He goes closer to her; she backs away.

                                    BETH
                        It's a confidential psychiatric 
                        record, it'd be illegal --She backs 
                        into a wall.  She looks very scared.  
                        He comes very close to her -- puts 
                        an arm behind her to the wall.

                                    NICK
                        Don't, Beth.  Don't lie to me.

          She says nothing, looks scared.

                                    NICK
                               (suddenly)
                        It's Internal Affairs, isn't it?

                                    BETH
                        No, Nick, please --

                                    NICK
                               (loud, hard)
                        Who?

                                    BETH
                               (blurts it)
                        Nilsen.

          INT. THE INTERNAL AFFAIRS DIVISION - DAY

          He storms into the big room.  He sees MARTY NILSEN.  He is 
          sitting behind his desk in his glass-enclosed office inside 
          this big room.  About a dozen plainclothes policemen are in 
          the big room.  He goes by them into Nilsen's office.

          INT. MARTIN NILSEN'S OFFICE

          He closes the door.  Nilsen sees the look on his face, backs 
          his chair away towards the wall.

                                    NILSEN
                        What do you want, Curran?                                                                     

          He goes to him, picks him up by his lapels, slams him against 
          the wall.

                                    NICK
                               (out of control)
                        You sold her the file, didn't you?

                                    NILSEN
                               (scared)
                        What are you talking about?

                                    NICK
                               (out of control)
                        What'd she pay you?

          He slams him against the wall again.  The glass EXPLODES behind 
          them -- a chair comes into the room.  Nick is frozen, holding 
          Nilsen by the throat against the wall.

                                    ONE OF THE I.A. GUYS
                        Let him go, Curran.  Nice and easy.

          He looks back, sees two Internal Affairs men with their guns 
          drawn, pointed at him.  A beat, and he lets Nilsen go.  He 
          turns calmly and starts to walk out.

                                    NILSEN
                        You're on sick leave, Shooter.  As 
                        of right now.  Pending the outcome 
                        of a psychiatric evaluation.

          EXT. THE POLICE PARKING LOT - DUSK

          He gets into his old Porsche.  He STARTS the car up.  Gus Moran 
          comes up to the window.  They look at each other a

                                    GUS
                        What's goin' down, son?

                                    NICK
                        Nothin'
                               (a beat)
                        I'll be okay, pop.

          They look at each other a long beat.

                                    GUS
                        No, sir.  You won't.  There's smoke 
                        off yonder on the horizon.  They're 
                        gonna want your badge.

                                    NICK
                               (after a long beat)
                        I got tired of being played with.

                                    GUS
                               (after a beat)
                        You sure got real conclusive ways 
                        of demonstrating that.

          They almost smile at each other, then --

                                    NICK
                               (almost to himself)
                        She knows where I live and breathe.  
                        She's coming after me.

                                    GUS
                               (after a long beat)
                        What is it you got between you?

                                    NICK
                               (after a beat; to 
                               himself)
                        I don't know.

                                    GUS
                        Somethin', though.

          A beat, and then Nick looks at him.

                                    NICK
                        Yeah.
                               (a beat)
                        Somethin'.

          INT. HIS APARTMENT - NIGHT

          He sits in front of the TV, watching a lame sitcom.  A bottle 
          of Jack Daniels is half-empty in front of him.  He is smoking 
          a cigarette.

                                    BETH
                               (behind him)
                        I still have my key.

          He looks at her, looks away at the sitcom.

                                    NICK
                        I don't want to see you, Beth.

          He keeps watching the sitcom.  A long beat.

                                    BETH
                               (suddenly angry)
                        Damnit!  Don't shut me out!  You 
                        owe me more than that?

          He goes to the TV, shuts it off.

                                    NICK
                        I don't owe you anything; you don't 
                        owe me anything.
                               (he looks at her)
                        We went to bed -- what was it? --
                        ten or fifteen times?
                               (he smiles)
                        It wasn't memorable enough to carry 
                        any obligations.

                                    BETH
                               (after a long beat)
                        Sometimes I really hate you.

                                    NICK
                               (smiles)
                        Yeah?  Well why don't you find 
                        some friendly therapist and work 
                        some of that hostility out.
                               (a beat)
                        But take my advice.  Put a little 
                        more life into it than you usually 
                        do.

          A beat, and she suddenly hurls herself at him in absolute fury, 
          trying to claw at his face.  He grabs her, blocks her.  They 
          look at each other a long beat and then he lets her go.

          The emotion of the moment is gone now -- they turn away from 
          each other.

                                    BETH
                               (finally)
                        I'm sorry... I don't usually... 
                        act like that.

          Nick looks at her a beat.

                                    NICK
                        How could you let him have my file, 
                        Beth?

          A long beat, then --

                                    BETH
                               (not looking at him)
                        He was going to recommend your 
                        discharge a behavioral disability.  
                        I made a deal with him.  He could 
                        review the session notes himself.  
                        It was the only way I could keep 
                        you on the force.

          She looks at him.  He looks away from her.

                                    NICK
                        You did it for me.

                                    BETH
                        Yes.  I care about you.  I did it 
                        for you.

          He turns away from her.

                                    NICK
                               (quietly)
                        Get out of here, Beth.
                               (a beat)
                        Please?

          He goes to the Jack Daniel's, pours some more.  She looks at 
          him pour it and turns to go.

          INT. HIS APARTMENT - NIGHT

          He is asleep on the couch -- the TV is on to a blank screen.  
          The Jack Daniel's is mostly gone.  The phone on the coffee 
          table RINGS.  It RINGS again.  He wakes, picks it up, listens.

                                    NICK
                        Yeah.
                               (a beat)
                        Okay.

          He hangs it up.  He sits there a long beat, staring.  He looks 
          disturbed.

          EXT. THE ALLEY BEHIND THE TEN-FOUR BAR - NIGHT

          He walks down the alley.  There are lots of police cars, 
          flashing lights, uniformed men, coroner's men.

          As he walks down the alley, he sees Lt. Walker, Gus, and several 
          of the Internal Affairs men we saw earlier in Nilsen's office.  
          They are standing around a Lincoln Town Car.

          They look at him as he comes closer to them -- then move aside.

          He can see into the car now.  Martin Nilsen lies against the 
          front seat.  He has been shot in the head.  Nick stares.

                                    GUS
                        One shot.  Close range.  Probably 
                        a .38 caliber revolver.

          Nick stares at Nilsen's body.  They watch him.

                                    LT. WALKER
                        Give me your gun, Nick.

          A beat, and then Nick gives him his gun.  Walker smells it, 
          shakes his head, gives it to one of the Internal Affairs men.

                                    NICK
                               (to Walker)
                        You think I --

                                    GUS
                        I don't son, but I got the minority 
                        opinion.

          INT. POLICE INTERROGATION ROOM - NIGHT

          He sits in the same room that Catherine sat in --surrounded by 
          four or five Internal Affairs men, Lt.

          Walker, Gus, and Captain Talcott.  Lt. Walker and Gus sort of 
          sit back -- I.A. is running the investigation.  The same police 
          stenographer -- the same plain young woman -- is sitting in 
          the room who was there with Catherine.

                                    NICK
                        Okay.  I went after him.  I lost 
                        my temper.

                                    AN I.A. MAN
                        Do you have any evidence that he 
                        showed your psychiatric file to 
                        anyone?

                                    NICK
                               (after a beat)
                        No.

          Beth Gardner comes into the room.  They look at her.

                                    AN I.A. MAN
                        We'll speak to you afterwards, Dr.
                        Gardner.

          Nick gives her a look.

                                    BETH
                        I'd like to sit-in if you don't 
                        mind.

                                    THE I.A. MAN
                        I'd really rather --

                                    TALCOTT
                        I don't see anything wrong with 
                        Dr. Gardner sitting-in if Detective 
                        Curran doesn't object.

          Nick looks at her, shrugs.

                                    AN I.A. MAN
                        Where were you tonight?

                        All night?

                                    NICK
                        Yeah.

                                    AN I.A. MAN
                        Were you drinking?

          He looks at Beth.

                                    NICK
                        Yeah, I was drinking.

                                    AN I.A. MAN
                        When did you start drinking again?

                        A couple days ago.

                                    BETH
                        I saw Detective Curran at his 
                        apartment around ten o'clock.  He 
                        was sober and lucid.  I asked him 
                        in my capacity as his departmental 
                        therapist about his altercation 
                        with Lt. Nilsen.  He expressed 
                        regret and displayed no hostility.

                                    AN I.A. MAN
                               (to Beth)
                        How long were you at his apartment?

                                    BETH
                        About fifteen minutes.  I saw there 
                        was no reason for my concern and 
                        left.

          She and Nick look at each other.  He looks away and lights a 
          cigarette.

                                    AN I.A. MAN
                        There's no smoking in this building.

                                    NICK
                               (after a beat)
                        What are you gonna do -- charge me 
                        with smoking?

          It is the exact line that Catherine used.  A long beat.

                                    LT. WALKER
                        I'll ask you once, Nick -- for the 
                        record did you kill him?

                                    NICK
                        No.

          They look at him a beat.

                                    NICK
                        Come on -- I'm going to storm into 
                        his office in front of everybody 
                        in the afternoon and then that 
                        night I'm going to kill him?  I'd 
                        have to be really dumb to do that.

                                    AN I.A. MAN
                        Going after him before gets you 
                        off the hook for killing him that's 
                        your alibi.

                                    LT. WALKER
                        Like writing a book about killing 
                        a guy gets you off the hook for 
                        killing him.

                                    AN I.A. MAN
                               (to Walker)
                        I don't understand.  What are you 
                        talking about?  What book?

                                    LT. WALKER
                               (to Nick)
                        Private joke.

                                    NICK
                        I don't think it's funny.

                                    GUS
                               (grins)
                        Well, hell, son, it's got a certain 
                        ring to it, I'll say that.

          INT. POLICE DEPARTMENT - NIGHT

          He is by the elevators with Gus and Lt. Andrews.  He spots 
          Beth going for the stairway.

                        Beth.

          She stops.  He catches up to her.  They walk down the flights 
          together.  They speak quietly.

                                    NICK
                        Thank you.

          She looks at him, smiles.  They keep walking down the steps.

                                    BETH
                        It's the least I could do...  
                        considering I got you into this 
                        mess with those reports.

          She looks at him, smiles.

                        How do you know Catherine Tramell 
                        saw my reports?

                        She must really be something.
                               (she smiles)
                        From a clinical point of view.

                        What was she like in school?

                        I hardly knew her.  She gave me 
                        the creeps, though.  I don't know 
                        why.

          EXT. THE BUILDING - NIGHT

          They get outside.  Beth kisses him quickly, softly on the cheek.

                                    BETH
                        Get some rest.  Promise?

          He nods.  She starts walking toward her car.

                        can handle it.

          She goes to her car.

          INT. THE DETECTIVE BUREAU - NEXT DAY

          Only Andrews is in the room.  We see Lt. Walker sitting in his 
          glass-enclosed office.

          He closes the duffel bag, looks at the place a long beat.

          Andrews is watching him.  He goes up to Andrews

                        The boat blew.  There was a leak 
                        in the gas line.  There were two 
                        previous repairs.  There was a 
                        five-mil policy on both of 'em.  A 
                        real heavy investigation.  Zilch.

                        She's screwing with your head, 
                        Nick.  Pretty soon you're gonna 
                        look in the mirror and think you're 
                        seeing her.

          EXT. HIS APARTMENT

          It is in the Marina District; on a street like Cervantes.

          He gets out of his old Porsche; he sees her black Ferrari there.  
          She is sitting on the front stoop.  She wears an Indian jacket, 
          jeans and a T-shirt.  He goes up to her. She looks at him a 
          beat.

                                    CATHERINE
                        I heard about what happened.  What 
                        good's a shooter without his gun?                                                                     

          She smiles.

                                    CATHERINE
                               (after a beat)
                        I have attorneys.  They have 
                        friends.  I have friends.  Money 
                        buys you a lot of attorneys and 
                        friends.

                        attorneys Gus is my only real

                                    CATHERINE
                               (smiles)
                        I wasn't talking about real friends.  
                        Why doesn't Gus like me.

                                    CATHERINE
                        Do you?

                        Yeah.  Would you like to come up 
                        and have a drink?

          She looks at him a beat.

                                    CATHERINE
                        I didn't think you'd ask me.

          He looks at her a beat.

                                    NICK
                               (smiles)
                        I'm not that easy to figure.

          They start walking inside.  She walks ahead of him.  He watches 
          her.  She turns suddenly.

                                    CATHERINE
                        You're not easy to figure.  I'm 
                        just very good at figuring.

                                    CATHERINE
                        Why not?

                                    NICK
                        You can make a mistake.

                                    CATHERINE
                               (smiles)
                        Not me.

          And she turns, heads inside; he follows her.

          INT. HIS APARTMENT - DAY

          They walk in.  She looks at the bareness of the place.

                                    CATHERINE
                        You should put some warmth into 
                        it.  You don't want it to reflect 
                        on your personality.

          She turns, smiles at him.  He looks at the bottle of Jack 
          Daniel's; there's not much left.

                                    NICK
                        Jack Daniel's okay?  It's gonna 
                        have to be.

                                    CATHERINE
                        Fine.

                                    NICK
                        Ice?

                                    CATHERINE
                               (smiles)
                        Please.

          There is a palpable tension between them.

          He takes the ice out, opens a drawer, takes out an icepick.

                                    CATHERINE
                        Let me do that.  You like to watch 
                        me doing it, don't you?

          She smiles; a beat and he hands her the icepick.  She takes 
          it, starts to us the icepick, her back to him.  He lights a 
          cigarette.

                                    CATHERINE
                        Can I have a cigarette, please?  I 
                        told you you'd start smoking again.

          He watches her working on the ice.

                                    CATHERINE
                        Light it for me, will you?

          He does, steps to her.  She parts her lips -- he puts it on 
          her lip, watches it.  Their eyes are on each other.

                                    CATHERINE
                        Thank you.

          She works on the ice again, opens the cabinets for glasses.

          She hands him his drink, holds hers.

          A beat, and she suddenly turns away.

                        I brought you something.

          She goes to her purse, takes a paperback book out of it.  We 
          see it -- The First Time, by Catherine Smith.  He looks at it.

                        No.  I wrote it years afterwards.

          He watches her; she has turned away from him -- and then she 
          turns back to him in a different mood.

          INT. THE STAIRWAY

          As she is going down the stairs, Gus Moran is coming up.

          He does a real double-take as he goes by her.

          He looks at him a long beat, and he goes upstairs, into Nick's 
          apartment.

          INT. NICK'S APARTMENT

          Nick stands at the window, watching her outside.  A long beat,

          INT. JOHNNY BOZ'S CLUB - NIGHT

          It is dark, cavernous there are a thousand people in here.  
          The MUSIC is ear-splitting, pulsing.  Lights flash.

          The floor is huge.  At one time, this club was a church.

          He walks around the sides, a drink in his hand, looking for 
          her.  He doesn't see her.

          The he catches a glimpse of Roxy.  She is dancing with another 
          woman.  He watches her.  She is wearing pants and a jacket, 
          her hair off to the side.  She looks very masculine tonight.

          Roxy laughs at the other woman, leaves her on the floor, starts 
          moving through the sea of dancers.  He follows her through the 
          press of bodies.  She goes towards the men's room.  She walks 
          in.

          INT. THE MEN'S ROOM

          It is large, dark, shadowy It was once the sacristy.

          A crowd scene men and women. Roxy presses through them.

          A haze of crack smoke; we see people doing poppers.

          She opens the door to a toilet stall, walks in.  Nick is behind 
          her.  As the door opens, he sees Catherine.

          She wears a black motorcycle jacket, a very short skirt, 
          stiletto heels.  Her hair is up.  He make-up is severe,  In 
          the darkness, in the shadows she looks about 19.  A hot 19.

          A hot flash-trash 19.

          She is in there with two men -- one of them is a big, body-
          built black guy.  She has a vial of something near her face.

          She sees Nick watching her.  She whispers something to the 
          tall black guy.  He looks at Nick, smiles a condescending smile.  
          The door to the stall closes

          INT. THE CLUB

          He is walking along the side, watching the floor, a drink in 
          his hand.  The song ends and it seques right into the Stones's 
          "Miss You."

          He sees her.  Her black leather jacket is off.

          She wears a very tight, flimsy top, the short skirt, the heels.  
          She is dancing with Roxy and the black guy.  He watches her 
          move... watches her body.

          She turns, sees him, dances, watches him... gets between Roxy 
          and the black guy... they sandwich her with their bodies... 
          keeps moving, turning... eyes on him... playing to him with 
          her body.  He watches.

          A long beat, and he goes up to them.  His movements are

          almost trance-like.  They look at each other.  A long beat.

          Catherine stops dancing.  he reaches for her.  She moves away.  
          A beat their eyes are on each other.  She moves a step towards 
          her.  A beat, as they look at each other...  and they start to 
          move together.

          Their eyes are on each other as they move, the eyes burning... 
          the movements tighter, hotter... and he suddenly grabs her and 
          kisses her... as they keep moving... the song seques into the 
          Stones's "Gimme Shelter."

          She is melting into him now, kissing him... Tex watches, 
          expressionless... the black guy is gone... he holds her by the 
          back of the neck, kissing her... their bodies pressed into 
          each other... his hands are on her butt now, pulling her into 
          him now, almost holding her up now... and then under her skirt, 
          under her panties... as he kisses her neck.

          People around them stare... he moves his hands under her top 
          as she keeps moving with the song, her head back, her back 
          almost arching... cups her breasts now... she keeps moving...  
          the song sweeping them into its rhythm "it's just a shot away, 
          it's just a kiss away, a kiss away..."

          They devour each other.  Right there on the floor.  Barely 
          able to hold it back.  As Tex watches expressionless.  As people 
          stop dancing and stare.

          INT. HER BEDROOM

          It is dark.  We can't see clearly.  A side table, lines of 
          cocaine on a small mirror.  A CD player The Stones play "Love 
          In Vain."

          There are mirrors all over the walls and ceiling.  They are in 
          bed.  The bed is big and brass.

          Atop her... he kisses her neck... his hands under her, raising 
          her... he moves down, kisses her breasts... puts his mouth 
          around  a breast... she arches, moves... he kisses her 
          shoulder... biting into it... she opens her mouth... we hear 
          no cry... we hear the Stones.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

          INT. HER BEDROOM - LATER

          The Stones play "Monkey Man."

          Atop him... she kisses his chest, licks it, lowers her head... 
          lower... lower... he arches his back... her mouth comes up... 
          her mouth on his lips again... he turns her.

          Atop her... he moves her legs apart... (the CAMERA is behind 
          them)... she holds his back... digs in her nails...  rakes his 
          back with them... digs in again... his back bleeds... he moves 
          inside her... harder... the nails dig...  blood trickles down 
          his back.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

          INT. HER BEDROOM - LATER

          The Stones play "Wild Horses."

          He is behind her... she is on her stomach... he rises her by 
          her hips... kisses her back... races her spine with his 
          tongue... traces her lower back... he kneels... moves into 
          her... kisses her neck... his fingers are in her mouth...  as 
          he moves.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

          INT. HER BEDROOM - LATER

          The Stones play "Sympathy for the Devil."

          Atop him... she leans close over his face, her tongue in his 
          mouth... kneeling over him... she moves his arms above his 
          head... moves higher atop him... her breasts in his face... 
          she reaches over to the side... a white silk scarf is in her 
          hand... she moves higher above him... kneeling over his face... 
          moving oh-so-slightly... his face strains towards her.

          The scarf in both hands now... she starts to tie his hands 
          with it... his eyes are open, watching her... she ties it 
          loosely, gently... it isn't tight... but his hands are tied to 
          the brass bed.

          She kisses him... moving her hips lower now... over his chest... 
          lower...

          And he is inside her... her arms above him... his eyes open... 
          she kisses his neck... bites but not hard...  moves... grinding 
          hard against him now.. she is on her knees... head arches back.. 
          her breasts high.. still grinding.

          Her back arches, strains... he strains toward her... she holds 
          her arms high... she comes out of the arch...  shivering... 
          falling over him... the scarf loosens... his arms come forward 
          and hold her close.. closer... closer...  as she moves with 
          slight... shivery... movements.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

          INT. HER BEDROOM - NIGHT

          It is dark, quiet.  Pindrop quiet.  He is sitting on the side 
          of the bed, his head down... his back a line tracing of dried 
          blood.  She is asleep nest to him, naked.

          He looks around the room.  The white scarf around the bedpost... 
          the coke on the side-table... clothes all over the floor.

          He gets up, walks into the bathroom.

          INT. HER BEDROOM - NIGHT

          The light is too bright.  He looks at himself in the mirror.  
          He pours the water, lowers his head, puts cold water on his 
          face.  A long beat, he comes back up, opens his eyes.  Roxy is 
          in the mirror behind him.  She startles him.

          He looks at her in the mirror a long beat, doesn't turn.

          She is expressionless; she wears the same thing she wore at 
          the club.

          He lowers down into the basin again, puts more water on his 
          face, comes back up, uses a towel this time, finishes with the 
          towel.  She is still looking at him in the mirror the same 
          way.  He looks at her in the mirror, doesn't turn.

                                    ROXY
                               (quietly)
                        If you don't leave her alone, I'll 
                        kill you.

          He looks at her a beat, then turns --

                        Tell me something, Rocki.  Man-to-

                        century, don't you?

          For a second, she looks like she's going to spring at him, 
          then controls it and turns to go.

                        She likes me to watch.

          And she turns and she is gone.

          INT. HER BEDROOM - NIGHT

          He lies on the bed in the dark, quiet room.  He is on his back, 
          his eyes open.  He has his arm around her.  She is asleep.

                                    CATHERINE

                        Nicky.

          He looks at her.

          INT. HER BEDROOM - MORNING

          He wakes up.  She is not there.  He looks around.  The white 
          scarf is gone.  The coke on the side table is gone.

          In its place, a scrawled note "The Beach -- C."

          EXT. HER STINSON BEACH HOUSE - DAY

          A cold and foggy day.  He gets out of his old Porsche, walks 
          down the driveway.  He sees her out on the beach by the water.  
          A small bonfire is near her.  He walks towards her.

          Roxy watches him, expressionless, from an upstairs window of 
          the house.  He doesn't see her.

          He walks up to Catherine.  She has an Indian blanket over her 
          and is wearing a black felt English derby hat, her hair loose 
          underneath.

                                    NICK
                               (expressionless)
                        'Morning.

          She doesn't look at him -- he smiles slowly.  She doesn't smile 
          and she doesn't seem to like his smile, either.  She walks 
          along the beach.  He walks with her.  A long beat.

                                    NICK
                        I think Roxy got jealous.

          She looks at him.  He looks like he is trying to hide a smile.

                        She's seen me fuck plenty of other 
                        guys.

          That wipes the hidden smile off his face.  He looks at her, 
          walks with her.  A long beat.

                                    NICK
                        Maybe she saw something she didn't

          She looks at him; he's smiling now.

                        I know.

          A long beat.  They look at each other.

                                    CATHERINE
                        I've got a book to write.  I'll 
                        see you around, Shooter.

          A beat, and she walks away towards the house.  He watches her.

          INT. A COUNTRY AND WESTERN BAR - NIGHT

          Nick walks in.  Waylon Jennings is on the JUKEBOX.  Gus is 
          sitting at the bar wearing jeans, a cowboy shirt, and a cowboy 
          hat.

          Nick goes, sits next to him.

                                    NICK
                               (grins)
                        What is this place?  Hillbilly 
                        heaven?

          He glances around.

                                    GUS
                               (loud)
                        Where in the fuck you been?  I 
                        went over to your place.

          He is drunk, slurring.  Nick sees it.

                                    NICK
                        Easy there, partner -- I wasn't 
                        there.

                                    GUS
                        I went over last night, too.

                                    NICK
                               (grins)
                        I wasn't there last night, either.

          Gus takes a long, drunken look at him.

                                    GUS
                        You... fucked her!  Goddamn dumb

                        really should.

          INT. A DINER - NIGHT

          Gus is eating chili, drinking coffee.  Hick keeps pouring him 
          more coffee.

                                    NICK
                               (grins)
                        You feeling better?

                                    GUS
                               (loud)
                        I feel fine!

          Nick pours him more coffee; Gus guzzles it.

                                    GUS
                               (loud)
                        How could you fuck her?

          It gets some looks from the other people in her -- Nick shushes 
          him, pours him more coffee.  He drinks it.

                                    GUS
                               (quietly)
                        You wanna die, son?  What is it --
                        those goddamn tourists -- you still 
                        feel so bad about that you're 
                        wigglin' your way into an icepi --
                               (suddenly louder)
                        We got too many goddamn tourists 
                        comin' here anyway -- plenty more 
                        goddamn tourists where they goddamn 
                        came from.

          Some people here really give him the looks now.  Gus looks 
          angrily away from them, drinks more coffee.

                                    NICK
                               (after a beat; 
                               quietly)
                        I'm not afraid of her.

                                    GUS
                               (loud)
                        Why the hell not?

                        I don't know.  I'm just not.

                                    GUS
                               (loud)
                        That's her pussy talkin' --He gets 
                        a real nasty look from a very fat 
                        woman eating a cheeseburger.  He 
                        winks at her.  The woman looks 
                        away from him, shaking her head.

                                    GUS
                               (smiles; to Nick)
                        It ain't your brain.

          They look at each other a long beat.  Gus drinks more coffee.  
          He sits back, pulls his cowboy hat over his eyes.

          A long beat.

                                    GUS
                               (quietly)
                        I.A. done did a track on Lt. Martin 
                        D for Dickhead Nilsen.  They found 
                        a safety deposit box with fifty-
                        thousand dollars in it, taken out 
                        three months ago, used that one 
                        time.

          He looks at the fat woman again -- leers at her obscenely.

          She looks away.

                                    NICK
                               (after a long beat)
                        It doesn't make sense.  She didn't 
                        know me three months ago.

                                    GUS
                        Maybe it wasn't her that paid him.
                        Maybe the money was for somethin' 
                        else.  How the fuck do I know?  
                        I'm just an old city cowboy tryin' 
                        not to fall outta his saddle.

          Nick looks at him and smiles a thin smile; he's not there, 
          he's completely preoccupied.

          INT. A CAR - NIGHT

          Someone is watching as he and Gus come out of the diner.

          EXT. THE STREET - NIGHT

          He stands by Gus as Gus gets into his battered, rusted, vintage 
          Cadillac.

                                    NICK
                        You all right, pop?  You want me 
                        to drive you?

                                    GUS
                        In that little pissant car of yours?  
                        Hell, no.  I ain't gettin' no back 
                        pain disability retirement -- I'm 
                        gettin' me a full pension and a 
                        real gold-plate Seiko watch.

                                    NICK
                        Come on, I'll drive you in this 
                        thing.                                                                     

                                    GUS
                        You think I'd let you drive my 
                        Cadillac car?  I ain't lettin' no 
                        hear-up-his-ass person drive my 
                        Cadillac car.

          And he steps on the gas and ROARS out of there, forcing Nick 
          to get out of the way.  Nick looks after him a long beat, shakes 
          his head.

          INT. A CAR - NIGHT

          Someone is following him slowly as he walks down the street.  
          He turns a corner, walks down the alley towards his Porsche, 
          parked behind the country and western bar.

          The car suddenly speeds up -- ROARS down on him from the back, 
          full bore.

          EXT. THE ALLEY

          He hurls himself across the Porsche's hood... barely avoiding 
          the car.  He sees the car at the end of the alley, turning out 
          It is a black Ferrari.

          INT. HIS PORSCHE

          He GUNS it down the alley, makes a wild turn in the direction 
          the Ferrari turned.

          EXT. THE STREET

          The Porsche dodges around cars very fast, almost side-swiping 
          them, looking almost out of control, its MOTOR screaming.

          INT. THE PORSCHE

          He sees the Ferrari turn ahead.  When he gets to where it 
          turned, he turns wildly.

          EXT. THE STREET

          The Ferrari is making fast, wild turns into little streets in 
          North Beach, its MOTOR screaming -- the Porsche is gaining 
          ground behind it, making turns.

          INT. THE PORSCHE

          The Ferrari is up ahead and makes a wild right turn onto a 
          road going up a hillside.  He yanks the wheel hard.

          EXT. THE STEPS

          The Porsche rockets up the steps -- bouncing high into the 
          air, almost out of control.                                                                     

          INT. THE PORSCHE

          As it crests the steps and gets to the street.  Nick GUNS it 
          and it looks like it flies high down the hill-side into 
          blackness.

          EXT. THE STREET

          But it lands on more steps -- heading downward -- bucking, 
          almost spinning, it bounces onto the next street.

          INT. THE PORSCHE

          Another set of steps leading up he GUNS it, it rockets up, 
          ROARS, bucking --

          EXT. THE STREET

          And lands on the next street.  Nick makes a wild right turn 
          onto the street.  And the black Ferrari appears from around a 
          curve to the right, heading right for him.

          INT. THE PORSCHE

          Nick steps on the GAS and heads head-on for the Ferrari.

          The Ferrari SCREAMS head-on for him.

          EXT. THE STREET

          And at the last moment, in the game of chicken, the Ferrari 
          tries to swerve around him on this narrow road, goes out of 
          control and over the side, turning over and over as it rolls 
          down the hillside.

          EXT. THE HILLSIDE

          The Ferrari has landed right-side up.

          He runs down the hillside and gets to it.  A beat, and he opens 
          the car door.

          Roxy lies hunched over the wheel, her eyes open.  Her neck is 
          broken.  She is dead.

          EXT. THE HILLSIDE - NIGHT

          Police lights have been set up.  He stands there with Lt.  
          Walker and several of the Internal Affairs men.

                                    LT. WALKER
                        Tell me again.  I want to hear you 
                        say it again.

                                    NICK
                               (after a beat; 
                               sheepish)
                        It was an accident.

                                    LT. WALKER
                        You're driving around North Beach 
                        for no particular reason and this 
                        car won't get out of the way --

                                    NICK
                        I don't think she meant to go off 
                        the hill, do you?

                                    LT. WALKER
                               (quietly)
                        Don't fuck with me, Nick.  I don't 
                        need a reason to put your ass in a 
                        sling.

          He and Nick look at each other a long beat.  Andrews comes up 
          to them with a piece of paper in his hand.

                                    ANDREWS
                        Full name, Roxanne Hardy.  Last 
                        address -- Cloverdale, California.

                        car is registered to Catherine 
                        Tramell.

          Lt. Walker looks at Nick like he's going to kill him.  Nick 
          looks calmly away.

                                    LT. WALKER
                        You knew her, didn't you?

                                    NICK
                        Gus and I talked to her at Tramell's 
                        house.  All we did was write her 
                        name down.

                                    LT. WALKER
                               (after a beat)
                        I told you to stay away from 
                        Tramell.

                                    NICK
                               (after a beat; smiles)
                        Yeah.  But you didn't tell me to 
                        stay away from her car.

          Walker looks at him in absolute disbelief.

                                    AN I.A. MAN
                        I want you in Dr. Gardner's office 
                        at nine o'clock.  You're out of 
                        control, Curran.

                        Who are you guys gonna sell my 
                        file to this time?

          They stare at him.  He watches as Roxy's body is taken away.

          INT. A POLICE CONFERENCE ROOM -DAY

          He walks in.  He looks good, in control.  Beth Gardner is 
          sitting there with two middle-aged MEN, both of them wearing 
          suits, who smile and scrutinize him the instant he walks in 
          the door.

                                    BETH
                        Hello, Nick.  This is Dr. Myron 
                        and R. McElwaine.  They've been 
                        asked to consult with me on this 
                        evaluation.

          They shake hands with him.

                                    DR. MYRON
                        Sit down, Nick.

          Nick gives him a look: What did he think he was going to do -- 
          stand there?

          He sits down, looks at them.  A beat, as they look at him, 
          then --

                                    DR. MCELWAINE
                               (courtly)
                        Nick -- when you recollect your 
                        childhood, are your recollections 
                        pleasing to you?

          Nick looks at them a long beat in disbelief.

                                    NICK
                               (calmly, directly)
                        Number one I don't remember how 
                        often I used to jack off, but it 
                        was a lot.  Number two I didn't 
                        get pissed off at my dad -- even 
                        after I was old enough to know 
                        what he and mom were doing in the 
                        bedroom.  Number three I don't 
                        look in the toilet before I flush 
                        it.  Number four I don't wet the 
                        bed and haven't for some time.
                        Number five You can go fuck 
                        yourselves because I'm out of here.

          INT. THE CORRIDOR

          He is walking away quickly.  Beth is with him, trying to keep 
          up.  She is very angry.

                                    BETH
                        What is your problem?  I'm trying 
                        to help you.  Why won't you let me 
                        help you?

                                    NICK
                        I don't need any help.

                                    BETH
                        Yes you do.  Something's on with 
                        you.
                               (a beat)
                        You're sleeping with her, aren't 
                        you?

          A beat, he stops looks at her, then keeps walking.

                                    NICK
                        What is this interest you've got 
                        in her?

                                    BETH
                        My interest is in you, not in her.
                        She seduces people, she manipulates --

                                    NICK
                        I thought you hardly know her.

                                    BETH
                        I know the type.  I'm a 
                        psychologist.

          He stops, looks at her.

                                    NICK
                               (after a beat)
                        That means you manipulate people 
                        too, doesn't it, Beth?  You're a 
                        practicing psychologist -- that 
                        means you're better at it than she 
                        is.

          She looks at him a long beat.

                                    BETH
                               (quietly)
                        I feel sorry for you, Nick.

          A beat, and she turns and walks away.

          EXT. ROAD TO STINSON HOUSE - DAY

          Nick is driving down winding road to Stinson house.  He is 
          driving very fast, passing other cars on the winding and 
          twisting road.

          INT. THE STINSON BEACH HOUSE - DAY

          Nick enters and shuts door.  Looking around, he does not see 
          her.

                                    NICK
                        Catherine!
                               (after a beat)
                        Catherine!

          Finally he sees her sitting by the window.  He walks over to 
          her.

                                    CATHERINE
                               (near tears)
                        I should have known.  I came into 
                        the house when you were down on 
                        the beach.  She looked at me so 
                        strangely.  She left right after 
                        you.
                               (a beat)
                        I shouldn't have let her watch us.  
                        She wanted to watch me all the 
                        time.  She tried to kill you, didn't 
                        she?

                                    NICK
                               (a beat)
                        Did you like her to watch?

                                    CATHERINE
                               (a long beat)
                        Do you think I told her to kill 
                        You?

                                    NICK
                               (softly, with 
                               intensity)
                        No.

                                    CATHERINE
                               (after a beat, near 
                               tears)
                        Everybody that I care about dies.

          She is about to break into uncontrolable sobbing.  Nick puts 
          his arms around her.

                                    NICK
                               (soothing)
                        It's OK.  It's OK.

                                    CATHERINE
                               (quietly, almost 
                               begging)
                        Make love to me.

          INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

          They are seen rolling and turning around on each other.

          Their love making is sensual, sincere.

          Later in bed.

                                    NICK
                               (calmly, but 
                               seriously)
                        Do you think she killed Johnny 
                        Boz?

                                    CATHERINE
                               (surprised, startled)
                        For what... to set me up?  She 
                        loved me she wouldn't frame me.

                                    NICK
                               (a beat)
                        Maybe she got jealous of Johnny 
                        Boz, too.

                                    CATHERINE
                               (after a beat)
                        No, she didn't... she never got 
                        jealous before... she got excited.
                               (a beat)
                        I don't have luck with women.
                        There was this girl I met while I 
                        was in college.  I slept with her 
                        once.  She started following me 
                        around, taking my picture.  She 
                        dyed her hair, copied my clothes.
                        Lisa something... Oberman.  It was 
                        awful.

          A long beat, he looks at her.

                                    NICK
                        I thought you didn't do adolescent 
                        secrets.

                        I never have before.

          EXT. THE DECK - MORNING

          It is a bright, sunshiny day.  He is out there looking at the 
          water.  She comes up behind him, hugs him.

                                    CATHERINE
                               (full of life)
                        Isn't it just beautiful?  I love 
                        it here like this.

          He looks at her.

                                    NICK
                               (cold)
                        We're still playing games, aren't 
                        we?

          She looks hurt.

                                    CATHERINE
                        No.

                        No more games, Nick.  I'm tired of 
                        playing games!

          They have their eyes on each other.

                                    NICK
                        Then tell me about Nilsen.

          She turns away from him.  He watches her.

                                    CATHERINE
                        You won't believe me.

          A beat, she looks at him.

                                    CATHERINE
                        I paid him $50,000 in cash for 
                        your psychiatric file.

                                    CATHERINE
                        About three months before I met 
                        you.

                                    NICK
                        Why?

          She turns away from him.

                                    CATHERINE
                        I'd read about your shootings in 
                        the papers.  I decided to write a 
                        book about a detective.  I wanted 
                        to know my character.

                                    NICK
                        You paid $50,000 for your character?

                                    CATHERINE
                        I would've paid more.  I wanted to 
                        know everything about you.  Then 
                        you came down here after Johnny 
                        got killed... it gave me a chance 
                        to get to know my character better.

                               (after a long beat)
                        What about the other night. What 
                        about last night?  Was that to get 
                        to know your character?

                                    CATHERINE
                               (after a beat)
                        Maybe I'm losing interest in my 
                        book.

          Their eyes are on each other.

                                    CATHERINE
                        Do you believe me?

                        I'll convince you.

          And she kisses him slowly, with more and more heat, on the 
          lips.

          The cordless phone on the deck table goes off.  It keeps 
          RINGING.  She breaks finally from the kiss, picks it up.

                                    CATHERINE
                        Hello?

          She listens a beat, then hands him the phone.

                                    CATHERINE
                        It's Gus-who-doesn't-like-me.

          He takes the phone.

                                    NICK
                        Catherine says you don't like her.

                        She wore the same kind of clothes 
                        I did.  It scared me.

                        Why?

          EXT. THE SALINAS CLINIC - DAY

          He walks in; it is a small valley hospital.  He goes up to the 
          desk.  There are two women there.

                        Hi, I'm looking for a Dr. Gardner?

                               (after a beat)
                        We don't have a Dr. Gardner on 
                        staff here.

                                    THE OTHER WOMAN
                        Dr. Joseph Gardner?

                        Yeah.

                                    THE WOMAN
                        He died -- about five or six years 
                        ago.

                        He was shot.

          INT. SALINAS SHERIFF'S OFFICE - DAY

          Nick sits with a sheriff's DETECTIVE.

                                    DETECTIVE
                        He was walking home from work.
                        They only lived a coupla blocks 
                        from the clinic.  Somebody drove 
                        by and shot him.

                        I had another one of you guys down 
                        here from Frisco -- about a year 
                        ago -- he asked me the same 
                        question.  What's this about anyway?

                                    NICK
                        Routine.

                        Yeah, he said it was routine too.
                        Now it's two guys saying it's 
                        routine.

          EXT. HER HOUSE IN STINSON - AFTERNOON

          He walks around the house; he sees her sitting out on the deck, 
          a portable word-processor in front of her.  She is smoking.

          He goes up to her.

                        I finished my book.

                        I told you.  She kills him.

                                    A VOICE INSIDE
                        Catherine?

          Nick looks -- Hazel Dobkins is there.

          Catherine still has her eyes on him.

                                    CATHERINE
                        Right there.

          A beat, and then she turns to go inside.  Hazel Dobkins smiles 
          slowly at him.

          EXT. THE POLICE PARKING LOT - DUSK

          He sits in his Porsche, staring ahead.  He is parked next to 
          Gus' Cadillac.  Gus is suddenly there, onway to his car.

                                    GUS
                               (excited)
                        Catherine Tramell's roommate her 
                        freshman year.  I got a call from 
                        her.  I've been calling people who 
                        were in her dorm all day.  She 
                        must've heard I was trying to talk 
                        to her.  She says she knows all 
                        about Catherine and Lisa Henderson.  
                        She's over in Oakland.  You wanna 
                        come with me?

          Nick just stares ahead.

                                    GUS
                        You look like you seen a ghost, 
                        son?

          Nick looks at him.

          INT. GUS' CADILLAC - NIGHT

          Gus drives.

                        shares office space with?  Dr.  
                        Elizabeth Gardner.

          Nick doesn't even respond.  Gus looks at him.

                                    GUS
                        What in hell's the matter with 
                        you?

          Nick doesn't say anything, stares ahead.

          EXT. AN OFFICE BUILDING - OAKLAND - NIGHT

          Gus gets out with Nick.  It is an old building.

                                    GUS
                        Where the hell you goin'?

                        She said alone -- suite 405.  It 
                        ain't gonna take long.

          A beat, and Nick gets back in the car.

          INT. THE OFFICE BUILDING - NIGHT

          Gus is on the first floor.  There is no one around.  He hits 
          the elevator button.  A beat, and it comes.  He steps in.

          INT. THE ELEVATOR - NIGHT

          He hits the button for the fourth floor.

          The elevator rises a floor, stops.  The door opens.  There is 
          no one there.  Then it starts going up again.  It rises to the 
          third floor.  It stops.  The door opens.  There is no one there.  
          Then it starts to rise again.

          EXT. GUS' CADILLAC - NIGHT

          Nick sits there, staring ahead.

                                    NICK
                               (suddenly, screaming)
                        Gus!

          INT. THE ELEVATOR

          As it goes up.  It stops.  The door starts to open.  As it 
          does -- a figure in a hooded raincoat sweeps into the elevator.  
          It happens very fast.  We see blonde hair around the face.

          But we don't see the face itself -- the head is down, the hood 
          up.  There is an icepick in the figure's hand.  The figure 
          explodes into Gus.  The icepick goes into his neck.

          INT. THE STAIRWAY

          Nick tears desperately up the stairway -- he hits the fourth 
          floor door.  It explodes open.

          INT. THE FOURTH FLOOR

          He stands there a beat, sees the elevator door open.  He runs 
          there,  He sees Gus, crumpled into the corner of the elevator.

          INT. THE ELEVATOR

          He goes into the elevator -- holds Gus.  He is dead.  A long 
          beat.  He sees the gun in Gus' hand -- he takes the gun out of 
          his hand.  He runs out of the elevator.

          INT. THE FOURTH FLOOR

          He hears something.  Gun in hand, he runs towards the SOUND.  
          He stops, gun in hand, listens again.  He runs again, hears 
          nothing.

          Behind him, we see a figure.

          He spins suddenly, gun, in hand.  Beth Gardner is there.

          She wears a windbreaker.  She has her hands in the pockets.

                                    BETH
                        What are you doing here?

                        meet Gus here.  Where is he?

          She smiles a strange smile.  She takes a step toward him.

                                    NICK
                               (screams)

                                    BETH
                        What?

          She smiles strangely again, takes a step toward him.

                                    NICK
                               (screams)
                        Take your hands out of your pockets!

          She moves a hand in a pocket and moves towards him fast --

                                    BETH
                        What is wrong with you?

          And he FIRES the gun.  She is hit in the chest, goes down.

          A long beat, and then he goes to her.  He gets down on the 
          ground.  Her eyes are open.  He empties the pockets of the 
          windbreaker -- first one, then the other the pockets are empty.

                                    BETH
                               (in a whisper)
                        I loved you.

          And she dies.

          INT. THE FOURTH FLOOR - LATER

          A lot of policemen, coroner's guys, photos being taken.

          Nick stands there with Lt. Walker, Harrigan, and some of the 
          Internal Affairs guys.

                                    LT. WALKER
                               (upset)
                        What made you think she had a gun?

          Nick says nothing; he looks like a zombie.

                                    LT. WALKER
                        What the hell was she doing here?  
                        What was Gus doing here?  

          Andrews yells to them from the stairway door.

                                    ANDREWS
                        Lieutenant.

          INT. THE STAIRWAY

          A FORENSICS MAN very carefully handles a hooded rain coat in a 
          stair landing.  He wears gloves.

          Nick is there with Lt. Walker.

          The Forensics Man picks the raincoat up -- a long blonde wig 
          falls out of it.  There are flecks of blood on it.

          He reaches into the pocket and pulls out an  icepick.  It has 
          a thin steel handle and is bloody.  He hands the icepick to an 
          assistant.

          He looks at the raincoat.  It has blood on it.

                                    THE FORENSICS MAN
                        It's departmental issue.

                                    LT. WALKER
                               (quietly)
                        Jesus.

          INT. BETH GARDNER'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

          Nick with Lt. Walker.  Nick looks like a zombie.  Andrews comes 
          up to them.  He has a gun in his hands.

                                    ANDREWS
                        Thirty-eight caliber revolver.

          Bottom drawer, bureau in the bedroom.

                                    LT. WALKER
                        Have  ballistics check it for 
                        Nilsen.

          Harrigan comes out.

                                    HARRIGAN
                        Lieutenant, you'd better come in 
                        here.

          Lt. Walker goes into the kitchen.  Nick follows him.

          There are several cops around a kitchen cabinet.  A drawer is 
          open.

          Walker looks -- we look with him.  We see a copy of Love hurts, 
          Catherine's paperback book, and a stack of photos of Catherine.

          Walker picks the photos up, goes through them -- we see shots 
          of Catherine in college -- Catherine at a fight --Catherine 
          with Johnny Boz -- Catherine with Roxy.

          He hands the photos to Nick.

          Nick stares at them.

                                    LT. WALKER
                        I guess that's it.

          INT. THE DETECTIVE BUREAU - NIGHT

          Nick sits, his feet up.  He looks like a zombie.  With him are 
          Lt. Walker, Andrews, and Captain Talcott.  We see other 
          plainclothesmen in the b.g. -- a flurry of activity, people on 
          phones.  A long beat.

                                    LT. WALKER
                        She must've heard you on the 
                        stairway and dumped the stuff.

          Nick says nothing, stares off.

          A DETECTIVE comes over to them.

                                    DETECTIVE
                        There was no suite 405 in that 
                        building.  Catherine Tramell's 
                        roommate in her freshman year is 
                        dead.  She died of leukemia two 
                        years ago.

          An INTERNAL AFFAIRS MAN comes over to them.

                                    INTERNAL AFFAIRS MAN
                        Our files on Dr. Gardner show 
                        nothing about a police report in 
                        Berkeley -- nothing related to 
                        Salinas, either.

          A long beat -- the phone RINGS.  Andrews picks it up, listens.

                                    ANDREWS
                        Thanks.

          He hangs up.

                                    ANDREWS
                        Ballistics says the .38 we found 
                        in her apartment matches Nilsen.  
                        No registration.  They're checking 
                        with Salinas.  The icepick is the 
                        same brand and model as the Boz 
                        weapon.

          A long beat -- Nick just stares.

          Harrigan comes up to them.

                                    HARRIGAN
                        We checked the tape machines at 
                        Dr.  Gardner's apartment and at 
                        her office -- both here and the 
                        one on Van Ness.  No message from 
                        Gus on any of 'em.  The one at her 
                        apartment was broken.
                               (a beat)
                        Johnny Boz's psychiatrist says he 
                        thinks he remembers Dr. Gardner 
                        and Boz meeting at a Christmas 
                        party at his house a year ago.

          A long beat.

                                    LT. WALKER
                               (after a long beat, 
                               sadly)
                        You just can't tell about people, 
                        can you.  Even the ones you think 
                        you know inside-out.

          He and Nick look at each other a beat.

                                    CAPTAIN TALCOTT
                        Congratulations, Curran.

          Nick looks at him, expressionless.

          EXT. HIS APARTMENT - NIGHT

          He parks his car.  It is dark.  Foggy.

          He starts heading inside.

          INT. HIS APARTMENT - NIGHT

          He goes in.  He starts to walk up the dark stairway, we see 
          him walking up several flights of steps.

          INT. THE CORRIDOR TO HIS APARTMENT

          He opens his door with his key.

          INT. HIS APARTMENT

          He walks in.  The apartment is dark.

                                    A VOICE
                               (behind him)
                        Hi.

          It is a whisper, almost a hiss.  He spins, fast.  Catherine 
          stands there, pressing herself against a wall.  They look at 
          each other a long beat.  She looks like she is almost in a 
          trance.

                                    CATHERINE
                        I heard about it... on TV.

          He looks at her, expressionless.  A long beat, their eyes are 
          into each other.  She looks like she is almost shivering.

                                    CATHERINE
                        I can't allow myself to care about 
                        you -- I can't allow myself to 
                        care -- I can't -- I can't --

          She looks very emotional.  He moves towards her, puts his arms 
          around her, holds her very close.

                                    CATHERINE
                               (in a whisper)
                        I don't want to do this -- please --
                        I don't want to do this -- I lose 
                        everybody -- I don't want to lose 
                        you -- I don't want to --

          He presses her closer and closer to himself, holds her.

          INT. HIS BEDROOM - NIGHT

          It is dark; we can't see clearly.

          Atop her... he makes love to her... gently... tenderly...  
          hardly moving inside her... there are tears in her eyes...

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

          INT. HIS BEDROOM - LATER

          Atop him... she is on her knees, straddling him... he is on 
          his back, his eyes are closed... her head arches back...  her 
          breasts high... he strains toward her with his body...  she 
          holds her arms high... her right hand is in a fist...

          (we only see the back of her hand and arm)... it comes down 
          suddenly... he bucks... writhes... then her whole body falls 
          on top of him.

          A very long beat...

          We can't see him... her body completely covers him...

          And then finally he moves... turns her to the side...  kisses 
          her.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

          INT. HIS BEDROOM - LATER

          The Stones play "Sympathy For The Devil"  in the b.g.; the 
          MUSIC is low.

          They lie next to each other on the bed.  The CAMERA faces them.  
          He lies, staring at the ceiling, on the left side of the bed, 
          smoking a cigarette.  She is curled away from him toward the 
          right side of the bed.  A long beat, then --

                                    CATHERINE
                        What do we do now, Nick?

                                    NICK
                               (after a long beat)
                        We fuck like minks.  We raise 
                        rugrats.  We live happily ever 
                        after.

          We see her right arm go to the side of the bed and then over.  
          He stares at the ceiling.

                                    CATHERINE
                        I hate rugrats.

                                    NICK
                               (after a long beat)
                        We fuck like minks.  We forget the 
                        rugrats.  We live happily ever 
                        after.

          We see from an ANGLE to the left side of the bed now Her face 
          is expressionless.  Her right arm dangles over the right side 
          of the bed.  Her right hand is clenched.  Is she holding 
          something in it against her arm?

          We see them from an ANGLE to the left side of the bed now: He 
          turns his body away from her to put out his cigarette.

          We see her behind him slowly turning towards him and the CAMERA.  
          A beat, and he turns towards her.

          They look at each other.  A long beat as the SONG gets louder.  
          We see them in CLOSEUP.  We don't see her right arm.

                                    CATHERINE
                               (in a whisper)
                        I love you.

          A beat, and he kisses her.  The CAMERA BACKS AWAY from them 
          slowly to the right side of the bedroom as they kiss, and we --

                                                              FADE TO BLACK

          ... A long beat, as the SONG keeps playing... and we...

          FADE IN:

          We see them from the right side of the bedroom.  And then the 
          CAMERA LOWERS SLOWLY as they kiss with more and more passion.

          It keeps going LOWER.

          There is something under the bed.  The CAMERA MOVES CLOSER 
          towards it as "SYMPATHY FOR THE DEVIL" plays louder.  We see 
          it now in CLOSEUP as the bed rustles above...

          It is a thin, steel-handled icepick.

          The SONG plays LOUDER and LOUDER, and we --

                                                                   FADE OUT

          INT. A BEDROOM - NIGHT

          It is dark; we don't see clearly.  a man and woman make love 
          on a brass bed.  There are mirrors on the walls and ceiling.  
          On a side table, atop a small mirror, lines of cocaine.  A 
          tape deck PLAYS the Stones "Sympathy for the Devil."

          Atop him... she straddles his chest... her breasts in his face.  
          He cups her breasts.  She leans down, kisses him...

          JOHNNY BOZ is in his late 40's, slim, good-looking.  We don't 
          see the woman's face.  She has long blonde hair.  The CAMERA 
          STAYS BEHIND and to the side of them.

          She leans close over his face, her tongue in his mouth...  she 
          kisses him... she moves her hands up, holds both of his arms 
          above his head.

          She moves higher atop him... she reaches to the side of the 
          bed... a white silk scarf is in her hand... her hips above his 
          face now, moving... slightly, oh-so slightly... his face strains 
          towards her.

          The scarf in her hand... she ties his hands with it...  
          gently... to the brass bed... his eyes are closed...  tighter... 
          lowering hips into his face... lower... over his chest... his 
          navel.  The SONG plays.

          He is inside her... his head arches back... his throat white.

          She arches her back... her hips grind... her breasts are high...

          Her back arches back... back... her head tilts back... she 
          extends her arms... the right arm comes down suddenly...  the 
          steel flashes... his throat is white...

          He bucks, writhes, bucks, convulses...

          It flashes up... it flashes down... and up... and down...  and 
          up... and...

          EXT. A BROWNSTONE IN PACIFIC HEIGHTS - MORNING

          Winter in San Francisco cold, foggy.  Cop cars everywhere.  
          The lights play through the thick fog.  Two Homicide detectives 
          get out of the car, walk into the house.

          NICK CURRAN is 42.  Trim, good-looking, a nice suit; a face 
          urban, edged, shadowed.  GUS MORAN is 64.  Crew-cut, silver 
          beard, a suit rumpled and shiny, a hat out of the 50'sa face 
          worn and ruined the face of a backwoods philosopher.

          INT. THE BROWNSTONE

          There's money here -- deco, clean, hip -- That looks like a 
          Picasso on the wall.  They check it out.

                                    GUS
                        Who was this fuckin' guy?

                                    NICK
                        Rock and roll, Gus.  Johnny Boz.

                                    GUS
                        I never heard of him.

                        Mid-sixties.  Five or six hits.
                        He's got a club down in the Fillmore 
                        now.

                                    GUS
                        Not now he don't.

          Past the uniformed guys... nods... waves... past the forensic 
          men... past the coroner's investigators... they get to the 
          bedroom.

          INT. THE BEDROOM

          They walk in, stare -- it's messy.

          It's like a convention in here.  LT. PHIL WALKER, in his 50's, 
          silver-haired, the Homicide guys; JIM HARRIGAN, late 40's, 
          puffy, affable;  SAM ANDREWS, 30's, black.  A CORONER'S MAN is 
          working the bed.

                                    LT. WALKER
                               (to Nick and Gus)
                        You guys know Captain Talcott?

          They nod.

                                    GUS
                        What's the Chief's office doin' 
                        here.

                                    CAPT. TALCOTT
                        Observing.

                                    LT. WALKER
                               (to the Coroner's 
                               Guy)
                        What do you think, Doc?

                                    THE CORONER'S GUY
                        The skin blanches when I press it --
                        this kind of color is about right 
                        for six or eight hours.

                                    LT. WALKER
                        Nobody say anything.  The maid 
                        came in an hour ago and found him.
                        She's not a live-in.

                                    GUS
                        Maybe the maid did it.

                                    LT. WALKER
                        She's 54 years old and weighs 240 
                        pounds.

                                    THE CORONER'S GUY
                               (deadpan)
                        There are no bruises on his body.

                                    GUS
                               (grins)
                        It ain't the maid.

                                    LT. WALKER
                        He left the club with his girlfriend 
                        about midnight.  That's the last 
                        time anybody saw him.

                                    NICK
                               (looks at body)
                        What was it?

                                    THE CORONER'S GUY
                        Ice pick.  Left on the coffee table 
                        in the living room.  Thin steel 
                        handle.  Forensics took it downtown.

                                    HARRIGAN
                        There's come all over the sheets --
                        he got off before he got offed.

                                    GUS
                               (deadpan)
                        That rules the maid out for sure.

                                    CAPT. TALCOTT
                        This is sensitive.  Mr. Boz was a 
                        major contributor to the mayor's 
                        campaign.  He was Chairman of the 
                        Board of the Palace of Fine Arts --

                                    GUS
                               (to Nick)
                        I thought you said he was a rock 
                        and roll star.

                                    LT. WALKER
                        He was a retired rock and roll 
                        star.

                                    CAPT. TALCOTT
                        A civic-minded, very respectable 
                        rock and roll star.

                                    GUS
                        What's that over there?

          We see the white powder laid out in lines on the small mirror 
          on the side table.

                                    NICK
                               (deadpan)
                        It looks like some civic-minded, 
                        very respectable cocaine to me, 
                        Gus.

                                    CAPT. TALCOTT
                               (evenly, to Nick)
                        Listen to me, Curran.  I'm going 
                        to get a lot of heat on this.  I 
                        don't want any... mistakes.

          Nick and Talcott look at each other a beat, then --

                                    NICK
                        Who's the girlfriend?

          Lt. Walker looks at the notepad in his hand.

                                    LT. WALKER
                        Catherine Tramell, 162 Divisadero.

          Nick writes it down.  He and Gus turn, leave.  Captain Talcott 
          watches them.  He looks disturbed.

          INT. THE LIVING ROOM

          As they head out --

                                    NICK
                        Talcott doesn't usually show up at 
                        the office 'till after his 18 holes.  
                        What are they nervous about?

                                    GUS
                        They're executives.  They're nervous 
                        about everything.

                                    LT. WALKER
                        Nick!

          He stops, turns, sees Walker behind them.  Walker comes up to 
          them.

                                    LT. WALKER
                               (to Nick)
                        Keep your three o'clock.

                                    NICK
                        Do you want me to work the case, 
                        Phil, or do you want me to --

                                    LT. WALKER
                        I said keep it.

          EXT. A VICTORIAN ON DIVISADERO - DAY

          It is more a mansion than a house.  They ring the bell.  An 
          Hispanic MAID answers.  They flash their badges.

                                    NICK
                        I'm Detective Curran, this is 
                        Detective Moran.  We're with the 
                        San Francisco Police Department.

          We'd like to speak to Ms. Catherine Tramell.

                                    THE MAID
                               (after a beat, an 
                               accent)
                        Just moment.  Come in.

          She leads them into a lavish, beautifully done living room 
          that offers a sweeping view of the Bay.

                                    THE MAID
                        Sit, please.  Just moment.

          They look around, impressed.  There is a Picasso on the wall 
          here, too.

                                    GUS
                        Ain't that cute?  They got his and 
                        her Pig-assos, son.

                                    NICK
                               (smiles)
                        I didn't know you knew who Picasso 
                        was, Gus.

                                    GUS
                               (grins)
                        I'm a smart sonofabitch.  I just 
                        hide it.

          Nick smiles -- and at that moment a beautiful BLONDE walks 
          into the room.  She looks like she has been asleep.  She is in 
          her early 20's.  She wears a very sheer robe.

                                    NICK
                        We're sorry to disturb you, we'd 
                        like to ask you some --

                                    THE WOMAN
                        Are you vice?

                        What do you want?

                                    GUS
                        When was the last time you saw 
                        John Boz? 

                                    THE WOMAN
                        Is he dead?

                                    NICK
                               (after a beat)
                        Why do you think he's dead?

                                    THE WOMAN
                        You wouldn't be here otherwise, 
                        would you?

                                    GUS
                        Were you with him last night?

                                    THE WOMAN
                        You're looking for Catherine, not 
                        me.

                                    NICK
                        Who are you?

                                    THE WOMAN

                        I'm her -- friend.

          She looks at them a beat.

                                    ROXY
                        She's out at the beach house at 
                        Stinson.  Seadrift.  1402.

                                    NICK
                        Thanks.

          They start to head out.

                                    ROXY
                        You're wasting your time. Catherine 
                        didn't kill him.

          A beat, they look at her, and go...

          EXT. SEADRIFT - STINSON BEACH - DAY

          Foggy.  Cold.  It is an expensive spit of land on the ocean.  
          Multi-million dollar "beach houses" with gardens and swimming 
          pools.  There are two Ferraris in the driveway -- one black, 
          one white.

          They get out of the car in front of the house.  They see a 
          woman in back of the house, sitting on a deck chair, staring 
          at the sea, a blanket around her.  As they get to her --

                                    NICK
                        Ms. Tramell?

          She takes a long look a Nick, then looks away.

          CATHERINE TRAMELL is 30 years old.  She has long blonde hair 
          and a refined, classically beautiful face.  She is not knockout 
          gorgeous like Roxy; there is a smoky kind of sensuousness about 
          her.

                                    NICK
                        I'm De...

                               (evenly)
                        I know who you are.

          She doesn't look at them.  She looks at the water.

                                    CATHERINE
                        How did he die?

                                    GUS
                        He was murdered.

                                    CATHERINE
                        Really.  Maybe that's why you're 
                        from Homicide.  How?

          Nick glances at Gus.

                                    NICK
                        With an ice pick.

          She closes her eyes a beat and then, still staring out, we see 
          a thin smile.  They see it, too, and glance at each other.

                                    NICK
                        How long were you dating him?

                                    CATHERINE
                        I wasn't dating him.  I was fucking 
                        him.

          They glance at each other again.

                                    GUS
                        What are you -- a pro?

          Catherine looks at him -- that thin smile again.

                                    CATHERINE
                        No.  I'm an amateur.

          She looks away.

                                    NICK
                        How long were you having sex with 
                        him?

                                    CATHERINE
                        About a year and a half.

                                    NICK
                        Were you with him last night?

                        Yes.

                        Did you go home with him?

                                    CATHERINE
                        No.  We had a drink at the club.
                        We left together.  I came here.  
                        He went home.

                        Was there anyone with you last 
                        night?

                               (looks at Nick)
                        No.  I wasn't in the mood to have 
                        sex with anyone last night.

          They look at her a beat.

                                    NICK
                        Let me ask you something, Ms.
                        Tramell?  Are you sorry he's dead?

          Catherine looks at him.

                                    CATHERINE
                        Yes.  I liked fucking him.

          They stare at her.  She looks out at the water.

                                    CATHERINE
                        I don't really feel like talking 
                        anymore.

                        Listen, lady, we can do this 
                        downtown if you --

                                    CATHERINE
                        Read me my rights and arrest me 
                        and I'll go downtown.

          She doesn't even look at them.

                                    CATHERINE
                               (quietly)
                        Otherwise, get the fuck out of 
                        here.  Please.

          A long beat as they look at her.

          INT. A CORRIDOR - POLICE HEADQUARTERS

          The door says Dr. Elizabeth Gardner, Counseling.  Nick opens 
          the door, peeks in.  The receptionist is not there.  A clock 
          says 3.

          INT. THE COUNSELING OFFICE

          He walks in -- sees the inner door open, walks in.

                        I'm sorry, Beth.  I -- I got hung 
                        up in Stinson.

          DR. ELIZABETH GARDNER, the police psychologist, is a very good-
          looking, dark-haired woman.  She is 30.

                        I'm fine.  Come on, Beth!  You 
                        know I'm fine!  How the hell long 
                        do I have to keep doing this?

                        As long as Internal Affairs wants 
                        you to, I suppose.  Sit down, Nick.

                                    NICK
                        It's bullshit.  You know it is.

                               (smiles)
                        I know it is -- but sit down anyway 
                        so we can get it over with, okay?

          He sits down.

                                    BETH
                        So -- how are things?

                        Things are fine.  I told you.
                        They're fine.

          She watches him closely.

                                    BETH
                               (after a beat)
                        How is your -- personal life?

                        My sex life is pretty shitty 
                        actually since I stopped seeing 
                        you -- maybe I should think about 
                        my Electrolux again.

          That embarrassed her; she looks away from him.

                                    NICK
                               (after a beat)
                        Sorry.

          She shrugs.  A beat.

                        How about the booze?

                        How's not smoking?

                        Thank you.

          And he starts heading out.

          He doesn't even turn, pretends he didn't hear.

          INT. THE DETECTIVE BUREAU

          He walks in.  Gus Moran gets up from his desk as soon as he

                        The scarf is Hermes, expensive --
                        they sell about 20,000 a year

                        The powder was cocaine, high-
                        quality, high-content.  He inhaled 
                        it; there were minute quantities 
                        on his lips and penis.  Mr. Boz 
                        leaves five million dollars, no

                        He liked his coke, he liked his 
                        girls, and he liked rock and roll.

                        He liked the mayor, too, right?

          Talcott gives him a look.

          He sits on the couch, reading a book.  It is a paperback.

          We see the title -- Love Hurts, by Catherine Adams.  He puts 
          the book down a beat, then picks the phone up, dials.

                        your murderer and acted out the 
                        killing described in ritualistic, 
                        literal detail.  Two.  Someone who 
                        wants to do the person who wrote 
                        this book harm read the book and 
                        enacted the killing described to 
                        incriminate the writer.

                               (after a long beat)
                        What if the writer did it?  What 
                        are we dealing with?

                                    DR. LAMOTT
                        You're dealing with a devious, 
                        diabolical mind.  This book must 
                        have been written at least six 
                        months, maybe years before it was 
                        published.  That means the writer 
                        planned the crime, at least in the 
                        subconscious, back then.  The fact 
                        that the writer carried it out 
                        indicates psychopathic obsessive 
                        behavior in terms not only of the 
                        killing itself but in terms of 
                        applied advance defense mechanism.

          A long beat.

                                    GUS
                        Most times I can't tell shit from 
                        shinola, Doc.  What was all that 
                        you just said?

          Some grins, titters.

                                    BETH
                        She anticipates the book to be her 
                        best alibi.

                                    DR. LAMOTT
                        Correct.

                                    BETH
                        She's going to say Do you think 
                        I'd be dumb enough to kill anyone 
                        in the exact way I've described in 
                        my book?  I wouldn't do that because 
                        I'd know I'd be a suspect.

          A long beat -- as they think about it.

                                    NICK
                        What if it's not the writer?  What 
                        if it's someone who read the book?

                                    DR. LAMOTT
                        You're dealing then with someone 
                        so obsessed that he or she is 
                        willing to kill an irrelevant and 
                        innocent victim to place the blame 
                        on the person who wrote this book.  
                        We are talking about deep-seated, 
                        obsessional hatred; an utter lack 
                        of sense of proportion or 
                        perspective.

                                    GUS
                        We've got a top-of-the-line, once-
                        in-a-lifetime loony-tune either 
                        way you cut it -- that's what you're 
                        saying, right, Doc?

                                    DR. LAMOTT
                        You're dealing with someone very 
                        dangerous and very ill.

          INT. THE PROSECUTOR'S OFFICE - DAY

          PROSECUTOR JOHN CORRIGAN, a big man in his 50's, with Captain 
          Talcott, Lt. Walker, Nick, and Gus.

          Corrigan is reading a file.  He gets up, yawns, goes to his 
          window, looks out.

                                    CORRIGAN
                        Come on, you know there's no case 
                        here.  There's no physical evidence -- 
                        okay, she doesn't have an alibi 
                        but there's no motive.  Her defense 
                        would just beat us to death with 
                        the copycat thing.  Anybody who 
                        read the book could have done it.

          A long beat; no one says anything.

                                    NICK
                        So what do we do -- nothing?

                                    LT. WALKER
                               (after a beat)
                        We bring her in for questioning.

                                    TALCOTT
                        She's got enough money to burn 
                        this whole department down.

                                    LT. WALKER
                        She was the last person seen with 
                        the guy -- I'll take the 
                        responsibility.

                                    TALCOTT
                        It's yours.

                                    CORRIGAN
                        It won't do any good.  She'll come 
                        in with Lee Bailey and Mel Belli 
                        trailing behind her on a solid 
                        gold chain from Tiffanys.

                                    TALCOTT
                        Yes she will.

                                    NICK
                               (after a beat)
                        No she won't.

          They look at him.

                                    NICK
                               (smiles)
                        I don't think she's going to hide 
                        behind anybody.  I don't think 
                        she's going to hide at all.

                                    TALCOTT
                               (after a beat)
                        I think you're as crazy as she 
                        probably is, Curran.

          Nicks says nothing.

                                    GUS
                        You know what they say: It takes 
                        one to know one.

          Nick looks a Gus, grins.

          EXT. HER HOUSE IN STINSON - DAY

          They walk from the car to the door of the big beach house.

          They ring the bell.  They hear typing inside.  The typing stops.  
          She comes to the door in jeans and a tight-fitting sweatshirt.

                                    NICK
                        Ms. Tramell, we'd like you to come 
                        downtown and answer some questions 
                        for us.

                                    CATHERINE
                        Are you arresting me?

                                    NICK
                        If that's the way you want to play 
                        it.

          They look at each other a beat.

                                    CATHERINE
                               (smiles)
                        Can I change into something more 
                        appropriate?  It'll just take a 
                        minute.

          He nods.

                                    CATHERINE
                        Come in.

          INT. THE HOUSE

          It is beautifully done in a Santa Fe motif.  She goes to a 
          bedroom of the living room.

          Nick sits down on a couch facing the bedroom she's walked into.  
          Gus sits across from him, his back to the bedroom.

          There is a coffee table between them.  She leaves the bedroom 
          door halfway open.

          An old newspaper is on the coffee table.  Nick reaches for it.  
          The headline says VICE COP CLEARED IN TOURIST SHOOTINGS.  A 
          headline underneath says GRAND JURY SAYS SHOOTINGS ACCIDENTAL.  
          There is a photograph of Nick.

          He stares at the paper.

                                    CATHERINE
                        How long will this take?

          Nick puts the paper down on the coffee table.  He is lost in 
          his thoughts.  Gus picks the paper up.

                                    NICK
                               (looks up)
                        I don't know.

          Nick, facing the half open bedroom door, sees a mirror near 
          the wall of the bedroom.  The mirror reflects her in the other 
          corner of the bedroom.  She is taking her clothes off.  He 
          stares.  She strips down.  He sees her back. She has a beautiful 
          body.  Naked, she puts a dress on.  She doesn't put any 
          underwear on.

                                    NICK
                        Do you always keep old newspapers 
                        around?

                                    CATHERINE
                        Only when they make interesting 
                        reading.

          And she is suddenly out of the bedroom.  She stands there, 
          smiles.  They look at each other a long beat.

                                    CATHERINE
                               (finally)
                        I'm ready.

          They get up, head out.

                                    GUS
                        You have the right to an attorney.

                                    CATHERINE
                        Why would I need an attorney?

          INT. THE CAR - DAY

          They sit in the front; she is in the back.  The car goes over 
          the winding, two-lane Mt. Tamalpais road.

          The fog is heavy.  It's starting to rain.  We see the beach 
          far below.

                                    CATHERINE
                        Do you have a cigarette?

                                    NICK
                        I don't smoke.

                                    CATHERINE
                        Yes, you do.

                                    NICK
                        I quit.

          She smiles, looks at him.  A beat, and he turns away.  Another 
          beat, and she lights a cigarette up.

                                    NICK
                        I thought you were out of 
                        cigarettes.

                                    CATHERINE
                        I found some in my purse; would 
                        you like one?

          He turns back to her.

                                    NICK
                        I told you -- I quit.

                                    CATHERINE
                        It won't last.

          A beat, as she looks at him, and then he turns away.

                                    GUS
                        You workin' on another book?

                                    CATHERINE
                        Yes I am.

                                    GUS
                        It must really be somehtin' --makin' 
                        stuff up all the time.

          He watches her in the rearview mirror.

                                    CATHERINE
                        It teaches you to lie.

                                    GUS
                        How's that?

                                    CATHERINE
                        You make it up, but it has to be 
                        believable.  They call it suspension 
                        of disbelief.

                                    GUS
                        I like that.  "Suspension of 
                        Disbelief."

          He smiles at her in the mirror.

                                    NICK
                        What's your new book about?

                                    CATHERINE
                        A detective.  He falls for the 
                        wrong woman.

          He turns back to her.

                                    NICK
                        What happens to him?

          She looks right into his eye.

                                    CATHERINE
                        She kills him.

          A beat, as they look at each other, and then he turns away 
          from her.  Gus watcher her in the rearview mirror.

          INT. A POLICE INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY

          It is large, fluorescent-lighted, antiseptic.

          She walks in with Nick and Gus.  In the room are prosecutor 
          John Corrigan, Lt. Walker, Captain Talcott, Harrigan, and 
          Andrews.  There is a police stenographer a plain young woman 
          in her 20's.

          As soon as she comes in --

                                    CORRIGAN
                        I'm John Corrigan.  I'm an assistant 
                        district attorney, Ms.  Tramell.  
                        Can we get you anything?  Would 
                        you like some coffee?

                                    CATHERINE
                        No thank you.

                                    TALCOTT
                        Are your attorneys --

                                    NICK
                               (hiding a smile)
                        Ms. Tramell waived her right to an 
                        attorney.

          Corrigan and Talcott glance at Nick.  She sees the look.

                                    CATHERINE
                               (smiles)
                        Did I miss something?

                                    NICK
                        I told them you wouldn't want an 
                        attorney present.

                                    LT. WALKER
                        Why have you waived your right to 
                        an attorney, Ms. Tramell?

                                    CATHERINE
                               (to Nick)
                        Why did you think I wouldn't want 
                        one?

                                    NICK
                        I told them you wouldn't want to 
                        hide.

                                    CATHERINE
                        I have nothing to hide.

          The two of them keep their eyes on each other.

          She sits down.  They sit around her.  Nick sits directly across 
          from her.  She lights up a cigarette.  They watch her.  

          She is poised, cool, in complete command of herself.

                                    CORRIGAN
                        There is no smoking in this 
                        building, Ms. Tramell.

                                    CATHERINE
                        What are you going to do?  Charge 
                        me with smoking?

          Ever so casually, she blows her smoke across at Nick.

                        Would you tell us the nature of 
                        your relationship with Mr. Boz?

                                    CATHERINE
                        I had sex with him for about a 
                        year and a half.  I liked having 
                        sex with him.

          She has control of the room; she looks from one man to the 
          other as she speaks.

                                    CATHERINE
                        He wasn't afraid of experimenting.  
                        I like men like that.  I like men 
                        who give me pleasure.  He gave me 
                        a lot of pleasure.

          A beat, as they watch her.  She is so matter-of-fact.

                                    CORRIGAN
                        Did you ever engage in sado-

                        Exactly what do you have in mind, 
                        Mr. Corrigan.

                               flustered)
                        Did you ever tie him up?

                                    CATHERINE
                        No.

                        You never tied him up.

                                    CATHERINE
                        No. Johnny liked to use his hands 
                        too much.  I like hands and fingers.

          They stare at her.

                        I've always had a fondness for 
                        white silk scarves.
                               (she smiles)
                        I have a very vivid imagination.

                                    NICK
                        But you said you liked men to use 
                        their hands.

                                    CATHERINE
                        No.  I said I liked Johnny to use 
                        his hands.

                        go with the flow.

          They have their eyes on each other.

                        I'd have to be pretty stupid to 
                        write a book about a killing and 
                        then kill him the way I described 
                        in my book. I'd be announcing myself 
                        as the killer.  I'm not stupid.

                        Maybe that's what you're counting 
                        on to get you off the hook.

                        Writing a book about it gives you 
                        an alibi for not killing him.

                        Yes it does, doesn't it?

          She holds his eyes a second, then --

                                    CATHERINE
                        The answer is no.  I didn't kill 
                        him.

                        I think that's irrelevant to this

                        I wanted to write a book about the

                        went down to his club and picked 
                        him up.  Then I had sex with him.

          EXAMINER.  Nick stands outside watching her with Gus and Lt. 
          Walker.  Her back is to them.  The Examiner shuts the machine 
          down, gathers rolls of papers, and comes out of the cubicle.

                                    THE EXAMINER
                        No blips, no blood pressure

                        adrenal glands.  In my opinion, 
                        this woman is telling the truth.

          The Examiner walks away.  They stand there. Catherine stands 
          at the door of the cubicle behind them --

                                    CATHERINE
                        Can I go now?

                                    LT. WALKER
                               (after a beat)
                        Yes.  Thanks for coming in, Ms.
                        Tramell.  I'm sorry to inconvenience 
                        you.

          She says nothing, has a thin smile.

                                    CATHERINE
                        Can I ask one of you for a ride?

          They look at her a beat.

                                    NICK
                        Sure.

                                    CATHERINE
                               (smiles)
                        Thanks.

          And he and Catherine walk away.  Gus and Walker watch them.

          INT. HIS CAR - NIGHT

          It is an old, mint-condition silver Porsche.  It is pouring 
          rain; the wind is blowing a San Francisco winter storm.  Nothing 
          is said a long beat as he drives.  She yawns.  Stretches.  He 
          looks at her.

                                    CATHERINE
                               (smiles)
                        I'm tired.

                                    NICK
                        It's got to be tiring to beat that 
                        machine.

          She looks at him and looks away.  A beat.

                                    CATHERINE
                        If I were guilty, and if I wanted 
                        to beat that machine, it wouldn't 
                        be tiring.  It wouldn't be tiring 
                        at all.

                                    NICK
                        Why not?

                                    CATHERINE
                        Because I'm a professional liar.  
                        I spend most of my waking hours 
                        dwelling on my lies.
                               (a beat)
                        For my writing.

          He looks at her.

                                    CATHERINE
                               (smiles)
                        I love the rain, don't you?

          He says nothing, doesn't look at her.

                                    CATHERINE
                        You took a polygraph after you 
                        shot those two people, didn't you?

          He looks at her now.

                                    NICK
                        I passed.

                                    CATHERINE
                        You see?  We're both innocent, 
                        Nick.

          He pulls up in front of her house on Divisadero, stops.  He 
          sees the white Ferrari in the driveway.

                                    NICK
                        How do you know all this stuff 
                        about me?

                                    CATHERINE
                        You know all about me.

                                    NICK
                        I don't know anything that isn't 
                        police business.

                                    CATHERINE
                               (after a beat)
                        You know I don't like to wear any 
                        underwear, don't you, Nick?

          They look at each other a beat.

                                    CATHERINE
                               (smiles)
                        Thanks for the ride.

          And she's out of the car.  He watches her as she hurries in 
          the rain -- his eyes on her until the moment she opens the 
          door and is inside.

          INT. THE TEN-FOUR - NIGHT

          It is a police bar, San Francisco style.  Ferns  Joe Montana 
          and Will Clark posters.  The jukebox has a lot of Tony Bennett.

          He walks in.  He sees Lt. Walker at a back booth with Gus, 
          goes to them, sits down.

                                    LT. WALKER
                        What is all this "Nick" stuff --
                        Nick would you like a cigarette.
                        Nick can you give me a ride.

                                    NICK
                        She didn't ask me for the ride.
                        She asked anybody.

                                    LT. WALKER
                        And you volunteered.

          A BARTENDER stays behind the bar, but yells to him.

                                    THE BARTENDER
                        Perrier, Nick?

                                    NICK
                        Double Black Jack rocks, Harry.

                                    GUS
                               (with concern)
                        What you doin', son?

                                    NICK
                        It's my first drink in three months.  
                        That okay with you, pop?
                               (to Lt. Walker)
                        She doesn't know me.  I never saw 
                        her before Gus and I talked to 
                        her.

                                    THE BARTENDER
                        Here you go, Nick.

          He gets up, gets his drink --

                                    NICK
                        Thanks, Harry.

          He sits back down.  He takes a big slug.  They watch him.

                                    LT. WALKER
                        You sure?

                                    NICK
                        I'm sure.

          He takes another big slug.

                                    NICK
                        Now what?

                                    LT. WALKER
                        What now what? Now nothing.  She 
                        passed the polygraph.  That's it.

                                    NICK
                        She knew she could beat it.  That's 
                        why she asked to take it.

                                    LT. WALKER
                        How the fuck do you know?  What is 
                        it with you and this broad anyway?

                                    NICK
                        Come on, Phil.  You're not gonna 
                        let this slide.  What about her 
                        parents?  What about what else 
                        she's published?  At least we should 
                        get the stuff to see if we find 
                        anything else that's an amazing 
                        real-life coincidence.

                                    LT. WALKER
                        Her parents died in an accident.  
                        I don't care what else she's 
                        written.  What are you -- a book 
                        critic?

                                    NICK
                        How did they die?  Was there an 
                        investigation?

                                    LT. WALKER
                        How you're saying she killed her 
                        parents?  Did she kill Bobby 
                        Vasquez, too?

                                    GUS
                        Not unless she got up in the ring 
                        and turned into one mean 
                        sonofabitch.

                                    LT. WALKER
                        Maybe she did, Gus.  Maybe she 
                        grew herself an Afro and learned a 
                        left hook and put shoe polish on 
                        her face.  Let's polygraph her 
                        again and ask her about it.

                                    NICK
                               (casually)
                        Fuck you, Phil.

                                    LT. WALKER
                        Fuck you, too Nick.

          A beat, then --

                                    NICK
                               (calls to the 
                               Bartender)
                        Can you get me another double Black 
                        Jack, Harry.

          Gus looks at him with concern.  A man in his 50's -- LT. MARTIN 
          NILSEN  is suddenly there.  He is overweight, florid.

                                    NILSEN
                               (to Nick)
                        Hey, shooter -- You back on the 
                        Black Jack, Shooter?

          He grins.  Nick doesn't look at him.

                                    LT. WALKER
                        We're discussing a case, Marty.

                                    NILSEN
                        I know that.  I had no doubt of 
                        that.

                                    THE BARTENDER
                        Here you go, Nick.

          Nilsen takes the drink, hands it to Nick.

                                    NILSEN
                               (grins)
                        Double, huh, Shooter?

          Nick turns to him.  He's sitting in the booth; Nilsen is 
          standing there.  Nick looks like he's barely restraining 
          himself.

                                    NICK
                        I'm off-duty, Nilsen.  You hear 
                        me?  I'm off-duty discussing a 
                        case.  Internal Affairs shouldn't 
                        have any trouble with that.  Maybe 
                        I should put in for overtime.

                                    NILSEN
                               (grins)
                        You do that, Shooter.  Why don't 
                        you send it to me?  I'll give it 
                        special attention.

          A beat, and then Nick gets up, faces him.

                                    NICK
                        I'm gonna tell you once more, Nilsen --

          Lt. Walker and Gus get up and hold Nick back.

          Beth Gardner, the police psychologist, is suddenly there.

                                    BETH
                        What's the problem?

                                    NILSEN
                               (grins)
                        No problem, Doctor.  Here comes 
                        the Doctor just in time to save 
                        her patient.  Take care, Shooter.

          And he walks away.  Nick still looks like he wants to go after 
          him.  Beth pulls him away from the booth.

                                    BETH
                        You okay?

                                    NICK
                               (after a beat)
                        Yeah.

                                    BETH
                               (smiles)
                        You don't look so okay.

          Nick looks at her a beat.

                                    NICK
                               (smiles)
                        What are you doing here?

                                    BETH
                               (smiles)
                        Baby-sitting.
                               (she shrugs)
                        Rookie cop.

                                    NICK
                               (smiles)
                        What else is new?

          A beat.  He looks at her again.

                                    NICK
                        You want to get out of here?

          She looks at him a beat.

                                    BETH
                               (smiles)
                        Yes.

          At the booth, Gus and Lt. Walker watch the two of them leave.

                                    GUS
                        Maybe it's for old-time's sake.

                        Sometimes I think he started banging 
                        her just to get himself off the 
                        hook with Internal Affairs.

                        He ain't that way.  He's got heart.

                                    LT. WALKER
                               (smiles)
                        Yeah.  I know.

          INT. BETH'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

          He is kissing her -- hard, rough.  He forces her against the 
          wall.

                                    BETH
                        Don't -- please, Nick --

          We hear her dress RIP.  He kisses her harder -- we hear her 
          panties RIP.  He gets the dress off, pushes his hands under 
          her bra --

                                    BETH
                        Please don't -- don't --

          He puts his mouth to her shoulder, bites it -- as they move 
          down to the floor.

          INT. BETH'S LIVING ROOM - LATER

          It is dark.  The are still partially dressed.  They are on the 
          floor.  He lies on his back, staring at the ceiling.

          She lies next to him -- the torn dress wound around her.

          There is a bite mark on her shoulder.  A long beat, silence -- 
          then --

                                    BETH
                        What was she like?

                                    NICK
                        Who?

                                    BETH
                        Catherine Tramell.

                                    NICK
                               (after a beat)
                        She said what you said she'd say.

          She sits up, looks away.  He looks at her, puts his finger on 
          the bite mark idly, gently.  A beat, and he kisses her shoulder 
          gently, then lies back down.

                                    BETH
                        I met her at Berkeley.

          He looks at her.

                                    BETH
                        We were in some of the same classes.

                                    NICK
                               (after a beat)
                        Why didn't you tell me?

          She looks at him.

                                    BETH
                        I'm telling you.

          They look at each other a long beat.

                                    BETH
                               (with difficulty)
                        You've never been... like that...  
                        before.

          He says nothing, looks away from her.

                                    BETH
                        Why?

          He doesn't look at her a long beat, says nothing.

                                    NICK
                        You're the shrink.

          She keeps looking at him.  He won't look at her.

                                    BETH
                        You weren't making love to me.

          A beat; he looks at her.

                                    NICK
                        Who was I making love to?

          She looks at him a long beat.

                                    BETH
                        You weren't making love.

          They look at each other, a long beat, then away.  He lies back 
          down.  Beth doesn't look at him, keeps sitting up.

                                    NICK
                               (finally)
                        I need a cigarette.

                                    BETH
                               (after a beat)
                        I thought you quit.

          He says nothing.

                                    BETH
                        Top drawer in the foyer.
                               (a beat)
                        Get it on your way out.

          He looks at her; she won't look at him.

          INT. THE DETECTIVE BUREAU - MORNING

          He walks in.  He looks hung-over.  He sees Gus with Harrigan 
          and Andrews and Lt. Walker in Lt. Walker's glass-enclosed office 
          at the end of this big room.

          They look at him when they see him.

                                    LT. WALKER
                        You look like dogshit.

                                    GUS
                               (grins)
                        He looks a little shrunk, that's 
                        all.

                                    ANDREWS
                               (after a beat)
                        We got a call from Berkeley P.D.
                        There was a killing.  A professor.
                        Icepick.  In his bed.  Multiple 
                        stab wounds.  1977.

                                    NICK
                               (a thin smile)
                        She was there, wasn't she?

                                    LT. WALKER
                        University records say she was 
                        there.

          He and Nick look at each other a long beat, then --

                                    LT. WALKER
                               (suddenly)
                        Gus -- go over to Berkeley.
                        Harrigan -- find out what else 
                        she's published.  Andrews -- get 
                        the files on her parents' accident.
                        Carbon Beth on everything.  I want 
                        some psychological input on this 
                        Andrews and Harrigan go; Nick is 
                        left there with Gus.

                                    NICK
                        What about me?

                                    GUS
                        You're already gettin' psychological 
                        input, son.

                                    LT. WALKER
                               (to Nick)
                        Go stick your head in a tub of ice 
                        water.
                               (a beat; then 
                               seriously)
                        See where she leads.

          EXT. THE BEACH HOUSE AT STINSON - DAY

          The black Ferrari is in the driveway.  He sits in an unmarked 
          police car on a hillside above the house, watching.  It is a 
          bleak, leaden gray day.

          Catherine comes out of the house.  She is dressed casually.

          She gets into the Ferrari.

          INT. HIS POLICE CAR

          He stays behind her at a safe distance on the winding panoramic 
          highway -- a two-lane mountain road which leads from Stinson 
          Beach into Marin County.

          She suddenly starts speeding up on this dangerous road, cutting 
          in and out, passing cars very fast.

          He has to start cutting around cars to keep up.  This woman 
          really drives.

          He cuts out and can barely pass a car without hitting a Grey 
          Lines Tour Bus head-on.  Close call: sheer drops on either 
          side.

          He looks frazzled.

          INT. HIS POLICE CAR

          He is behind her at a distance on a hilly Mill Valley road -- 
          little streets, terraced hillsides, sharp turns.

          He goes slowly, looks around, thinks he's lost her.  And then 
          he sees the black Ferrari parked in front of a house obscured 
          by hedges.

          He parks the car a distance behind the Ferrari, sits there a 
          long beat.  He gets out, goes carefully up to the hedges, looks.  
          A small, nondescript house.  He watches.  He can't see anything 
          inside the house.

          A beat, he reaches over to the mailbox and opens it.  He takes 
          an envelope out, looks at the name Hazel Dobkins.

          INT. HIS POLICE CAR - NIGHT

          He watches as she comes out of the house.  A frail old woman 
          in her 70's is with her.  She hugs the old woman, gets into 
          the Ferrari, STARTS it up.

          He waits a beat and then STARTS after her.  He stays behind 
          her at a distance -- she is going slowly.  And then she suddenly 
          GUNS it, cuts her lights -- her wheels SCREECH.

          He GUNS his car after her.  He makes a turn.  She is gone.

          There is a fork in the road.  He turns one way, goes a few 
          hundred feet.

          Nothing.  Blackness.  He stops.

                                    NICK
                               (quietly)
                        Shit.

          INT. HIS POLICE CAR - NIGHT

          He pulls his car up to her house at Stinson Beach.  The black 
          Ferrari is in the driveway.

          A light goes on in an upstairs bedroom.  The curtain is drawn.  
          He sees the outline of her body now.

          She starts to take her clothes off -- there in the window, 
          behind the curtain.  He watches her body as she does an almost 
          languorous strip.  His eyes are intense... ravishing.

          INT. THE DETECTIVE BUREAU - NIGHT

          He is alone, nobody else in the big room.

          He sits in front of a computer.  We see the screen.  He has 
          punched in

          HAZEL DOBKINS, WF, 145 ALBION RD., MILL VALLEY.

          He is waiting for a response.  We see it come on screen

          NOTHING CURRENT.

          A long beat, as he stares at the screen, and then we see these 
          words

          RELEASED, SAN QUENTIN, JULY 7, 1965.

          We see him type in the words

          PRIOR ARREST RECORD.

          A long beat, and then it comes up

          HOMICIDE, JANUARY 10, 1956 - SAN FRANCISCO

          He stares at the screen a long beat.

                                    GUS
                               (behind him)

                        And guess what?  He was her 
                        counselor.

          Nick looks at him a beat.

                                    NICK
                        Was she ever suspect?

                                    GUS
                        No, sir.  They never even got a 
                        statement from her.

          Nick sits back a long beat, his eyes off somewhere.

                                    NICK
                               (slowly)
                        Do you remember a case -- 1956 --
                        Hazel Dobkins?

                                    GUS
                               (grins)
                        Hell yes!  Couldn't get it outta 
                        my head for years.  Still can't.  
                        Nice little kids -- nice husband, 
                        wasn't porkin' around -- no 
                        financial problems.  One day -- 
                        outta the clear blue sky -- she 
                        does 'em.  All of 'em.  Used a 
                        knife. He got for a wedding present.  
                        Didn't even deny it.  Sweet as 
                        honey.  Said she didn't know why 
                        she done it.

          Nick just stares at him.

          EXT. THE STINSON BEACH HOUSE - NEXT DAY

          He pulls up to the house, gets out of his unmarked police car.  
          He stands there a beat, thinking.  He walks down to the beach 
          entrance of the house.  He hears a Rolling Stones SONG playing 
          inside.  He stands there.  The door suddenly opens.  Catherine 
          stands there, smiles.  She wears very tight-fitting spandex 
          leotards.

                                    CATHERINE
                        Hi.

          He looks at her a beat, then --

                                    NICK
                        Am I... disturbing you?

                                    CATHERINE
                        No.  Come in.

          They have their eyes on each other.  A beat, and she turns to 
          go in.

          INT. THE STINSON BEACH HOUSE

          She goes in ahead of him -- he follows her inside.  He watches 
          her body.  His movements are tentative, off-balance.  She turns 
          the Stones DOWN.

          On a table by the window, he sees a word processor.  Spread 
          around it are newspaper clippings.  They are all about him.

          We see the headline on one KILLER COP TO FACE POLICE REVIEW.  
          She sees him glancing at the clips.

                                    CATHERINE
                        I'm using you for my detective.  
                        In my book.  You don't mind, do 
                        you?

          She smiles.  He looks at her, expressionless.

                                    CATHERINE
                        Would you like a drink?  I was 
                        just going to have one.

                                    NICK
                        No, thanks.

          She goes to the bar.

                                    CATHERINE
                               (smiles)
                        That's right.  You're off the Jack 
                        Daniels too, aren't you?

          She is making herself a drink.  She takes the ice out and then 
          opens a drawer and gets an icepick.  It has a fat wooden end.  
          She uses the icepick on the ice, her back to him.  He watches 
          her.

                                    NICK
                        I'd like to ask you a few more 
                        questions.

                                    CATHERINE
                        I'd like to ask you some, too.

          She turns to him, icepick in hand, smiles.

                                    CATHERINE
                        For my book.

          She turns back to the ice, works on it with the pick.  She 
          raises her arm, plunges it.  Raises it, plunges it.  He watches 
          her.

                                    NICK
                               (wary)
                        What kind of questions?

          She puts the icepick down, pours herself a drink, turns to 
          him.

                                    CATHERINE
                        How does it feel to kill someone?

          He looks at her a long beat.

                                    NICK
                               (finally)
                        You tell me.

                                    CATHERINE
                        I don't know.  But you do.

          Their eyes are on each other.

                                    NICK
                               (finally)
                        It was an accident.  They got in 
                        the line of fire.

                                    CATHERINE
                        Four shootings in five years.  All 
                        accidents.

                                    NICK

                        They were drug buys.  I was a vice 
                        cop.

          A long beat, as they look at each other.

                                    NICK
                        Tell me about Professor Goldstein.

          BEAT.

                                    CATHERINE
                        There's a name from the past.

                                    NICK
                        You want a name from the present?
                        How about Hazel Dobkins?

          She looks at him a long beat, sips her drink, never takes her 
          eyes off him.

                                    CATHERINE
                        Noah was my counselor in my freshman 
                        year.
                               (she smiles)
                        That's probably where I got the 
                        idea for the icepick.  For my book.
                        Funny how the subconscious works.
                               (a beat)
                        Hazel is my friend.

                                    NICK
                        She wiped out her whole family.

                                    CATHERINE
                        Yes.  She's helped me understand 
                        homicidal impulse.

                                    NICK
                        Didn't you study it in school?

                                    CATHERINE
                        Only in theory.
                               (she smiles)
                        You know all about homicidal 
                        impulse, don't you, shooter?  Not 
                        in theory -- in practice.

          He stares at her a long beat.

                                    CATHERINE
                               (quietly)
                        What happened, Nick?  Did you get 
                        sucked into it? Did you like it 
                        too much?

                                    NICK
                               (after a beat)
                        No.

          He stares at her, almost horrified.

                                    CATHERINE
                               (quietly)
                        Tell me about the coke, Nick.  The 
                        day you shot those two tourists --
                        how much coke did you do?

          She steps closer to him.

                                    CATHERINE
                        Tell me, Nick.

          She puts her hand softly on his cheek,  He grabs her hand 
          roughly, holds it.

                                    NICK
                        I didn't.

                                    CATHERINE
                        Yes, you did.  They never tested 
                        you, did they?  But Internal Affairs 
                        knew.

          They are face to face.  He is still holding her roughly by the 
          hand.

                                    CATHERINE
                        Your wife knew, didn't she?  She 
                        knew what was going on.  Nicky got 
                        too close to the flame.  Nicky 
                        liked it.

          He twists her arm back behind her -- their bodies are pressed 
          against each other -- their eyes digging into each other.

                                    CATHERINE
                               (in a whisper)
                        That's why she killed herself?

          He is twisting her arm, staring at her, pulling her against 
          him.  We hear the DOOR behind them.  A beat, and he lets her 
          go, turns away from her.

          Roxy stands there, staring at them.  Her hair is up.  She wears 
          a black motorcycle jacket, a black T-shirt, and black jeans 
          and cowboy boots.

                                    CATHERINE
                               (brightly)
                        Hiya, hon.  You two have met, 
                        haven't you?

          Roxy looks at Nick.  Catherine goes to her, kisses her briefly 
          on the lips, stands there with her arm around her --both of 
          them looking at Nick.

          He walks by them, opens the door to go, his face a mask.

                                    CATHERINE
                        You're going to make a terrific 
                        character, Nick.

          He doesn't look at her; he's gone.

          INT. BETH GARDNER'S OFFICE - DAY

          He comes in.  He looks like he's going to kill someone.  A 
          RECEPTIONIST sits there.

                                    RECEPTIONIST
                        She's on the phone -- she'll be 
                        right with you, detective --He 
                        sweeps by her into Beth's inner 
                        office.  She hangs up when she 
                        sees the look on his face.

                                    NICK
                        Who has access to my file?

                                    BETH
                        What are you talking about, Nick --
                        what's wrong with you?

                                    NICK
                        Who's got access to my goddamn 
                        file?

          She gets up -- he goes closer to her; she backs away from him.

                                    BETH
                        Nobody.

          He goes closer to her; she backs away.

                                    BETH
                        It's a confidential psychiatric 
                        record, it'd be illegal --She backs 
                        into a wall.  She looks very scared.  
                        He comes very close to her -- puts 
                        an arm behind her to the wall.

                                    NICK
                        Don't, Beth.  Don't lie to me.

          She says nothing, looks scared.

                                    NICK
                               (suddenly)
                        It's Internal Affairs, isn't it?

                        No, Nick, please --

                               (loud, hard)
                        Who?

                        Nilsen.

          INT. THE INTERNAL AFFAIRS DIVISION - DAY

          He storms into the big room.  He sees MARTY NILSEN.  He is 
          sitting behind his desk in his glass-enclosed office inside 
          this big room.  About a dozen plainclothes policemen are in 
          the big room.  He goes by them into Nilsen's office.

          INT. MARTIN NILSEN'S OFFICE

          He closes the door.  Nilsen sees the look on his face, backs 
          his chair away towards the wall.

                                    NILSEN
                        What do you want, Curran?                                                                     

          He goes to him, picks him up by his lapels, slams him against 
          the wall.

                                    NICK
                               (out of control)
                        You sold her the file, didn't you?

                                    NILSEN
                               (scared)
                        What are you talking about?

                                    NICK
                               (out of control)
                        What'd she pay you?

          He slams him against the wall again.  The glass EXPLODES behind 
          them -- a chair comes into the room.  Nick is frozen, holding 
          Nilsen by the throat against the wall.

                                    ONE OF THE I.A. GUYS
                        Let him go, Curran.  Nice and easy.

          He looks back, sees two Internal Affairs men with their guns 
          drawn, pointed at him.  A beat, and he lets Nilsen go.  He 
          turns calmly and starts to walk out.

                                    NILSEN
                        You're on sick leave, Shooter.  As 
                        of right now.  Pending the outcome 
                        of a psychiatric evaluation.

          EXT. THE POLICE PARKING LOT - DUSK

          He gets into his old Porsche.  He STARTS the car up.  Gus Moran 
          comes up to the window.  They look at each other a

                                    GUS
                        What's goin' down, son?

                                    NICK
                        Nothin'
                               (a beat)
                        I'll be okay, pop.

          They look at each other a long beat.

                                    GUS
                        No, sir.  You won't.  There's smoke 
                        off yonder on the horizon.  They're 
                        gonna want your badge.

                                    NICK
                               (after a long beat)
                        I got tired of being played with.

                                    GUS
                               (after a beat)
                        You sure got real conclusive ways 
                        of demonstrating that.

          They almost smile at each other, then --

                                    NICK
                               (almost to himself)
                        She knows where I live and breathe.  
                        She's coming after me.

                                    GUS
                               (after a long beat)
                        What is it you got between you?

                                    NICK
                               (after a beat; to 
                               himself)
                        I don't know.

                                    GUS
                        Somethin', though.

          A beat, and then Nick looks at him.

                                    NICK
                        Yeah.
                               (a beat)
                        Somethin'.

          INT. HIS APARTMENT - NIGHT

          He sits in front of the TV, watching a lame sitcom.  A bottle 
          of Jack Daniels is half-empty in front of him.  He is smoking 
          a cigarette.

                                    BETH
                               (behind him)
                        I still have my key.

          He looks at her, looks away at the sitcom.

                                    NICK
                        I don't want to see you, Beth.

          He keeps watching the sitcom.  A long beat.

                                    BETH
                               (suddenly angry)
                        Damnit!  Don't shut me out!  You 
                        owe me more than that?

          He goes to the TV, shuts it off.

                                    NICK
                        I don't owe you anything; you don't 
                        owe me anything.
                               (he looks at her)
                        We went to bed -- what was it? --
                        ten or fifteen times?
                               (he smiles)
                        It wasn't memorable enough to carry 
                        any obligations.

                                    BETH
                               (after a long beat)
                        Sometimes I really hate you.

                                    NICK
                               (smiles)
                        Yeah?  Well why don't you find 
                        some friendly therapist and work 
                        some of that hostility out.
                               (a beat)
                        But take my advice.  Put a little 
                        more life into it than you usually 
                        do.

          A beat, and she suddenly hurls herself at him in absolute fury, 
          trying to claw at his face.  He grabs her, blocks her.  They 
          look at each other a long beat and then he lets her go.

          The emotion of the moment is gone now -- they turn away from 
          each other.

                                    BETH
                               (finally)
                        I'm sorry... I don't usually... 
                        act like that.

          Nick looks at her a beat.

                                    NICK
                        How could you let him have my file, 
                        Beth?

          A long beat, then --

                                    BETH
                               (not looking at him)
                        He was going to recommend your 
                        discharge a behavioral disability.  
                        I made a deal with him.  He could 
                        review the session notes himself.  
                        It was the only way I could keep 
                        you on the force.

          She looks at him.  He looks away from her.

                                    NICK
                        You did it for me.

                                    BETH
                        Yes.  I care about you.  I did it 
                        for you.

          He turns away from her.

                                    NICK
                               (quietly)
                        Get out of here, Beth.
                               (a beat)
                        Please?

          He goes to the Jack Daniel's, pours some more.  She looks at 
          him pour it and turns to go.

          INT. HIS APARTMENT - NIGHT

          He is asleep on the couch -- the TV is on to a blank screen.  
          The Jack Daniel's is mostly gone.  The phone on the coffee 
          table RINGS.  It RINGS again.  He wakes, picks it up, listens.

                                    NICK
                        Yeah.
                               (a beat)
                        Okay.

          He hangs it up.  He sits there a long beat, staring.  He looks 
          disturbed.

          EXT. THE ALLEY BEHIND THE TEN-FOUR BAR - NIGHT

          He walks down the alley.  There are lots of police cars, 
          flashing lights, uniformed men, coroner's men.

          As he walks down the alley, he sees Lt. Walker, Gus, and several 
          of the Internal Affairs men we saw earlier in Nilsen's office.  
          They are standing around a Lincoln Town Car.

          They look at him as he comes closer to them -- then move aside.

          He can see into the car now.  Martin Nilsen lies against the 
          front seat.  He has been shot in the head.  Nick stares.

                                    GUS
                        One shot.  Close range.  Probably 
                        a .38 caliber revolver.

          Nick stares at Nilsen's body.  They watch him.

                                    LT. WALKER
                        Give me your gun, Nick.

          A beat, and then Nick gives him his gun.  Walker smells it, 
          shakes his head, gives it to one of the Internal Affairs men.

                                    NICK
                               (to Walker)
                        You think I --

                                    GUS
                        I don't son, but I got the minority 
                        opinion.

          INT. POLICE INTERROGATION ROOM - NIGHT

          He sits in the same room that Catherine sat in --surrounded by 
          four or five Internal Affairs men, Lt.

          Walker, Gus, and Captain Talcott.  Lt. Walker and Gus sort of 
          sit back -- I.A. is running the investigation.  The same police 
          stenographer -- the same plain young woman -- is sitting in 
          the room who was there with Catherine.

                                    NICK
                        Okay.  I went after him.  I lost 
                        my temper.

                                    AN I.A. MAN
                        Do you have any evidence that he 
                        showed your psychiatric file to 
                        anyone?

                                    NICK
                               (after a beat)
                        No.

          Beth Gardner comes into the room.  They look at her.

                                    AN I.A. MAN
                        We'll speak to you afterwards, Dr.
                        Gardner.

          Nick gives her a look.

                                    BETH
                        I'd like to sit-in if you don't 
                        mind.

                                    THE I.A. MAN
                        I'd really rather --

                                    TALCOTT
                        I don't see anything wrong with 
                        Dr. Gardner sitting-in if Detective 
                        Curran doesn't object.

          Nick looks at her, shrugs.

                                    AN I.A. MAN
                        Where were you tonight?

          He looks at Beth.

                                    NICK
                        Yeah, I was drinking.

                        A couple days ago.

                                    BETH
                        I saw Detective Curran at his 
                        apartment around ten o'clock.  He 
                        was sober and lucid.  I asked him 
                        in my capacity as his departmental 
                        therapist about his altercation 
                        with Lt. Nilsen.  He expressed 
                        regret and displayed no hostility.

                                    AN I.A. MAN
                               (to Beth)
                        How long were you at his apartment?

                                    BETH
                        About fifteen minutes.  I saw there 
                        was no reason for my concern and 
                        left.

          She and Nick look at each other.  He looks away and lights a 
          cigarette.

                                    AN I.A. MAN
                        There's no smoking in this building.

                                    NICK
                               (after a beat)
                        What are you gonna do -- charge me 
                        with smoking?

          It is the exact line that Catherine used.  A long beat.

                                    LT. WALKER
                        I'll ask you once, Nick -- for the 
                        record did you kill him?

                                    NICK
                        No.

          They look at him a beat.

                        his office in front of everybody 
                        in the afternoon and then that 
                        night I'm going to kill him?  I'd 
                        have to be really dumb to do that.

                        Going after him before gets you

          INT. POLICE DEPARTMENT - NIGHT

          He is by the elevators with Gus and Lt. Andrews.  He spots 
          Beth going for the stairway.

          She stops.  He catches up to her.  They walk down the flights 
          together.  They speak quietly.

                                    NICK
                        Thank you.

          She looks at him, smiles.  They keep walking down the steps.

                        why.

          INT. THE DETECTIVE BUREAU - NEXT DAY

          He is cleaning his desk out, putting things into a duffel bag.  
          Only Andrews is in the room.  We see Lt. Walker sitting in his 
          glass-enclosed office.

          He closes the duffel bag, looks at the place a long beat.

          Andrews is watching him.  He goes up to Andrews

                                    ANDREWS

          A beat, and Andrews opens the file.

                        The boat blew.  There was a leak 
                        in the gas line.  There were two 
                        previous repairs.  There was a 
                        five-mil policy on both of 'em.  A 
                        real heavy investigation.  Zilch.

                        she knew nobody would buy it.

          Lt. Walker looks at him a long beat.

          EXT. HIS APARTMENT

          It is in the Marina District; on a street like Cervantes.

          He gets out of his old Porsche; he sees her black Ferrari there.  
          She is sitting on the front stoop.  She wears an Indian jacket, 
          jeans and a T-shirt.  He goes up to her. She looks at him a 
          beat.

                                    CATHERINE
                        I heard about what happened.  What

          She smiles.

          She looks at him a beat.

                                    CATHERINE
                        I didn't think you'd ask me.

          He looks at her a beat.

          They start walking inside.  She walks ahead of him.  He watches 
          her.  She turns suddenly.

                                    CATHERINE
                        You're not easy to figure.  I'm

                        Why not?

                        Not me.

          And she turns, heads inside; he follows her.

          INT. HIS APARTMENT - DAY

          They walk in.  She looks at the bareness of the place.

                                    CATHERINE
                        You should put some warmth into 
                        it.  You don't want it to reflect 
                        on your personality.

          She turns, smiles at him.  He looks at the bottle of Jack 
          Daniel's; there's not much left.

                                    NICK

                        Ice?

                               (smiles)
                        Please.

          There is a palpable tension between them.

          He takes the ice out, opens a drawer, takes out an icepick.

                                    CATHERINE
                        Let me do that.  You like to watch 
                        me doing it, don't you?

          She smiles; a beat and he hands her the icepick.  She takes 
          it, starts to us the icepick, her back to him.  He lights a 
          cigarette.

                                    CATHERINE
                        Can I have a cigarette, please?  I 
                        told you you'd start smoking again.

          He watches her working on the ice.

                                    CATHERINE
                        Light it for me, will you?

          He does, steps to her.  She parts her lips -- he puts it on 
          her lip, watches it.  Their eyes are on each other.

                                    CATHERINE
                        Thank you.

                        parents died?

                                    NICK
                        Yes.

                                    CATHERINE
                        No.  I wrote it years afterwards.

          He watches her; she has turned away from him -- and then she 
          turns back to him in a different mood.

                                    CATHERINE
                               (smiles)
                        You're not going to stop following 
                        me around now just because you're 
                        on leave -- are you?

                        No.

                                    CATHERINE
                        Good.  I'd miss you.

                        You can get into trouble, though.
                        You're not really a cop anymore.

                                    NICK
                        I'll risk it.

                                    CATHERINE
                        Why take the risk?

                                    NICK
                        To see if I can get away with it.

          She looks at him; she smiles.

                                    NICK
                        How's your new book?

                        I'm getting deeper and deeper into 
                        my character.

          They look at each other a long beat.

                                    CATHERINE
                        Thanks for the drink.

          He nods, say nothing as she goes to the door --

                                    CATHERINE
                        I'm leaving the house around 
                        midnight.  In case you're going to 
                        follow me.

          She looks at him a long beat; and she's gone.

          INT. THE STAIRWAY

          As she is going down the stairs, Gus Moran is coming up.

          He does a real double-take as he goes by her.

                                    CATHERINE
                               (smiles)
                        Hi, Gus.

          He looks at him a long beat, and he goes upstairs, into Nick's 
          apartment.

          INT. NICK'S APARTMENT

          Nick stands at the window, watching her outside.  A long beat, 
          and he looks at Gus.

                                    GUS
                               (after a beat)

                        don't mean to belabor the obvious, 
                        but why is it that you've got your 
                        head so far up your own ass?

                                    NICK
                               (after a beat)
                        She want to play?  Fine.  I can 
                        play.

                                    GUS
                               (after a beat)
                        Everybody that she plays with dies.

                               quietly)
                        I know what that's like.

          INT. JOHNNY BOZ'S CLUB - NIGHT

          It is dark, cavernous there are a thousand people in here.  
          The MUSIC is ear-splitting, pulsing.  Lights flash.

          The floor is huge.  At one time, this club was a church.

          He walks around the sides, a drink in his hand, looking for 
          her.  He doesn't see her.

          The he catches a glimpse of Roxy.  She is dancing with another 
          woman.  He watches her.  She is wearing pants and a jacket, 
          her hair off to the side.  She looks very masculine tonight.

          Roxy laughs at the other woman, leaves her on the floor, starts 
          moving through the sea of dancers.  He follows her through the 
          press of bodies.  She goes towards the men's room.  She walks 
          in.

          INT. THE MEN'S ROOM

          It is large, dark, shadowy It was once the sacristy.

          A crowd scene men and women. Roxy presses through them.

          A haze of crack smoke; we see people doing poppers.

          She opens the door to a toilet stall, walks in.  Nick is behind 
          her.  As the door opens, he sees Catherine.

          She wears a black motorcycle jacket, a very short skirt, 
          stiletto heels.  Her hair is up.  He make-up is severe,  In 
          the darkness, in the shadows she looks about 19.  A hot 19.

          A hot flash-trash 19.

          She is in there with two men -- one of them is a big, body-
          built black guy.  She has a vial of something near her face.

          She sees Nick watching her.  She whispers something to the 
          tall black guy.  He looks at Nick, smiles a condescending smile.  
          The door to the stall closes

          INT. THE CLUB

          He is walking along the side, watching the floor, a drink in 
          his hand.  The song ends and it seques right into the Stones's 
          "Miss You."

          He sees her.  Her black leather jacket is off.

          She wears a very tight, flimsy top, the short skirt, the heels.  
          She is dancing with Roxy and the black guy.  He watches her 
          move... watches her body.

          She turns, sees him, dances, watches him... gets between Roxy 
          and the black guy... they sandwich her with their bodies... 
          keeps moving, turning... eyes on him... playing to him with 
          her body.  He watches.

          A long beat, and he goes up to them.  His movements are

          almost trance-like.  They look at each other.  A long beat.

          Catherine stops dancing.  he reaches for her.  She moves away.  
          A beat their eyes are on each other.  She moves a step towards 
          her.  A beat, as they look at each other...  and they start to 
          move together.

          Their eyes are on each other as they move, the eyes burning... 
          the movements tighter, hotter... and he suddenly grabs her and 
          kisses her... as they keep moving... the song seques into the 
          Stones's "Gimme Shelter."

          She is melting into him now, kissing him... Tex watches, 
          expressionless... the black guy is gone... he holds her by the 
          back of the neck, kissing her... their bodies pressed into 
          each other... his hands are on her butt now, pulling her into 
          him now, almost holding her up now... and then under her skirt, 
          under her panties... as he kisses her neck.

          People around them stare... he moves his hands under her top 
          as she keeps moving with the song, her head back, her back 
          almost arching... cups her breasts now... she keeps moving...  
          the song sweeping them into its rhythm "it's just a shot away, 
          it's just a kiss away, a kiss away..."

          They devour each other.  Right there on the floor.  Barely 
          able to hold it back.  As Tex watches expressionless.  As people 
          stop dancing and stare.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

          INT. HER BEDROOM

          It is dark.  We can't see clearly.  A side table, lines of 
          cocaine on a small mirror.  A CD player The Stones play "Love 
          In Vain."

          There are mirrors all over the walls and ceiling.  They are in 
          bed.  The bed is big and brass.

          Atop her... he kisses her neck... his hands under her, raising 
          her... he moves down, kisses her breasts... puts his mouth 
          around  a breast... she arches, moves... he kisses her 
          shoulder... biting into it... she opens her mouth... we hear 
          no cry... we hear the Stones.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

          INT. HER BEDROOM - LATER

          The Stones play "Monkey Man."

          Atop him... she kisses his chest, licks it, lowers her head... 
          lower... lower... he arches his back... her mouth comes up... 
          her mouth on his lips again... he turns her.

          Atop her... he moves her legs apart... (the CAMERA is behind 
          them)... she holds his back... digs in her nails...  rakes his 
          back with them... digs in again... his back bleeds... he moves 
          inside her... harder... the nails dig...  blood trickles down 
          his back.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

          INT. HER BEDROOM - LATER

          The Stones play "Wild Horses."

          He is behind her... she is on her stomach... he rises her by 
          her hips... kisses her back... races her spine with his 
          tongue... traces her lower back... he kneels... moves into 
          her... kisses her neck... his fingers are in her mouth...  as 
          he moves.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

          INT. HER BEDROOM - LATER

          The Stones play "Sympathy for the Devil."

          Atop him... she leans close over his face, her tongue in his 
          mouth... kneeling over him... she moves his arms above his 
          head... moves higher atop him... her breasts in his face... 
          she reaches over to the side... a white silk scarf is in her 
          hand... she moves higher above him... kneeling over his face... 
          moving oh-so-slightly... his face strains towards her.

          The scarf in both hands now... she starts to tie his hands 
          with it... his eyes are open, watching her... she ties it 
          loosely, gently... it isn't tight... but his hands are tied to 
          the brass bed.

          She kisses him... moving her hips lower now... over his chest... 
          lower...

          And he is inside her... her arms above him... his eyes open... 
          she kisses his neck... bites but not hard...  moves... grinding 
          hard against him now.. she is on her knees... head arches back.. 
          her breasts high.. still grinding.

          Her back arches, strains... he strains toward her... she holds 
          her arms high... she comes out of the arch...  shivering... 
          falling over him... the scarf loosens... his arms come forward 
          and hold her close.. closer... closer...  as she moves with 
          slight... shivery... movements.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

          INT. HER BEDROOM - NIGHT

          It is dark, quiet.  Pindrop quiet.  He is sitting on the side 
          of the bed, his head down... his back a line tracing of dried 
          blood.  She is asleep nest to him, naked.

          He looks around the room.  The white scarf around the bedpost... 
          the coke on the side-table... clothes all over the floor.

          He gets up, walks into the bathroom.

          INT. HER BEDROOM - NIGHT

          The light is too bright.  He looks at himself in the mirror.  
          He pours the water, lowers his head, puts cold water on his 
          face.  A long beat, he comes back up, opens his eyes.  Roxy is 
          in the mirror behind him.  She startles him.

          He looks at her in the mirror a long beat, doesn't turn.

          She is expressionless; she wears the same thing she wore at 
          the club.

          He lowers down into the basin again, puts more water on his 
          face, comes back up, uses a towel this time, finishes with the 
          towel.  She is still looking at him in the mirror the same 
          way.  He looks at her in the mirror, doesn't turn.

                                    ROXY
                               (quietly)
                        If you don't leave her alone, I'll 
                        kill you.

          He looks at her a beat, then turns --

                                    NICK
                        Tell me something, Rocki.  Man-to-
                        man.
                               (he smiles)
                        I think she's the fuck of the 
                        century, don't you?

          For a second, she looks like she's going to spring at him, 
          then controls it and turns to go.

                                    NICK
                        How long you been here, Rock?  You 
                        like to watch, do you?

                                    ROXY
                               (after a beat, looks 
                               at him)
                        She likes me to watch.

          And she turns and she is gone.

          INT. HER BEDROOM - NIGHT

          He lies on the bed in the dark, quiet room.  He is on his back, 
          his eyes open.  He has his arm around her.  She is asleep.

                                    CATHERINE
                               (murmurs)
                        Nicky.

          He looks at her.

          INT. HER BEDROOM - MORNING

          He wakes up.  She is not there.  He looks around.  The white 
          scarf is gone.  The coke on the side table is gone.

          In its place, a scrawled note "The Beach -- C."

          EXT. HER STINSON BEACH HOUSE - DAY

          A cold and foggy day.  He gets out of his old Porsche, walks 
          down the driveway.  He sees her out on the beach by the water.  
          A small bonfire is near her.  He walks towards her.

          Roxy watches him, expressionless, from an upstairs window of 
          the house.  He doesn't see her.

          He walks up to Catherine.  She has an Indian blanket over her 
          and is wearing a black felt English derby hat, her hair loose 
          underneath.

                                    NICK
                               (expressionless)
                        'Morning.

          She doesn't look at him -- he smiles slowly.  She doesn't smile 
          and she doesn't seem to like his smile, either.  She walks 
          along the beach.  He walks with her.  A long beat.

                                    NICK
                        I think Roxy got jealous.

          She looks at him.  He looks like he is trying to hide a smile.

                                    CATHERINE
                               (after a beat)
                        She's seen me fuck plenty of other 
                        guys.

          That wipes the hidden smile off his face.  He looks at her, 
          walks with her.  A long beat.

                                    NICK
                        Maybe she saw something she didn't 
                        see before.

                                    CATHERINE
                        She's seen everything before.

          She looks at him; he's smiling now.

                                    NICK
                        She's never seen us before.

          He's serious.  She looks at him.  She smiles slowly.

                                    CATHERINE
                        Did you think it was so special?

                                    NICK
                        I told her it was the fuck of the 
                        century.

          He can't hide his smile anymore.  She says nothing, keeps 
          walking.

          hat.

          It gets some looks from the other people in her -- Nick shushes 
          him, pours him more coffee.  He drinks it.

                        away from him, shaking her head.

          They look at each other a long beat.  Gus drinks more coffee.  
          He sits back, pulls his cowboy hat over his eyes.

          A long beat.

                        time.

          She looks away.

                        know me three months ago.

                                    GUS
                        Maybe it wasn't her that paid him.
                        Maybe the money was for somethin' 
                        else.  How the fuck do I know?  
                        I'm just an old city cowboy tryin' 
                        not to fall outta his saddle.

          Nick looks at him and smiles a thin smile; he's not there, 
          he's completely preoccupied.

          INT. A CAR - NIGHT

          Someone is watching as he and Gus come out of the diner.

          He stands by Gus as Gus gets into his battered, rusted, vintage 
          Cadillac.

                        hear-up-his-ass person drive my 
                        Cadillac car.

          And he steps on the gas and ROARS out of there, forcing Nick 
          to get out of the way.  Nick looks after him a long beat, shakes 
          his head.

          INT. A CAR - NIGHT

          Someone is following him slowly as he walks down the street.  
          He turns a corner, walks down the alley towards his Porsche, 
          parked behind the country and western bar.

          The car suddenly speeds up -- ROARS down on him from the back, 
          full bore.

          EXT. THE ALLEY

          He hurls himself across the Porsche's hood... barely avoiding 
          the car.  He sees the car at the end of the alley, turning out 
          It is a black Ferrari.

          INT. HIS PORSCHE

          He GUNS it down the alley, makes a wild turn in the direction 
          the Ferrari turned.

          EXT. THE STREET

          The Porsche dodges around cars very fast, almost side-swiping 
          them, looking almost out of control, its MOTOR screaming.

          INT. THE PORSCHE

          He sees the Ferrari turn ahead.  When he gets to where it 
          turned, he turns wildly.

          EXT. THE STREET

          The Ferrari is making fast, wild turns into little streets in 
          North Beach, its MOTOR screaming -- the Porsche is gaining 
          ground behind it, making turns.

          INT. THE PORSCHE

          The Ferrari is up ahead and makes a wild right turn onto a 
          road going up a hillside.  He yanks the wheel hard.

          EXT. THE STEPS

          The Porsche rockets up the steps -- bouncing high into the 
          air, almost out of control.                                                                     

          INT. THE PORSCHE

          As it crests the steps and gets to the street.  Nick GUNS it 
          and it looks like it flies high down the hill-side into 
          blackness.

          EXT. THE STREET

          But it lands on more steps -- heading downward -- bucking, 
          almost spinning, it bounces onto the next street.

          INT. THE PORSCHE

          Another set of steps leading up he GUNS it, it rockets up, 
          ROARS, bucking --

          EXT. THE STREET

          And lands on the next street.  Nick makes a wild right turn 
          onto the street.  And the black Ferrari appears from around a 
          curve to the right, heading right for him.

          INT. THE PORSCHE

          Nick steps on the GAS and heads head-on for the Ferrari.

          The Ferrari SCREAMS head-on for him.

          EXT. THE STREET

          And at the last moment, in the game of chicken, the Ferrari 
          tries to swerve around him on this narrow road, goes out of 
          control and over the side, turning over and over as it rolls 
          down the hillside.

          EXT. THE HILLSIDE

          The Ferrari has landed right-side up.

          He runs down the hillside and gets to it.  A beat, and he opens 
          the car door.

          Roxy lies hunched over the wheel, her eyes open.  Her neck is 
          broken.  She is dead.

          EXT. THE HILLSIDE - NIGHT

          Police lights have been set up.  He stands there with Lt.  
          Walker and several of the Internal Affairs men.

                                    LT. WALKER
                        Tell me again.  I want to hear you 
                        say it again.

                                    NICK
                               (after a beat; 
                               sheepish)
                        It was an accident.

                                    LT. WALKER
                        You're driving around North Beach 
                        for no particular reason and this 
                        car won't get out of the way --

                                    NICK
                        I don't think she meant to go off 
                        the hill, do you?

                                    LT. WALKER
                               (quietly)
                        Don't fuck with me, Nick.  I don't 
                        need a reason to put your ass in a 
                        sling.

          He and Nick look at each other a long beat.  Andrews comes up 
          to them with a piece of paper in his hand.

                                    ANDREWS
                        Full name, Roxanne Hardy.  Last 
                        address -- Cloverdale, California.  
                        No priors, no convictions.  The 
                        car is registered to Catherine 
                        Tramell.

          Lt. Walker looks at Nick like he's going to kill him.  Nick 
          looks calmly away.

                                    LT. WALKER
                        You knew her, didn't you?

                                    NICK
                        Gus and I talked to her at Tramell's 
                        house.  All we did was write her 
                        name down.

                                    LT. WALKER
                               (after a beat)
                        I told you to stay away from 
                        Tramell.

                                    NICK
                               (after a beat; smiles)
                        Yeah.  But you didn't tell me to 
                        stay away from her car.

          Walker looks at him in absolute disbelief.

                                    AN I.A. MAN
                        I want you in Dr. Gardner's office 
                        at nine o'clock.  You're out of 
                        control, Curran.

                                    NICK
                               (to the I.A. Man)
                        Who are you guys gonna sell my 
                        file to this time?

          They stare at him.  He watches as Roxy's body is taken away.

          INT. A POLICE CONFERENCE ROOM -DAY

          He walks in.  He looks good, in control.  Beth Gardner is 
          sitting there with two middle-aged MEN, both of them wearing 
          suits, who smile and scrutinize him the instant he walks in 
          the door.

                                    BETH
                        Hello, Nick.  This is Dr. Myron 
                        and R. McElwaine.  They've been 
                        asked to consult with me on this 
                        evaluation.

          They shake hands with him.

                                    DR. MYRON
                        Sit down, Nick.

          Nick gives him a look: What did he think he was going to do -- 
          stand there?

          He sits down, looks at them.  A beat, as they look at him, 
          then --

                                    DR. MCELWAINE
                               (courtly)
                        Nick -- when you recollect your 
                        childhood, are your recollections 
                        pleasing to you?

          Nick looks at them a long beat in disbelief.

                                    NICK
                               (calmly, directly)
                        Number one I don't remember how 
                        often I used to jack off, but it 
                        was a lot.  Number two I didn't 
                        get pissed off at my dad -- even 
                        after I was old enough to know 
                        what he and mom were doing in the 
                        bedroom.  Number three I don't 
                        look in the toilet before I flush 
                        it.  Number four I don't wet the 
                        bed and haven't for some time.
                        Number five You can go fuck 
                        yourselves because I'm out of here.

          INT. THE CORRIDOR

          He is walking away quickly.  Beth is with him, trying to keep 
          up.  She is very angry.

                                    BETH
                        What is your problem?  I'm trying 
                        to help you.  Why won't you let me 
                        help you?

                                    NICK
                        I don't need any help.

                                    BETH
                        Yes you do.  Something's on with 
                        you.
                               (a beat)
                        You're sleeping with her, aren't 
                        you?

          A beat, he stops looks at her, then keeps walking.

                                    NICK
                        What is this interest you've got 
                        in her?

                                    BETH
                        My interest is in you, not in her.
                        She seduces people, she manipulates --

                                    NICK
                        I thought you hardly know her.

                                    BETH
                        I know the type.  I'm a 
                        psychologist.

          He stops, looks at her.

                                    NICK
                               (after a beat)
                        That means you manipulate people 
                        too, doesn't it, Beth?  You're a 
                        practicing psychologist -- that 
                        means you're better at it than she 
                        is.

          She looks at him a long beat.

                                    BETH
                               (quietly)
                        I feel sorry for you, Nick.

          A beat, and she turns and walks away.

          EXT. ROAD TO STINSON HOUSE - DAY

          Nick is driving down winding road to Stinson house.  He is 
          driving very fast, passing other cars on the winding and 
          twisting road.

          INT. THE STINSON BEACH HOUSE - DAY

          Nick enters and shuts door.  Looking around, he does not see 
          her.

                                    NICK
                        Catherine!
                               (after a beat)
                        Catherine!

          Finally he sees her sitting by the window.  He walks over to 
          her.

                                    CATHERINE
                               (near tears)
                        I should have known.  I came into 
                        the house when you were down on 
                        the beach.  She looked at me so 
                        strangely.  She left right after 
                        you.
                               (a beat)
                        I shouldn't have let her watch us.  
                        She wanted to watch me all the 
                        time.  She tried to kill you, didn't 
                        she?

                                    NICK
                               (a beat)
                        Did you like her to watch?

                                    CATHERINE
                               (a long beat)
                        Do you think I told her to kill 
                        You?

                                    NICK
                               (softly, with 
                               intensity)
                        No.

                                    CATHERINE
                               (after a beat, near 
                               tears)
                        Everybody that I care about dies.

          She is about to break into uncontrolable sobbing.  Nick puts 
          his arms around her.

                                    NICK
                               (soothing)
                        It's OK.  It's OK.

                                    CATHERINE
                               (quietly, almost 
                               begging)
                        Make love to me.

          INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

          They are seen rolling and turning around on each other.

          Their love making is sensual, sincere.

          Later in bed.

                                    NICK
                               (calmly, but 
                               seriously)
                        Do you think she killed Johnny 
                        Boz?

                                    CATHERINE
                               (surprised, startled)
                        For what... to set me up?  She 
                        loved me she wouldn't frame me.

                                    NICK
                               (a beat)
                        Maybe she got jealous of Johnny 
                        Boz, too.

                                    CATHERINE
                               (after a beat)
                        No, she didn't... she never got 
                        jealous before... she got excited.
                               (a beat)
                        I don't have luck with women.
                        There was this girl I met while I 
                        was in college.  I slept with her 
                        once.  She started following me 
                        around, taking my picture.  She 
                        dyed her hair, copied my clothes.
                        Lisa something... Oberman.  It was 
                        awful.

          A long beat, he looks at her.

                                    NICK
                        I thought you didn't do adolescent 
                        secrets.

                                    CATHERINE
                               (after a beat)
                        I never have before.

          EXT. THE DECK - MORNING

          It is a bright, sunshiny day.  He is out there looking at the 
          water.  She comes up behind him, hugs him.

                                    CATHERINE
                               (full of life)
                        Isn't it just beautiful?  I love 
                        it here like this.

          He looks at her.

                                    NICK
                               (cold)
                        We're still playing games, aren't 
                        we?

          She looks hurt.

                        I'd read about your shootings in 
                        the papers.  I decided to write a 
                        book about a detective.  I wanted 
                        to know my character.

                        know everything about you.  Then 
                        you came down here after Johnny 
                        got killed... it gave me a chance 
                        to get to know my character better.

                        about last night?  Was that to get

          And she kisses him slowly, with more and more heat, on the 
          lips.

          The cordless phone on the deck table goes off.  It keeps 
          RINGING.  She breaks finally from the kiss, picks it up.

                        I can get my butt kicked for this.

                        You shouldn't leave your door open.

          A beat, she looks at him.

                        She told you, didn't she?

                        I slept with her once in school.

                        I was just a kid.  I was

                        She developed a... fixation... on 
                        me.  She styled her hair like mine.  
                        She wore the same kind of clothes 
                        I did.  It scared me.

          She looks at him, sees his look.

                                    BETH
                        Isn't that what she told you?

                        dyed your hair blonde.

          A long beat as they look at each other.

                        I did dye my hair.  It didn't have 
                        anything to do with her.  I was a

                        knows I knew Noah.  She makes up 
                        that story about me.  She's handing 
                        you somebody who's obsessed with

                        She didn't hand you to me.  She 
                        doesn't even know who you are.

                        She knew you'd find out who Lisa 
                        Henderson is.  You're a good cop --
                        what did she do?  Tell you casually 
                        and make it seem irrelevant?
                               (she smiles)
                        Did she tell you in bed, Nick?
                        That's how I'd do it.

          INT. THE STAIRWAY - HIS APARTMENT HOUSE - NIGHT

          He has his key out to open his door.  He hears MUSIC inside.  

          A beat, and he opens the door.

          INT. HIS APARTMENT

          It is dark.  We hear a Rolling Stones SONG.  He sees Catherine 
          standing by a window, watching him.  She wears black jeans and 
          the black motorcycle jacket.

          They look at each other a long beat.

          He walks up close to her.

                        No.

          She unzips her motorcycle jacket slowly.  She wears nothing 
          underneath it.

                        Not yet it isn't.

          She pulls him close.

                               (excited)
                        Johnny Boz's psychiatrist has an 
                        office on Van Ness.  Guess who he 
                        shares office space with?  Dr.  
                        Elizabeth Gardner.

          Nick doesn't even respond.  Gus looks at him.

                                    GUS
                        What in hell's the matter with 
                        you?

          Nick doesn't say anything, stares ahead.

          EXT. AN OFFICE BUILDING - OAKLAND - NIGHT

          Gus gets out with Nick.  It is an old building.

                                    GUS
                        Where the hell you goin'?

                                    NICK
                               (after a beat)
                        I'm going with you.

                                    GUS
                        She said alone -- suite 405.  It 
                        ain't gonna take long.

          A beat, and Nick gets back in the car.

          INT. THE OFFICE BUILDING - NIGHT

          Gus is on the first floor.  There is no one around.  He hits 
          the elevator button.  A beat, and it comes.  He steps in.

          INT. THE ELEVATOR - NIGHT

          He hits the button for the fourth floor.

          The elevator rises a floor, stops.  The door opens.  There is 
          no one there.  Then it starts going up again.  It rises to the 
          third floor.  It stops.  The door opens.  There is no one there.  
          Then it starts to rise again.

          EXT. GUS' CADILLAC - NIGHT

          Nick sits there, staring ahead.

                                    NICK
                               (suddenly, screaming)
                        Gus!

          INT. THE ELEVATOR

          As it goes up.  It stops.  The door starts to open.  As it 
          does -- a figure in a hooded raincoat sweeps into the elevator.  
          It happens very fast.  We see blonde hair around the face.

          But we don't see the face itself -- the head is down, the hood 
          up.  There is an icepick in the figure's hand.  The figure 
          explodes into Gus.  The icepick goes into his neck.

          INT. THE STAIRWAY

          Nick tears desperately up the stairway -- he hits the fourth 
          floor door.  It explodes open.

          INT. THE FOURTH FLOOR

          He stands there a beat, sees the elevator door open.  He runs 
          there,  He sees Gus, crumpled into the corner of the elevator.

          INT. THE ELEVATOR

          He goes into the elevator -- holds Gus.  He is dead.  A long 
          beat.  He sees the gun in Gus' hand -- he takes the gun out of 
          his hand.  He runs out of the elevator.

          INT. THE FOURTH FLOOR

          He hears something.  Gun in hand, he runs towards the SOUND.  
          He stops, gun in hand, listens again.  He runs again, hears 
          nothing.

          Behind him, we see a figure.

          He spins suddenly, gun, in hand.  Beth Gardner is there.

          She wears a windbreaker.  She has her hands in the pockets.

                                    BETH
                        What are you doing here?

                                    NICK
                               (screaming)
                        Put your hands up!

          She stares at him.

                                    NICK
                               (screams)
                        Put your fucking hands up!  Don't 
                        move.

                                    BETH
                        I got a message on my machine to 
                        meet Gus here.  Where is he?

          She smiles a strange smile.  She takes a step toward him.

                                    NICK
                               (screams)
                        Don't!
                               (a beat)
                        I know about your husband.  You 
                        still like girls, Beth?

                                    BETH
                        What?

          She smiles strangely again, takes a step toward him.

                                    NICK
                               (screams)
                        Take your hands out of your pockets!

          She moves a hand in a pocket and moves towards him fast --

                                    BETH
                        What is wrong with you?

          And he FIRES the gun.  She is hit in the chest, goes down.

          A long beat, and then he goes to her.  He gets down on the 
          ground.  Her eyes are open.  He empties the pockets of the 
          windbreaker -- first one, then the other the pockets are empty.

                                    BETH
                               (in a whisper)
                        I loved you.

          And she dies.

          INT. THE FOURTH FLOOR - LATER

          A lot of policemen, coroner's guys, photos being taken.

          Nick stands there with Lt. Walker, Harrigan, and some of the 
          Internal Affairs guys.

                                    LT. WALKER
                               (upset)
                        What made you think she had a gun?

          Nick says nothing; he looks like a zombie.

                                    LT. WALKER
                        What the hell was she doing here?  
                        What was Gus doing here?  

          Andrews yells to them from the stairway door.

                                    ANDREWS
                        Lieutenant.

          INT. THE STAIRWAY

          A FORENSICS MAN very carefully handles a hooded rain coat in a 
          stair landing.  He wears gloves.

          Nick is there with Lt. Walker.

          The Forensics Man picks the raincoat up -- a long blonde wig 
          falls out of it.  There are flecks of blood on it.

          He reaches into the pocket and pulls out an  icepick.  It has 
          a thin steel handle and is bloody.  He hands the icepick to an 
          assistant.

          He looks at the raincoat.  It has blood on it.

                                    THE FORENSICS MAN
                        It's departmental issue.

                                    LT. WALKER
                               (quietly)
                        Jesus.

          INT. BETH GARDNER'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

          Nick with Lt. Walker.  Nick looks like a zombie.  Andrews comes 
          up to them.  He has a gun in his hands.

                                    ANDREWS
                        Thirty-eight caliber revolver.

          Bottom drawer, bureau in the bedroom.

                                    LT. WALKER
                        Have  ballistics check it for 
                        Nilsen.

          Harrigan comes out.

                                    HARRIGAN
                        Lieutenant, you'd better come in 
                        here.

          Lt. Walker goes into the kitchen.  Nick follows him.

          There are several cops around a kitchen cabinet.  A drawer is 
          open.

          Walker looks -- we look with him.  We see a copy of Love hurts, 
          Catherine's paperback book, and a stack of photos of Catherine.

          Walker picks the photos up, goes through them -- we see shots 
          of Catherine in college -- Catherine at a fight --Catherine 
          with Johnny Boz -- Catherine with Roxy.

          He hands the photos to Nick.

          Nick stares at them.

                                    LT. WALKER
                        I guess that's it.

          INT. THE DETECTIVE BUREAU - NIGHT

          Nick sits, his feet up.  He looks like a zombie.  With him are 
          Lt. Walker, Andrews, and Captain Talcott.  We see other 
          plainclothesmen in the b.g. -- a flurry of activity, people on 
          phones.  A long beat.

                                    LT. WALKER
                        She must've heard you on the 
                        stairway and dumped the stuff.

          Nick says nothing, stares off.

          A DETECTIVE comes over to them.

                                    DETECTIVE
                        There was no suite 405 in that 
                        building.  Catherine Tramell's 
                        roommate in her freshman year is 
                        dead.  She died of leukemia two 
                        years ago.

          An INTERNAL AFFAIRS MAN comes over to them.

                                    INTERNAL AFFAIRS MAN
                        Our files on Dr. Gardner show 
                        nothing about a police report in 
                        Berkeley -- nothing related to 
                        Salinas, either.

          A long beat -- the phone RINGS.  Andrews picks it up, listens.

                                    ANDREWS
                        Thanks.

          He hangs up.

                                    ANDREWS
                        Ballistics says the .38 we found 
                        in her apartment matches Nilsen.  
                        No registration.  They're checking 
                        with Salinas.  The icepick is the 
                        same brand and model as the Boz 
                        weapon.

          A long beat -- Nick just stares.

          Harrigan comes up to them.

                                    HARRIGAN
                        We checked the tape machines at 
                        Dr.  Gardner's apartment and at 
                        her office -- both here and the 
                        one on Van Ness.  No message from 
                        Gus on any of 'em.  The one at her 
                        apartment was broken.
                               (a beat)
                        Johnny Boz's psychiatrist says he 
                        thinks he remembers Dr. Gardner 
                        and Boz meeting at a Christmas 
                        party at his house a year ago.

          A long beat.

                                    LT. WALKER
                               (after a long beat, 
                               sadly)
                        You just can't tell about people, 
                        can you.  Even the ones you think 
                        you know inside-out.

          He and Nick look at each other a beat.

                                    CAPTAIN TALCOTT
                        Congratulations, Curran.

          Nick looks at him, expressionless.

          EXT. HIS APARTMENT - NIGHT

          He parks his car.  It is dark.  Foggy.

          He starts heading inside.

          INT. HIS APARTMENT - NIGHT

          He goes in.  He starts to walk up the dark stairway, we see 
          him walking up several flights of steps.

          INT. THE CORRIDOR TO HIS APARTMENT

          He opens his door with his key.

          INT. HIS APARTMENT

          He walks in.  The apartment is dark.

                                    A VOICE
                               (behind him)
                        Hi.

          It is a whisper, almost a hiss.  He spins, fast.  Catherine 
          stands there, pressing herself against a wall.  They look at 
          each other a long beat.  She looks like she is almost in a 
          trance.

                                    CATHERINE
                        I heard about it... on TV.

          He looks at her, expressionless.  A long beat, their eyes are 
          into each other.  She looks like she is almost shivering.

                                    CATHERINE
                        I can't allow myself to care about 
                        you -- I can't allow myself to 
                        care -- I can't -- I can't --

          She looks very emotional.  He moves towards her, puts his arms 
          around her, holds her very close.

                                    CATHERINE
                               (in a whisper)
                        I don't want to do this -- please --
                        I don't want to do this -- I lose 
                        everybody -- I don't want to lose 
                        you -- I don't want to --

          He presses her closer and closer to himself, holds her.

          INT. HIS BEDROOM - NIGHT

          It is dark; we can't see clearly.

          Atop her... he makes love to her... gently... tenderly...  
          hardly moving inside her... there are tears in her eyes...

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

          INT. HIS BEDROOM - LATER

          Atop him... she is on her knees, straddling him... he is on 
          his back, his eyes are closed... her head arches back...  her 
          breasts high... he strains toward her with his body...  she 
          holds her arms high... her right hand is in a fist...

          (we only see the back of her hand and arm)... it comes down 
          suddenly... he bucks... writhes... then her whole body falls 
          on top of him.

          A very long beat...

          We can't see him... her body completely covers him...

          And then finally he moves... turns her to the side...  kisses 
          her.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

          INT. HIS BEDROOM - LATER

          The Stones play "Sympathy For The Devil"  in the b.g.; the 
          MUSIC is low.

          They lie next to each other on the bed.  The CAMERA faces them.  
          He lies, staring at the ceiling, on the left side of the bed, 
          smoking a cigarette.  She is curled away from him toward the 
          right side of the bed.  A long beat, then --

                                    CATHERINE
                        What do we do now, Nick?

                                    NICK
                               (after a long beat)
                        We fuck like minks.  We raise 
                        rugrats.  We live happily ever 
                        after.

          We see her right arm go to the side of the bed and then over.  
          He stares at the ceiling.

                                    CATHERINE
                        I hate rugrats.

                                    NICK
                               (after a long beat)
                        We fuck like minks.  We forget the 
                        rugrats.  We live happily ever 
                        after.

          We see from an ANGLE to the left side of the bed now Her face 
          is expressionless.  Her right arm dangles over the right side 
          of the bed.  Her right hand is clenched.  Is she holding 
          something in it against her arm?

          We see them from an ANGLE to the left side of the bed now: He 
          turns his body away from her to put out his cigarette.

          We see her behind him slowly turning towards him and the CAMERA.  
          A beat, and he turns towards her.

          They look at each other.  A long beat as the SONG gets louder.  
          We see them in CLOSEUP.  We don't see her right arm.

                                    CATHERINE
                               (in a whisper)
                        I love you.

          A beat, and he kisses her.  The CAMERA BACKS AWAY from them 
          slowly to the right side of the bedroom as they kiss, and we --

                                                              FADE TO BLACK

          ... A long beat, as the SONG keeps playing... and we...

          FADE IN:

          We see them from the right side of the bedroom.  And then the 
          CAMERA LOWERS SLOWLY as they kiss with more and more passion.

          It keeps going LOWER.

          There is something under the bed.  The CAMERA MOVES CLOSER 
          towards it as "SYMPATHY FOR THE DEVIL" plays louder.  We see 
          it now in CLOSEUP as the bed rustles above...

          It is a thin, steel-handled icepick.

          The SONG plays LOUDER and LOUDER, and we --

                                                                   FADE OUT

                                               FIRST DRAFT

                                               October 20, 1986








     FADE IN:

     EXT. CITYSCAPE - NIGHT

     The place is Gotham City. The time, 1987 -- once removed.

     The city of Tomorrow: stark angles, creeping shadows, 
     dense, crowded, airless, a random tangle of steel and 
     concrete, self-generating, almost subterranean in its 
     aspect... as if hell had erupted through the sidewalks and 
     kept on growing. A dangling fat moon shines overhead, ready 
     to burst.

     EXT. CATHEDRAL - NIGHT

     Amid the chrome and glass sits a dark and ornate Gothic 
     anomaly: old City Cathedral, once grand, now abandoned -- 
     long since boarded up and scheduled for demolition.

     On the rooftop far above us, STONE GARGOYLES gaze down from 
     their shadowy, windswept perches, keeping monstrous watch 
     over the distant streets below, sightless guardians of the 
     Gotham night.

     One of them is moving.

     EXT. GOTHAM SQUARE - NIGHT

     The pulsing heart of downtown Gotham, a neon nightmare of 
     big-city corruption, almost surreal in its oppressiveness. 
     Hookers wave to drug dealers. Street hustlers slap high-
     fives with three-card monte dealers. They all seem to know
     each other... with one conspicuous exception:

     A TOURIST FAMILY, Mom, Dad, and little Jimmy, staring 
     straight  ahead as they march in perfect lockstep down the 
     main drag. They've just come out of a bit show two blocks 
     over; the respectable theatre crowd has thinned out, and 
     now -- Playbills in hand -- they find themselves adrift in 
     the predatory traffic of Gotham's meanest street.

                              MOM
               For God's sake, Harold, can we
               please just get a taxi??

                              DAD
               I'm trying to get a --
                     (shouting)
               TAXI!!

     Three cabs streak pass and disappear. MOM grimaces in 
     frustration as LITTLE JIMMY consults a subway map.

                              JIMMY
               We're going the wrong way.

     Nearby, STREET TYPES are beginning to snicker. DAD surveys 
     them nervously, gestures toward the subway map.

                              DAD
               Put that away. We'll look like
               tourists.

     TWO COPS lean on their patrol car outside an all-night 
     souvlaki stand, sipping coffee and chatting with a HOOKER. 
     The HOOKER smiles at JIMMY.  JIMMY smiles back. MOM yanks 
     him off down the street and glowers at DAD.

                              DAD (cont.)
               We'll never get a cab here. Let's
               cut over to Seventh.

                              JIMMY
               Seventh is that way.

                              DAD
               I know where we are!

     EXT. SIDE STREET - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT

     A deserted access street, sidewalks lined with the husks of 
     stripped-down cars. MOM, DAD, and JIMMY take a deep breath 
     and march down the darkened street. A VOICE startles them.

                              VOICE
               Hey, mister. Gimme a dollar?

     The VOICE belongs to a DERELICT -- nineteen or twenty, 
     acne-scarred -- who sits between two garbage cans, his palm 
     uplifted. His ratty t-shirt reads: 'I LOVE GOTHAM CITY.'

     MOM, DAD, and JIMMY pause for the merest of seconds, then 
     move on -- pretending not to hear.

                              DERELICT
               Mister. How about it. One dollar?
                     (standing up)
               One dollar, man. Are you deaf?
               Are you deaf? -- Do you speak
               English??

     By now the TOURISTS are halfway across the street. 
     Mercifully, the DERELICT doesn't seem to be following.

     They pick up their pace. They don't see the SHADOWY FIGURE 
     in the alleyway. They don't see the GUN until a gloved hand 
     brings it down, butt-first, across the back of DAD's neck.

     DAD crumples. MOM grabs JIMMY and backs up against a brick 
     wall, too terrified to scream. The DERELICT races across 
     the street to join his confederate, the STREET PUNK, who's 
     already searching for DAD's wallet.

     MOM's mouth opens in panic. They can see she's about to 
     snap -- so  the STREET PUNK, still in a crouch, trains his 
     gun on JIMMY.

                              STREET PUNK
               Do the kid a favor, lady. Don't
               scream.

     The poor woman is utterly horrified. TEARS stream down her 
     face. But she keeps her wits about her, stifles the urge to 
     shriek, and hustles JIMMY off down the street.

     The two PUNKS watch them break into a run -- then chuckle, 
     slap hands, race off in the opposite direction.

     EXT. ROOFTOP - NIGHT

     Six stories up. The PUNKS -- NICK and EDDIE -- hunker down 
     on the tar-and-gravel roof, sizing up their take.

                              NICK
                     (emptying the wallet)
               All right. The Gold Card.
                     (tossing the credit card
                     in EDDIE's face)
               Don't leave home without it.

     A chill wind whips across the roof as NICK extracts the 
     cash and begins to count it. There's a distant, indistinct 
     CLANG: metal on metal. EDDIE hears it and tenses up.

                              EDDIE
               Let's beat it, man. I don't like
               being up here.

                              NICK
               What, scared of heights?

                              EDDIE
               I dunno, man. After what happened to
               Johnny Gobs --

                              NICK
               Look, Johnny Gobs got ripped and
               walked off a roof, all right? No big
               loss.

                              EDDIE
               That ain't what I heard. That ain't
               what I heard at all.
                     (beat)
               I heard the bat got him.

                              NICK
               Gimme a break, will you? Shut up... 

                              EDDIE
               Five stories, straight down. There
               was no blood in the body.

                              NICK
               No shit. It was all over the
               pavement.

     NICK has no patience with campfire tales -- but here on the 
     roof, in the pale moonlight, he can't ignore the slight 
     tingle at the base of his spine... 

                              EDDIE
               There was no blood, man.
                     (beat)
               My brother says... all the bad things
               you done... they come back and
               haunt you... 

                              NICK
               Listen to this. How old are you?
               There ain't no bat.

                              EDDIE
               My brother's a priest, man.

                              NICK
               No wonder you're such a chickenshit.
               Now shut up.
                     (conclusively)
               There ain't no bat.

     As they speak our attention shifts to a point at the 
     opposite corner of the roof, some fifteen yards away... 
     where, at the end of a line, a STRANGE BLACK SILHOUETTE is 
     dropping slowly, implacably, into frame... 

                              EDDIE
               You shouldn'ta turned the gun on
               that kid, man. You shouldn'ta --

                              NICK
               Do you want this money or don't
               you? Now shut up! Shut up --

     BOTH PUNKS FREEZE at the sudden, inexplicable sound of 
     BOOTS CRUNCHING ON GRAVEL. They turn slowly. Their JAWS 
     DROP.

     Standing at the edge of the roof, bathed in moonlight, is a 
     BLACK APPARITION. IT DOES NOT MOVE.

     EDDIE stands rooted to the spot, a choked gurgle in his 
     throat, as if he's just seen his own death. The BLACK 
     FIGURE advances, spreading  its arms. Or rather, its WINGS: 
     GREAT BLACK BATWINGS, flapping in the wind.

     NICK drops to the gravel, gropes for the gun, brings it up.

     And still the BLACK FIGURE draws closer, deliberate, 
     menacing. On its chest: THE EMBLEM OF A BAT, in an oval 
     yellow field, glowing like a target in the darkness... 

     NICK FIRES TWICE. TWO CLEAN HITS. The strange black figure 
     is knocked bodily to the roof.

     Trembling, sweating buckets, NICK gets to his feet. He 
     whacks a motionless EDDIE on the arm --

                              NICK (cont.)
               I'm gettin' outta here.

     -- and bends to retrieve his loot. EDDIE lets out a 
     strange, pre-verbal squeal... 

     ... and NICK sees THE HUMAN BAT, BACK ON ITS FEET, 
     NIGHTMARISH, UNDEAD, MOVING SLOWLY AND INEVITABLY CLOSER.

     Panic. Sheer, raw, unrelenting panic. Stolen money flutters 
     out of NICK's hands. He scuttles around the periphery of 
     the roof, his feet skidding on the gravel as he searches 
     for a way down. The BLACK SPECTRE is blocking his path to 
     the fire escape. Trapped like a rat, NICK FIRES WILDLY.

     EDDIE is frozen in place, his eyes glazed over, his face 
     drained of blood. The BAT treads calmly past. A LEG snakes 
     out. A BLACK BOOT catches EDDIE high on the chest --

     -- LIFTS HIM CLEANLY OFF HIS FEET --

     -- AND SENDS HIM FLYING THROUGH THE AIR. EDDIE slams into a 
     brick chimney and slumps to the roof unconscious, a broken, 
     weightless puppet.

     THIS ACTION IS SO SMOOTH, SO AUTOMATIC, THAT THE BAT DOES 
     NOT EVEN BREAK HIS STRIDE. NICK sees his chance and CHARGES 
     past the black wraith, scrambling toward the fire escape... 

     A GLOVED HAND slices through the air, and NICK pitches 
     forward, his legs ensnared in a tangle of WIRES. Screaming 
     now, he drags himself across the gravel roof, the looming 
     figure of the BAT at his heels... 

     ... until there's no place left to go. NICK cowers against 
     the ledge, his pants torn, his hands and knees bloody. He 
     has dissolved into total mindless hysteria.

     Almost by reflex, NICK keeps shooting. He'd do better if he 
     could manage to open his eyes. By now the hammer is falling 
     on an empty chamber, but NICK continues, obsessively, to 
     pull the trigger. He weeps; he moans; he wails... 

     THE BAT grabs a fistful of NICK's shirt, and with 
     supernatural ease HOISTS HIM into the air.

                              NICK (cont.)
               Don't kill me... don't kill me... 

     When NICK finally opens his eyes, he realizes THE BAT is 
     standing on the ledge of the roof -- HOLDING HIM OUT, at 
     arm's length, over six stories of nothingness.

     The gruesome black apparition speaks, in a rasping whisper:

                              BATMAN
               I won't kill you. I want you to do
               me a favor.

     NICK looks down. Far, far below, CARS wink silently past.

     He looks up. And sees, in the mirrored lenses where 
     BATMAN's eyes should be, the twin reflections of his own 
     stricken face.

                              BATMAN (cont.)
               Tell your friends. Tell all your
               friends.

     NICK HOWLS. Almost as an afterthought, THE BATMAN heaves 
     him roughly back onto the roof. And then -- casually, 
     without a moment's hesitation -- STEPS OFF THE LEDGE OF THE 
     ROOF, INTO MIDAIR.

     Trembling, NICK crawls to the ledge and looks over... 
     finding ABSOLUTELY NO TRACE of the Batman.

     NICK is still screaming as we PAN UP to the bilious yellow 
     globe of Gotham's moon. MAIN CREDITS ROLL:

                              BATMAN

                                                 CUT TO:

     INT. GOTHAM CITY DEMOCRATS' CLUB - NIGHT

     An oversized CAMPAIGN POSTER fills one wall: "A NEW GOTHAM. 
     HARVEY DENT FOR DISTRICT ATTORNEY". We TILT DOWN to find 
     the man himself, determined, dynamic HARVEY DENT, 
     addressing a crowd from behind his podium.

                              DENT
               ... it is no longer enough to go
               after the small-time punks and petty
               criminals who infest the streets of
               Gotham City. Crime and corruption
               must be attacked at the root!

     ANOTHER ANGLE - THE AUDIENCE

     Civic-minded politicos decked out in fund-raiser finery. 
     They applaud DENT's tough talk wildly. They've just shelled 
     out $500 a plate for a chicken dinner, and by God they're 
     going to enjoy this.

     Tuxedoed WAITERS move among the tables, deftly refilling 
     water glasses. As they do, we SEE an EMPTY PLACE SETTING -- 
     the only one in the hall. Some well-meaning moneybags has 
     laid out half a grand and then neglected to show up.

     The engraved placecard reads: BRUCE WAYNE.

     ANGLE ON DENT

                              DENT
               If elected, my first act as district
               attorney will be to return an
               indictment against Boss Carl
               Grissom!

                                                 CUT TO:

     INT. APARTMENT - NIGHT

     A woman's apartment, decorated in pastel pinks and mauves. 
     Original paintings and sculptures everywhere. The place 
     reeks of money.

     In the foreground: a MAN'S HAND, long, elegant, manicured.
     Manipulating a DECK OF CARDS, doing a one-handed shuffle 
     with extraordinary finesse.

     In the background: a TV set tuned to the 11 o'clock news, 
     with highlights of HARVEY DENT's campaign speech.

                              DENT
                     (on the TV screen)
               Together we can make Gotham city a
               safe place for decent people to live
               and work and play.

     THE HAND sets the deck on an end table, raps it twice, 
     turns up four aces off the top. This most unusual deck 
     sports a .22 calibre BULLET HOLE straight through the 
     middle.

                              JACK NAPIER
               Decent people shouldn't live here.
               They'd be much happier someplace
               else.

     JACK NAPIER, 32, is right-hand man and chief enforcer to 
     Boss Carl Grissom. His features are delicate, almost 
     feminine, and he takes a vain, gangsterish pride in his 
     appearance. He is also absolutely merciless.

     He trains a cold eye on DENT's televised image as ALICIA 
     HUNT -- 26, beautiful, Carl Grissom's kept woman -- glides 
     over in her negligee and snuggles up.

                              ALICIA
               Anything new?

                              JACK
               The usual gas. If this clown could
               lay a hand on Grissom... I would've
               had to kill him by now.

     ALICIA finds JACK's necktie draped over a nearby chair. She 
     begins knotting it playfully about his neck.

                              ALICIA
               If Grissom knew about us... he
               might kill you.

     JACK seems uninterested in her affections. His eye darts 
     back and forth between the TV and his own reflection in a 
     nearby vanity.

                              JACK
               Don't think so, angel. I'm too
               valuable. That's the way I've
               planned it.
                     (pause)
               And besides, he doesn't know.

     JACK checks his watch, reaches for his topcoat, and stands 
     in front of the vanity. He runs a hand through sculpted 
     hair, checks out his Albert Nipon ensemble.

                              ALICIA
               You look just fine, Jack.

     He smiles at himself before turning to the door.

                              JACK
               ... I didn't ask.

                                                 CUT TO:

     EXT. ALLEYWAY - NIGHT

     The scene of the earlier mugging, a half-block off Gotham 
     Square. Only now, the deserted alleyway is a beehive of 
     activity: police cars, an ambulance, a forensics van.

     EDDIE THE PUNK goes past on a stretcher, catatonic. 
     Watching him are a porcine cop, LT. ECKHARDT, and a POLICE 
     MEDIC.

                              MEDIC
               That one there won't say a word. The
               other one's raving his head off.

                              ECKHARDT
               Variety, huh? The spice of life.

     At the mouth of the alley, we find ALEXANDER KNOX --
     thirty, hyperactive, a crime reporter for the Gotham
     Gazette. At the moment, he's chatting with a uniformed
     PATROLMAN.

                              PATROLMAN
               They found him hugging a drainpipe.
               He was scared to come off the roof.

                              KNOX
               Great, but tell me: is this another
               you-know-what? 'Cause if so, it's
               the third one this week.

                              PATROLMAN
                     (testily)
               I dunno. What's "what"?

                              KNOX
               Good answer. I'm gonna put you in
               for a commendation.

     KNOX spots ECKHARDT and the MEDIC, waves cheerily, and 
     saunters down the alley. ECKHARDT curses under his breath.

                              ECKHARDT
               Oh Christ, it's Knox.

                              KNOX
               Hiya, gents. This anything I should
               know about?

                              ECKHARDT
               Nothing out of the routine.

     At this exact moment two uniformed PATROLMEN drag a brain-
     fried NICK past the mouth of the alley.

                              NICK
               A bat, I tell you, a giant bat!
               He wanted me to do him a favor...!

     KNOX tilts one eyebrow. ECKHARDT and the MEDIC trade 
     disgusted looks.

                              KNOX
               No offense, boys, but these guys are
               seeing something up there.

                              ECKHARDT
               No comment. Print what you like.

                              KNOX
               Come on. One question. Is there a
               six-foot bat in Gotham City?

     KNOX's tone is jokey, but only half-jokey. ECKHARDT snorts 
     in disgust and turns away. KNOX shouts after him:

                              KNOX (cont.)
               If so, is he on the police payroll?
               If so, what's he pulling down after
               taxes?

     EXT. STREET - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT

     We pick up LT. ECKHARDT as he emerges onto the side street. 
     He's headed for his car when he spies a STRETCH LIMO idling 
     across the street. Leaning on the hood, waving hi, is the 
     dandyish JACK NAPIER -- flanked by two impressive GOONS.

     ECKHARDT throws a nervous glance back in KNOX's direction. 
     He turns left, gestures to JACK to meet him farther up the 
     block. By the time he reaches the corner JACK has swaggered 
     up alongside him.

     ECKHARDT takes a fat brown envelope from JACK and stuffs it 
     quickly in his coat.

                              JACK
               You didn't show up.

                              ECKHARDT
               We had another bat sighting.

                              JACK
               I'm sure that was vitally important.
               Listen: things are heating up.
               Someone is leaking information to
               Harvey Dent.

     ECKHARDT bristles. There's no love lost between these two.

                              ECKHARDT
               I'm doing the best I can. If it's a
               problem --

                              JACK
               Eckhardt... our problems are your
               problems.

                              ECKHARDT
               I'll work on it.

     JACK reaches out and grabs ECKHARDT by the lapels of his 
     topcoat -- an Italian job, obviously expensive. He rubs the 
     material between his fingers.

                              JACK
               Very nice, Lieutenant. But a little
               ostentatious on a cop's salary,
               don't you think?

                              ECKHARDT
                     (knocking his hands away)
               I answer to Grissom, punk. Not to
               you.

                              JACK
               You're a smart boy, Eckhardt. You
               should be thinking about the future.

     ECKHARDT laughs in his face.

                              ECKHARDT
               Ambition.
                     (nodding his head)
               Forget it, Jack. You'll never run
               that organization.

                              JACK
               And why's that?

                              ECKHARDT
               You're a psycho, friend. You're an
               A-one crazy boy and Grissom knows
               it.

     JACK lashes out and BACKHANDS ECKHARDT across the face. The 
     fat cop, stunned, turns bright red and CHARGES JACK.

     JACK claps a hand on ECKHARDT's face and shoves him back 
     full-force. The cop sprawls on his ass in the doorway of an 
     all-night Cuban-Chinese restaurant.

     By now PATRONS are staring out of the restaurant windows. 
     ECKHARDT is livid. His hand goes instinctively to his gun.

                              JACK
               Here. Use mine.

     JACK pulls an automatic from his pocket and tosses it in 
     ECKHARDT's lap. He looks down and laughs, daring ECKHARDT 
     to pick it up -- just as the two enormous GOONS from the 
     stretch limo appear behind him for reinforcement.

     ECKHARDT wipes blood from his mouth as JACK -- an A-one 
     crazy-boy grin on his face -- reaches down for the gun.

                              JACK (cont.)
               It's all right, boys. Lt. Eckhardt
               here is a good cop. A real good cop.
                     (pause; smiling)
               Inexpensive.

                                                 DISSOLVE TO:

     INT. GOTHAM GLOBE - CITY ROOM - DAY

     Gotham city's leading tabloid daily. COPY BOYS rush to and 
     fro; REPORTERS pound out articles on computer terminals. 
     ALEXANDER KNOX saunters in, a sheath of typed pages in his 
     hand, and pauses at a CARTOONIST's drawing table.

                              KNOX
               What have you got for me, Jerry?

     JERRY holds up a cartoon: a HUMAN BAT, with an awful, 
     fanged rodent's face, wearing a business suit. The caption 
     at the top reads: "HAVE YOU SEEN THIS MAN?"  KNOX nods in 
     approval.

                              KNOX (cont.)
               Nice, but... maybe a little more gore
               on the fangs, huh?

     He pats JERRY on the shoulder, moves on. A BESPECTACLED 
     COLLEAGUE spots him and calls out:

                              COLLEAGUE
               Hey Knox, you got a visitor.

                              KNOX
               I'm real busy, Clark. Be a pal and
               dust him, okay?

                              COLLEAGUE
               This one you might want to dust
               yourself.

     Curiosity piqued, KNOX moves toward his desk... and stops 
     in his tracks. Propped up on the desk are a PAIR OF LEGS. 
     The legs -- exceptionally nice ones -- are attached to a 
     WOMAN leaning back in KNOX's swivel chair, taking a nap, 
     her face obscured by a big outrageous hat.

                              KNOX
               ... Vicki Vale.

     The hat tips back. VICKI VALE, her face framed by a shock 
     of bright red hair, flashes a dazzling smile. She pulls 
     KNOX over for a quick smooch and laughs.

                              VICKI
               How'd you know it was me?

                              KNOX
               Honey -- I would know any randomly
               selected square inch of Vicki
               Vale.
                     (grinning)
               If I had a good enough hint.

     He points at the oversized CAMERA BAG on his desk. It bears 
     the monogram "V.V."  VICKI catches on, makes a face at him.

                              KNOX (cont.)
               Where the hell have you been?

                              VICKI
               A nice, restful vacation.

     She reaches into the camera bag and pulls out a stack of 
     glossy 8x10's: COMBAT PHOTOS from some unspecified war-torn 
     corner of the world. KNOX leafs though them, impressed.

                              KNOX
               God, a girl could get hurt doing
               this.

                              VICKI
               I do get hurt.

     She unbuttons her sleeve, rolls it back to show KNOX a long 
     fresh scar on the inside of her arm. He winces -- then 
     points to the scar and adds, slyly:

                              KNOX
               Got any more of those?

                              VICKI
               Nothing I'm at liberty to reveal
               here. What's new and hot in Gotham
               City?

                              KNOX
               It's too good, Vick. We got a six-
               foot bat that swoops out of the
               night and preys on evildoers.

                              VICKI
                     (laughing)
               Evildoers, huh? Big or small?

                              KNOX
               Small so far. I mean -- they don't
               allow bats in boardrooms, do they.

                              VICKI
               Speaking of which... I hear the
               notorious Bruce Wayne is throwing a
               big do for the Harvey Dent campaign.

                              KNOX
               Yeah. Hottest ticket in town. Every
               law'n'order freak in the city's
               gonna be there.

     KNOX suddenly freezes. It's just occurred to him that VICKI 
     may have a purpose in all this.

                              KNOX (cont.)
               Wa-a-it. Vicki. You're not saying --

     She reaches back into her camera bag and hands over an 
     INVITATION. KNOX is all but panting with excitement.

                              KNOX (cont.)
               Aw, Vicki. Vicki!
                     (apprehensively)
               Got a date?

     She flutters her great big eyelashes, shakes her head no. 
     KNOX grabs her face and plants a kiss on her forehead, 
     nearly knocking her out of the swivel chair.

                              KNOX (cont.)
               Vicki, baby, I love you, I've always
               loved you. Will you marry me?

                              VICKI
                     (straightening her clothes)
               No.

                              KNOX
               Well, I'm starving. Will you at
               least buy me a hamburger?

                              VICKI
               Yes, but please -- be gentle.

     Overwhelmed with glee, he offers her his arm.

                                                 CUT TO:

     INT. PENTHOUSE - DAY

     A HUGE PLATE GLASS WINDOW opens on the best view in Gotham. 
     This spectacular penthouse suite is just one of the power 
     perks available to CARL GRISSOM, kingpin of the Gotham City 
     rackets, fat, fifty, and utterly without charm.

     GRISSOM, behind a big broad desk, addresses his LIEUTENANTS 
     -- a fearsome assemblage of bloodless white-collar types 
     and few outright goons, sprawled in chairs throughout this 
     makeshift 'boardroom.'  The big boss waves a copy of the 
     Gotham Globe -- with HARVEY DENT's face on the cover.

                              GRISSOM
               Nine points ahead in the new poll. I
               don't like the way this is shaping
               up.

     JACK NAPIER slouches in an easy chair off to GRISSOM's 
     right, doing his trademark one-handed shuffle.

                              JACK
               We can always pop him. -- Or pop
               someone close to him.

                              LIEUTENANT
               Let's feed him to the bat.

     This suggestion draws CHUCKLES from several members of the 
     crowd. GRISSOM is unamused.

                              GRISSOM
               He's going after our front
               companies. Specifically Ace
               Chemical. Which would tie us
               in with Councilman Kane, Senator
               Miller... on up the line.
                     (pause)
               We have to clean out our files
               before the subpoena comes down.

                              LIEUTENANT
               How do we go? The usual fire?

                              GRISSOM
               I'm thinking break-in. Trash the
               office, remove the relevant
               documents... 

                              JACK
               "Industrial espionage."

                              GRISSOM
               That's right. And Jack --
                     (pause)
               I'd like you to handle this
               operation personally.

     JACK has just turned up the third ace off the top of the 
     deck. His hand freezes in midair.

                              JACK
               ... Me?

     At this exact moment, METAL DOORS slide back -- and ALICIA 
     HUNT steps out of GRISSOM's private penthouse elevator. 
     She's carrying a handful of SHOPPING BAGS.

                              GRISSOM
               Hello, sweetheart. I wonder if you'd
               mind waiting in the other room.

     ALICIA's gaze meets JACK's as she vanishes through a side 
     door. The eye contact is not lost on GRISSOM.

                              JACK
               Why do you need me to handle a
               simple break-in?

                              GRISSOM
                     (emphatically)
               Because I want someone I can
               trust.

     JACK bridles, but doesn't protest. Nervously, he turns the 
     fourth card off the top of the deck. It's not an ace.

     It's a JOKER -- a Joker with a neat, round, .22 calibre 
     HOLE through its face.

                              GRISSOM (cont.)
               We'll work out the details later.
               But it's got to be soon. -- All
               right, that's all for now.

     GRISSOM'S CRONIES get up to go. JACK, troubled, lingers 
     behind a moment.

                              GRISSOM (cont.)
               You don't mind, do you Jack? It's an
               important job. I can't trust it to
               somebody who'll screw up.

                              JACK
               I understand.

                     (smiling)
               Jack. Don't forget your lucky deck.

     JACK pockets the deck and leaves. GRISSOM sits behind the 
     big desk and GRINS WOLFISHLY.

                              GRISSOM (cont.)
               My friend, your luck is just about
               to change.

     He reaches for the phone. ALICIA appears in the doorway 
     nearby, modeling her new purchases for him. He smiles 
     coolly at her as he speaks into the receiver.

                              GRISSOM (cont.)
               Get me Lieutenant Eckhardt.

                                                 CUT TO:

     EXT. WAYNE MANOR - ESTABLISHING - NIGHT

     A vast, rambling mansion on sixty wooded acres a half-
     hour's drive from Gotham: old money, and how. Out front, a 
     team of red-jacketed VALETS are parking expensive cars.

     INT. BALLROOM - NIGHT

     A DEALER'S HAND pushes cards out of a shoe (the card kind, 
     not the Florsheim kind). It's casino night at Wayne Manor; 
     the ballroom has been outfitted with roulette wheels, 
     blackjack tables, etc., and the various members of Gotham's 
     power elite are happily -- and legally -- throwing money 
     into Harvey Dent's campaign kitty.

     DENT himself is surrounded by a gang of political cronies, 
     telling jokes, calling in favors. VICKI's off in another 
     group, looking luscious, drawing compliments from big shots 
     and envious, furtive glances from their wives. And, in a 
     corner of the room, all alone in his cheap suit, stands 
     ALEXANDER KNOX -- staring inquisitively up at the ceiling.

     A butler, ALFRED, appears alongside KNOX with a trayful of 
     champagne glasses. He too looks up at the ceiling.

                              KNOX
               How high up would you say that is?

                              ALFRED
               I'd say about thirty feet, sir.

                              KNOX
               You know, if you cut your bathroom
               in half, you'd have my apartment.

                              ALFRED
               Which bathroom is that, air?

                              KNOX
               The small one.

     KNOX takes a drink and ALFRED moves on. A moment later, 
     VICKI detaches herself from her little circle of admirers 
     and hooks up with KNOX.

                              KNOX (cont.)
               Man, I feel like Robin Leach. You
               actually know all these people?

                              VICKI
               Some. I am a rich bitch, remember.
                     (pause)
               I'm quoting.

     KNOX winces at the reminder. She smiles and takes his arm.

                              KNOX
               Yeah, I guess we move in different
               circles. -- Though I did meet a
               one-eyed pimp last week.

     ANGLE ON JAMES W. GORDON

     Gotham's Police Commissioner, a distinguished-looking gent 
     in his late fifties. He's at a craps table, blowing into 
     his fist. ONLOOKERS root him on as he lets the dice fly.

     Snake eyes. Crapped out. GORDON passes the dice as KNOX and 
     VICKI wander up alongside him.

                              KNOX
               Commissioner Gordon! What do you
               hear from our pointy-eared friend?

     KNOX puts his hands up behind his head and wiggles his 
     fingers -- like little bat ears. GORDON groans.

                              GORDON
               Knox, for the ninth time, and you
               can quote me -- there is no bat.

                              KNOX
               Aww, Commissioner. There's gotta be
               one honest cop in Gotham city.

     HARVEY DENT is working the room. He ambles up, claps a 
     friendly hand on GORDON's shoulder.

                              DENT
               How's your luck, Jim?

                              KNOX
               Mr. Dent. What's your stand on
               winged vigilantes?

     DENT exchanges a meaningful look with GORDON.

                              DENT
               Mr. Knox, I think we have enough
               real problems in this city without
               worrying about ghosts and goblins
               and Halloween characters.

     EXT. ACE CHEMICAL CO. ESTABLISHING - NIGHT

     A NEON SIGN reads: "ACE CHEMICAL. FOR A MODERN TOMORROW."  
     From the SIGN we pan over to a METAL SLUICE GATE -- dumping 
     TONS of CHURNING TOXIC SLUDGE into Gotham's East River.

     INT. VAN - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT

     TIGHT ON the rear-view mirror. JACK NAPIER is meticulously 
     applying BLACK CAMOUFLAGE PAINT to his face. He could be 
     getting ready for a date.

     The van is parked outside a chain-link fence which 
     surrounds the Ace Chemical complex.

     JACK'S POV - THROUGH WINDSHIELD

     The SECURITY GUARD in a glass booth at the entrance to the 
     parking lot. ONE OF JACK'S BOYS creeps up behind the booth 
     and takes the GUARD out.

     INT. VAN - ON JACK

     He turns the key in the ignition, shifts into first.

                                                 CUT TO:

     INT. WAYNE MANOR - NIGHT

     KNOX and VICKI are taking an unauthorized tour of BRUCE's 
     house, wandering through rooms decorated in wildly 
     divergent motifs, eyeing an astounding collection of 
     artworks and antiques from every corner of the world.

                              KNOX
               My question is, where does one man
               get all this junk.

                              VICKI
               All over the world. They say he
               spends most of the year overseas --
               until recently, anyway.

                              KNOX
               Holy shit... 

     KNOX goes goggle-eyed as they enter the LIBRARY.

     INT. BRUCE WAYNE'S LIBRARY - NIGHT

                              KNOX (cont.)
               ... We found the arsenal.

     One wall is lined to the ceiling with leather-bound 
     volumes. On the other walls hang EXOTIC WEAPONS. Halberds. 
     Maces. Blowguns. Bolas. Thugee ropes and samurai swords... 
     every arcane implement of death the human mind has ever 
     devised. KNOX lets out a low whistle.

                              KNOX (cont.)
               This guy has just gotten
               interesting. What else do you know?

                              VICKI
               Just what I've heard. Rich.
               Reclusive. Old money and lots of it.

                              KNOX
               Likes to kill?

                              VICKI
                     (smiling)
               Women find him magnetic.

                              KNOX
               I bet they like him for his big
               charity balls.

                              VICKI
               That, and the sweet smell of two
               hundred million bucks.

                              KNOX
               Well, you know me. The more they've
               got, the less they're worth.
                     (scanning the room)
               This guy must be the most worthless
               man in America.

     Just then, A VOICE FROM BEHIND intrudes.

                              BRUCE WAYNE
               You disappoint me. Why not the
               world?

     KNOX turns. We get our first good look at the smiling face 
     of BRUCE WAYNE: 32, tall, athletic, impeccably mannered... 
     and intensely handsome.

                              KNOX
               I assume in my usual charming manner
               I've just insulted the host.
                     (extending a hand)
               Alexander Knox.

                              BRUCE
               Bruce Wayne. -- I've read your work.
               I quite like it.

                              KNOX
               Great. Give me a grant.

                              BRUCE
               I might consider it if you introduce
               me to Miss Vale.

     KNOX blinks at VICKI. BRUCE already seems to know who she 
     is. KNOX shrugs and forges bravely ahead:

                              KNOX
               "This is Miss Vale." -- That felt
               redundant.

                              BRUCE
                     (to VICKI)
               You're just back from Corto Maltese.
               I saw your combat photos. Quite a
               departure for you.

                              VICKI
               That's intriguing. They haven't been
               published yet.

     BRUCE smiles and ignores the implied question.

                              BRUCE
               ... You have an extraordinary eye.

     He's laying on the charm now. KNOX, his territorial 
     instincts aroused, pipes up:

                              KNOX
               Some people think she has two.

     VICKI shoots KNOX a sidelong glance:

                              VICKI
               Don't mind my friend. He's a little
               nervous tonight.

     KNOX, chastened, calls off the dogs and sizes up his 
     competition. BRUCE is charming, all right, but there's 
     something formal, maybe even calculating about it -- he
     could be reading his clever remarks off cue cards. It's 
     almost as though he's an actor doing a brilliant imitation 
     of charm.

     This is a man who thinks three moves ahead. KNOX doesn't
     like him. But VICKI -- who's used to seeing male charm 
     turned on and off, at will -- doesn't seem to mind at all:

                              VICKI (cont.)
               This is an amazing house. I'd love
               to shoot it sometime.

                              BRUCE
               I don't... seek publicity. -- Will
               you be staying in Gotham for a
               while?

                              VICKI
               As far as I know.

                              BRUCE
               Good. Then with any luck we'll run
               into each other.

     Suddenly ALFRED, the butler, appears in the doorway behind 
     them. He clears his throat. BRUCE turns.

                              ALFRED
               Excuse me, sir. Commissioner Gordon
               was compelled to leave -- very
               unexpectedly. He asked me to convey
               his regrets.

                              BRUCE
               Thank you, Alfred.
                     (to VICKI)
               I hope you'll excuse me. It was a
               great pleasure meeting you.
                     (to KNOX)
               And you.

     Without bothering to shake hands BRUCE does a sharp 180 and 
     strides hurriedly out of the room.

                              KNOX
               I know the rich are different, but
               that guy is real different.

     VICKI, staring off after BRUCE, doesn't seem to hear him.

                              KNOX (cont.)
               Hello? Vicki?

                              VICKI
               Oh. Sorry. I was thinking.

                              KNOX
               What were you thinking?

                              VICKI
               Yum, yum.

                              KNOX
               Well, he must like the way he
               looks. He's got a mirror in every
               room.

     And indeed, the two of them are standing before an enormous 
     WALL MIRROR, eight feet wide, running from floor to 
     ceiling.

                              VICKI
               I get it. Bruce Vain.

     She pokes KNOX. He groans at the dumb pun. And suddenly we

                                                 CUT TO:

     REVERSE ANGLE - THROUGH THE MIRROR

     looking DOWN ON KNOX and VICKI -- THROUGH ONE-WAY GLASS -- 
     as they continue to chat. Behind the mirror... recording 
     everything that happens in the room... is a small, silent, 
     state-of-the-art SURVEILLANCE CAMERA.

     CLOSEUP - VIDEO MONITOR

     showing KNOX and VICKI in the library. CAMERA PULLS BACK to 
     reveal that the screen we're watching is only one in a 
     whole vast bank of video monitors. From this control 
     center, we can see everything that's happening in the 
     house.

     Now we ZERO IN on a single screen: GUESTS moving backward, 
     with exaggerated speed, as a videotape REWINDS.

     At the panel, BRUCE WAYNE hits a button. And now we see 
     COMMISSIONER GORDON talking to a uniformed POLICEMAN.

                              PATROLMAN
               ... anonymous tip. Tonight. The Ace
               Chemical Company.

                              GORDON
                     (obviously agitated)
               Good Lord, it we could put our hands
               on Jack Napier... Why wasn't I told
               about this? Who's in charge of
               the --

                              PATROLMAN
               Lt. Eckhardt, sir.

                              GORDON
               Eckhardt. Oh my God... 

     And suddenly COMMISSIONER GORDON is grabbing for his coat. 
     The monitor goes black. BRUCE reaches up, loosens his tie.

                                                 CUT TO:

     EXT. ACE CHEMICAL CO. - PARKING LOT - NIGHT

     UNMARKED POLICE CARS are pulling into the lot, headlights 
     off. ECKHARDT circulates among his ARMED SWAT TEAM, handing 
     out xeroxed copies of a PHOTOGRAPH.

     The PHOTOGRAPH is a full-face shot of JACK NAPIER.

                              ECKHARDT
               Shoot to kill.

     INT. ACE CHEMICAL - FILE ROOM - NIGHT

     SPARKS FLY. A SAFECRACKER, in welder's mask, trains a 
     blowtorch on the office safe. Behind him, JACK'S HOODS are 
     at work on the filing cabinets.

     The SAFECRACKER kills his blowtorch and opens the metal 
     door of the safe, giving JACK a good look at its contents:

                              SAFECRACKER
               ... Empty.

                              HOOD I
               Just like the file cabinets.

                              HOOD II
               I don't get it. If this place is
               cleaned out already, what do we need
               five men?

     JACK shakes his head. His boys are antsy, ready to mutiny. 
     By now it's depressingly obvious: they've been set up.

     Then, as if they needed any proof -- a SIREN blares 
     outside.

     EXT. ACE CHEMICAL - NIGHT

     ECKHARDT'S SWAT TEAM goes wide-eyed as a CONVOY OF POLICE 
     BLACK-AND-WHITES roars into the Ace parking lot. UNIFORMED 
     COPS pile out of their squad cars, relieving the SWAT TEAM. 
     ECKHARDT goes livid as COMMISSIONER GORDON approaches.

                              ECKHARDT
               What are you trying to do, blow the
               collar?

                              GORDON
                     (to SWAT TEAM)
               You men are dismissed. We'll take
               over from here.
                     (to UNIFORMED COPS)
               Any man who opens fire on Jack
               Napier... will answer to me.

     ECKHARDT tries to slink off. GORDON grabs him roughly.

                              GORDON (cont.)
               You. Stick around.

     INT. ACE CHEMICAL - THAT MOMENT

     JACK and his HOODS ducking out of the office. It's two 
     stories above the refinery floor, accessible by a network 
     of steel ladders and CATWALKS running between the walls.

     Down below, a CORRUGATED METAL DOOR begins to rise.

                              COP
               Freeze!

     One hood goes into a crouch and OPENS FIRE. Half of his 
     colleagues dive back into the office, looking for a rear 
     exit. The others take off across the CATWALKS.

     ANGLE ON GORDON

     standing in the doorway as his MEN rush into the building 
     and take their places behind heavy machinery. SHOTS RING 
     OUT as the HOODS scatter.

                              ECKHARDT
                     (snidely)
               Nice work, Commissioner.

                              GORDON
               I'm in charge here. Not Carl
               Grissom.

     INT. HALLWAY - THAT MOMENT

     TWO HOODS run down a tiled corridor in the office section 
     of the complex. They're almost at the end of the hall when 
     a CAPED BLACK SHADOW steps into their path.

     It stands there, motionless. EXTENDS ITS ARMS -- like giant 
     WINGS -- revealing the yellow-and-black insigne on its 
     massive chest. BATMAN.

     One millisecond later, the shocked HOODS are racing back in 
     the opposite direction.

     THE BATMAN flings a handful of STEEL BALL-BEARINGS across 
     the tiled floor. HOOD I tumbles to the floor and lands 
     hard, losing his breath. HOOD II rolls and pulls a GUN.

     BATMAN hurls a BOOMERANG -- its edges scalloped, like a 
     bat's wing. HOOD II finds his gun hand PINNED TO THE WALL 
     by the twin prongs of the BATARANG.

     THE BATMAN strides briskly toward them, businesslike, 
     taking his time. He grabs a handful of HOOD I's hair, lifts 
     his head off the floor, KNEES HIM IN THE FACE.

     He turns to the petrified HOOD II. CHROME-STEEL TALONS 
     spring out of his fingertips. He strolls past HOOD II,
     reaching out casually to give him a QUICK NICK on the chin.

     HOOD II slumps against the wall, unconscious.

     ANGLE ON JACK

     down on the floor, racing along a wall, THROWING SWITCHES 
     -- anything to create a diversion. With every switch he 
     throws, ANOTHER GIGANTIC MACHINE roars to life. CENTRIFUGES 
     SPIN. HUGE POLYMER EXTRUDERS spit out thick strands of 
     plastic gunk. OVERHEAD CHEMICAL TANKS rotate into place 
     over giant basins.

     JACK SEES a squad of COPS on his tail, moving from machine 
     to machine, keeping covered. He SHOOTS AND RUNS.

     ANGLE ON CATWALKS

     BLASTING AWAY, HOODS III and IV scuttle across the elevated 
     walkways, keeping down, avoiding police fire. One of them 
     starts up a vertical ladder leading to the next catwalk up.

     BATMAN plunges past on the end of a rope. A BLACK-GLOVED 
     HAND snatches at HOOD III's collar as he climbs and YANKS 
     HIM CLEANLY OFF THE LADDER. They drop to the lower catwalk.

     HOOD IV gapes. He LEVELS HIS GUN at BATMAN, who stands his 
     ground, holding onto the rails of the catwalk for support. 
     A bullet hits him squarely in the chest. He does not fall.

     HOOD IV turns and scrambles. BATMAN goes to his belt for a 
     miniature SPEAR GUN. He points it at HOOD IV and FIRES... 
     planting a BARBED HOOK in the HOOD'S LEG.

     ANGLE ON COPS

     staring up in utter disbelief at the action on the catwalk.

                              COP
               LOOK!

                              GORDON
               My God... it's him.

     ANGLE ON CATWALK

     HOOD III, on his feet now, charges BATMAN from behind. 
     BATMAN -- not even turning to face him -- DROPS HOOD III 
     with an ELBOW. Now he has a HOOD on either side.

     He takes a STEEL BILLY CLUB from his belt, whips it once 
     through the air. It telescopes out into a FOUR-FOOT STAFF.

     Like a drum majorette from hell, he WHIRLS THE STAFF as the 
     HOODS CONVERGE on him. HOOD III takes a debilitating JAB 
     UNDER THE JAW. BATMAN SPINS on his heels and SLAMS THE 
     STAFF into HOOD IV's BACK -- knocking him OFF THE CATWALK 
     to the factory floor forty feet below!

     INT. ACE LOADING BAY - THAT MOMENT

     JACK spots a possible out. He hits a button on the wall; 
     STEEL DOORS RISE to reveal ACE CARGO TRUCKS in the parking 
     lot outside. Beyond the trucks... AN ARMY OF COPS waiting 
     for JACK to make his move.

     No go. He turns. Behind him, other cops -- the inside team 
     -- are rushing at him in full riot gear. JACK ducks behind 
     a forklift and darts into the adjacent room.

     INT. CHEMICAL SUPPLY ROOM - A MOMENT LATER

     JACK sprints through the room, firing FOUR SHOTS at the 
     metal CHEMICAL TANKS on the wall. TOXIC CHEMICALS gush out 
     onto the floor in streams. The streams run together... 
     begin to SMOKE and SIZZLE.

     COPS RIGHT BEHIND HIM. JACK can't resist taking one last 
     pot-shot at a FIFTH CHEMICAL TANK.

     AN EXPLOSION knocks him off his feet.

     INT. FACTORY FLOOR - A MOMENT LATER

     COPS LOOK ON IN PUZZLEMENT as a RIVER OF CHEMICALS courses 
     out into the main refinery. A second later, they go UP IN 
     FLAMES. A WALL OF FIRE bisects the factory floor.

     JACK RACES ALONG behind the spreading wall of flame. The 
     cops can't see him now. He ducks behind a huge machine, 
     hits a switch -- and SLUICE GATES OPEN. CHEMICAL SLUDGE 
     begins to churn. A big HOLE IN THE WALL appears as a gate 
     opens on the East River. It's the waste dump!

     Up on the catwalk, BATMAN has a perfect view of JACK. If 
     JACK can just sprint through the flames without getting 
     shot, he'll make it to the river. BATMAN hooks a rope to 
     his Batarang, FLINGS IT at a catwalk across the floor.

     JACK bolts. BURSTS THROUGH the wall of fire. And just as he 
     does --

     BATMAN leaps off the catwalk and swings down toward him! 
     His foot catches a THIRTY-FOOT ROLL of plastic, six feet in 
     diameter, one of several standing upright on the floor. The 
     plastic roll DROPS into JACK's path, BLOCKING HIS EXIT.

     An instant later, BATMAN lands on top of JACK. Wraps an arm 
     around his throat and RAISES his free hand. DRUG-TIPPED 
     STEEL TALONS appear. But before he can paralyze JACK... 

                              VOICE
               HOLD IT!

     In all the ruckus, HOOD V has managed to circle back behind 
     the heavy machinery. Now he's got a GUN pointed DIRECTLY AT 
     COMMISSIONER GORDON'S HEAD.

                              HOOD V
               Let him go or I'll do it.

     BATMAN releases JACK and stands back. JACK chuckles to 
     himself: what loyalty. Then, with plenty of time, he 
     strolls across the floor to a Jacob's ladder mounted on the 
     back wall... and BEGINS TO CLIMB toward the catwalks.

     All action stops. BATMAN doesn't move. The COPS don't move. 
     HOOD V stands there sweating, his gun hand shaking as he 
     waits for JACK to climb safely out of shooting range.

     ECKHARDT's pig-like eyes glisten. His hand drops to his 
     side. He's half-tempted to pull a gun and get the 
     Commissioner plugged.

     ANGLE ON JACK

     at a crouch, groping his way along the rail of the catwalk. 
     He reaches a paneled glass window propped open by a 
     supporting rod. It's a forty-foot drop to the swirling 
     black currents of the East River... and freedom.

     He's about to climb out when his eye falls on a .38 
     AUTOMATIC -- which lies, abandoned, on the gridwork floor 
     of the catwalk mere yards away.

     ANGLE ON FACTORY FLOOR

     The HOOD, one arm around GORDON. With his gun at the 
     Commissioner's temple, he backs slowly toward the door.

                              HOOD V
               Nobody makes a move. We go out
               clean.

                              JACK'S VOICE
               ECKHARDT!!

     ALL EYES TURN to the catwalk overhead, where JACK stands 
     poised with the .38 in his fist. A SINGLE SHOT drops 
     ECKHARDT cleanly.

     The moment's distraction is all BATMAN needs. He hurls a 
     NINJA WHEEL -- a small, ratcheted, razor-sharp disc -- at 
     the FOREARM of HOOD V. One jerk of a thin filament WIRE -- 
     a sudden SHRIEK -- and GORDON IS FREE.

     The THUG lurches forward. His GUN DROPS to the floor, 
     DISCHARGING ACCIDENTALLY.

     AN UNGODLY HOWL OF PAIN echoes out from the catwalk above. 
     JACK REELS and STAGGERS, his hands CLUTCHING AT HIS CHEEKS. 
     BLOOD GUSHES from between his fingers.

     JACK NAPIER HAS BEEN SHOT THROUGH THE FACE.

     A YOUNG COP, unnerved by the sight of JACK's agonized 
     pirouette, draws his gun and OPENS FIRE.

                              GORDON
               NO!!

     But the bullet has caught JACK in the arm. He spins, 
     totters to the edge of the catwalk... and TOPPLES OVER. The 
     COPS look on helplessly as JACK plunges TWO STORIES DOWN 
     into a CATCH BASIN full of BUBBLING TOXIC WASTE, SCREAMING 
     ALL THE WAY.

                              GORDON (cont.)
               Goddammit, we had him. We --

     And suddenly, with JACK out of the picture, all attention 
     focusses on THE BATMAN. COPS reach for their guns, circle 
     warily around him. Cornered now, he backs off slowly, HANDS 
     ON HIS BELT.

                              GORDON (cont.)
               Hold it right there, Mister.

     THE BATMAN raises his hands in a gesture of surrender. Then 
     -- as the COPS advance -- he flicks TWO TINY CAPSULES onto 
     the factory floor.

     A BLINDING FLASH OF LIGHT. COLORS BURST in a wild 
     pyrotechnic display. COPS stumble backwards, momentarily 
     dazzled, as a THICK WALL OF BLACK SMOKE conceals BATMAN 
     from view.

     A TINY GRAPPLING HOOK rockets out of the dense curling 
     cloud and CATCHES on a catwalk overhead.

                              COP
               LOOK!

     The COPS are firing wildly into the smoke. But it's too 
     late. At the end of a cord, THE BLACK MAJESTIC FIGURE OF 
     THE BATMAN whips upward, rising out of the smoke like an 
     avenging angel -- and DISAPPEARING into the shadowy 
     heights, safely out of range.

                              GORDON
               HOLD YOUR FIRE!

                              COP
               ... Who is this guy?

                              GORDON
               I don't know, but he's one hell of a
               showman.

                                                 CUT TO:

     EXT. ACE CHEMICAL CO. - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT

     A BLACK SHADOW scurries across the roof. From the 
     illuminated sign with its neon ace, WE PAN DOWN past the 
     chemical sluice to a SECOND ACE... a card from JACK's lucky 
     deck, pierced by a neat, round bullet hole, bobbing on the 
     oily surface of the foul, polluted river.

     As deadly toxins gush forth, OTHER CARDS from the deck 
     swirl past: a nine. A deuce. A queen. And finally, a JOKER 
     -- SHOT CLEANLY THROUGH THE FACE.

     A BONE-WHITE HAND BREAKS THE SURFACE as we

                                                 SHOCK CUT TO:

     INT. GOTHAM GLOBE - CITY ROOM - DAY

     A BANNER HEADLINE on the late edition of the Globe: "BAT 
     MAN FOILS ROBBERY. WHO IS MASKED VIGILANTE?"

     Behind the newspaper, feet propped up on his desk, is a 
     jubilant KNOX. He's on the horn to COMMISSIONER GORDON.

                              KNOX
               Commissioner. Do us both a favor.
               Don't tell me some lie you'll have
               to retract later.

     CLICK. KNOX grins, lowers the paper, finds himself looking 
     up at the smiling face of VICKI VALE.

                              KNOX (cont.)
               Vick! Looks like our friend the bat
               is getting ambitious. -- Why the
               dopey grin?

                              VICKI
               Guess who's got a date with Bruce
               Wayne.

                              KNOX
               Bruce Wayne? Date? He called you up
               and asked you for a date?... Shit.
                     (shouting)
               HEY MIRANDA! C'MERE!
                     (to VICKI)
               I want you to pay close attention to
               this. Miranda -- tell my friend here
               what you told me about Bruce Wayne.

     A SUPERANNUATED SOUTHERN BELLE toddles over. MIRANDA REITZ, 
     60, is the society editor of the Globe.

                              MIRANDA
               You mean Mister One-Nighter?

                              KNOX
               Yeah. "Mister One-Nighter."
                     (to VICKI)
               Because that's the average length of
               his relationships with women.

                              MIRANDA
               The current record is almost two
               weeks. That cover girl -- what's her
               name? You must've shot her, Vicki --

                              KNOX
               Tell her about the peanuts.

                              VICKI
               Peanuts?

                              KNOX
               Yeah. Peanuts. Which is how he goes
               through women.

                              MIRANDA
               Like Planter's Peanuts.

     VICKI is about to break out into helpless giggles.

                              VICKI
               Plain or roasted?
                     (standing up)
               Alex, I'm very flattered that you've
               gone out and done all this research.

                              KNOX
               Why?
                     (blushing suddenly)
               Aw, come on, Vicki, I'm a reporter.
               I'm curious. I do this for a living.
               -- What'd you tell him?

                              VICKI
               I told him yes.

     KNOX fumes. VICKI shakes her head and laughs. She takes 
     KNOX's face in her hands, plants a kiss on his forehead.

                              VICKI (cont.)
               You're awfully sweet to be
               concerned, but it's really not
               necessary. I'll call you, okay?

     She exits. KNOX stands there looking poleaxed.

                              KNOX
               ... What was that?

                              MIRANDA
               That was one of the most gracious
               fuck-yous it's ever been my pleasure
               to watch. -- What a nice girl.

     KNOX, totally flustered, sighs and sinks into his chair.

                              KNOX
               Miranda, I'm busy. Go be productive.

                                                 CUT TO:

     EXT. COASTLINE - DAY

     A CABIN CRUISER slices through the waves. In the distance, 
     closer to the shore, we see a throng of SAILBOATS.

     EXT. DECK - YACHT - DAY

     BRUCE's forty-foot cabin cruiser, aptly christened "DIE 
     FLEIDERMAUS." BRUCE and VICKI are on the deck, in chairs, 
     soaking up sun, gazing off at the sailboats.

                              VICKI
               Do you sail?

                              BRUCE
               Too much work. I'm not really the
               physical type. -- Thank you, Alfred.

     ALFRED has just appeared from belowdecks with a tray of 
     drinks for BRUCE and VICKI. VICKI watches as BRUCE reaches 
     for his glass. His forearm looks like a thin layer of skin 
     over braided telephone cables.

                              VICKI
               You do a very convincing imitation.
                     (sipping her drink)
               Mm, this is tasty. What's yours?

     He smiles, slides the drink over toward her, gestures for 
     her to try a sip.

                              VICKI (cont.)
               ... Ginger ale?

                              BRUCE
               Two drinks and I start swinging from
               the rooftops.
                     (beat)
               Tell me, Vicki. There's something
               I'm very curious about. What took
               you down to Corto Maltese?

                              VICKI
               ... I guess I needed a change.

                              BRUCE
               You were one of the most successful
               magazine photographers in the city.
               Everyone wanted you.

                              VICKI
               Have you ever been to Corto Maltese?

                              BRUCE
               Not since the shooting started.

                              VICKI
               We went there once when I was
               little. I played on the beach. And
               at nights -- they had a band -- I
               danced with my father on the hotel
               patio.
                     (shrugging)
               That was Corto Maltese. When the war
               broke out I had to go back. And I
               promised myself that this time... I
               wouldn't look away.

                              BRUCE
               What did you see?

                              VICKI
               ... Terror.

     The conversation is getting rather intense -- at both ends. 
     VICKI seems to have hit some weird chord within BRUCE.

                              BRUCE
               There's terror everywhere. Some
               types are just more -- familiar
               than others.

     For a moment BRUCE seems to be drifting back into his 
     familiar 'preoccupied' mode. VICKI laughs apologetically.

                              VICKI
               I'm sorry. I didn't mean to -- I
               know it all seems a million miles
               away, out here on the water, with
               all this --

                              BRUCE
               Insulation?

     VICKI is momentarily stuck for a reply. In some way she 
     can't quite grasp, he seems to be challenging her.

                              VICKI
               Bruce, really, when I say these
               things I don't mean to criticize
               you.

                              BRUCE
               I think you see things very clearly.

                              VICKI
               I'm happy to talk about something
               else. I don't want to be depressing.

                              BRUCE
                     (smiling)
               Do you assume that if I know you
               better I won't like you as much?

     VICKI starts laughing. BRUCE is a notorious womanizer, but 
     if this is a come-on, it's like no come-on she's ever seen.

                              VICKI
               I'm sorry, Bruce, I have to ask. Are
               you like this with the other women
               you know? -- Because I just can't
               seem to get a handle on this
               conversation.

                              BRUCE
                     (taking her hand)
               Vicki, if I say anything cryptic, or...
               ambiguous, I think you should put
               the most flattering possible
               interpretation on it. Because even
               if it doesn't sound that way... 
               that's how I'll mean it.

     Bingo. The guy's a chessplayer, but on the other hand he's 
     also rather touchingly, almost childishly, sincere. Before 
     she knows it, VICKI finds herself melting.

     INT. GOTHAM CITY OPERA HOUSE - NIGHT

     Rigoletto. THE DUKE onstage, launching into his big 
     crowd-pleaser, "La Donna e Mobile."

     WE PAN THE AUDIENCE, finding several mobile young DONNAS in 
     the crowd -- drop-dead beauties in slinky gowns. Although 
     most eyes are fixed, reasonably enough, on the stage, DONNA 
     #1 is staring with undisguised envy at a PRIVATE BOX above 
     the orchestra seats. Her mouth twists in disgust.

     She scans the crowd, finds her counterpart (DONNA #2) some 
     rows back, on the arm of a bald bigwig. DONNA #2 is wearing 
     a similar sour expression, staring up at the same box.

     DONNA #3 is even less discreet than her comrades. She has 
     her opera glasses trained on the couple in the box.

     HER POV - THROUGH OPERA GLASSES - THE BOX

     BRUCE and VICKI. He whispers in her ear. She smiles and 
     whispers back.

     A beat. He whispers again. This time she doesn't laugh. But 
     her lips part slightly. SCREEN GOES BLACK as the opera 
     glasses SNAP SHUT.

     ANGLE ON CROWD - DONNA #3

     staring icily at the DUKE as he finishes up to a round of 
     TUMULTUOUS APPLAUSE.

     INT. WAYNE MANOR - NIGHT

     BRUCE and VICKI enter. He takes her coat, drops it on a 
     chair by the door. VICKI is giddy, all champagned up.

                              VICKI
               -- but it's not fair. I'm half
               drunk and you're not even --

                              BRUCE
               Would you like me to take you home?

                              VICKI
               God. You would.
                     (sidling up to him)
               Come on, Bruce. I just want to get
               two drinks in you. As an
               experiment.

                              BRUCE
               Maybe we should just kiss.

                              VICKI
               ... We could try that.

     WIDER ANGLE

     BRUCE embracing VICKI in the vastness of the darkened entry 
     hall, framed by long semicircular STAIRWAYS on opposite 
     walls. A SUDDEN FLASH OF LIGHTNING transports us to:

     EXT. OFFICE BUILDING - ESTABLISHING - NIGHT

     Broken windows, graffiti on the walls: a decrepit rathole 
     near the Gotham docks.

     INT. DOCTOR'S OFFICE - NIGHT

     TIGHT ON a face swathed in bandages. The patient sits erect 
     in a wooden chair, surrounded by the grimy paraphernalia of 
     an unlicensed gangland doctor.

     The DOCTOR, a nervous little ferret with the bedside manner 
     of a back-alley abortionist, steps up with a scissors.

                              DOCTOR
               Well, Mr. Napier, let's see how we
               did.

     He begins to snip away. As the bandages come off, we get:

     JACK NAPIER'S POV

     The last strands of gauze peel away. The DOCTOR stands 
     there, looking at his handiwork. His mouth falls open. His 
     eyes bug out. He GAGS.

                              JACK (V.O.)
               Mirror.

     The DOCTOR just stands there staring AT CAMERA, stock-
     still, apparently transfixed by the sight of JACK's face.

                              JACK (V.O.)
               Mirror.

     ANGLE ON DOCTOR

     He clears his throat, reaches apprehensively for a hand 
     mirror, and passes it out of frame to JACK. Two beats. 
     Then, the sound of GLASS SHATTERING as the mirror drops to 
     the floor.

     JACK begins to laugh. THE DOCTOR gets a little edgy.

                              DOCTOR
               You understand the facial muscles
               were completely severed --

     JACK keeps on laughing.

     The DOCTOR turns uneasily away, gestures apologetically at 
     his seedy equipment.

                              DOCTOR (cont.)
               -- you can see what I have to work
               with here --

     MORE LAUGHTER. The trembling DOCTOR covers his face with 
     one hand, whining now, not daring to look at JACK.

                              DOCTOR (cont.)
               I'm sure that with proper recon--
               recon-- reconstructive surgery --

     A DOOR SLAMS. JACK is gone. The grateful DOCTOR breathes a 
     sigh of relief and steadies himself on an operating table.

     EXT. OFFICE BUILDING - OVERHEAD ANGLE - NIGHT

     From a point high above we see JACK emerging into the 
     alley, pulling on a hat, wrapping a muffler about his head. 
     We can't see his face. But we can't forget his LAUGH.

                                                 CUT TO:

     INT. BRUCE WAYNE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

     VICKI nestled peacefully under the covers. Beside her is 
     BRUCE: hands behind his head, staring up at the ceiling.

     It's almost as though BRUCE is not used to sleeping at 
     night. He doesn't know what to do with himself.

     He looks at VICKI. She's terribly lovely. But despite all 
     that, we can't shake the feeling that BRUCE... would really 
     rather be somewhere else.

                                                 CUT TO:

     EXT. STREET - NIGHT

     LOUD MUSIC. KIDS in punk regalia stand outside a rock club 
     as JACK stalks past. The wind knocks his hat off.

                              KID
                    Nice hair, dude!

     JACK ignores them as he bends to retrieve his hat. Then he 
     gazes up at the steel-and-glass facade of a SKYSCRAPER -- 
     and strides deliberately across the street.

     INT. GRISSOM'S PENTHOUSE - NIGHT

     The spectacular Gotham skyline, seen through the plate-
     glass window of GRISSOM's conference room. The doors to the 
     private elevator hiss open and JACK wanders in. He plops in 
     the big plush swivel chair behind GRISSOM's desk.

                              GRISSOM (O.S.)
               That you, sugar bumps?

     GRISSOM waddles in unsuspectingly from the adjoining room. 
     He's fresh out of the shower, a towel wrapped around his 
     impressive girth. He's using a smaller towel to dry his 
     hair, and so it's a moment before he sees the bundled-up 
     figure at his desk.

                              GRISSOM (cont.)
               Who the hell are you?

                              JACK
               It's me. "Sugar Bumps."

                              GRISSOM
                     (recognizing his voice)
               Jack?
                     (advancing cautiously)
               Thank God. I can't believe it's you.
               I heard you'd been --

                              JACK
                     (standing up)
               Is that what you "heard"?

     JACK gestures him over to the empty chair. GRISSOM doesn't 
     move until he sees the GUN pointed at his belly.

                              JACK (cont.)
               YOU SET ME UP!
                     (beat)
               Over a girl. You must be insane!

     GRISSOM surreptitiously reaches for a desk drawer.

                              JACK (cont.)
               Keep your hands on the desk.

                              GRISSOM
               Sooner or later you would've tried
               to take me, Jack. You may get me
               now, but your life won't be worth a
               dime.

                              JACK
               I've died once already. It wasn't so
               bad. -- In fact I recommend it.

     GRISSOM is beginning to panic now. It's obvious that JACK 
     is utterly, hopelessly deranged.

                              GRISSOM
               Jack, listen -- we'll cut a deal --

                              JACK
               JACK? JACK? DO I LOOK LIKE A JACK??

     And now, for the first time, he flings away the hat. RIPS 
     THE MUFFLER from his face. And -- as GRISSOM gasps in shock 
     -- STANDS REVEALED in his full horrendous glory.

     His flesh is bleached bone-white. His hair is a luminous 
     seaweed-green. And his cheeks are torn and puckered from 
     the bullet wound, TWISTING HIS MOUTH INTO A HIDEOUS, 
     PERPETUAL HARLEQUIN'S GRIN.

                              JACK (cont.)
               I'm not a Jack any more.
                     (pause; cackling)
               You made me a Joker!

     THE CACKLE BUILDS INTO FURIOUS, HYSTERICAL LAUGHTER. 
     GRISSOM, revulsed, terrified, pushes himself away from the 
     desk, back toward the window which overlooks the city.

                              GRISSOM
               Jack -- I'm warning you. WIPE THAT
               LUNATIC GRIN OFF YOUR FACE.

                              JACK
               HA! That's the best part. I CAN'T!!

     And with that JACK pulls the trigger. And fires. And fires 
     again until the CLIP IS EMPTY.

     EXT. GRISSOM'S BUILDING - NIGHT

     We TILT UP the chrome-and-glass facade of the skyscraper, 
     arriving finally at the TOP FLOOR: a PLATE GLASS WINDOW 
     spiderwebbed with cracks where Jack's bullets hit.

     INT. GRISSOM'S PENTHOUSE - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT

     The room is still dark. JACK -- or, as we'll know him from 
     this moment on, THE JOKER -- sits in GRISSOM's swivel 
     chair, staring out at the moon-drenched skyline.

                              JOKER
               What a view. Our little city. It
               always brings a smile to my face.

     He reaches for a nearby glass of liquor and glances down at 
     GRISSOM -- who lies dead on the floor, the towel still 
     wrapped around him. THE JOKER laughs softly to himself.

                              JOKER (cont.)
               Guess it's my little city now.
               Wonder what it'll look like when I
               get done with it.
                     (pause)
               I bet it'll be something real fine.
               Real fine and pretty.

     INT. BRUCE WAYNE'S BEDROOM - MORNING

     The sun is just up, and VICKI finds herself alone in bed. A 
     SOFT, OFF-KEY BARITONE VOICE drifts out of the adjacent 
     bathroom: BRUCE in the shower, singing "Honeysuckle Rose."

     She breaks into a huge smile and climbs out of bed. Somehow 
     she's wound up wearing BRUCE's ribbed formal shirt.

     INT. BATHROOM - A MOMENT LATER - MORNING

     BRUCE in his opulent deco shower stall, still SINGING to 
     himself. VICKI sneaks up behind him, opens the door. He 
     instantly STOPS SINGING -- as if he's been hit by a brick.

                              VICKI
               I didn't mean to scare you. I just
               had to come in here and see it that
               was really you singing.

     She smiles, teasing him. He doesn't respond. He acts as if 
     she's caught him doing something shameful -- exposed him.

                              VICKI (cont.)
                     (singing)
               "Don't buy sugar -- you just have to
               touch my cup." Come on. "You're my
               sugar --"
                     (no response from BRUCE)
               Bruce, you are such a case.

     BRUCE seems somehow unable to sing along. But be quickly 
     recovers his composure -- and forces a crooked, almost 
     childish smile.

                              BRUCE
               I don't sing very well.

                              VICKI
               Then there's one thing in the world
               you don't do very well. And I know
               what it is. -- Now you'll have to
               kill me.

     He kisses her good morning, steps out and reaches for a 
     towel. His body is one big mass of BRUISES AND ABRASIONS.

                              VICKI (cont.)
               Poor thing. You should stay off that
               horse.

     INT. GLOBE - CITY ROOM - DAY

     KNOX, in a surly mood, examines the morning edition of the 
     Globe. He's turned to page six -- the gossip page -- and 
     there, under Miranda Reitz's byline, is a picture of VICKI. 
     It seems she and BRUCE are the talk of the town.

                              KNOX
                     (disgusted)
               ...Peanut.

     A COPY BOY approaches his desk with a MANILA FOLDER:

                              COPY BOY
               Here's that morgue file you wanted.

     KNOX leans back in his chair. The file is labelled "BRUCE 
     WAYNE: 1982-1987."  KNOX opens it and begins to leaf 
     through old clippings from back issues of the Globe.

     WAYNE FOUNDATION TO FUND LOW-COST HOUSING. MILLIONAIRE 
     HEADS CHARITY DRIVE FOR GOTHAM HANDICAPPED. HURRICANE 
     VICTIMS SAY 'THANK YOU' TO BRUCE WAYNE. KNOX's face sags in 
     dismay. Every article seems to be telling us just how swell 
     a rich philanthropist can be.

                              KNOX
               Come on. Gimme some dirt!

     Then he notices something odd. In the whole fat file of 
     clippings, there are no pictures of Bruce Wayne -- with two 
     partial exceptions.

     One is a group shot, Bruce in the middle, waving at the 
     camera and blocking our view of his face. The other is an 
     ancient picture of a collegiate Bruce, stern-faced, hair 
     down to his collar. The caption reads "BRUCE WAYNE IN 
     1973" -- years out of date even when it ran in the paper.

                              KNOX (cont.)
               ... Why don't you like your picture
               taken?

     INT. APARTMENT LOBBY - NIGHT

     A DOORMAN DOZES in the plush lobby of ALICIA HUNT's 
     apartment building on the East Side of Gotham. Through the 
     glass doors we see ALICIA outside in the chill wind, 
     peering inside, hesitant to enter.

     As silently as possible she uses her key and steps in, 
     tiptoeing past the doorman, trying not to wake him. She's 
     almost made it when he SITS BOLT UPRIGHT, startling her.

                              DOORMAN
               Miss Hunt!
                     (smiling)
               No need to sneak in. The rent's been
               taken care of.

                              ALICIA
               ... The rent? Paid?

     INT. ALICIA'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

     ALICIA, mystified, lets herself in and turns to lock the 
     door. She's startled once more by a VOICE FROM BEHIND.

                              VOICE
               Honey -- I'm home!

     She pivots. Her eyes widen. She SHRIEKS.

     Sitting cross-legged in an easy chair, a twisted grin on 
     his loathesome face, is THE JOKER. He's in a smoking jacket 
     and slippers, reading the paper, a dry martini at his side.

     This grim parody of domesticity sends poor ALICIA into a 
     dead faint.

     INT. PENTHOUSE SUITE - DAY

     It looks for all the world like a corporate boardroom. At a 
     long table sit Gotham's most distinguished criminals: 
     GANGLORDS and RACKETS BOSSES from every corner of the city. 
     They stare suspiciously at the head of the table.

                              JOKER (O.S.)
               So that's how it is, gents. Until
               Grissom decides it's safe to come up
               for air... I'm running the show.

     Now we see what they see: THE JOKER, dressed rather 
     flamboyantly in a big slouch hat. His FACE is layered with 
     flesh-toned makeup, and his HAIR's been rinsed black.

     Unfortunately, he can't conceal his ghoulish SMILE.

                              GANG BOSS
               So why don't we hear this from
               Grissom?

                              RACKETEER
               I got something I'd like to know.
               How come you're wearing that stupid
               smirk?

                              JOKER
               'Cause I got an army, chum. And I
               got Grissom's army. And this city
               is mine.

     CARMINE ROTELLI, an especially oily mobster, speaks up:

                              ROTELLI
               I don't like taking orders, from
               Grissom. And I especially don't like
               taking orders from Grissom's goon.

                              JOKER
               I've considered that possibility.

                              ROTELLI
               And what happens if we say no?

                              JOKER
                     (chuckling)
               Nobody wants a war, Carmine. If we
               can't do business, we shake hands
               and part friends.

                              ROTELLI
               That's it?

                              JOKER
               That's it.

     THE JOKER extends a hand. ROTELLI reaches out to shake it. 
     He doesn't see the JOY BUZZER concealed in the JOKER's 
     palm.

     40,000 VOLTS course through ROTELLI's body. He drops back 
     into his seat a blackened husk, SMOKE pouring out from his 
     sleeves and shirt collar.

     The CRIMELORDS recoil in horror. Before they can make a 
     move, a squad of ARMED THUGS burst into the room.

                              JOKER (cont.)
               Looks like Carmine got a little hot
               under the collar.

                              CRIMELORD
               ... You're insane!

     The JOKER is a wee bit agitated. He removes the hat and 
     mops sweat from his brow, exposing a patch of CHALK-WHITE 
     FLESH -- to the great bewilderment of the ONLOOKERS.

                              JOKER
               That's what they said about Lee
               Iacocca. Now GET OUT OF HERE. -- And
               THINK IT OVER!

     The sickened CRIMINALS file out cautiously. That leaves THE 
     JOKER alone in the room with the charred corpse of ROTELLI. 
     THE JOKER sinks into a chair and -- as is his wont -- 
     ADDRESSES THE STIFF:

                              JOKER (cont.)
               Heck, they're not such bad guys. I
               say we give 'em a couple of days to
               come around.
                     (thoughtful pause)
               We-e-ll... maybe one day.
                     (then, casually)
               Aaah, screw it. Let's grease 'em.

                                                 CUT TO:

     INT. SMALL BACK ROOM - NIGHT

     A poker game. A CRIMELORD from the JOKER's board meeting 
     picks up his hand and fans out the cards. FIVE JOKERS.

     He looks up, puzzled. The last thing he sees is a HIRED 
     KILLER bursting in through the door, GUN IN HAND.

     EXT. GOTHAM PARK - DAY

     A COSTUMED CLOWN with a wheeled cart, filling balloons from 
     a helium tank, passing them out to the kids. CRIMELORD #2 
     strolls past. The CLOWN offers him a balloon, which be 
     politely refuses.

     THE CLOWN reaches into his cart for a RED METAL TANK. But, 
     as we quickly find out, it's not a helium tank -- it's a 
     FLAMETHROWER.

     EXT. HALLIDAY PLAZA - DAY

     A sunny, landscaped quad surrounded by corporate 
     skyscrapers: trees, grass, marble fountains, flags of many 
     nations. Amid the pedestrians we catch BRUCE and VICKI, all 
     smiles, cutting through the plaza on the way to lunch.

                              VICKI
               ... To tell you the truth, I'd just
               about given up waiting.

                              BRUCE
               I said I'd call you the minute I got
               free. And I did. -- And here we are.

                              VICKI
                     (teasing him)
               Hm hmm. Lunch. Not even dinner.

     He stops in his tracks, takes her by the shoulders.

                              BRUCE
               Vicki. Do you want the whole truth?
               All coyness aside?
                     (long pause)
               I wish I had more time to give you.
               Every day I don't see you, I miss
               you.
                     (beat)
               Now. Are you going to waste this
               lovely afternoon being all mad at
               me?

     All this, of course, is delivered with devastating 
     sincerity. VICKI finds herself totally disarmed.

                              VICKI
               Okay, I'm a sucker. You sound so
               much like someone I used to... 
                     (stopping suddenly)
               Bruce? I know this is silly, but --
               you're not married, are you?

     He stops and laughs. She smiles crookedly, takes his arm.

     ANOTHER ANGLE - ACROSS PLAZA - THAT MOMENT

     PHILLY RICORSO -- another CRIMELORD from the boardroom -- 
     enters the plaza flanked by a cadre of PAID BODYGUARDS.

     ON BRUCE AND VICKI

     A PAINTED STREET MIME walks alongside them, feeling his way 
     along an imaginary wall. VICKI groans.

                              VICKI
               All street mimes should be executed.

                              BRUCE
               ... Looks like a convention.

     And indeed, there are HALF A DOZEN STREET MIMES converging 
     on the center of the plaza.

     RICORSO and co. approach the mirrored-glass entrance of a 
     skyscraper. In the lobby, A MIME -- who's been annoying the 
     passersby -- THROWS A BOLT, LOCKING THE DOORS from inside.

     A BODYGUARD bangs on the glass. Nearby, ANOTHER MIME 
     reaches into a trash bin -- and pulls out a MACHINE GUN.

     SUDDEN SCREAMS OF TERROR from the onlookers.

     VICKI turns to BRUCE. Before she can get his name out, he's 
     HOISTED HER BODILY and THROWN HER behind a marble fountain.

     SERIES OF SHOTS

     BRUCE'S EYES darting birdlike around the plaza -- INTERCUT 
     with the following POV SHOTS, ALL IN SLOW MOTION:

     -    TWO MIMES with machine guns. One of them lining PHILLY 
          and co. up against the glass doors, the other holding 
          the CROWD at bay;

     -    A WOMAN in the crowd fainting. A THIRD MIME gleefully 
          imitating her swoon, to no one's amusement;

     -    PHILLY and his goons, COWERING, hands in the air, as 
          OTHER MIMES cruelly mimic their terrified poses... 

     ... and suddenly BRUCE is RUNNING FRANTICALLY, looking for 
     a secluded spot, an alleyway, anything. No go. He's out in 
     the open, with onlookers everywhere. In his civvies, he's 
     just another citizen... TOTALLY IMPOTENT.

     He darts around a corner, backs against a wall. WOMEN, 
     CHILDREN, GROWN MEN race past. No privacy. He's 
     practically quaking now, in the throes of some terrible 
     anxiety. He looks up at the sky overhead, terrified.

     A BRILLIANT SUN bears down on him as MACHINE GUNS CHATTER.

     ANGLE ON PHILLY AND BODYGUARDS

     BODIES JERKING as GLASS rains down in shards.

     ANGLE ON BRUCE

     his back arched, his mouth agape, his face drained of blood 
     as the sounds of carnage echo through the plaza. It's 
     almost as if the bullets are striking him.

     A moment later, it's all over but the screaming. VICKI 
     emerges from the crowd and finds BRUCE slumped against the 
     wall, nearly catatonic. She moves to touch him.

     As if by reflex he reaches out and GRABS HER BY THE ARMS -- 
     with a grip so strong it could crush bone. She GASPS, looks 
     up -- and sees, in his traumatized EYES, a look so raw, so 
     desperate, that it virtually defies comprehension.

                              VICKI
               BRUCE!!

     He blinks rapidly. He relaxes his grip. Before VICKI's 
     eyes, he's changing... becoming the BRUCE she knows.

                              BRUCE
               Oh my God... are you all right?

     He reaches for her. Involuntarily, she steps back.

     He sees her reaction and his face goes slack -- frightened, 
     pleading. This time she lets him embrace her... but her 
     face is full of bewilderment and doubt.

     INSERT - TELEVISION SCREEN

                              ANCHORWOMAN
               ... live from Halliday Plaza, where a
               gangland-style execution claimed the
               life of racketeer Philly Ricorso.
               Ricorso's death is the third in a
               rash of underworld killings... 

     CUT TO TWO-SHOT: the ANCHORWOMAN and COMMISSIONER GORDON.

                              ANCHORWOMAN (cont.)
               Commissioner, you've heard the
               rumors. Are these murders the work
               of the mysterious 'Batman'?

     A PIERCING CACKLE fills the air. CAMERA PULLS BACK from the 
     TV, placing us in the JOKER's boardroom. Behind the big 
     desk he SWIVELS INTO VIEW, phone in hand.

                              JOKER
               All reet! I think it's about time
               we called another meeting, huh?

                                                 CUT TO:

     INT. WAYNE MANOR - DAY

     ALFRED on the phone, a feather duster in his hand.

                              ALFRED
               I'm sorry, Miss Vale. I've given him
               your messages. That's all I can do.

     ANGLE WIDENS. BRUCE is sitting mere feet away, obviously 
     distraught, locked in some sort of internal struggle.

     INT. VICKI'S APARTMENT - THAT MOMENT - DAY

                              VICKI
               Please tell him... I'm not trying to
               make his life difficult. I'd just --
               I'd just like to know what's going
               on.

     A KNOCK at the door as VICKI hangs up. She goes to open it, 
     finds KNOX -- wearing a big, cheshire-cat smile.

                              KNOX
               Hiya, peanut. I got something I'd
               like you to see.

     INT. LIBRARY - DAY

     A MICROFILM MACHINE. As VICKI looks on curiously, KNOX -- 
     all eagerness now -- threads up a roll of film and begins 
     cranking through back-issue newspapers.

                              KNOX
               Okay, here we go. Check it out.

     He steps back. VICKI stares down at the display screen. A 
     FRONT-PAGE BANNER HEADLINE reads:

                      THOMAS WAYNE MURDERED
            Prominent Doctor, Wife Slain in Robbery
            Unidentified Gunman Leaves Child Unharmed

     Beneath it, a PHOTO: cops kneeling over corpses. Medics 
     with stretchers. And off to one side, a YOUNG BOY -- BRUCE 
     WAYNE -- his arms wrapped around the waist of a BEAT COP.

     The BOY stares straight at the camera. His face is a mask 
     of UNFORGETTABLE AGONY. You can't take your eyes off it.

                              VICKI
               Oh my God... I've seen this picture.

                              KNOX
               I guess so. Pulitzer Prize, 1963.

                              VICKI
               His face. Allie, look at his face.

     TIGHT ON THE BOY'S contorted face, staring out in shock and 
     disbelief, his features recognizable across all the years 
     -- permanently, indelibly traumatized. The same face VICKI
     saw in Halliday Plaza.

                              KNOX
               Yep. He watched the whole thing
               happen. -- Recognize the beat cop?
               Jim Gordon.

                              VICKI
               Oh, Bruce... 

                              KNOX
               Something like this -- what do you
               suppose this could drive a guy to?

     INT. RESTAURANT - DAY

     A greasy spoon off the lobby of the Globe building. KNOX
     and VICKI in a booth.

                              VICKI
               Alexander, you are on drugs.

                              KNOX
               He walks out on his own party. Half
               an hour later, the Caped Crusader
               turns up in full bat-drag.
                     (beat)
               Sees an execution, freaks out in an
               alleyway. No place to change.
                     (smiling)
               Yeah, Vicki, he's "married" all
               right.

                              VICKI
               You're pissing me off, Allie. I know
               exactly why you're doing this.

                              KNOX
                     (leaning forward)
               Oh? Why is that, Vicki?

     VICKI wilts under the challenge. She holds her silence for 
     a second, then changes the subject.

                              VICKI
               He's best friends with Jim Gordon
               and Harvey Dent. They would know.

                              KNOX
               ... Okay, Vicki, I have a confession
               to make. I'm the Batman.

     VICKI snorts, rolls her eyes impatiently.

                              KNOX (cont.)
               Don't believe me? Why not?

                              VICKI
               Alexander... I know you.

                              KNOX
               Right. And they know him. And
               that's why it would never occur to
               them for a minute that their old
               buddy Bruce puts on a cape at night
               and goes out looking for --

                              VICKI
               This is pointless. I'm leaving.

                              KNOX
                     (grabbing her arm)
               Your little chum is out of his mind.
                     (relaxing his grip)
               Next time you call him up and he
               can't go out Friday night -- think
               it over.

                                                 CUT TO:

     INT. ACE CHEMICAL CO. - DAY

     LOW ANGLE on the JOKER. He stands on a catwalk high above 
     the refinery floor, lord of all he surveys, overseeing 
     production like a demented middle manager.

     INT. STOREROOM - DAY

     A dank, windowless room in the bowels of Ace Chemical, 
     which the JOKER has converted into a makeshift lair. SAP-
     LIKE GOO drips in puddles from exposed pipes overhead.

     CAMERA DRIFTS across the JOKER's cluttered desk. Shipping 
     manifests. Ledgers. PSYCHOTIC DOODLES scrawled in crayon.

     More significantly: an old CONTRACT dating back to the mid-
     seventies. It's half-obscured by other papers, but the 
     initials 'CIA' are plainly visible.

     Then: a BOUND REPORT with the title 'DDID NERVE GAS: 
     RESULTS OF PRELIMINARY EXPERIMENTATION.' Across its title 
     page, a diagonal rubber stamp: 'DISCONTINUED January 1977.'

     And finally: a sheaf of PHOTOS. Laboratory apes, chimps and
     orangutans, all DEAD. Their LIPS are drawn back, exposing 
     HIDEOUS, CHEMICAL-INDUCED GRIMACES.

     ON ONE WALL: POSTER-SIZED BLOWUPS of the grinning apes.

     ON THE OPPOSITE WALL: a large-scale photographic 
     reproduction of the Gotham City skyline, its bottom half 
     HIDDEN FROM VIEW by the JOKER's desk.

     The PHONE RINGS. The JOKER -- who has been sitting on the 
     floor by the cityscape -- POPS INTO FRAME and picks it up.

                              JOKER
               How's that first shipment coming?

                              VOICE ON PHONE
               Right on schedule. Oh, we got that
               address for you -- 79 East End,
               #12-C.

                              JOKER
               Mmm. How'd you find it?

                              VOICE ON PHONE
               Called her agent.

     The JOKER nods in satisfaction and resumes his place on the 
     floor. Like a happy kindergartener, with paste pot and 
     scissors, he's CLIPPING PHOTOS from a magazine -- horrible 
     scenes of death, destruction, panic, mutilation.

     One by one, he's PASTING these shots on the blowup of 
     Gotham city -- all along sidewalk level -- creating a 
     massive photomontage of ANARCHY IN THE STREETS.

     We've seen these photos before. VICKI VALE took them... in 
     Corto Maltese.

     INT. PHOTOGRAPHER'S STUDIO - DAY

     In foreground, ROWS OF MAKEUP in startling profusion: 
     mascara, blusher, eyeliner, lipstick. HALF A DOZEN 
     BEAUTIFUL MODELS giggle into their makeup mirrors.

     In the background VICKI wanders past with a stylish friend, 
     CLAIRE, who owns and operates the studio.

                              CLAIRE
               ... of course, after Corto Maltese,
               this must all seem pretty tame.

                              VICKI
               Not to me. I need a job.

                              CLAIRE
               Now Vicki. Everyone knows you've
               got your hooks in Bruce Wayne.

                              VICKI
               Then "everyone" must know something
               I don't.

                              CLAIRE
                     (cattily)
               Oh. Really. Well. -- Come on,
               dear, Tony's dying to see you.

     In a corner of the studio, TONY, a gaunt, tubercular Brit, 
     is shooting a swimsuit layout with two SUPERMODELS. They 
     all ad lib greetings to VICKI as TONY darts around 
     hyperkinetically, snapping the girls in a series of poses.

                              TONY
               Yes, ladies, smiles, show me
               those smiles, fabulous, tropical
               smiles, think Tahiti, I want to
               see teeth, yes, those glorious
               teeth --

     As VICKI looks on, the SUPERMODELS freeze in place 
     simultaneously, a strange, STRICKEN LOOK on their faces.

                              TONY (cont.)
               My God no, don't stop now, those
               smiles, I need those smiles --

     Suddenly the girls are LAUGHING -- but the laughter is 
     unnatural, involuntary. VICKI, sensing that something is 
     terribly wrong, lays a hand on CLAIRE's arm.

     The MODELS, now wearing HUGE SMILES, begin to TWITCH 
     SPASMODICALLY. TONY snaps away.

                              TONY (cont.)
               Yes! Oh baby, YES! That's --
                     (beat)
               No! Too far, too far! Pull back,
               pull back!
                     (dropping the camera)
               OH MY GOD!

     The SUPERMODELS PITCH TO THE FLOOR, shuddering 
     convulsively, their LIPS drawn back in FRIGHTFUL, FROZEN, 
     LAB-APE GRINS. VICKI GASPS. CLAIRE SCREAMS. TONY SCREAMS.

                                                 CUT TO:

     INT. TELEVISION STUDIO - EVENING

     The Eyewitness News set, with anchors PATSY NARITA and
     DAVE McELROY. Behind them, BLOWUPS of the two dead 
     SUPERMODELS.

                              PATSY
               The fashion world was stunned today
               by the sudden deaths of top models
               Kelly Brinkley and Christie Emberg.
               Cause of death has been attributed
               to a violent allergic reaction,
               although authorities have not yet
               ruled out the possibility of drug
               use. Dave?

     Behind DAVE, on the bluescreen: a HUGE STATUE, covered in 
     canvas -- not unlike New York's Statue of Liberty.

                              DAVE
               In Gotham, plans continue for the
               city's 300th birthday celebration.
               The four-day event will conclude
               with the unveiling, in Gotham
               Harbor, of the newly restored 'Lady
               Gotham'... 

     A TECHNICIAN'S HAND passes a slip of paper into frame.

                              DAVE (cont.)
               This bulletin just in. Nine more
               mysterious deaths at a beauty parlor
               in --

     Off to the left, PATSY begins to LAUGH. DAVE FROWNS.

                              DAVE (cont.)
               Patsy! This is hardly the --
                     (his eyes widen)
               PATSY!!

     An offscreen CRASH. Suddenly DAVE is up out of his seat, 
     mouth agape in horror.

     PATSY HAS GONE INTO CONVULSIONS. CAMERA WHIPS VIOLENTLY 
     RIGHT AND LEFT as she jerks out of her seat and TOTTERS 
     UNCONTROLLABLY across the set, LAUGHING INSANELY.

     TECHNICIANS rush the soundstage in an unrehearsed frenzy. 
     PATSY spins like a dervish and LURCHES BACKWARD over the 
     newsdesk in a death spasm, giving us a quick look at the
     grisly Joker's grin etched on her now-lifeless face.

     DAVE gestures frantically to the cameraman:

                              DAVE (cont.)
               KILL THE CAMERA!! KILL THE --

     Suddenly, CRACKLING VIDEO STATIC wipes out the screen. A 
     moment later, we're looking at:

     SPLITSCREEN CLOSEUP - THE SUPERMODELS

     Their gorgeous faces sprout BIG, ANIMATED-CARTOON GRINS as 
     a BOUNCY TUNE -- "Put on a Happy Face" -- comes up 
     underneath.

                              MODELS (CARTOON VOICE)
               ... Love that Joker!

     INT. SUPERMARKET - DAY

     THEME MUSIC CONTINUES as a grinning, deranged pitchman -- 
     THE JOKER -- pushes his shopping cart down the aisle. The 
     shelves are filled with products bearing his TRADEMARK 
     HARLEQUIN'S FACE. He waves merrily in time to the music.

     INT. STUDIO - VIDEO CONTROL BOOTH - THAT MOMENT

     PANICKED TECHNICIANS swarm the booth. The studio feed has 
     been JAMMED. Every monitor shows THE JOKER'S COMMERCIAL.

                              DIRECTOR
               WHERE'S IT COMING FROM??

                              TECHNICIAN
               I DON'T KNOW!

     CLOSEUP - THE JOKER

                              JOKER
               ... new improved Joker brand. With
               the secret ingredient... SMYLENOL!
                     (a sweep of the hand)
               Let's go to our blind taste test.

     TIGHT ON an anonymous MAN -- GAGGED AND BLINDFOLDED, tied 
     to his chair, squirming, struggling. On the table before 
     him is a package labelled "BRAND X." A SUPERIMPOSED TITLE 
     reads: "NOT AN ACTOR."

                              JOKER (cont.)
               Ooh. He's tense. Irritable. Out of
               sorts.
                     (wagging a finger)
               He's been using Brand X! But with
               new improved Joker brand... 

     ANGLE WIDENS to include a BLINDFOLDED CORPSE, limp in his 
     chair, GRINNING HORRIFICALLY.

                              JOKER (cont.)
               ... it's a SMILE EVERY TIME!!

     EXT. IDYLLIC PASTORAL SETTING - DAY

     THE JOKER in a field of wheat. On a picnic blanket before 
     him are TWO CLEAN-CUT MODELS -- one male, one female, BOTH 
     DEAD... and GRIMACING HORRIBLY.

                              JOKER (cont.)
               -- and the world smiles with you!
               Irresistable -- oh-so-kissable --

     He grabs the dead MODELS by the hair. THEIR TEETH CLINK as 
     he forces their heads together for a post-mortem kiss.

     SERIES OF SHOTS

     Television sets all over Gotham, as startled citizens react 
     to the JOKER's maniacal promo.

                              JOKER
               I know what you're saying. Where can
               I buy these fine, fine products?
               Well, that's the gag, folks, you
               never know. Chances are... you've
               bought 'em already!!!

     As his RANT CONTINUES, we SEE:

     -    A YOUNG MAN watching the bedroom TV as he dresses for 
          a date. He's got an aerosol deodorant can poised under 
          one arm, ready to spray. He looks down at the can, 
          suddenly uncertain. Could it be...?

     -    A FAMILY in their kitchen, eyeing a 12-inch portable 
          as MOM serves dinner. They dig in automatically, then 
          FREEZE with their forks in midair.

     -    A MIDDLE-AGED MATRON at the living-room TV. Shocked, 
          she calls to her husband -- and gets no reply. We 
          FOLLOW HER to the bathroom door.

          On the floor she sees AN OVERTURNED SHAMPOO BOTTLE. 
          Then: her HUSBAND, slumped down in the tub, a lethal 
          GRIN on his face. She lets out a SHRIEK.

     INT. WAYNE MANOR - STUDY - NIGHT

     ALFRED THE BUTLER in a crouch, glued to the tube.

                              ALFRED
               ... Sir!

     HIS POV: THE JOKER in tight closeup. Offscreen, an INFANT 
     begins to squall. THE JOKER cocks an eyebrow.

                              JOKER
               Baby's got a tummyache? Here's
               something that'll fix him quick!

     He tosses a JOKER PRODUCT out of frame. Then -- leering -- 
     he gives the camera a BIG JUICY WINK.

                              JOKER (cont.)
               Now on your grocer's shelf. So
               remember -- use Joker brand -- and
               put on a happy face!!

     MUSIC UP. VIDEO SNOW fills the screen as the jammed 
     transmission end. ALFRED looks over his shoulder.

     TRACK IN ON THE GRIM, DETERMINED FACE OF BRUCE WAYNE.

     -    The Gotham Globe cartwheeling into frame:

                         PANIC GRIPS GOTHAM
                Contaminated Products Claim 72 Lives
                WHO IS THE MYSTERIOUS "JOKER"?

     -    An ANCHORWOMAN on the evening news. Her complexion is 
          curiously sallow. BLACK BAGS show under her eyes.

                              ANCHORWOMAN
                  ... sixteen new deaths, with no clues
                  as to the Joker's identity or
                  demands. The list at potentially
                  lethal products now includes:
                  perfume -- mascara -- cold cream --

     -    The makeover counter at Bloomingdale's. SECURITY 
          GUARDS rush to the scene as THREE MATRONLY CUSTOMERS
          go into simultaneous smiling fits.

     -    An ANCHORMAN with a BIG UGLY ZIT on his nose:

                              ANCHORMAN
                  Men's cologne toothpaste mouthwash
                  -- underarm deodorant --

     -    A SUBWAY CAR jammed with STRAPHANGERS. HUGE PATCHES OF 
          SWEAT under every arm. The doors slide open; ONCOMING 
          PASSENGERS RECOIL VISIBLY at the unendurable stench.

     -    The original ANCHORWOMAN, whose look is now 100% 
          natural. Her hair is frizzy. Her eyebrows are missing 
          altogether. Every wrinkle on her face is plainly 
          visible.

                              ANCHORWOMAN
                  Hair spray -- eyebrow pencil --
                  moisturizing cream --

     -    A LARGE DRUGSTORE. CASHIERS sit idly by the registers. 
          The store is utterly devoid of customers.

                                                 CUT TO:

     EXT. STREET - DUSK

     From across the street we see VICKI headed down the 
     sidewalk toward a museum. A GLOVED HAND reaches for a pay 
     phone.

                              VOICE
               She's outside the Fluegelheim.

     INT. ALICIA HUNT'S PENTHOUSE - THAT MOMENT

     A BONE-WHITE HAND slams a phone receiver down. THE JOKER is 
     at his vanity. He's rinsed his hair black. He's applying 
     pounds of pancake makeup to his bleached face, his puckered 
     cheeks. In the right light he could almost pass for human.

     In all the city, he's the only person still using 
     cosmetics.

     A DREAMY, DRUGGED VOICE intrudes:

                              ALICIA
               Jack? Who was that?

     As he looks up at the mirror, we get a quick glimpse of 
     ALICIA behind him. The voice, the long blonde hair, are 
     unmistakable. But for some reason, ALICIA'S FACE is 
     COVERED... by a SHINY WHITE PORCELAIN DOLL'S MASK.

                              JOKER
               Get dressed. We're going out.

     INT. FLUEGELHEIM MUSEUM - EVENING

     A Gotham landmark, the Fluegelheim looks like something 
     Frank Lloyd Wright would've dreamed up -- a large open 
     atrium encircled by a stucco RAMP, which spirals up along 
     the interior walls to the CEILING four stories above. You 
     walk up this gently-inclined ramp to view the paintings.

     INT. FLUEGELHEIM - ROOFTOP TEA ROOM - EVENING

     The upper terminus of the ramp opens on an airy, fern-
     filled dining room popular with tourists and elderly 
     matrons who work up an appetite looking at art. VICKI 
     enters, camera bag slung over one shoulder, portfolio in 
     hand.

                              VICKI
               I'm meeting Mr. Wayne. Is he here?

                              MAITRE D'
               No, but your table is ready.

     INT. TEA ROOM - TWENTY MINUTES LATER - EVENING

     VICKI, sipping on a gin and tonic, checks her watch. A 
     WAITER brings her a small parcel, wrapped in brown paper, 
     bearing a single word: URGENT.

                              WAITER
               Miss Vale, this just arrived for
               you.

     As the WAITER leaves, she tears off the wrapper. Inside is 
     a small white box and a NOTE -- SCRIBBLED IN CRAYON.

               DEAR V. VALE,
                    PUT THIS ON RIGHT NOW.

     Unsigned, of course. VICKI, puzzled, opens the box to find 
     a MINIATURE GAS MASK.

     She hears a strange HISSING NOISE. A few feet away, GREEN 
     SMOKE is billowing out of an air-conditioning vent.

     TRAYS OF FOOD CRASH TO THE FLOOR as WAITERS pass out. ART 
     LOVERS drop forks, go face down in their pasta salad.

     VICKI hurriedly fits the gas mask over her nose and mouth. 
     Within seconds, she's the only one conscious in the room.

     INT. MUSEUM - THAT MOMENT

     GREEN SMOKE plumes up toward the ceiling as we TILT DOWN 
     toward the floor of the atrium. PATRONS and SECURITY GUARDS 
     lie sprawled on the floor, twisted at odd angles, out cold.

     The mist is beginning to clear now. The doors swing open 
     and in strolls THE JOKER, looking quite dapper in his
     street makeup and BIG PURPLE PIMP'S HAT.

     A SQUAD OF GOONS enters behind him. Some of them are 
     carrying large cartons. They lock the entry doors, place a 
     "CLOSED" sign in front of them, and begin uncrating LARGE 
     CANS OF BLACK PAINT.

     The JOKER steps up onto the ramp, examines the artwork with 
     an appreciative eye.

                              JOKER
               Okay, boys, let's broaden our minds.

     He stops in front of an Ingres odalisque. Stands back a 
     pace or two to get a better look. Then pulls out a STRAIGHT 
     RAZOR and cuts a LONG DIAGONAL GASH in the canvas.

     He ambles up the ramp, stepping over collapsed patrons, 
     pausing at every fourth or fifth painting. Monet water 
     lilies, a Degas ballerina -- all get the razor treatment. 
     Behind him his CRONIES work their way up the ramp, HEAVING 
     BLACK PAINT on every canvas the JOKER has missed.

     He cocks an eyebrow at Edvard Munch's "THE SCREAM."

                              JOKER (cont.)
               I kinda like this one. Leave it.

     INT. TEA ROOM - A MOMENT LATER - EVENING

     VICKI at her table, still wearing the gas mask, scared as 
     hell. The overhead lights wink out and the room goes dark. 
     The JOKER saunters over and pulls up a chair.

                              JOKER
               I think it's safe to take that off.

     VICKI recognizes the deranged smile instantly. She removes 
     the gas mask, tries to gather her wits.

                              JOKER (cont.)
               You're quite beautiful.

                              VICKI
               ... Thank you.

                              JOKER
               Unfortunate, but I think we can work
               around it.

     He sets a couple of CANDLESTICKS on the table and reaches 
     for his lighter. A LONG JET OF FLAME shoots out, Jerry 
     Lewis-style, as he lights the candles.

                              JOKER (cont.)
               You're Vicki Vale. I guess you know
               who I am. -- Is this your
               portfolio?

     She nods. He opens it, begins leafing through the record of 
     VICKI's career. Newspaper photos from the Globe, at first.
     Then fashion layouts, magazine covers of celebrities. 
     Artier B&W shots from VICKI's first couple of exhibitions.

                              JOKER (cont.)
               Crap. Crap. Crap, crap, crap... 
               Ahhh. Now here's what caught my eye.

     He's come to the COMBAT PHOTOS from Corto Maltese.

                              JOKER (cont.)
               The panic. The bloody skulls. The
               armless screaming fellows... you
               know, the atrocities.
                     (smirking)
               Somehow, when you shoot it, it all
               comes out so clean, so lovely.

     VICKI is squirming, but she doesn't think it wise to debate 
     the point. Not with this lunatic, anyway.

                              JOKER (cont.)
               I guess I'm just an old cornball,
               but... I live for beauty. I look
               around at my little city, it gets me
               down.
                     (indicating the photos)
               We don't have anything like this.
               Well, it came to me that what this
               city needs... is beautification. Kind
               of a big makeover.
                     (enraptured)
               Miss Vale, I finally realized that
               one man can make a difference. You
               know the saying. "In his image... 
               created he them"?

     VICKI gazes at the awful face of this deranged visionary, 
     getting more frightened by the minute.

                              VICKI
               And you want a --

                              JOKER
               A visual record, yes. A before-and-
               after kind of thing.
                     (leaning closer)
               This could make your reputation.

     Her first impulse is to get up and run. But she fights the 
     impulse. She won't run... not until she gets this maniac
     on film. She reaches for her camera bag.

                              VICKI
               Maybe we should start with a
               portrait of the artist. People might
               like to see the face behind the
               makeup.

                              JOKER
                     (momentarily puzzled)
               ... Behind the makeup?

     Then it sinks in. By candlelight, in the darkened 
     restaurant, with his pancake makeup and his black rinse 
     job, he looks practically normal. VICKI must think she's
     looking at his real face!

                              JOKER (cont.)
               Oh. Yes. I see what you mean.

     He finds a pitcher, pours a glass of water, and very 
     carefully SETS IT ON THE TABLE in front of VICKI. Then -- 
     suddenly, inexplicably -- HE BARKS AT HER:

                              JOKER (cont.)
               Silly little TWIT -- I can't take
               you ANYWHERE!

     He sits back and grins expectantly. VICKI is thoroughly 
     nonplussed by this bizarre outburst. A moment passes.

     He obviously wants her to do something, but she hasn't
     got a clue as to what it is. Growing impatient now, he 
     POINTS at the WATER GLASS:

                              JOKER (cont.)
               Well? What are you waiting for??

     Now VICKI gets the point. She picks up the glass and HURLS 
     ITS CONTENTS in THE JOKER'S FACE.

     His hands go up. He writhes. He shrieks -- like the Wicked 
     Witch of the West dissolving. He reaches for a napkin to 
     wipe his face clean... and begins to CACKLE.

     His awful white-and-green clown's face revealed behind the 
     running makeup, he LEERS at her.

                              JOKER (cont.)
               You see, Miss Vale -- that was my
               makeup.
                     (leaning forward)
               What do you think?

     VICKI is repulsed, but she's determined to tough it out.

                              VICKI
               I've seen worse. Much worse.

                              JOKER
               Strong stomach, huh? I like that in
               a woman. -- Maybe we can do business
               after all.

     He seems to have calmed down a bit. It's almost as if he's 
     coming on to her. But just then, a tiny BELL sounds behind 
     them... and a VOICE intrudes:

                              VOICE
               Jack?

     The JOKER turns. ALICIA steps out of a ROOFTOP ELEVATOR and 
     moves toward them, drugged, wraithlike. She's still wearing 
     the porcelain DOLL'S MASK we saw earlier.

                              JOKER
                     (to VICKI)
               Christ, it's my girlfriend.
                     (to ALICIA)
               WHAT?

                              ALICIA
               You said I could look at the
               pictures before you -- before you --

                              JOKER
               Shucks, honey, I forgot.
                     (rolling his eyes at
                      VICKI)
               I'm in trouble now.
                     (to ALICIA)
               This is business, sweetie. Why don't
               you go outside and see how the boys
               are coming?

     VICKI can't take her eyes off this strange figure drifting 
     eerily through the abandoned tea room.

                              VICKI
                     (hesitantly)
               ... Why the mask?

                              JOKER
               Alicia! Come here, have a seat. Show
               Miss Vale why you wear the mask.

     ALICIA sits down numbly and begins to undo the mask.

                              JOKER (cont.)
               You see, Miss Vale, Alicia's beautiful.
               One in a million. A work of art. In 
               fact... 

     We're looking at ALICIA's profile as the mask comes off. 
     The side that's turned to us is indeed beautiful. But the 
     side we can't see... SENDS VICKI RIGHT OVER THE EDGE.

                              JOKER (cont.)
               She makes you look sick.

     VICKI lurches out of her seat, knocking it over, HER FACE 
     FROZEN IN HORROR. She finds her CAMERA, holds it out like a 
     weapon as THE JOKER advances on her.

                              VICKI
               You SCUM! You SICK FILTH!... You DID
               THAT to her!

                              JOKER
               What? I improved her a little... 

     VICKI backs away, snapping the shutter on her camera. HE 
     BLINKS as the flash gun goes off repeatedly.

                              VICKI
               I'll see you burn. I'll see you dead.
               -- GET AWAY FROM ME!!

                              JOKER
               Miss Vale, was it something I said?
                     (brightly)
               Do you want to sniff my flower?

     There's a BRIGHT PURPLE BOUTONNIERE in his lapel. He holds 
     it up for VICKI's inspection as he moves menacingly closer.

                              VICKI
               NO!

     The JOKER squeezes a concealed BULB. A JET OF CLEAR LIQUID 
     spurts out of the FLOWER, NARROWLY MISSING VICKI.

     She GASPS. BUMPS INTO A TABLE. ACRID BLACK SMOKE rises from 
     the floor where the clear liquid hit. Acid.

                              JOKER
               Come on, Miss Vale... STOP AND SMELL
               THE ROSES!!

     He backs VICKI into a corner. And then -- abruptly --

     A SKYLIGHT SHATTERS IN A HAIL OF GLASS! A CAPED SHADOW 
     DROPS TO THE FLOOR OF THE RESTAURANT! And THE JOKER is face 
     to face with... 

     THE BATMAN!

     On his wrist is a STEEL GAUNTLET. Ha AIMS IT at the JOKER 
     like a weapon. Then PIVOTS SUDDENLY -- POINTS HIS ARM 
     THROUGH THE DOOR OF THE RESTAURANT --

     -- AND FIRES A METAL SPIKE into the adobe wall of the RAMP 
     OUTSIDE!!

                              JOKER (cont.)
               ... YOU!!

     On the end of the spike is a CORD leading to BATMAN's belt. 
     In the wink of an eye he's GRABBED VICKI -- DRAGGED HER OUT 
     OF the tea room -- and PLUNGED OVER THE RAMP WALL, FOUR 
     STORIES STRAIGHT DOWN TO THE ATRIUM FLOOR BELOW!!!

     The JOKER races to the edge of the ramp.

                              JOKER (cont.)
               GET 'EM!! GET 'EM!!

     His GOONS are stationed at various points along the ramp, 
     still defacing masterpieces. They pull their guns and OPEN 
     FIRE as BATMAN and VICKI plummet past.

     ANGLE ON BATMAN AND VICKI - AS THEY FALL

     He holds the gauntlet overhead, ROPE whistling through it. 
     As we watch, the gauntlet sprouts STEEL WINGS -- forming a 
     BULLETPROOF SHIELD over their heads!

     TWO FEET ABOVE the marble floor, THE ROPE jerks them up 
     short -- like a bunjee cord. GUNS BLAZE as BATMAN and VICKI 
     drop safely to earth and MAKE FOR THE EXIT.

     The doors are LOCKED. BATMAN spots the black "CLOSED" sign 
     on a metal stand. He HEAVES IT through the glass doors.

     VICKI hustles through. He points her to a side alley.

     EXT. SIDE ALLEY - THAT MOMENT - DUSK

     VICKI rounds the corner just as BATMAN lobs a SMOKE PELLET 
     into the doorway of the Fluegelheim.

                              BATMAN
               GET IN THE CAR!

                              VICKI
               WHICH CAR?

     VICKI suddenly feels quite stupid. Because -- while there 
     are many cars parked along the side alley -- there is only 
     one BATMOBILE.

                              VICKI (cont.)
               ... Oh.

     The BATMOBILE is sleek, futuristic, and... well, 
     indescribable. Imagine your own. VICKI climbs into the 
     passenger seat and is immediately dazzled by a stunning 
     array of electronic gadgetry.

                              BATMAN
               Ignition!

     As BATMAN sprints down the alley, a COMPUTER DISPLAY on the 
     dashboard registers his unique voiceprint. A tinny, 
     synthesized VOICE repeats the command:

                              COMPUTER
               Ignition.

     The engines are revving up even as BATMAN vaults into the 
     cockpit alongside VICKI.

     Guns in hand, the JOKER'S GOONS Are stumbling out of the 
     Fluegelheim, hacking, coughing, blinded by smoke. They DIVE 
     FOR THEIR LIVES as the BATMOBILE comes barrelling out of 
     the alley at ninety miles an hour.

     THE JOKER emerges just as the BATMOBILE careens off.

                              JOKER
               I WANT HIM!! I WANT HIM!!

     The JOKER climbs into the back of a van labelled "MONARCH 
     PLAYING CARDS."  Half his GOONS pile into the van behind 
     him, the other half into a second car nearby.

     EXT. STREETS - THAT MOMENT

     SIRENS HOWL as POLICE CARS converge on the Flugelheim.

     INT. BATMOBILE - THAT MOMENT

     roaring out into CITY TRAFFIC.

                              VICKI
               Look! Police!

                              BATMAN
               I called them.

                              VICKI
               Shouldn't we --

     A POLICE CAR whizzes past the BATMOBILE. TIRES SKID. The 
     COP CAR does a quick 180 and sets out in hot pursuit of the 
     BATMOBILE. BATMAN FLOORS THE ACCELERATOR in response.

     INT. VAN - THAT MOMENT

     TIGHT ON the demented face of THE JOKER. A GOON calls out 
     from the front of the van.

                              GOON
               There they are! Dead ahead!

     THE JOKER screams into a RADIO DISPATCHER'S MIKE.

                              JOKER
               ALL UNITS! SOUTHBOUND ON RIVERVIEW!

     SERIES OF SHOTS

     The JOKER'S ARMY. THUGS in cars. CREEPS in Italian 
     restaurants. CROOKED COPS at a coffee shop. LIGHTS FLASH, 
     BEEPERS SOUND, and within seconds they're racing to the 
     streets, eager to join the chase.

     SERIES OF SHOTS - THE STREETS

     COP CARS. GOON CARS. THE BATMOBILE streaks through an 
     intersection, nearly causing a pileup. THE JOKER'S VAN 
     makes short work of a SABRETT'S HOT DOG STAND in its path.

     INT. BATMOBILE - THAT MOMENT

     PEDESTRIANS GAWK as the sleek supercar RIPS UP THE 
     PAVEMENT.

                              VICKI
               What about her? What about the girl?

                              BATMAN
               He won't kill her.
                     (gritting his teeth)
               GODDAMMIT!

     They're moving up on an EMPTY BLOCK -- a NIGHT CONSTRUCTION 
     TEAM. A HUGE PIECE OF HEAVY MACHINERY backs up slowly and 
     inexorably, BLOCKING THE INTERSECTION.

     BATMAN GUNS THE ENGINE. SWERVES LEFT. TRIES TO SLIDE PAST. 
     And HITS THE BRAKES -- stopping inches short of a head-on 
     collision with a lamppost.

     He jumps out of the car. No chance to get through. THE 
     JOKER'S VAN is two blocks back and coming up fast.

     ONLOOKERS and CONSTRUCTION WORKERS are beginning to form a 
     crowd around them.

                              VICKI
               Can't we --

                              BATMAN
               Too many people. Come on!
                     (as she scrambles out)
               SHIELDS!!

     The BATMOBILE's computerized VOICE replies:

                              COMPUTER
               Shields.

     With a series or CLANGS, CHROME-STEEL PLATES slide into 
     place -- across the cockpit, over the tires -- leaving the 
     BATMOBILE an inert, impenetrable BLOCK OF BLACK METAL.

     BATMAN and VICKI sprint through the CONSTRUCTION SITE, 
     vaulting over mounds of loose dirt and concrete rubble.

     INT. VAN - MOVING - NIGHT

     THREE POLICE CARS, red lights blazing, OVERTAKE THE JOKER'S 
     VAN and bear down on the abandoned BATMOBILE.

                              GOON AT WHEEL
               Are they ours?

                              JOKER
               ... I don't know. We'd better get out
               of here.
                     (into RADIO MIKE)
               Westbound on 36th. DO YOU COPY??

     The VAN does a discreet U-turn and rumbles off sedately 
     down the street.

     EXT. SIDE STREET - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT

     BATMAN and VICKI zigzag past storefronts and candy stands, 
     dodging astonished PEDESTRIANS.

     INT. CAR - MOVING - THAT MOMENT

     FOUR GOONS with GUNS. They spot BATMAN and VICKI coming off 
     the side street. GOON I, the driver, speaks into a radio:

                              GOON I
               We got 'em!

                              JOKER (V.O.)
                     (over radio)
               Take 'em! I want his head!

     EXT. STREET - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT

     BATMAN and VICKI race down the sidewalk. The car is gaining 
     on them; and then, from behind --

     BATMAN and VICKI are caught in a SPRAY OF BULLETS. They 
     dive. Drop behind a parked car. And don't come up.

     They've ducked into a BLIND ALLEY.

     INT. ALLEYWAY - NIGHT

     Hunkered on the pavement, they watch the car glide past the 
     mouth of the alley. VICKI sighs in relief. BATMAN -- still 
     alert, his muscles tensed -- puts a restraining hand on her 
     arm. He looks overhead, sees a catwalk spanning the width 
     of the alleyway five stories up.

                              BATMAN
               How much do you weigh?

                              VICKI
               ... A hundred and eight?

     He does some quick mental calculations. A beat. Then the 
     CAR reappears -- backing up -- blocking their only avenue 
     of escape. BATMAN unfurls a rope, HEAVES A BATARANG UPWARD, 
     and grabs VICKI roughly about the waist.

                              BATMAN
               HANG ON!

     The JOKER'S THUGS pile out of the car. The BATARANG catches 
     on the catwalk, and BATMAN triggers the spring-action REEL 
     on his utility belt -- jerking him and VICKI INTO THE AIR.

     BULLETS zing past as they whip upward like fish on a line. 
     One story; two stories; and then... 

     They slow. They STOP. They DANGLE IN MIDAIR as the Joker's 
     goons advance. BATMAN wriggles, twists. They lurch upward 
     another few feet -- and stop again. VICKI SCREAMS.

     Her additional weight is too much for the reel mechanism. They're
     stranded two stories up -- SITTING DUCKS.

                              BATMAN (cont.)
               Whatever happens -- DON'T LET GO!!

     In the wink of an eye he's detached the reel from his own 
     waist and hitched it around VICKI's belt. Before she has a 
     chance to protest, he LETS GO.

     VICKI rockets upward at blinding speed, shrieking all the 
     way. BATMAN, his cape billowing, PLUMMETS DOWNWARD.

     VICKI slams up into the catwalk and BOBS on the end of the 
     line as BATMAN lands with a loud crash, overturning a row 
     of garbage cans. The GOONS are on him in a flash -- one per 
     limb. Random kicking and flailing. BATMAN manages to slam 
     two GOONS into a wall, but before he can get to his feet --

     -- GOON #3 slams a lead pipe into the back of his skull.

     BATMAN is down for the count. The THUGS dust themselves off 
     and circle around his prostrate form, still wary.

     The LEAD THUG holds his colleagues back, draws his gun, and 
     fires TWO SHOTS, point-blank, at the yellow-and-black 
     INSIGNE on BATMAN's chest. The body jerks.

     They move closer. And stop.

                              GOON I
               ... No blood.

                              GOON II
               Jesus.

                              GOON III
               Wait a minute.

     GOON III screws up his courage and crouches beside the 
     body. He examines THE BATMAN'S TUNIC... and RIPS IT OPEN.

                              GOON IV
               ... What is that?

                              GOON III
               Some kind of body armor.

                              GOON I
               He's human after all. -- Take that
               mask off.

     EXT. ROOFTOP - ON VICKI

     Five stories overhead, VICKI has pulled herself up onto the 
     roof of the adjacent building. She watches transfixed as 
     the THUGS bend over to remove BATMAN's cowl. But at this 
     height -- and this angle -- she can't see his face. On a 
     sudden impulse she reaches for her CAMERA BAG.

     ANGLE ON GOONS

     peering-down open-mouthed at the unconscious face of BRUCE 
     WAYNE. Blood seeps from BRUCE's left nostril.

                              GOON I
               Well?... Who is this guy?

                              GOON II
               I dunno. You seen him before?

                              GOON III
               Maybe he's got some kind of I.D.

                              GOON IV
               Good idea. Let's check his wallet.

                              GOON I
               We'll worry about it later. Plug
               him.
                        (beat)
               In the head.

     GOON II draws his automatic. And at that very instant... A 
     FLASH GUN EXPLODES OVERHEAD.

     Startled, the THUGS look up. ANOTHER CAMERA FLASH.

                              GOON III
               Goddam, it's the redhead!

     ON VICKI

     A chunk of ledge chips off mere inches from her head as the 
     GOONS OPEN FIRE. She ducks back behind the overhang, holds 
     the camera out over the ledge, and KEEPS ON FLASHING.

     ON BRUCE

     HIS EYES WINK OPEN.

     ON VICKI

     momentarily idle. She's used up her roll. The GOONS KEEP 
     SHOOTING as she reaches in her bag for new film. She finds 
     it, loads the camera with astonishing dexterity -- and 
     then, on instinct, reaches back inside the bag for a 
     TELEPHOTO LENS. All the better to see you with, Batman... 

     ON THE THUGS

     No response from VICKI. They begin to relax a little.

                              GOON II
               Did you hit her?

                              GOON I
               Who cares? Wax that freak.

     They turn their attention to BRUCE. A GLOVED HAND snakes 
     out with lightning speed -- GRABBING GOON I BY THE COATTAIL 
     and pulling him DIRECTLY INTO THE LINE OF FIRE. GOON II bas 
     pulled the trigger twice before he knows what's happened.

     In one fluid motion BRUCE HEAVES GOON I's lifeless body 
     THROUGH THE AIR, knocking GOON II backward over a garbage 
     can. GOON II falls and CRACKS HIS HEAD on the nearest wall.

     GOON III takes a rabbit punch to the throat. He's on the 
     way down when he catches a STEEL-TOED BOOT in the gut.

     Four seconds after all this began, BRUCE is alone in the 
     alleyway with GOON IV. GOON IV has his gun pointed right at 
     BRUCE, but he's shaking too much to pull the trigger.

     BRUCE smiles. GOON IV SCREAMS and RUNS FOR HIS LIFE.

     Through all this, VICKI's telephoto camera has been poised 
     on the ledge, snapping away. BRUCE looks up at the FLASH 
     GUN and shakes his head. He bends to retrieve his cowl.

     ON VICKI

     She finally dares to peek down at the alley. Limp goons 
     everywhere. And, in addition, THE BATMAN -- leaping up, 
     grabbing the edge of a fire escape, climbing up to meet 
     her.

     VICKI thinks fast. She may have a clean shot of BATMAN'S 
     FACE. She advances the film in the camera and removes the 
     roll, then drops it down her blouse.

     But BATMAN is likely to want that roll. So she straightens 
     her skirt and scurries across the roof, away from the 
     alley. She should have a minute or so before be gets there.

     It's a three-foot drop to the next roof over. VICKI 
     clambers down and quickens her pace, tossing a nervous 
     glance over her shoulder every couple of steps.

     Then, somehow -- and she'll be damned if she can figure out 
     how -- she walks smack into THE BATMAN. And GASPS.

                              BATMAN
               ... Not even a 'thank you'?

                              VICKI
               Well -- I think you might consider
               thanking me. You were good as
               dead.

                              BATMAN
               That's because you lied about your
               weight.
                     (a long pause)
               Thank you.

     VICKI NODS and tries to walk past him. He grabs her arm.

                              BATMAN (cont.)
               I'll have to ask you for that film.

                              VICKI
               I just wanted to distract them. I
               wasn't trying to get a picture of
               you.

     BATMAN looks down at the camera hanging from her neck. The 
     telephoto lens must jut out six inches. VICKI gulps.

                              BATMAN
               Please.

                              VICKI
               I won't let you have it.

     THE BATMAN is amused. He smiles menacingly.

                              VICKI (cont.)
               I know you can break my neck and
               take it. But the Joker's on that
               same roll. I --

                              BATMAN
               The Joker is a murderer. And you
               were as good as dead. So --

                              VICKI
               Look, I appreciate what you did for
               me. But this is my job. And I'm
               keeping those pictures.

                              BATMAN
               All right, here's a compromise. I'll
               develop the photos. You keep the
               Jokers and I'll keep the rest.

                              VICKI
               How do I know you won't keep them
               all?

                              BATMAN
               Because I'll take you with me.

     He reaches out, holds her gently by the shoulders. His 
     voice is deep and soothing. True, VICKI is a little dizzy 
     from all that's happened, but she's undeniably drawn to 
     him.

     Still cautious, though. She reaches into her bag and hands 
     over a roll of film. The original roll -- not the telephoto
     shots, which are still stashed in her blouse.

                              BATMAN (cont.)
               Thank you, Vicki.

                              VICKI
               ... Where are you going to take me?

     No reply. She looks up into his mirrored eyes. He pulls her 
     closer to him. Brushes back her hair, runs one hand 
     delicately along the line of her cheek... 

     ... AND BREAKS A TINY CAPSULE under her nose. VICKI SLUMPS 
     into BATMAN's arms.

                                                 CUT TO:

     EXT. ALLEYWAY - NIGHT

     Street level. BATMAN emerges carrying VICKI's inert form in 
     his arms. He pauses and peers around the edge of a wall at 
     the BATMOBILE two blocks down.

     The car is still there, the chrome-steel shields intact. 
     But DOZENS OF COPS and CURIOSITY-SEEKERS are SWARMING ALL 
     OVER the fearsome machine.

     BATMAN snorts in frustration. AN ENORMOUS THREE-TON 
     CATERPILLAR WINCH rumbles up the street toward the 
     Batmobile.

     He's about to get towed. BATMAN takes a RADIO TRANSMITTER
     from his utility belt and SPEAKS INTO IT.

                              BATMAN
               Shields open.

     EXT. STREET - ON BATMOBILE

     TWO COPS are crawling along the hood of the car. From 
     within they hear the tinny computerized voice:

                              COMPUTER
               Shields open.

     The steel plates begin to retract.

                              BATMAN (V.O.)
                     (over radio)
               Ignition.

                              COMPUTER
               Ignition.

     The stunned COPS gaze into the Batmobile's cockpit.

                              COP
               There's somebody in there!

     They TUMBLE OFF THE HOOD as the turbine engines ROAR TO 
     LIFE and THE BATMOBILE BEGINS TO MOVE.

     COPS AND ONLOOKERS quickly clear a path. They stand there 
     stunned as the futuristic auto PICKS UP SPEED and advances 
     toward the end of the block. The LEFT TURN SIGNAL flashes 
     dutifully. And the BATMOBILE VANISHES AROUND THE CORNER.

     PANDEMONIUM BREAKS LOOSE as the COPS bolt for their cars.

     EXT. STREET - NIGHT

     SIRENS WAIL. PASSERSBY STARE SLACKJAWED at the driverless 
     BATMOBILE as it tears down the street, passing, darting, 
     dodging buses and CUTTING OFF TAXIS -- all with a squad of 
     COP CARS in hot pursuit.

     EXT. ALLEYWAY - NIGHT

     BATMAN sees the BATMOBILE rounding the corner and 
     approaching on the straightaway. He takes VICKI in his arms 
     and STEPS DIRECTLY INTO THE PATH OF THE ONRUSHING 
     HEADLIGHTS.

                              BATMAN
               STOP!

     BRAKES SQUEAL. The BATMOBILE stops one yard short of BATMAN 
     and VICKI. A moment later BATMAN is AT THE WHEEL.

     SIRENS BUILD. LIGHTS FLASH. The COP CARS are now visible 
     behind them. BATMAN floors the pedal; the Batmobile's 
     powerful AFTERBURNERS kick in; and the hapless cops KILL 
     THEIR SIRENS as BATMAN zooms off into the night at 140 mph.

                                                 DISSOLVE TO:

     EXT. BACK ROAD - NIGHT

     A deserted stretch of road, lined by ancient tall pines on 
     either side. The BATMOBILE roars past.

     INT. BATMOBILE - NIGHT

     VICKI is gradually coming to on the passenger's side.

                              VICKI
               ... How long have I been out?

                              BATMAN
               Quite a while. I took the scenic
               route.

                              VICKI
                     (gazing around her)
               Well, I've certainly enjoyed it.
               What's that?

     He's just hit a BUTTON on the dashboard.

                              BATMAN
               Garage door.

     EXT. ROAD - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT

     At the side of the road, a FALLEN TREE, surrounded by 
     underbrush, RISES HYDRAULICALLY INTO THE AIR -- revealing a 
     SECRET ROAD invisible from the main thoroughfare.

     Doing sixty, the BATMOBILE makes a hairpin turn. Seconds 
     later, the FALLEN TREE drops back magically into place.

     INT. BATMOBILE - A MOMENT LATER - NIGHT

     As they cruise down the hidden road, VICKI STUDIES BATMAN'S 
     FACE. KNOX's words are very much on her mind.

                              VICKI
               I meant to ask you. Up on the roof
               -- how did you know my name?

     BATMAN SMILES in response. VICKI smiles with him.

                              VICKI (cont.)
               I'm serious. How did you know?

     No reply. VICKI frowns, looks through the windshield, and 
     SEES -- much to her horror -- an enormous SHEER CLIFF WALL 
     LOOMING DEAD AHEAD.

     Wide-eyed, she looks at BATMAN. Still smiling, he HITS THE 
     GAS -- SPEEDING UP. She lets out a SCREAM.

     ANGLE ON CLIFF WALL

     One second to impact. Suddenly the cliff wall VANISHES 
     ALTOGETHER -- revealing, in its place, the GAPING MOUTH OF 
     AN UNDERGROUND CAVERN.

     The Batmobile zooms through. A moment later, the CLIFF WALL 
     -- which is nothing more than a HOLOGRAPHIC PROJECTION -- 
     winks back into existence, showing no trace of the cavern.

     INT. BATCAVE - NIGHT

     We all know this place. Although we haven't had time to 
     acquire the familiar mementos -- the dinosaur, the giant 
     penny -- the BATCAVE is unmistakable. Vast banks of 
     blinking computers. A state-of-the-art crime lab. A fully-
     equipped workshop for hammering out new toys. It's the 
     biggest and best secret clubhouse a boy could wish for.

     BATMAN climbs out of the car. He removes his cape, strips 
     off his bullet-riddled jersey and his body armor. There are 
     TWO BIG BRUISES on the center of his chest.

     VICKI looks on as he goes to a rack along one wall and 
     picks out a fresh tunic -- one of four. She wanders over to 
     examine the row of bat-suits -- and the BODY ARMOR.

                              VICKI
               What is this stuff? Kevlar?

                              BATMAN
               Better. It's not on the market yet.

                              VICKI
               It doesn't protect your head,
               though.

                              BATMAN
               That's why I wear a target on my
               chest.

     THE BATMAN takes obvious pleasure in showing her his 
     futuristic bachelor's pad. His tone is jokey, almost 
     flirtatious. Behind the mask, he's a lot looser, more 
     carefree, than some guys we could name... 

     ... like Bruce Wayne.

     VICKI is, to put it mildly, awed. She wanders around gaping 
     at millions of dollars' worth of equipment.

                              VICKI
               How'd you find this place?

                              BATMAN
               Stumbled across it when I was a boy.

     VICKI'S HEAD jerks up abruptly. In the dim recesses 
     overhead, BATS ARE SCREAMING. She shivers.

                              BATMAN (cont.)
               They don't come down here. They're
               afraid of the lights.

                              VICKI
               I don't like bats. Not that kind.

                              BATMAN
               They used to terrify me. But I
               forced myself to keep coming back,
               and --
                     (smiling)
               -- I guess I became the thing I
               feared the most. I'll do your photos
               now.

     He goes to a HIGH-SPEED PHOTO PROCESSING MACHINE -- the 
     kind they have at Fotomat, only better -- and loads the 
     roll.

     VICKI wanders over to the edge of a DEEP BLACK PIT. She 
     kicks a pebble over. Long seconds pass; no sound.

     She looks up. Suspended over the bottomless pit are a pair 
     of GYMNAST'S RINGS. This guy is dedicated.

                              VICKI
               Who pays for all this?

                              BATMAN
               I have sponsors.

                              VICKI
               The computers?

                              BATMAN
               I'm running a check on the tainted
               products. There is a pattern.
               Beauty products. Personal hygiene.

                              VICKI
               No more makeup. -- Looks like we'll
               all be showing our true faces now.

     She looks straight at him. It's almost a direct request. 
     But BATMAN is preoccupied with the matter at hand.

                              BATMAN
               I've tracked all the records. Every
               shipment, every warehouse, every
               loading dock. Nothing. No
               opportunities for tampering. Somehow
               the Joker is supplying tainted
               ingredients... at the source.

                              VICKI
               Wait. You can just tap into any
               corporate database you want?
               Anywhere?

                              BATMAN
               Oh, no. I let the FBI do that. Then
               I tap into the FBI. -- Your photos
               are ready.

     He holds up a hand to VICKI: stand back. Then he checks out 
     the pictures -- SMILING as he shuffles through the prints.

                              VICKI
               You could've killed him, you know.
               You could have killed the Joker.

                              BATMAN
               I had to save you, Vicki.
                     (turning to face her)
               Here you go. I think I'll let you
               keep the whole set.

     She looks at the photos. Joker. Joker. Joker. And four 
     shots of the BATMAN in action. He's without his mask, but 
     there's no clean angle on his face.

     VICKI doesn't quite know why, but her head is reeling.

                              BATMAN (cont.)
               Care for an autograph?

     He takes one of the prints, scrawls on it, hands it to her 
     with the inscription: "TO VICKI. LOVE, B."

     Now he turns to shut down the photo machine. VICKI is 
     trembling. Her hand goes to her belt, finds the telephoto 
     roll concealed in her blouse. She steps up silently behind 
     him, reaches for his cowl. At the last second... she STOPS.

                              VICKI
               ... Bruce?

     HE FREEZES IN PLACE for an indecisive moment. Then:

                              BATMAN
               Are you talking to me?

     He turns in seeming incomprehension. And shows her a 
     SMILE... the same crooked, curious, childlike smile she saw 
     on BRUCE's face that morning when she caught him singing.

                              BATMAN (cont.)
               Maybe we've had enough for one
               night. I'll take you home.

     Almost in a trance now, she lets him lead her to the 
     BATMOBILE. As she takes her seat he reaches into his 
     utility belt for another KNOCKOUT CAPSULE.

                              BATMAN (cont.)
               Do you want to do it this time?

     VICKI doesn't move. She looks at the capsule in her hand as 
     he walks over to the driver's side and gets in.

                              BATMAN (cont.)
               Don't be afraid. I'm here.

     She takes one last look at the familiar SMILE beneath the 
     mask... then breaks the capsule and BREATHES DEEP.

     FLAME ERUPTS from the rear of the Batmobile as the after-
     burners kick in and BATMAN screeches off. A FIERY RED GLOW 
     fills the screen, BURNING OUT THE IMAGE as we

                                                 DISSOLVE TO:

     EXT. GOTHAM STREET - 1963 - NIGHT (DREAM SEQUENCE)

     The red glow resolves itself into a DREAMLIKE STREET SCENE: 
     liquid, weightless figures moving in a tinted, soundless 
     cityscape as DISTANT, TINKLY CARNIVAL MUSIC plays 
     underneath. We're outside a theatre watching first-nighters 
     emerge from the opening of a hit musical.

     In the crowd we pick out THREE FIGURES: DR. THOMAS WAYNE, 
     his wife MARTHA, and -- in THOMAS's arms -- their young son 
     BRUCE. BRUCE hasn't made it through the show. He's asleep, 
     head nestled peacefully against his father's shoulder.

     THOMAS rouses the boy gently, sets him down on the 
     sidewalk. BRUCE rubs the sleep from his eyes as THOMAS puts 
     an arm around his wife. Together they begin walking.

     IN A SINGLE CUT the crowd has DISAPPEARED, and the WAYNES 
     are walking toward us up a deserted street. THOMAS and 
     MARTHA are laughing, making jokes, reaching down to tousle 
     BRUCE's hair. Their FACES, as they draw closer, are FULL OF 
     JOY. And then, without warning --

     A HANDGUN enters frame.

     The WAYNES freeze in their tracks. THOMAS steps 
     protectively in front of his wife, reaches for his wallet, 
     begins unbuckling his watch. He won't put up a fight.

     MARTHA's hand goes involuntarily to the PEARL NECKLACE at 
     her throat.

     The GUNMAN sees it, gestures for her to hand it over. But 
     MARTHA is paralyzed, afraid to move.

     The GUNMAN steps past THOMAS, SNATCHES AT THE NECKLACE.

     The instant his wife is threatened, THOMAS ATTACKS. The 
     pearl strand BREAKS in the GUNMAN'S HAND as he drops toward 
     the sidewalk.

     A SILENT BURST OF FLAME erupts from the muzzle of the gun.

     THOMAS CRUMPLES. MARTHA emits a PIERCING SHRIEK -- a shriek 
     we cannot hear --

     -- a shriek cut short by a second burst of flame.

     BRUCE stands paralyzed in shock. THE GUNMAN scoops a 
     handful of pearls off the sidewalk, reaches for MARTHA's 
     purse, and rises slowly -- his gun levelled directly at the 
     boy.

     Almost catatonic, BRUCE stares down at the corpses of his 
     parents. At their hands, somehow intertwined. At the tiny 
     glinting pearls and the spreading pool of blood around 
     them.

     He looks up with a gaze so bleak, so petrifying... that the 
     GUNMAN turns and runs.

     AND WE CUT. To an exact reproduction of the Pulitzer Prize-
     winning photo... the cops bent over the bodies, the medics 
     with their stretchers, the boy BRUCE, his arms wrapped 
     tightly around the waist of OFFICER GORDON.

     There's only one difference. BRUCE's head is turned away 
     from us. We can't see his face.

     And now a HAND enters the frame. Much like the GUNMAN's 
     hand, but feminine, beckoning. BRUCE, hearing his name, 
     LOOKS UP; then, agonized, ashamed, he BURIES HIS FACE in 
     GORDON's side. GORDON gestures angrily at the intruder.

     But the hand keeps beckoning. And ultimately BRUCE turns. 
     Showing us the tear-stained face from the famous photo. A
     face slack with horror. The horror of his parents' death... 
     and more importantly, the horror that someone would dare to
     violate this most private and terrible of moments.

     At last we see what BRUCE sees: a WOMAN crouched on the 
     sidewalk nearby. The WOMAN is holding a camera. The WOMAN 
     is smiling prettily at BRUCE.

     The WOMAN is VICKI VALE.

     A FLASHBULB EXPLODES. FILLING. THE SCREEN with its blinding 
     white light, SCORCHING OUT THE IMAGE as a HARSH RINGING 
     SOUND cuts through the silence.

                                                 CUT TO:

     INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

     VICKI AWAKENS. She sits up in bed, tremulous, distraught. 
     The bedside phone is ringing. She reaches for it, but her 
     hand freezes in midair. She knows who's calling.

     Three rings later, she manages to lift the receiver. To her 
     amazement, she finds she cannot speak. Finally, she hears a 
     VOICE at the other end of the line.

                              BRUCE (V.O.)
               Vicki... ?

     INT. BRUCE WAYNE'S STUDY - NIGHT

     BRUCE at a big mahogany desk in his somber, book-lined 
     study. The room is dark but for a small table lamp.

                              BRUCE
               Vicki, I've been thinking about you.
                     (long pause)
               I know it's late. I'm sorry. I --
               Are you there?

     INTERCUT BRUCE AND VICKI

                              VICKI
               Yes, Bruce -- I'm here --

                              BRUCE
               I'm sorry about the way things went
               between us. I'd very much like to
               see you again.

                              VICKI
               Well, Bruce... I don't think... that
               would be possible.

                              BRUCE
               I wish you'd reconsider.
                     (groping)
               I didn't stand you up today. The
               museum was closed when I got there.

                              VICKI
               I, uh... 

     ON VICKI

     Her voice trails off. She's profoundly shaken. She knows.

                              BRUCE (V.O.)
               Vicki? Vi --

     She returns the receiver to its cradle.

     ON BRUCE

     He hears the click. His lips part slightly. He hangs up and 
     sits there at the desk, staring straight ahead.

     INT. VICKI'S BATHROOM - NIGHT

     TOTAL DARKNESS. VICKI stands before the bathroom mirror. 
     She holds the OPENED ROLL OF TELEPHOTO SHOTS over the sink.

     Then she strikes a match. IGNITES the film. Drops it into 
     the sink, and -- with hollow eyes -- WATCHES IT BURN.

     INT. VICKI'S APARTMENT - LATER - NIGHT

     It's four in the morning. VICKI, wrapped in a bathrobe, 
     still shaky, pours her fifth cup of coffee. Sitting across 
     from her is a rumpled and stubbly ALEXANDER KNOX.

                              KNOX
               Vicki, it all fits. The stuff you're
               telling me -- the car, the equipment
               -- somebody's paying for it.

                              VICKI
               I just can't --

                              KNOX
               The FBI. You know who's got the FBI
               computer contract? Wayne
               Technologies.
                     (shaking his head)
               The guy's bats all right. He's bat
               shit crazy. This is gonna be the
               most incredible --

                              VICKI
               But he's not.

                              KNOX
               Not what?

                              VICKI
               He's not crazy.

     KNOX slaps his forehead in frustration, sprawls back in his 
     chair.

                              KNOX
               Vicki. We got a wealthy millionaire
               here... who dresses up like a bat. He
               goes out at night and swings around
               -- in his cape -- on a rope.
                     (throwing up his hands)
               Okay. Maybe I'm crazy.

                              VICKI
               Allie... he wants to tell me.
               That's why he took me there. Because
               he's trying to tell me.

                              KNOX
               Gimme a break. If he wants to chat,
               he can talk to his car.

     The joke dies. VICKI stares dead ahead. KNOX looks on in 
     utter disbelief as it all comes into focus: he's lost her 
     loyalty. VICKI is in over her head with BRUCE.

                              VICKI
               He has to tell someone. And I'm the
               one. He's trying to tell me.

     KNOX, hurt in a way he doesn't fully understand, gets up 
     and pulls on his coat. He stares at her coldly:

                              KNOX
               Well, when he does you know my
               number.

     EXT. NEWSSTAND - DAY

     CUSTOMERS are lining up to buy the early edition of the
     Globe, which carries the full-page banner headline:

             Batman, Joker in Fluegelheim Shootout

     In the midst of the hubbub a DELIVERY TRUCK cruises past, 
     dumping a bundle of AFTERNOON EDITIONS on the sidewalk. 
     "WAR OF THE FREAKS" has been relegated to the lower right-
     hand corner of the page -- supplanted by more pressing 
     news:

     INT. WAYNE FOUNDATION - DAY

     BRUCE in a plush office suite downtown, on the phone to his 
     broker. Behind his desk is a big plate-glass window with a 
     fortieth-floor view of the financial district, so he can 
     wave at his fellow millionaires on their way down.

                              BRUCE
               Don't sell. It won't last. We'll
               ride it out.

     With exaggerated calm, he hangs up. He lifts the receiver 
     to dial another number, then hesitates and hangs up again.

     INT. RECEPTION AREA - A MOMENT LATER - DAY

     BRUCE, affecting an air of nonchalance, strolls past a 
     squad of SECRETARIES at desks. Phones are ringing off the 
     hook.

     INT. HALLWAY - A MOMENT LATER - DAY

     BRUCE ambles past a couple of COLLEAGUES. One of them is 
     shambling catatonically down the hall, bumping into walls. 
     The other is WAILING HYSTERICALLY.

                              WAILING COLLEAGUE
               ... a nine-million-dollar bath!

     BRUCE nods in sympathy as they pass. He stops outside the 
     door to a men's room, looks around cautiously, then enters.

     INT. MEN'S ROOM - A MOMENT LATER - DAY

     A small anteroom outside the bathroom proper, with a bank 
     of PAY PHONES on one wall. BRUCE checks the bathroom to 
     make sure it's empty, then digs out a quarter and dials a 
     number. He cups one hand confidentially over the receiver:

                              BRUCE
                     (the familiar rasp)

               would you?

     KNOX starts cockily off down the driveway -- then STOPS. 
     Behind him, the iron gates are SLIDING OPEN.

     INT. BRUCE'S LIBRARY - TEN MINUTES LATER - DAY

     KNOX, agitated, drums his fingers on the edge of a big 
     leather chair. BRUCE stands across from him.

                              BRUCE
               I've been expecting to hear from
               you.

                              KNOX
               Well, that's how it is, chum. She
               tells me everything.

                              BRUCE
               What is it you want?

                              KNOX
               Simple. You know the score. One
               column -- and I can bring all this
               tumbling down. I can take you off
               the streets once and for all.
                        (a shaky pause)
               I want you to hang up the suit. And
               I want you to stay away from Vicki.

                              BRUCE
               I can't do that. Not while the
               Joker's still out there.

                              KNOX
               Then stay away from Vicki. That's
               all I want, man. I just want your
               word.

     BRUCE turns away, evading his gaze. KNOX fumbles in his 
     jacket for a cigarette.

                              KNOX (cont.)
               See, I don't know how it happened --
               she's a smart girl and you are an
               extraordinarily screwed-up guy -- but
               she's in love with you.

                              BRUCE
               There's something I don't
               understand. If you've got the story,
               why haven't you printed it?

                              KNOX
               Because I --
                     (beat)
               Because she'd never speak to me
               again.

     KNOX is a bundle of nerves now. No longer cocky, he stubs 
     out his newly-lit cigarette -- and begins to PLEAD OPENLY.

                              KNOX (cont.)
               Come on, Bruce. Be straight. What
               have you got to offer? You gonna
               marry her? Batman and Mrs. Batman?
                     (laughing bitterly)
               Gimme a break, huh? Who's gonna be
               Best Rodent?

     BRUCE sinks into a chair, exhales sharply. He can't even 
     put up an argument. The two of them sit there, not looking 
     at each other, as ALFRED appears in the doorway.

                              BRUCE
               Do you want a drink?

                              KNOX
               Yeah, a drink. "Civilized."  Man-to-
               man, right?

                              BRUCE
               Alfred, bring something for Mr.
               Knox. -- I'll have one too.

                                                   CUT TO:

     EXT. GOTHAM PARK - LATE AFTERNOON

     The weekend-long BIRTHDAY GALA is getting underway, and 
     Gotham Park is mobbed with CELEBRANTS enjoying a FREE 
     CONCERT. Onstage: FIVE ELVIS IMITATORS, dressed in 
     everything from black leather to white spangled jumpsuits, 
     representing the King in progressive stages of 
     deterioration.

     INT. VICKI'S APARTMENT - DUSK

     She's on the sofa beside a disconsolate BRUCE.

                              VICKI
               ... So we just pretend none of this
               ever happened. We never met. We --
                     (frightened)
               You're going to get yourself killed,
               Bruce. You know that, don't you?

                              BRUCE
               It wouldn't matter much.

                              VICKI
               I don't understand it. You can do so
               much good for people. As Bruce
               Wayne.

     He sinks back on the sofa, closes his eyes. He's had the 
     same argument with himself a thousand times.

                              BRUCE
               Money makes money, Vicki. The
               foundation runs itself. -- I'm
               extraneous to the process.

                              VICKI
               You're one man. You can't save
               everybody.

                              BRUCE
               What it I could save a handful?
               -- What if I could save one?

     VICKI is sick of watching BRUCE torment himself. She stands 
     up, almost crying now, and ACCUSES HIM DIRECTLY:

                              VICKI
               Bruce, at the rate you're going, you
               can't even save yourself.

                              BRUCE
                     (staring right at her)
               Sometimes... I don't know if there's
               enough of me left to save.

     VICKI is totally drained. She heads for the kitchen.

                              VICKI
               Oh, God. I've got to have some
               coffee or something.

     A moment's breather as BRUCE sits on the sofa reflecting. 
     Then, suddenly, a KNOCK at the door.

     VICKI reappears and moves to answer the door. BRUCE -- on 
     his feet instantly -- grabs her by the shoulder.

                              BRUCE
               Are you expecting anyone?

     She nods no. He goes to the peephole in the door.

                              BRUCE (cont.)
               Who's there?

     THROUGH THE PEEPHOLE he sees a DELIVERY BOY.

                              DELIVERY BOY
               Package tor Miss Vale.

                              BRUCE
               Set it down by the door. On the
               left-hand side.

     The DELIVERY BOY sets the package down and wanders off, 
     tipless, muttering something about "cheap shits." After a 
     moment's interval, BRUCE opens the door and bends to pick 
     up the mysterious package.

     Another brown-paper parcel... ADDRESSED IN CRAYON.

                              VICKI
               BRUCE!

     He strides past her, handling the parcel gingerly, and sets 
     it down on the kitchen counter.

                              VICKI (cont.)
               It's just like the last time. He
               sent me a present before he --

                              BRUCE
               Very thoughtful. Don't touch it.

     As VICKI watches, he goes into the living-room and finds 
     his ALLIGATOR ATTACHE CASE. He opens the case, removes a 
     LAPTOP COMPUTER and a handful of business papers... then 
     lifts out a false bottom to reveal his UTILITY BELT.

                              VICKI
               Oh, Bruce. Don't tell me you carry
               it around with you.

                              BRUCE
               I feel naked without it.

     He takes out a tiny ULTRASOUND SCANNER -- rather like a 
     stethoscope, with a miniature sonar display where the 
     earpieces should be -- and runs it over the package.

                              BRUCE (cont.)
               Not a bomb. But it could be rigged.
               Wait in the next room.

     He takes a small GAS MASK from his belt, puts it on, then 
     SLITS THE WRAPPING with a steak knife.

     Nothing. Cautiously, he pulls back the flaps. The box is 
     full of STYROFOAM POPCORN. BRUCE shoves a hand down into 
     the popcorn... and extracts a HUMAN EAR.

     In the doorway behind him, VICKI lets out a squeal.

     BRUCE grabs the box and dumps TWO DOZEN EARS on the 
     counter.

                              BRUCE
               ... They're wax.

     VICKI finds a hand-scrawled NOTE among the ears.

                              VICKI
               "It worked for Van Gogh. Let's make
               up. I'll need you soon." -- Whew.

                              BRUCE
                     (lost in thought)
               That does it. It's going to be this
               weekend.

     The KITCHEN PHONE rings. VICKI reaches for the receiver. 
     Her eyes go wide and she gestures him over.

     INT. ALICIA HUNT'S APARTMENT - THAT MOMENT

     ALICIA, in her porcelain mask, on the phone.

                              ALICIA
               I thought you ought to know -- he's
               coming for you... 

     ON BRUCE AND VICKI

     Faces pressed together as they listen in. BRUCE covers the 
     mouthpiece with one hand.

                              BRUCE
               Keep her on the line!

                              VICKI
               ... Where are you calling from?

     As VICKI struggles to keep the conversation alive, BRUCE 
     rushes into the living room and crouches beside his LAPTOP 
     COMPUTER. He plugs it in, flips open the screen, punches up 
     a telecommunications program.

     A moment later VICKI enters from the kitchen.

                              VICKI
               I'm sorry, she hung up. What are --

                              BRUCE
               Finding out where she is.

                              VICKI
               How can you do that if she's already
               off the line?

                              BRUCE
               I've had an automatic tracer on this
               number ever since he tracked you to
               the museum.

     INT. BATCAVE - THAT MOMENT

     MASSIVE COMPUTERS click and whir. At BRUCE's prodding, 
     INFORMATION comes up on the monitor: a number, a name -- 
     ALICIA HUNT -- and an East Side address.

     INT. VICKI'S APARTMENT - THAT MOMENT - EVENING

     THE SAME INFORMATION scrolls across BRUCE's screen.

                              BRUCE
               Got it!

                              VICKI
               What now!

                              BRUCE
               Hang on. I have to leave a message.

     HE FREEZES. He's heard something in the hallway outside.

     INT. HALLWAY - THAT MOMENT

     ELEVATOR DOORS open on THREE THUGS. One of them uses a key 
     to lock the car in place on VICKI's floor. The key is on 
     the end of a ring which contains dozens of other keys.

     The KEY RING belongs to a DOORMAN, who's riding in the 
     elevator with the JOKER's trio of thugs. He's dead, alas. 
     The THUGS dump him unceremoniously on the floor of the hall 
     and march toward VICKI's apartment.

     INT. VICKI'S APARTMENT - A MOMENT LATER

     BRUCE is nowhere in sight. VICKI is at the sink washing 
     dishes, acting nonchalant. She pretends not to hear the 
     DOOR unlocking behind her.

     She turns -- and faces the THREE ADVANCING THUGS.

                              THUG I
               Hi, Miss Vale. Let's not put up a
               fight, huh? 'Cause we'd hate to have
               to --

     BRUCE steps into the doorway behind them. With a single 
     sweep of the arm, he flings THREE DRUG-TIPPED NINJA WHEELS 
     at the thugs, catching one in the neck, one in the 
     shoulder, one in the hip. They COLLAPSE in quick 
     succession.

                              BRUCE
               There's a garage in this building?

     VICKI nods yes. BRUCE -- all business now that he's in his 
     element -- disappears into VICKI's bedroom.

     She peeks around the corner. He reemerges carrying a BLACK 
     NYLON STOCKING, which he stuffs into his pocket. VICKI is 
     full of question, but he shushes her before she can speak.

                              BRUCE (cont.)
               I've got to take him out now.

     He stoops down beside the THUGS and pulls the elevator key 
     off the key ring -- which he then tosses to VICKI.

                              BRUCE (cont.)
               Pick an apartment and stay there.
               And listen: call the police. Give
               them that address. Every available
               man.

     He starts out the door, stops just long enough to take a 
     dumbfounded VICKI in his arms for a kiss.

     INT. UNDERGROUND GARAGE - A MOMENT LATER - EVENING

     THE JOKER'S VAN, bearing the Monarch Playing Card logo. TWO 
     ARMED GOONS lean against the hood. They watch as the 
     elevator opens and an ordinary fellow in a suit steps out.

     BRUCE pulls car keys from his pocket and strolls past the 
     thugs, head down, whistling. As he walks around the van, 
     his hand brushes against it -- leaving a MAGNETIZED HOMING 
     DEVICE, almost too tiny to notice, stuck to the fender.

     He walks another six paces, then stops short. He feels 
     around in all his pockets, making a big show of having
     forgotten something.

                              BRUCE
               Oh, hell!

     The GOONS eye him curiously as he strides back toward the 
     elevator. The doors are closing before it strikes them that 
     something is amiss.

                              GOON
               Hey, boss, something's up. The
               elevator's working.

     INT. VAN - ON JOKER

     Frustrated, snarling, ready to throw a tantrum.

                              JOKER
               DAMMIT! You can't get good help
               these days. -- Let's move out.

     EXT. STREET - EVENING - OVERHEAD ANGLE

     From high above the street we see the JOKER'S VAN pulling 
     out of VICKI's building. We're up on the roof, with BRUCE. 
     He hits a button on his utility belt, and a RED SIGNAL 
     LIGHT begins to flash.

     BRUCE clamps the utility belt around his waist. Pulls the 
     BLACK NYLON STOCKING over his head. And suddenly, he's 
     BOUNDING ACROSS THE ROOFTOPS in pursuit of the JOKER.

     EXT. CROSS STREET - A MOMENT LATER - EVENING

     The VAN turns right at the intersection. Nothing unusual. 
     But for some reason, PEDESTRIANS are pointing at the sky, 
     staring goggle-eyed at the rooftops.

     Far above them, a MAN -- dressed in a suit, a tie, a yellow 
     belt and a BLACK STOCKING MASK -- is gliding across the 
     intersection on a ROPE.

     INT. VAN - A MOMENT LATER

     The VAN DRIVER guns through a red light. BRAKES SQUEAL on 
     either side. In the back of the van, the JOKER GROWLS:

                              JOKER
               Slow down, you maniac!

     EXT. INTERSECTION - THAT MOMENT - EVENING

     As the VAN ROARS PAST, a MOUNTED POLICEMAN shakes his fist. 
     His horse shies, rears back, turns in a circle. He's just 
     about gotten the beast calmed down when a MAN IN A STOCKING 
     MASK plummets down on a rope from nowhere and lands 
     directly behind him on the horse's back.

     BRUCE elbows the startled COP. Now there's only one rider. 
     The VAN turns left. BRUCE gallops straight ahead through 
     the intersection, hoping to cut the JOKER off.

     INT. ALICIA HUNT'S APARTMENT - THAT MOMENT

     ALICIA peers out through the window. On the street below, 
     UNMARKED CARS are converging.

     INT. VAN - THAT MOMENT

     The JOKER and co. are two blocks away from ALICIA's. They 
     see a POLICE SWAT TEAM sealing off the building.

                              DRIVER
               Boss! Jesus! They've --

                              JOKER
               They'll be sorry. They'll be
               sorry. -- GET OUT OF HERE!

     EXT. SIDE STREET - THAT MOMENT - EVENING

     BRUCE on horseback, charging past elegant old brownstones, 
     drawing stares from passersby. We get a quick look at the 
     FLASHING RED SIGNAL LIGHT on his belt.

     EXT. RIVERVIEW DRIVE - THAT MOMENT - EVENING

     A YELLOW VW BUG rips up the street at 70 mph.

     INT. VOLKSWAGEN BUG - THAT MOMENT

     We can't see the driver. But we do see, on the seat 
     beside him, a VIDEO DISPLAY with a shifting grid map of the 
     city -- and on it, a FLASHING SIGNAL blinking in perfect 
     sync with the one on BRUCE's belt.

     EXT. SIDE STREET - THAT MOMENT

     BRUCE sees the VW bug rounding the corner and STREAKING 
     TOWARD HIM. He reins in the horse; it rears back on its 
     hind legs in a classic western pose; the BUG zooms past --

     -- and ALFRED THE BUTLER heaves out a BROWN LAUNDRY BUNDLE, 
     neatly tied in string.

     BRUCE snatches it out of the air, gives ALFRED a quick 
     salute -- and the BUG is gone.

     INT. JOKER'S VAN - EVENING

     The JOKER and his boys are stalled in heavy traffic at the 
     southern border of Gotham Park. POLICE BARRICADES are 
     everywhere; the surrounding streets have been roped off for 
     the birthday gala. HORNS HONK in anger.

                              JOKER
               MOVE! Can't you do something??

                              DRIVER
               It's some kind of detour. They're
               backed up for blocks!

     The JOKER snorts. He happens to glance into the side-view 
     mirror. What he sees there... CURDLES HIS BLOOD.

                              JOKER
               Oh my God. How does he do it... ?

     EXT. STREET - A BLOCK AWAY - THAT MOMENT

     THE BATMAN, IN FULL COSTUMED GLORY, GALLOPING UP THE STREET 
     ON HORSEBACK -- passing stunned COPS, weaving in and around 
     the stalled autos, GAINING FAST on the JOKER.

     INT. VAN - THAT MOMENT

     THE JOKER climbing all over the DRIVER. He HITS THE GAS, 
     RUNS THE VAN UP ON THE SIDEWALK, and -- at the first 
     opening he sees -- CRASHES THROUGH A POLICE BARRICADE INTO 
     GOTHAM PARK ITSELF.

     BATMAN is half a block behind him now. As he follows hot on 
     the JOKER's heels, TWO HELICOPTERS swing into the park from 
     overhead.

     EXT. GOTHAM PARK - EVENING

     CROWDS EVERYWHERE. On the central platform where we saw the 
     FREE CONCERT earlier, an EMCEE mans the microphone:

                              EMCEE
               -- the most spectacular, most death-
               defying aerial stunt ever devised.
               Tonight -- for the first time
               anywhere -- THE FLYING GRAYSONS!

     He points up at the two approaching HELICOPTERS, flying 
     side-by-side in tight formation some forty feet apart.

     ANGLE ON HELICOPTERS

     ONLOOKERS GASP as TWO TRAPEZES drop from the bellies of the 
     twin copters. Dangling from the trapezes are the FLYING 
     GRAYSONS -- a husband-and-wife aerialist team in spangled 
     red-and-green suits. They begin swinging toward each other 
     in a plane perpendicular to the path of the copters.

     EXT. GOTHAM PARK - GROUND LEVEL

     PANIC DOWN BELOW as the JOKER's van barrels through the 
     crowd, HORN BLARING. BATMAN is moving up swiftly.

     On each wrist he's wearing a MINIATURE ROCKET LAUNCHER. He 
     lets fly with TWO SALVOS. The first explodes harmlessly 
     against a tree. The second HITS THE REAR DOOR OF THE VAN -- 
     driving it off the access road down into the brush, where 
     it nearly topples over sideways.

     ANGLE ON FLYING GRAYSONS

     GRAYSON has just completed a double somersault in midair, 
     landing in the capable hands of his wife. Now they're 
     swinging again, building momentum as he prepares to make 
     the return leap back to his own trapeze.

     INT. HELICOPTER - THAT MOMENT

     In the bay of the helicopter stands a kid, fifteen, 
     compact, tough, and wiry: DICK GRAYSON. Like his parents, 
     he's wearing a red-and-green suit. From the copter, he's 
     got a perfect bird's-eye view of the BATMAN-JOKER chase.

                              PILOT
               Ready to go, Dick?

                              DICK
               What's all the ruckus down there?

     EXT. PARK - GROUND LEVEL - THAT MOMENT

     The VAN bounces over rocks and bushes, narrowly avoiding 
     trees, with BATMAN in hot pursuit.

     INT. VAN - THAT MOMENT

     At the foot of a hill, the JOKER spies a truck. On its 
     side, in bright red letters, a WARNING: "DANGER - 
     FIREWORKS. FLAMMABLE LOAD."

     The JOKER reaches into the back for a HIGHWAY FLARE.

                              JOKER
               Head for the truck!

     INT. HELICOPTER - THAT MOMENT

     Hovering over the chase scene, DICK catches sight of the 
     JOKER. He GASPS IN SHOCK as a LIT FLARE flies from the back 
     of the VAN... directly into the FIREWORKS TRUCK.

     EXT. PARK - GROUND LEVEL - A MOMENT LATER

     THE BATMAN is thrown off his horse by the shock of a 
     massive EXPLOSION. All at once, THE SKY IS FULL of 
     BURSTING, INCANDESCENT COLORS!!

     THE JOKER hangs out of the rear of the van, looking up, an 
     expression of PURE DELIGHT on his face.

                              JOKER
               I love fireworks!

     ANGLE ON HELICOPTERS

     LURCHING AND SPINNING IN THE SKY as FIREWORKS rocket past. 
     One of them takes a dead hit on the rotor. JOHN GRAYSON 
     falls to his death instantly; a moment later, the COPTER 
     plummets into the trees with a resounding, fiery CRASH.

     MARY GRAYSON hangs from the second copter as it bobs and 
     weaves out of control. ONLOOKERS SCREAM IN TERROR.

     EXT. STREET - THAT MOMENT

     THE JOKER'S VAN bursts out of the park and speeds up a 
     wide, cordoned-off avenue. Overhead, THE SECOND COPTER 
     veers wildly, out of the park now, swinging dangerously 
     close to the tall buildings along the avenue.

     INT. HELICOPTER - THAT MOMENT

     DICK GRAYSON at the mouth of the bay, hanging on by a 
     canvas strap. He watches helplessly as his MOTHER swings 
     into a POWER LINE and drops three stories to the pavement.

                              DICK
               NO! NOOOOOOOO!!!!

     His face is contorted with rage and pain. The PILOT 
     struggles desperately to right the copter, barely avoiding 
     a collision with the nearest building. And then -- before 
     THE PILOT can make a move to stop him -- DICK HAS JUMPED 
     OUT OF THE COPTER.

     ANGLE ON DICK

     With astonishing physical grace, he DIVES. GRABS A 
     FLAGPOLE. Executes a perfect somersault. FLIPS onto a 
     nearby fire escape. VAULTS to the next fire escape down. 
     And LEAPS OUT OVER THE STREET --

     -- MAKING A PERFECT TWO-POINT LANDING on his intended 
     target... THE ROOF OF THE JOKER'S VAN!!

     INT. VAN - THAT MOMENT

     THE JOKER hears a THUNK overhead. He casually lifts his gun 
     and BLOWS A HOLE THROUGH THE ROOF OF THE VAN.

     EXT. ROOF OF VAN - MOVING - THAT MOMENT

     The blast just misses DICK. He sprawls flat, YANKS at the 
     chrome luggage rack on the roof of the van, and BREAKS OFF 
     A FOUR-FOOT SHAFT OF METAL.

     ANOTHER SHOT through the roof. DICK rolls forward, hoists 
     his chrome spear over the windshield.

     INT. VAN - THAT MOMENT

     SPLINTERED GLASS flies everywhere as DICK RAMS THE SHAFT 
     THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD. THE DRIVER dodges left and LOSES 
     CONTROL OF THE WHEEL.

     EXT. ROOF OF VAN - MOVING - THAT MOMENT

     The VAN careens wildly toward an OVERPASS. DICK rises up 
     into a crouch just in time to see a sign which reads 
     "DANGER -- LOW CLEARANCE." He's about to get his head taken 
     off!

     ONE SECOND BEFORE IMPACT a BLACK-CAPED SHADOW swings across 
     the street and SCOOPS DICK OFF THE ROOF OF THE VAN.

     EXT. STREET - NIGHT

     BATMAN AND DICK tumble to the pavement. THE VAN knocks over 
     a fire hydrant and STOPS. DICK is already on his feet, 
     ready to CHARGE THE VAN, when BATMAN throws a powerful arm 
     around his waist.

                              DICK
               LET ME GO! LET ME --

     THE JOKER steps casually out of the van. TWO GOONS with 
     MACHINE GUNS emerge behind him. PEDESTRIANS SCREAM as the 
     GOONS level their guns at the CROWD.

                              DICK (cont.)
               YOU PIECE OF -- YOU MOTHERF--

     DICK is kicking, screaming, clawing, biting. BATMAN has his 
     hands full restraining the kid.

                              JOKER
               Like your boyfriend. He's kinda
               hot.
                     (glowering at BATMAN)
               Hands off the belt.

                              BATMAN
               Take me. Let the boy go.

                              JOKER
               Gosh, I could kill you, but then
               you'd miss my party. And I'd be
               real, real sad if you couldn't make
               it.

                              BATMAN
               What are you talking about?

                              JOKER
               Batman! Don't you even recognize
               your old pal Jack? After all... 
                     (cackling insanely)
               You made me what I am today.

     BATMAN cocks his head in puzzlement as DISTANT SIRENS 
     BLARE. The JOKER and his HOODS -- guns still aimed at the 
     crowd -- back away and race off on foot, vanishing into the 
     night.

     DICK BREAKS FREE and BOLTS AFTER THEM. BATMAN throws him to 
     the street with a flying tackle. The boy is hysterical.

                              DICK
               HE KILLED MY PARENTS! HE KILLED
               MY --

     BATMAN flinches at the sound of the words. He reaches into 
     his belt and -- mercifully -- breaks a KNOCKOUT CAPSULE 
     under DICK's nose.

                                                 DISSOLVE TO:

     INSERT - TELEVISION SCREEN

     A taped report from the hallway outside ALICIA's apartment. 
     COPS and FORENSICS MEN mill about in the b.g.

                              REPORTER
               ... on a tip attributed to the
               mysterious Batman. The apartment was
               booby-trapped with the Joker's
               laughing gas, leaving 17 policemen
               dead.
                     (beat)
               Also found dead at the scene was
               Alicia Hunt, 26, a former model --

     CAMERA PULLS BACK to reveal that the TV SCREEN is part of 
     BRUCE'S BANK OF MONITORS, deep in the Batcave. The other 
     screens show the various rooms of Wayne Manor, all empty.

     We move now to the video display of a COMPUTER WORKSTATION, 
     showing TWO FACES side-by-side: a mug shot of JACK NAPIER 
     and a freeze-frame of the JOKER from one of his pirate 
     transmissions. A GRAPHICS PROGRAM abstracts the twin heads 
     into THREE-DIMENSIONAL, ROTATING TOPOLOGICAL GRIDS -- and, 
     as we watch, the two spinning heads COLLIDE AND MERGE.
     Except for the fearsome grin, they MESH PERFECTLY.

     Yet another terminal: BRUCE's database. The same phrase
     flashes again and again, scrolling up the screen: ACE 
     CHEMICAL CO. ACE CHEMICAL CO. ACE CHEMICAL CO.

     And, finally: BRUCE HIMSELF, slumped at a table, his head 
     in his hands. He's realized, to his horror, that he is
     responsible for the birth of the Joker. And frankly...
     he would just as soon be dead.

     INT. WAYNE MANOR - GUEST BEDROOM - DAY

     DICK GRAYSON is sprawled on a huge four-poster bed, 
     unconscious, softly moaning. He COMES TO with a jolt.

     Breaking into a sweat almost instantly, he looks at his 
     unfamiliar surroundings. A shadowy figure stands nearby.

                              DICK
               ... Where am I?

                              BRUCE
               My name is Bruce Wayne. You're
               welcome to stay here as long as you
               want.

     BRUCE steps out just as ALFRED enters with a breakfast 
     tray. DICK makes a puzzled face. What the hell is going on 
     here?

     INT. HALL OF JUSTICE - DAY

     Beneath the statue of blind Justice, BRUCE and HARVEY DENT 
     march through the portico, engaged in a heated argument.

                              DENT
               We'll send a team into Ace the
               moment the warrant comes through.

                              BRUCE
               He'll be ready when you do. Remember
               what happened at the apartment.

                              DENT
               All right, Bruce, what do you
               suggest?

                              BRUCE
               I suggest a nice big bomb.

                              DENT
               Good. A bomb. On a blind tip from
               Bruce Wayne. -- We do have laws.

                              BRUCE
               Then for God's sake, Harvey, cancel
               the anniversary celebration.

                              DENT
               We've told him we'll deal. What
               could he possibly have to gain by --

                              BRUCE
               Do you still think the Joker cares
               about money??

                              DENT
               I don't know. I'm just a D.A. I
               don't have access to all your
               expert sources.

     Mexican standoff. BRUCE stalks off fuming. DENT hangs back 
     a moment, then turns down the hall.

     EXT. WAYNE MANOR - ESTABLISHING - DAY

     The ornate, wrought-iron GATE which opens on the long 
     driveway snaking up toward Wayne Manor. It's bolted shut.

     INT. WAYNE MANOR - DAY

     A glass-enclosed room which houses an enormous HEATED 
     INDOOR SWIMMING POOL. DICK GRAYSON does a couple of laps, 
     then climbs out and towels himself off.

     He looks out at the estate: tennis courts, a riding stable 
     in the distance. He's not happy. All this opulence could 
     drive a guy stark staring nuts in short order.

     INT. GUEST BEDROOM - DAY

     An OPEN SUITCASE on the bed. DICK fingers a gold ashtray 
     bearing the figure of Winged Victory -- then shrugs and 
     tosses it into the suitcase on top of his gymnast's 
     costume. When he looks up he sees BRUCE in the doorway 
     behind him.

                              DICK
               ... Your butler wouldn't gimme a ride
               so I figured I'd hoof it.

                              BRUCE
               Sorry. I can't let you leave.

                              DICK
               You can't keep me here, man. That's
               kidnapping.

                              BRUCE
               If I let you leave, you'll do the
               same thing again. You'll go after
               the Joker... and you'll wind up dead.
                     (turning to go)

                              DICK
               Hey, man. Look at you. You're
               rich. You got everything you want.
               How do you know what's in my mind?

     BRUCE turns to face him. The little hellion's eyes are 
     filled with raw, burning hatred. BRUCE knows the feeling.

                              BRUCE
               I don't care what's in your mind.
               You're staying.

     BRUCE reaches for a key in his pocket. Without warning, the 
     kid RUSHES him, throwing a rock-solid punch. With blinding 
     speed, BRUCE sidesteps him, parries the blow, and winds up 
     spinning DICK around -- INTO A WALL.

     DICK is stunned, but he has to laugh. This rich boy has a 
     move or two. BRUCE stands there, silently challenging him.

     A second later, the kid is airborne -- upping the ante with 
     a scissor-kick aimed squarely at BRUCE's gut. In a blur of 
     motion BRUCE checks the kick, swings an arm into DICK's 
     chest, and sends the boy sprawling flat on his back.

     INT. WAYNE MANOR - KITCHEN - THAT MOMENT

     ALFRED, in his apron, fixing a tray of snacks. He looks up 
     curiously at the ceiling. From the sound of it, a battle 
     royal is shaping up in the guest bedroom.

     INT. GUEST BEDROOM - THAT MOMENT

     DICK'S BODY -- head down, feet up -- flies through the air. 
     He SMASHES INTO a closet door and slumps to the carpet. 
     Shaken now, and sweating profusely, he looks up at BRUCE... 
     who stands calmly over him, adjusting his necktie.

     A long, tense moment passes between them. Then:

                              DICK
               ... You're him.

     No reply from BRUCE. Their gazes lock. And suddenly... 

                              ALFRED (V.O.)
               FREEZE!

     DICK and BRUCE look around. The puny, mustachioed butler 
     stands in the doorway, feet spread in a Dirty Harry stance, 
     a .44 MAGNUM trained on DICK.

                              BRUCE
               It's all right, Alfred. Everything's
               under control.

                              ALFRED
               ... Very good, sir.

     ALFRED relaxes, musters his dignity, and turns to go.

                                                 CUT TO:

     INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - AFTERNOON

     CANNED APPLAUSE as THE JOKER marches out onto a makeshift 
     STAGE to give his QUARTERLY REPORT to the stockholders.

                              JOKER
               Thankya, thankya. Ladies and germs,
               I'm here to tell you... we have had
               one helluva quarter.

     He waves a pointer at three SALES CHARTS on portable 
     easels.

                              JOKER (cont.)
               Panic's up. Terror's up. And fear --
               fear's gone straight through the
               roof. You guys should be proud --
               'cause I couldn'ta done it without
               each and every one of you!

     MORE CANNED APPLAUSE. The JOKER takes a bow.

                              JOKER (cont.)
               I feel it's time to expand the
               Joker line. I was askin' myself,
               what are the products that every
               consumer wants most? And that's when
               it hit me: the water you drink, and
               the air you breathe! Huh? Bingo!
                     (strutting across stage)
               Now, some of you have your eye on
               the profit margin. You're thinkin':
               this boy's too ambitious. You
               don't approve. In fact, some of you
               have been talking about turning me
               in to the cops. Or knocking me off.

     He pauses. GLARES OUT at the audience. NO RESPONSE.

                              JOKER (cont.)
               But that's okay. I understand. Not
               everyone shares my eye for beauty.
               And just to show there's no hard
               feelings, I'm throwin' a little
               shindig tonight -- and you're all
               invited!

     THE CANNED APPLAUSE goes right off the meter.

                              JOKER (cont.)
               How 'bout it? IS EVERYBODY HAPPY??

     REVERSE ANGLE - THE AUDIENCE

     Familiar faces all around -- the major players of the 
     Gotham underworld. But despite the enormous twisted grins, 
     no one here is laughing or applauding. No one here is
     living. The JOKER is playing to a roomful of smiling 
     corpses.

     One of them topples out of his chair and lands with a plop.

                              JOKER
               Look at that, folks. We got 'em
               rolling in the aisles!

                                                 CUT TO:

     INT. BRUCE'S BEDROOM - TOWARD DUSK

     VICKI lies in BRUCE's bed, under the covers, propped up on 
     the pillows. BRUCE is in his robe over by the window, 
     looking out at his estate.

                              BRUCE
               All this apparatus, Vicki... this
               house, and the money, and the
               power... it was never mine. It was
               something I inherited. Bruce Wayne
               was something I inherited.
                     (pause)
               All I ever hoped for was someone who
               could see through Bruce -- who could
               see me -- and not be frightened.

                              VICKI
               I'm not frightened of you, Bruce.
               I'm frightened for you.

                              BRUCE
               In all these years... why couldn't I
               see how it would turn out?

     He turns toward her. His face is ravaged with guilt. Now 
     she's truly afraid.

                              BRUCE (cont.)
               I'm responsible, Vicki. If it wasn't
               for me, there'd be no Joker.

                                                 CUT TO:

     INT. BATCAVE - EVENING

     TIGHT ON a tiny electronic device: two cylindrical steel 
     casings bracketed together, topped by a DIGITAL TIMER. 
     BRUCE makes a few adjustments with a jeweler's screwdriver, 
     hits a trigger, and watches the TIMER tick off seconds. 30. 
     29. 28. At 25 seconds, BRUCE kills the
     countdown and CLAMPS THE DEVICE into an empty packet on his 
     utility belt.

     He stands up wearily. He's in his bat-suit, minus the cape 
     and cowl. Behind him, hanging back discreetly in the 
     shadows, is his loyal butler ALFRED.

                              BRUCE
               Where's the boy?

                              ALFRED
               Upstairs. He's quite docile.

                              BRUCE
               I know that feeling. It won't last.

     BRUCE takes a moment to survey the Batcave as ALFRED looks 
     on tremulously.

                              BRUCE (cont.)
               He's a long way ahead of where I was
               at his age.
                     (taking ALFRED's
                      shoulders)
               I want you to treat him just as if
               he were me. Promise.

                              ALFRED
               Yes, sir.

                              BRUCE
               He'll be taken care of financially.
               Beyond that... you know what to do.
               Don't let all this go to waste.

     Their eyes lock for a long moment. ALFRED is unable to 
     speak. Finally BRUCE turns and starts slowly up the long 
     circular stairway which leads from the Batcave to Wayne 
     Manor. On the third step he pauses:

                              BRUCE (cont.)
               Alfred? -- Thank you.

     As BRUCE disappears up the stairs, a shaken ALFRED steadies 
     himself against a lab table, fighting back tears.

     INT. BRUCE'S BEDROOM - EVENING

     BRUCE draws the curtains, sets an alarm clock. The current 
     time is 7:09 PM.

     He sits cross-legged on the floor, slumps forward slightly, 
     and closes his eyes. He inhales, exhales, taking deep, 
     regular breaths. His muscles relax. Ten seconds later, 
     BRUCE has plunged into DEEP SLEEP.

     Time passes. The clock shows 7:19, 7:32.

     At 7:44 we TRACK IN on BRUCE's unconscious face, drawing 
     closer and closer until HIS EYELIDS FILL THE FRAME, 
     twitching with the irregular movement characteristic of 
     R.E.M. sleep. Without warning his EYES SNAP OPEN.

     HOLD ON BRUCE'S GAZE -- grim, alert, determined -- as the 
     clock hits 7:45. An ALARM SOUNDS, BREAKING THE SILENCE with 
     its grating electronic WHINE.

                                                 DISSOLVE TO:

     EXT. ACE CHEMICAL - AERIAL SHOT - NIGHT

     The trademark ace on the illuminated sign. From our vantage 
     point high above, we can see THREE CARGO TRUCKS rolling out 
     the main gates. A half-mile away, THE BATMOBILE cruises up 
     the waterfront, approaching soundlessly, its headlights 
     off... preparing for a final showdown with the JOKER's 
     forces.

     INT. ACE CHEMICAL - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT

     The JOKER'S MINIONS, working late, readying a huge 
     shipment. At an open loading bay, we find a DISPATCHER with 
     a clipboard, directing MORE UNMARKED TRUCKS in the lot 
     outside.

                              DISPATCHER
               Boston, Philly: loading bay one.

     EXT. ACE CHEMICAL - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT

     The BATMOBILE stops short of the main gate. ENGINES ROAR 
     and the supercar ACCELERATES, SMASHING THROUGH THE GATE and 
     taking half the chain-link fence with it.

     In the guard's booth, ARMED GOONS pull guns as the 
     BATMOBILE streaks across the parking lot and LAUNCHES A 
     ROCKET at the corrugated metal door which opens on the 
     factory floor. A THUNDEROUS EXPLOSION tears a gaping hole 
     in the door.

     INT. ACE CHEMICAL - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT

     The BATMOBILE cruises through the flaming wreckage and 
     SKIDS TO A HALT on the refinery floor. The JOKER'S MEN are 
     everywhere. They take one look at the BATMOBILE, PANIC, and 
     PELT THE CAR with a barrage of MACHINE-GUN FIRE.

     CRACKS begin to spread across the Batmobile's plexiglass 
     dome. Within moments, the windshield SHATTERS -- and 
     COLLAPSES ALTOGETHER.

     INT. BATMOBILE - THAT MOMENT

     BULLETS rip through the upholstered passenger seats. It 
     doesn't matter. The car is empty. No one's driving.

     TRACK IN on the computer console -- where a familiar tinny 
     voice calmly repeats its pre-programmed command:

                              COMPUTER
               ... Detonate.

     A beat. Then: BLAM.

     INT. POLICE CAR - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT

     A CONVOY approaches Ace Chemical -- GORDON's team preparing 
     to raid the plant. Inside each car: SPECIAL UNIT COPS 
     dressed in asbestos suits, gas masks in their laps.

     All at once, a BRILLIANT RED GLARE suffuses the sky.

                              COP
                    Good Lord!

     EXT. ACE CHEMICAL - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT

     THE JOKER'S MEN running for their lives across the parking 
     lot, KNOCKED FLAT by the force of SIX DEAFENING EXPLOSIONS. 
     For a few seconds everything is flame and fury. And then --

     All that's left of Ace Chemical is a pile of charred rubble 
     and a PILLAR OF THICK BLACK SMOKE, spiraling up to the sky.

                                                 CUT TO:

     EXT. ANDREWS ISLAND - NIGHT

     DAZZLING FIREWORKS explode in the night sky over Gotham 
     Harbor. SEARCHLIGHTS sweep across the mammoth, welcoming 
     stone figure of LADY GOTHAM -- still wrapped in canvas, 
     ready to be unveiled.

     THOUSANDS OF RUBBERNECKERS jam every square inch of 
     Andrew's Island. COPS ON HORSEBACK speak into walkie-
     talkies as they patrol the edges of the crowd. Across the 
     Harbor, Ace Chemical is going up in flames -- but as far as 
     the crowd can tell, with all the noise and excitement, it's 
     just another part of the celebration.

     At the base of the statue, GOVERNOR GILROY speaks into a 
     microphone:

                              GOVERNOR GILROY
               As Governor of this great state, it
               is now my honor to unveil for you a
               very special lady -- a lady who
               stands tall for life and liberty --
               America's favorite lady... LADY
               GOTHAM!

     The CROWD begins to APPLAUD RHYTHMICALLY, chanting 'LADY 
     GOTHAM! LADY GOTHAM!' It's like Times Square on New Year's 
     Eve, waiting for the big ball to drop. GILROY hoists a pair 
     of oversized scissors and cuts a ceremonial ribbon: 
     hydraulic CRANES kick into gear: CABLES DROP FREE, and the 
     canvas cover draws back from LADY GOTHAM's face... 

     ... to a chorus of SCREAMS from the crowd. LADY GOTHAM IS
     WEARING A GRISLY JOKER GRIN!!!

     Suddenly -- in the midst of the hysteria -- THE 
     SEARCHLIGHTS DIE. The STAGE LIGHTS BLINK OUT. ANDREWS 
     ISLAND IS PLUNGED INTO DARKNESS. Instantaneous mass panic: 
     the GOVERNOR shouts to his aides as ONLOOKERS mob the 
     stage. COPS are knocked from their horses as the CROWD 
     stampedes. PANDEMONIUM RULES.

     And across the harbor... block by block... GOTHAM CITY IS 
     GOING DARK.

     EXT. GOTHAM SKIES - AERIAL SHOTS - NIGHT

     QUICK SHOTS of FOUR HELICOPTERS hovering at different 
     points over the blacked-out city. LOUDSPEAKERS blare out a 
     PRE-RECORDED MESSAGE:

                              JOKER (V.O.)
               HAPPY BIRTHDAY, Gotham. Here's a
               little token of my esteem. HAVE
               FUN... 'cause THE PARTY'S ON ME!

     INSANE LAUGHTER echoes. CARGO BAYS open wide. The JOKER'S 
     HELICOPTERS begin LEAFLETING THE CITY... with MONEY!

     SERIES OF SHOTS

     ANARCHY IN GOTHAM as high-denomination bills flutter to 
     earth, blanketing the streets. HOPELESSLY OUTMANNED COPS 
     try to maintain order as SOLID CITIZENS trample one another 
     in a paroxysm of ANIMAL GREED. BUILDINGS EMPTY as APARTMENT 
     DWELLERS race outside. ALL TRAFFIC STOPS as DRIVERS climb 
     out of their cars to SNATCH MONEY FROM THE AIR.

     DARKNESS EVERYWHERE. In the pitch-black subways, TERRIFIED 
     COMMUTERS are seized by claustrophobia. GLASS SHATTERS, 
     DOORS BREAK OPEN as they claw their way out of stalled 
     subway cars and SPILL OUT onto the tracks.

     On the streets above, GOTHAM'S CRIMINAL ELEMENT is having a 
     field day. The cops are preoccupied, utterly helpless 
     against the first waves of RIOTING AND LOOTING.

     FLAMES ERUPT. PUNKS race down the street carrying fur coats 
     and color TV's. LOOTERS break through the display window of 
     an electronics store, and climb in among the goodies... 
     only to FLY OUT, two seconds later, on the wrong end of a 
     SHOTGUN BLAST. THE JOKER'S DREAM IS COMING TRUE.

     EXT. STREET - NIGHT

     In a crouch on the pavement, snapping photos of the wild 
     street action, is VICKI -- fearless, professional, doing
     her job. A battered FORD ESCORT cruises up behind her.

                              KNOX
               VICKI!

     VICKI sees KNOX, climbs into the passenger seat. He's 
     wearing a big smile. They're jazzed, oblivious to danger.

                              KNOX (cont.)
               Couldn't turn down the job, huh? A
               girl could get hurt this way.

                              VICKI
               Yeah. Deja vu.

                              KNOX
               What do you say? Let's head for the
               lights.

     In the distance, above the tops of the buildings, BEACONS 
     are sweeping the sky.

     EXT. BROAD AVENUE - NIGHT

     Stationed all up and down Gotham's widest thoroughfare are
     huge portable SEARCHLIGHTS -- mounted on trucks with
     portable generators, unaffected by the power outage.

     On the money-covered sidewalks, TOTAL BEDLAM. But on the 
     street itself, a bizarre PARADE is taking place, just as if 
     nothing's wrong. Rumbling up the avenue at two-block  
     intervals, moored to floats, are DOZENS OF ENORMOUS 
     BALLOONS in the shapes of cartoon characters and historical 
     figures. It's like a hellish Thanksgiving's day procession.

     The LEAD-OFF BALLOON is a gigantic, grotesque CLOWN -- 
     smiling ghoulishly, dressed in white pierrot frills. We 
     TILT DOWN to the FLOAT BENEATH IT... 

     ... and there, atop a mountain of roses where the prom
     queen should be, sits the JOKER -- smiling, waving daintily 
     at the rioters and looters, presiding over the carnage like 
     some demented parade marshal.

                                                 CUT TO:

     EXT. LAKE - NIGHT

     A desolate rural setting. UTTER SILENCE. Moonlight glints 
     on placid waters. We track in on a small sign bearing the 
     legend: "GOTHAM CITY RESERVOIR."

     Far off in the distance, HEADLIGHTS ARE APPROACHING.

     EXT. ACCESS ROAD - AERIAL SHOT - MOVING - NIGHT

     The THREE CARGO TRUCKS from Ace Chemical roll ominously 
     TOWARD THE RESERVOIR on their deadly mission. And then -- A 
     STREAKING BLACK SHADOW ENTERS FRAME, overtaking the TRUCKS.

     THE BATWING! A phenomenal ULTRALIGHT AIRCRAFT, swift, 
     sleek, jet-black and infinitely maneuverable, it SOARS 
     EASILY past the trucks, swooping low just long enough to 
     release a BOMB over a concrete bridge.

     EXT. ACCESS ROAD - A MOMENT LATER

     The BRIDGE EXPLODES, blocking the trucks' path to the 
     reservoir. PUZZLED DRIVERS climb out of their cabs and 
     wonder what to do next.

     They spot the BATWING in the distance -- banking, doing a 
     sharp 180. For a moment they gape in disbelief. Then they 
     HEAD FOR THE TREES as the BATWING DIVES DIRECTLY AT THE 
     TRUCKS, firing THREE ARMOR-PIERCING SHELLS... and 
     destroying the JOKER's lethal cargo once and for all.

     ANGLE ON BATMAN

     in the cockpit, his jaw set, not even looking back at the 
     wreckage as his plane screams off toward the Gotham 
     skyline.

     EXT. GOTHAM STREET - NIGHT

     FRIGHTENED PEDESTRIANS race past OVERTURNED CARS. A PARADE 
     FLOAT, run aground on the sidewalk, begins to BURN.

     Above it, a damaged BALLOON -- the cartoon character 
     UNDERDOG -- is losing helium, warping and buckling in on 
     itself, sinking down gently toward the flames. Down the 
     street, KNOX'S FORD ESCORT is coming up fast.

     INT. FORD - MOVING - THAT MOMENT

     VICKI snapping photos out the window as UNDERDOG drifts 
     downward. FLAMES lick up at his belly -- and the cartoon 
     blimp EXPLODES.

                              KNOX
               So much for Underdog.

     THEN -- as they drive past -- A SECOND EXPLOSION. And all 
     at once the STREET IS FULL OF DEADLY GREENISH GAS!

                              VICKI
               ALLIE!! THE WINDOWS!!

     EXT. STREET - A MOMENT LATER - NIGHT

     The Ford Escort, windows up, swerves out of a THICK 
     SPREADING CLOUD of GREEN LAUGHING GAS -- threatening to 
     engulf the entire block!

     INT. FORD - MOVING - THAT MOMENT

                              KNOX
               WHAT HAPPENED?!?

     VICKI stares back at the green cloud. Turns. And sees, up 
     the street, THE JOKER'S PROCESSION: BALLOONS BY THE DOZEN!

                              VICKI
               Oh my God. Compressor tanks. He's
               got the balloons rigged with
               compressor tanks!!

                              KNOX
               Jesus Christ, the guy's a genius.

     INT. BATWING - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT

     BATMAN, at the controls, gliding over the Gotham streets. 
     He looks down, sees a BILLOWING HAZE of DENSE GREEN FUMES. 
     At its periphery: LOOTERS reeling and staggering, falling 
     to the pavement, LAUGHING THEMSELVES TO DEATH.

     INT. FORD - MOVING - THAT MOMENT

     VICKI staring through the windshield. Overhead, an AIRCRAFT 
     streaks past... an aircraft with SCALLOPED BLACK BAT WINGS.

                              VICKI
               LOOK! IT'S BRUCE!!
                     (frantically)
               Allie -- the balloons. We've got to
               find some way to tell him!

                              KNOX
               Great. How??

     They speed up the street toward the PARADE. SPOTLIGHTS 
     SHINE. Suddenly KNOX's eyes bug out. He SLAMS ON THE BRAKES 
     and SKIDS TO A HALT.

                              KNOX (cont.)
               COME ON!

     EXT. AVENUE - A SECOND LATER - NIGHT

     Before VICKI can speak, KNOX has grabbed a tire iron from 
     the back of the car and RACED OUT ONTO THE STREET. He 
     flings the TIRE IRON through a glass STOREFRONT.

     It's a COSTUME SHOP. In the window, MANNEQUINS dressed in 
     party costumes: Frankenstein. Ronald Reagan. And, that 
     current popular sensation... THE BATMAN.

     As VICKI catches up with him, KNOX drags the Batman dummy 
     out of the store window. RIPS OFF ITS BLACK CAPE. And 
     DASHES MANIACALLY UP THE SIDEWALK.

     Waving the cape, he VAULTS onto the back of a SPOTLIGHT 
     TRUCK. VICKI's face goes slack. Now she gets it.

                              KNOX
               GIMME A HAND UP HERE!

     VICKI climbs aboard. They drape the cape over the face of 
     the spotlight. Then they put their shoulders to the swivel 
     assembly -- tilting the spotlight -- AIMING THE BEAM... 

     ... DIRECTLY AT THE JOKER'S WHITE CLOWN BALLOON!!!

     INT. BATWING - THAT MOMENT

     BATMAN stares at the CLOWN BALLOON dead ahead. On its 
     massive distended belly... a BURNING YELLOW OVAL. And in 
     the center of the oval... THE BLACK SILHOUETTE OF A BAT.

     BATMAN'S MOUTH drops open. He understands.

     EXT. AVENUE - ON JOKER'S FLOAT - THAT MOMENT

     THE JOKER reaches into a big sack and begins distributing 
     MINIATURE GAS MASKS, like party favors, to his cronies on 
     the float. Then he pulls out a radio-operated REMOTE 
     CONTROL DEVICE and points it up at the CLOWN BALLOON.

     He hits a button. The CLOWN begins to INFLATE. Its joints 
     bulge. Its FACE SWELLS UP as the COMPRESSOR TANK concealed 
     inside it releases its noxious contents. The JOKER is 
     BEAMING, a look of PURE UNALLOYED JOY on his face... 

     ... when his PARADE FLOAT BLOWS TO SMITHEREENS BENEATH HIM! 
     The JOKER and his men CARTWHEEL THROUGH THE AIR and TUMBLE 
     TO THE ASPHALT as THE BATWING WHIPS PAST OVERHEAD, soaring 
     through the stone canyons of Gotham at a 90-degree angle to 
     the ground!

                              JOKER
               No... NOOOOO!!!

     ANGLE ON CLOWN BALLOON

     as it rises, rises, swelling to grotesque proportions in 
     the starless night. The tallest buildings are far below it 
     now. Finally it BURSTS -- and the deadly GAS inside it 
     disperses harmlessly in the wind.

     EXT. AVENUE - THAT MOMENT

     THE JOKER on the edge of a tantrum as he digs amid the 
     rubble of his float for the remote device. At last he finds 
     it; aims it up at the other balloons in the procession; 
     hits a button repeatedly... 

     ... and HOWLS IN FRUSTRATION. Nothing's happening. The 
     damned thing is broken. He heaves it to the street in a
     fit of pique.

     A SCREAMING COMES ACROSS THE SKY as the BATWING swings back 
     for another pass, BUZZING the JOKER at an altitude of 
     twenty feet. SIZZLING LASER FIRE sweeps the street.

     CABLES SNAP and BALLOONS DRIFT UPWARD as BATMAN'S LASERS 
     sever their moorings. The JOKER can only look on 
     helplessly, in stunned disbelief.

     As he's watching his plans evaporate... HIS EYES FALL ON 
     THE MAKESHIFT BAT-SIGNAL.

                              JOKER
               There. There. -- GET 'EM!!

     ANGLE ON SPOTLIGHT TRUCK

     A SPRAY OF MACHINE-GUN FIRE shatters the Bat-signal. KNOX 
     throws VICKI to the street, ducks down behind the 
     spotlight, and tosses her his CAR KEYS.

                              KNOX
               GET THE CAR!

     The JOKER'S GOONS are coming up fast as VICKI reaches the 
     Ford, starts it, and comes ROARING UP toward KNOX. He jumps 
     off the truck as VICKI twists the wheel, lays a track of 
     rubber, and noses the car back in the opposite direction.

     GUNFIRE as KNOX jumps inside and they PEEL OUT.

     INT. FORD ESCORT - MOVING - A MOMENT LATER

     KNOX's breathing is ragged, but he breaks out in HYSTERICAL 
     LAUGHTER nonetheless. The two of them are totally 
     exhilarated. They can't believe what they've just done.

                              KNOX
               HOLY SHIT!!

                              VICKI
               You okay?

                              KNOX
               Yeah. Yeah. Little winded. DID YOU
               SEE THAT?!

                              VICKI
                     (laughing wildly)
               God yes, Allie. I've gotta say --
               that was the ballsiest move I
               ever --

                              KNOX
                     (ecstatic)
               Holy shit. Holy --

     He GURGLES. AN ENORMOUS GOUT OF BLOOD bubbles up between 
     his lips -- and BURSTS.

                              VICKI
               ALLIE!!

     His hand goes to his stomach -- and comes away bloody. He 
     looks down in genuine bewilderment.

                              KNOX
               Jesus, Vicki.

     That quickly, he's dead. VICKI lets out an awful wail and 
     slams on the brakes. She sits there in the middle of the 
     street, POUNDING THE WHEEL, TEARS pouring down her face.

     EXT. GOTHAM HARBOR - NIGHT

     In the sky, CARTOON CHARACTERS drift lazily out to sea.

     EXT. BROAD AVENUE - NIGHT

     THE JOKER and his boys running like hell down the avenue, 
     past the parade. They reach the last of the floats -- the 
     one bringing up the rear -- then CLIMB ABOARD and disappear 
     through a CONCEALED HATCH.

     WOOD SPLINTERS as the top of the float begins to ROTATE 
     mysteriously. The muzzle of a CANNON breaks through the 
     parade decorations. And one moment later... 

     A ROSE-COVERED TANK is rumbling up Broad Avenue!

     INT. BATWING - THAT MOMENT

     BATMAN sweeps past overhead. He sees the tank, unleashes a 
     burst of LASER FIRE. It bounces harmlessly off the tank, 
     leaves a trail of SMOKING ASPHALT on the street. He swoops 
     low overhead, hits a button on his control panel as he 
     streaks OVER THE TANK and into firing range.

     INT. TANK - THAT MOMENT

     THE JOKER and his MEN clap hands to their ears as an EAR-
     SPLITTING ULTRASONIC SHRIEK reverberates in the tank. The 
     JOKER screams out commands, to no avail. No one can hear
     him. He falls on the controls, begins hitting buttons.

     EXT. STREET - THAT MOMENT

     The TANK TURRET swings wildly. A HEAT-SEEKING MISSILE rips 
     through the night, narrowly missing the BATWING... and 
     BLOWING A HOLE in the side of a skyscraper.

     INT. BATWING - THAT MOMENT

     THE BLAST all but knocks the BATWING out of the sky. BATMAN 
     stabilizes the plane, climbs for the clouds. When he's 
     clear of the buildings, he grits his teeth and rolls out.

     He's coming back for more!

     INT. TANK - THAT MOMENT

     The JOKER stares at a tiny BLIP on his radar screen.

                              JOKER
               He'll be back... he'll be back!!

     EXT. BROAD AVENUE - ON BATWING

     The black ultralight hurtles down Broad Avenue at full 
     speed, on a suicide mission. MISSILES streak past on either 
     side. MACHINE GUN FIRE peppers the dome of the cockpit. The 
     REAR STABILIZER WING takes a direct hit... and BURSTS INTO 
     FLAME!

     The BATWING, trailing thick black smoke, bears down on the 
     tank like a kamikaze plane. BOMB BAYS OPEN as BATMAN dumps 
     the last of his high explosives DIRECTLY INTO THE PATH OF 
     THE TANK. The BATWING takes a hard bounce off the top of 
     the tank and CRASHES TO THE STREET.

     And suddenly a GAPING CHASM opens underneath the tank as 
     the bombs go off -- and BROAD AVENUE BEGINS TO SPLIT WIDE 
     OPEN!

     INT. SUBWAY TUNNEL - THAT MOMENT

     BROKEN CONCRETE SLABS rain down on a SUBWAY CAR stalled in 
     the tunnel DIRECTLY BENEATH BROAD AVENUE. SUPPORT GIRDERS 
     groan and GIVE WAY as the STREET ITSELF COLLAPSES -- and 
     the front end of the TANK drops through, CRUSHING THE 
     SUBWAY TRAIN BENEATH IT!

     EXT. BROAD AVENUE - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT

     The rear end of the TANK projects out through the rubble. A 
     hatch pops open. The JOKER crawls out through the smoke and 
     pulls himself up to the street.

     He's down to his last three GOONS. He points to the 
     BATWING: bent, broken, WEDGED ON ITS SIDE in the asphalt 
     SEAM running up Broad Avenue -- half in, half out of the 
     tunnel.

                              JOKER
               You do him. I'm outta here.

     The GOONS look on in dismay as the JOKER scurries off. They 
     sidestep blackened debris and move up cautiously on the 
     Batwing. Through the cockpit dome they can see BATMAN... 
     inert in his harness, beaten to a pulp, all but dead.

     A JET OF FLAME drives them back momentarily. They reach for 
     their guns, move in warily... 

                              VOICE
               Yo.

     The frightened GOONS turn in unison. An abrupt flurry of 
     motion -- feet and fists flying -- quick flashes of red and 
     green --

     -- and THREE GOONS lie paralyzed on the street. The only 
     one left standing is a fifteen-year-old boy garbed in a 
     red-and-green aerialist's uniform... DICK GRAYSON.

     INT. BATWING - THAT MOMENT

     BATMAN slumps at the controls. Beneath him, asphalt SHIFTS 
     and BUCKLES. The Batwing lurches to the right, drops a foot 
     or two into the tunnel. Metal braces collapse and the 
     plexiglass dome of the cockpit SHATTERS LIKE AN EGGSHELL.

     TONGUES OF FIRE lick at his face. He's helpless, pinned in 
     place. He manages to look up -- and SEES, through a dream-
     like haze, A HAND extended toward him:

                              DICK
               HEY! COME ON!

     And suddenly DICK is clambering down into the flaming 
     wreckage. He gets an arm around BATMAN's chest and with an 
     extraordinary effort HAULS HIM OUT OF THE BATWING.

     EXT. STREET - A MOMENT LATER - NIGHT

     They stagger across the ruptured street. BATMAN grimaces in 
     agony. His right leg -- shattered -- is like rubber beneath 
     him. His ribs are crushed. He's barely conscious.

                              DICK
               Now we're even, huh? Even up.

                              BATMAN
               How did you... 

                              DICK
               I hitched. MOVE IT!

     DICK drags BATMAN to safety as the Batwing ERUPTS INTO 
     FLAME behind them.

                              BATMAN
               The Joker. Is he --?

                              DICK
               Forget it. Relax.
                     (beat)
               ... He's mine now.

     DICK snatches an abandoned .38 off the pavement.

                              BATMAN
               DICK!

     THE BATMAN tries to pull himself erect. The pain is 
     unendurable. His body has finally failed him.

     He collapses on the pavement, powerless to intervene, as 
     DICK races off with murder in his eyes.

     EXT. GOTHAM CATHEDRAL - NIGHT

     A BELLTOWER's jagged spire, jutting up into the night sky, 
     piercing the moon. Down at street level, the JOKER is 
     scrambling up the marble steps at the entrance to the old 
     abandoned cathedral. He pulls a WALKIE-TALKIE off his belt.

                              JOKER
               Gotham cathedral. Come and get me.

     HEAVY PANELED DOORS groan on tired hinges as THE JOKER 
     forces his way inside. A beat. Then DICK GRAYSON appears, 
     hot on his trail, sprinting up the steps two at a time.

     INT. CATHEDRAL - A MOMENT LATER - NIGHT

     Ancient and creepy. A huge pipe organ, shattered stained
     glass windows, row after row of mahogany pews... all 
     forgotten, covered with dust and cobwebs. The JOKER wanders 
     about, staring at the statuary, the rusted icons.

     DICK enters silently behind him. He kneels behind a rear 
     pew, brings up the gun, and squeezes off THREE QUICK SHOTS 
     at the JOKER. The JOKER dives, takes cover, and RETURNS 
     DICK'S FIRE. Then: silence.

     In a crouch, groping his way along the wall, THE JOKER 
     finds what he wants: a small door opening on a wooden 
     stairway, leading to the belltower. He ducks inside and 
     starts up.

     DICK'S GUN drops with a thud. His hand slips from the back 
     of the pew. In the second before he slumps to the floor, 
     unconscious, he sees a curious sight: a TINY BLACK NINJA 
     WHEEL, imbedded in the flesh of his leg.

     Behind him -- framed in the arched doorway -- A RAGGED 
     BLACK GHOST begins his final unholy march down the center 
     aisle of the old cathedral.

     INT. CATHEDRAL - BELLTOWER - NIGHT

     A tiny stone chamber, 8'x8', open on four sides to the 
     wind. The enormous church bell has long since been removed.

     The JOKER stands in an archway, gazing at the gargoyles on 
     the roof below. He hits a button on the walkie-talkie:

                              JOKER
               I'm in the belltower. Don't land.

     INT. HELICOPTER - MOVING - NIGHT

     A PILOT replies through his radio headset.

                              PILOT
               E.T.A. two minutes. Hang on.

     The PILOT swings the copter right in a wide, swooping arc.

     INT. STAIRWAY TO BELLTOWER - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT

     BATMAN. Broken, beaten, his right leg useless, he hauls 
     himself up the steps one at a time. He should be dead.
     Dried blood cakes his face, his chest.

     Dizzy, exhausted, his body strained to the limit, he slumps 
     against a wall to steady himself, then reaches into his 
     utility belt for a painkiller -- and forces the capsule 
     back onto his dry, swollen tongue.

     Quaking all over, he tries to draw himself erect... and 
     TOPPLES OVER, landing with his full weight on the rotten 
     wood of the belltower stairs.

     THE STAIRWAY COLLAPSES, turning to splinters beneath him. 
     And suddenly BATMAN finds himself DANGLING PRECARIOUSLY IN 
     MIDAIR, hanging by one hand to an upper step.

     It would be so much easier to let go. He looks down at the 
     fragments of the shattered stairway, STILL FALLING, 
     vanishing into the dark depths of the stairwell.

     Then he looks up. At the trapdoor. A mere six feet away. 
     His TEETH CLENCH in a monstrous grimace. AND WITH AN 
     INHUMAN EFFORT, HE HOISTS HIMSELF UP ONTO THE UPPER STEPS.

     For a full five seconds he's blind with pain. A RAGGED 
     WOODEN SHAFT is buried in his right shoulder. Twitching, 
     trembling, he reaches up and YANKS IT OUT with his last 
     ounce of strength.

     The trapdoor is a foot above his head. It could be a mile. 
     BATMAN finally realizes he's not going to make it.

     He reaches down and rips open a Velcro seal on his utility 
     belt, revealing the strange TIMER DEVICE we saw him making 
     earlier. Before he can activate it his hand falls limply at 
     his side.

     THE BATMAN is out like a light.

     INT. BELLTOWER - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT

     The JOKER glances casually down at the trapdoor, wondering 
     what all the noise is about. He draws his gun, moves 
     cautiously to the trapdoor, and lifts it a few inches... 
     just enough to see the unconscious form on the stairs.

                              JOKER
               ... Batman?

     No reply. The JOKER stands there and lets out a little 
     snicker. He looks out through the archway, sees no sign of 
     his rescue copter. Then -- a look of curious amusement on 
     his face -- he steps down THROUGH THE TRAPDOOR and LUGS 
     BATMAN up into the belltower.

     He props BATMAN up against a wall. Still no sign of life. 
     The JOKER crouches beside him and -- almost tenderly -- 
     pats his face.

                              JOKER (cont.)
               Batman? Batman?

     THE BATMAN's lips part. But he's too weak to speak.

                              JOKER (cont.)
               I thought you'd be more comfortable
               here in the belfry.
                     (chuckling to himself)
               Before I kill you I'd like to see
               who you are. Would that be okay?

     BATMAN emits a tiny low moan. The JOKER takes it as a yes 
     and reaches over to undo his cowl.

     BRUCE WAYNE stares up with dulled, sightless eyes. The 
     JOKER reaches into his pocket for a purple handkerchief, 
     moistens it, dabs at the caked blood on BRUCE's face.

                              JOKER (cont.)
               Oh my, aren't we pretty.
                     (brightening suddenly)
               I know you! You're the rich boy!!

     The JOKER is enormously tickled by this discovery. He claps 
     his hands together in sheer glee.

                              JOKER (cont.)
               My goodness, what in the world made
               you do it? It must've been
               something pretty terrible!

     He's practically dancing now. He's made a friend.

                              JOKER (cont.)
               You know, we should've sat down and
               had us a little heart-to-heart. I
               bet we would have got on famously.

                              BATMAN
               Mad... man... 

                              JOKER
               Well now, you're not exactly the
               picture of mental health, are you.

                              BATMAN
               ... Murderer... 

                              JOKER
               Bruce, we're both murderers. Think
               how many people you've killed by
               letting me live.

     A SPOTLIGHT cuts through the night sky. The JOKER hears his 
     helicopter approaching in the distance.

     BRUCE reaches down furtively. Finds the timer on his 
     utility belt. FLICKS A SWITCH... and the countdown begins.

     The JOKER pulls a straight razor from his pocket and opens 
     it gingerly.

                              JOKER (cont.)
               I have to do it now, Bruce, but it
               won't even hurt. Now relax. The
               bat's in his belfry, all's right
               with the world... 

     He has the razor almost up to BRUCE's throat when BRUCE 
     reaches out and GRABS HIS LAPELS in a death grip. The JOKER 
     is momentarily amused by this seeming display of affection.

                              JOKER (cont.)
               Why, Bruce... 

     Then he hears ticking.

     Looks down at the flashing digital display on BRUCE's belt. 
     0:26 seconds. 0:25 seconds.

     He SHRIEKS HORRIFICALLY and DROPS THE RAZOR.

     BRUCE won't let go of him. Finally he manages to lurch 
     convulsively away, sprawling on the floor of the belfry.

     BRUCE is wearing a great big Joker smile.

                              JOKER (cont.)
               IT'S NOT FUNNY!!!

                              BRUCE
               No... sense... of humor?

     The JOKER reaches out for the ticking time bomb. Thinks 
     better of it and retracts his shaking hand.

     He can see the copter approaching now, slicing through the 
     clouds. He screams, waves a flashlight in the air: his 
     signal beacon. 0:20 and counting.

     The JOKER scans the belltower frantically. His eyes fall on 
     the trapdoor. He races over, flings it open, starts down 
     the stairs in a frenzy.

     There are no stairs. They've collapsed. 0:16 and 
     counting.

     Screaming insanely, the JOKER vaults through the door and 
     makes for the open stone archway. The copter is directly 
     overhead now. A rope ladder drops from its belly.

     EXT. BELLTOWER - THAT MOMENT

     The helicopter descends, its whirling blades stirring up a 
     windstorm on the roof of the old abandoned cathedral. DEAD 
     LEAVES rise and swirl in the churning air.

     INT. BELLTOWER

     The JOKER makes a futile grab at the rope ladder, almost 
     losing his purchase on the archway parapet. He gestures 
     wildly for the copter to make another pass. 0:12 to go.

     EXT. BELLTOWER

     A maelstrom of swirling leaves. And now, among the leaves 
     -- roused from their resting place in the rotten rafters of 
     the old cathedral --

     -- A HORDE OF SQUEALING, CHITTERING BATS!! Filling the air 
     like a black cloud, HUNDREDS OF THEM, taking flight in
     blind uncomprehending fury --

     INT. BELLTOWER

     The JOKER leaps into empty space, grabs hold of the ladder, 
     cackles in mad triumph --

     -- AND SUDDENLY THE BELLTOWER IS FULL OF BATS. A SCREECHING 
     SWARM, HIDEOUS, BLACK-WINGED -- SWOOPING THROUGH THE 
     ARCHWAYS DIRECTLY AT THE JOKER --

     -- WHO SCREAMS IN TERROR -- LETS GO OF THE LADDER --

     -- and plunges into the night.

     TIGHT ON BATMAN. Six seconds remain. There is still time if 
     he makes his choice now.

     Surrounded by the flapping of leathery wings, his body 
     working on pure adrenalin, he unbuckles the belt. Lurches 
     into position. Heaves it out into the darkness.

     It snags on the bottom rung of the dangling rope ladder.

     INT. HELICOPTER - POV CO-PILOT

     The CO-PILOT is hanging out one side of the copter, just 
     enough to see what's going on.

                              CO-PILOT
               PULL UP!! PULL --

     EXT. CHURCHYARD - OVERHEAD ANGLE

     It's as if time has stopped. The world has grown suddenly 
     silent. We're looking down at the JOKER, whose body lies 
     splayed and broken on the flagstone surface of the 
     churchyard. Slowly, elegantly -- we have all the time in 
     the world, now -- we DRIFT DOWNWARD, closer, until his FACE 
     FILLS THE SCREEN, the familiar chilling grin still intact.

     Sad clown, A-one crazy boy, staring aimlessly at the stars. 
     Suddenly his face is bathed in a brilliant gasoline GLOW.

     POV JOKER

     Looking up he sees a beautiful display of fireworks, 
     bursting and burning, spirals of color snaking through the 
     sky as the helicopter explodes in eerie silence.

     REVERSE ANGLE - THE JOKER'S FACE

     It's all so lovely. The JOKER's expression is happy, almost 
     childlike, as he gazes up at this private show. Gradually, 
     though, the bright colors fade; and the JOKER's face begins 
     to relax, the twisted grin dissolving at last as darkness 
     sets in.

                                               FADE THROUGH TO:

     INT. TELEVISION STUDIO - NIGHT

     AN ANCHORWOMAN delivering an oncamera EDITORIAL.

                              ANCHORWOMAN
               As the details of the Joker's
               heinous plan become known, a city's
               gratitude goes out to the mysterious
               Batman. His whereabouts remain
               unknown, but Batman -- if you're
               alive -- if you're listening --
               thank you.

     EXT. CEMETERY - DAY

     VICKI at a fresh gravesite. She places a FLORAL ARRANGEMENT 
     in the urn at the head of the grave; stands back to examine 
     it; then bends once more to reposition the drooping 
     flowers.

                              VICKI
               I loved you too.

     As soon as the words come out, she begins to CRY. Then she 
     gets hold of herself; rises; turns up her collar; and goes.

     The headstone reads: "ALEXANDER KNOX, 1956-1987."

     INT. WAYNE MANOR - STUDY - DAY

     ALFRED, in his apron, on the phone.

                              ALFRED
               No, Mr. Wayne is in Thailand. I'm
               afraid he's quite unreachable.

     INT. WAYNE MANOR - DAY

     The glass-enclosed room which houses BRUCE's Olympic-sized 
     SWIMMING POOL. Outside, snow is falling.

     In the pool, on an inflatable rubber raft, is BRUCE WAYNE. 
     Beside him, waist-deep is the water, is VICKI -- helping 
     him rehabilitate his leg and shoulder.

                              VICKI
               I don't know why I'm doing this. I
               half wish you'd stay a cripple.

                              BRUCE
               Ohhhh... you don't mean that.

                              VICKI
                     (grasping for words)
               I don't, but... I do. It's just... I
               love you, Bruce. I --

                              BRUCE
                     (taking her hand)
               Vicki. Do you love half of me? Or
               all of me?

     A hard question for VICKI to answer. She thinks it over for 
     several beats, then SMILES... SLOWLY, SADLY.

                              VICKI
               I guess you did it, didn't you. You
               saved everyone.
                     (pause)
               Almost.

     For a moment he stares deeply into her eyes. Then he pulls 
     her over, takes her in a tight embrace.

                              BRUCE
               I don't know how to explain this so
               it makes sense... but you saved
               me.

     INT. BATCAVE - THAT MOMENT - DAY

     DICK GRAYSON stands at the brink of the bottomless pit and 
     looks up at the GYMNAST'S RINGS suspended overhead. He sets 
     his jaw and then -- with only a moment's hesitation -- 
     LEAPS INTO THE VOID.

     His hands find the rings. He launches himself HIGH INTO THE 
     AIR and does a spectacular TRIPLE SOMERSAULT, catching the 
     rings on his way down.

     Exhilarated, he makes a perfect landing on the edge of the 
     pit. 10-point-0. A SMILE OF PLEASURE comes to his lips.

     EXT. ROOFTOP - GOTHAM CITY - NIGHT

     A dark, moonless night. LIGHTS OF THE CITY sparkle in the 
     distance. CAMERA DRIFTS across the rooftop, settling 
     finally on the broad back of a BLACK-CAPED FIGURE poised at 
     the edge of the roof, gazing down on the streets below.

     A SECOND FIGURE enters frame. We get a brief glimpse of his 
     RED-AND-GREEN SUIT in the seconds before our EYES TURN 
     SKYWARD... to the SEARING YELLOW SPOTLIGHT sweeping through 
     the clouds. In its center: the VAST BLACK SILHOUETTE of a 
     BAT, wings extended, DOMINATING the night sky.

     We HOLD on the GLARING BAT-SIGNAL as BATMAN and ROBIN 
     vanish over the edge of the roof, plunging down toward new 
     adventures. MUSIC BUILDS and we

                                               October 20, 1986








     FADE IN:

     EXT. CITYSCAPE - NIGHT

     The place is Gotham City. The time, 1987 -- once removed.

     The city of Tomorrow: stark angles, creeping shadows, 
     dense, crowded, airless, a random tangle of steel and 
     concrete, self-generating, almost subterranean in its 
     aspect... as if hell had erupted through the sidewalks and 
     kept on growing. A dangling fat moon shines overhead, ready 
     to burst.

     EXT. CATHEDRAL - NIGHT

     Amid the chrome and glass sits a dark and ornate Gothic 
     anomaly: old City Cathedral, once grand, now abandoned -- 
     long since boarded up and scheduled for demolition.

     On the rooftop far above us, STONE GARGOYLES gaze down from 
     their shadowy, windswept perches, keeping monstrous watch 
     over the distant streets below, sightless guardians of the 
     Gotham night.

     One of them is moving.

     EXT. GOTHAM SQUARE - NIGHT

     The pulsing heart of downtown Gotham, a neon nightmare of 
     big-city corruption, almost surreal in its oppressiveness. 
     Hookers wave to drug dealers. Street hustlers slap high-
     fives with three-card monte dealers. They all seem to know
     each other... with one conspicuous exception:

     A TOURIST FAMILY, Mom, Dad, and little Jimmy, staring 
     straight  ahead as they march in perfect lockstep down the 
     main drag. They've just come out of a bit show two blocks 
     over; the respectable theatre crowd has thinned out, and 
     now -- Playbills in hand -- they find themselves adrift in 
     the predatory traffic of Gotham's meanest street.

                              MOM
               For God's sake, Harold, can we
               please just get a taxi??

                              DAD
               I'm trying to get a --
                     (shouting)
               TAXI!!

     Three cabs streak pass and disappear. MOM grimaces in 
     frustration as LITTLE JIMMY consults a subway map.

                              JIMMY
               We're going the wrong way.

     Nearby, STREET TYPES are beginning to snicker. DAD surveys 
     them nervously, gestures toward the subway map.

                              DAD
               Put that away. We'll look like
               tourists.

     TWO COPS lean on their patrol car outside an all-night 
     souvlaki stand, sipping coffee and chatting with a HOOKER. 
     The HOOKER smiles at JIMMY.  JIMMY smiles back. MOM yanks 
     him off down the street and glowers at DAD.

                              DAD (cont.)
               We'll never get a cab here. Let's
               cut over to Seventh.

                              JIMMY
               Seventh is that way.

                              DAD
               I know where we are!

     EXT. SIDE STREET - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT

     A deserted access street, sidewalks lined with the husks of 
     stripped-down cars. MOM, DAD, and JIMMY take a deep breath 
     and march down the darkened street. A VOICE startles them.

                              VOICE
               Hey, mister. Gimme a dollar?

     The VOICE belongs to a DERELICT -- nineteen or twenty, 
     acne-scarred -- who sits between two garbage cans, his palm 
     uplifted. His ratty t-shirt reads: 'I LOVE GOTHAM CITY.'

     MOM, DAD, and JIMMY pause for the merest of seconds, then 
     move on -- pretending not to hear.

                              DERELICT
               Mister. How about it. One dollar?
                     (standing up)
               One dollar, man. Are you deaf?
               Are you deaf? -- Do you speak
               English??

     By now the TOURISTS are halfway across the street. 
     Mercifully, the DERELICT doesn't seem to be following.

     They pick up their pace. They don't see the SHADOWY FIGURE 
     in the alleyway. They don't see the GUN until a gloved hand 
     brings it down, butt-first, across the back of DAD's neck.

     DAD crumples. MOM grabs JIMMY and backs up against a brick 
     wall, too terrified to scream. The DERELICT races across 
     the street to join his confederate, the STREET PUNK, who's 
     already searching for DAD's wallet.

     MOM's mouth opens in panic. They can see she's about to 
     snap -- so  the STREET PUNK, still in a crouch, trains his 
     gun on JIMMY.

                              STREET PUNK
               Do the kid a favor, lady. Don't
               scream.

     The poor woman is utterly horrified. TEARS stream down her 
     face. But she keeps her wits about her, stifles the urge to 
     shriek, and hustles JIMMY off down the street.

     The two PUNKS watch them break into a run -- then chuckle, 
     slap hands, race off in the opposite direction.

     EXT. ROOFTOP - NIGHT

     Six stories up. The PUNKS -- NICK and EDDIE -- hunker down 
     on the tar-and-gravel roof, sizing up their take.

                              NICK
                     (emptying the wallet)
               All right. The Gold Card.
                     (tossing the credit card
                     in EDDIE's face)
               Don't leave home without it.

     A chill wind whips across the roof as NICK extracts the 
     cash and begins to count it. There's a distant, indistinct 
     CLANG: metal on metal. EDDIE hears it and tenses up.

                              EDDIE
               Let's beat it, man. I don't like
               being up here.

                              NICK
               What, scared of heights?

                              EDDIE
               I dunno, man. After what happened to
               Johnny Gobs --

                              NICK
               Look, Johnny Gobs got ripped and
               walked off a roof, all right? No big
               loss.

                              EDDIE
               That ain't what I heard. That ain't
               what I heard at all.
                     (beat)
               I heard the bat got him.

                              NICK
               Gimme a break, will you? Shut up... 

                              EDDIE
               Five stories, straight down. There
               was no blood in the body.

                              NICK
               No shit. It was all over the
               pavement.

     NICK has no patience with campfire tales -- but here on the 
     roof, in the pale moonlight, he can't ignore the slight 
     tingle at the base of his spine... 

                              EDDIE
               There was no blood, man.
                     (beat)
               My brother says... all the bad things
               you done... they come back and
               haunt you... 

                              NICK
               Listen to this. How old are you?
               There ain't no bat.

                              EDDIE
               My brother's a priest, man.

                              NICK
               No wonder you're such a chickenshit.
               Now shut up.
                     (conclusively)
               There ain't no bat.

     As they speak our attention shifts to a point at the 
     opposite corner of the roof, some fifteen yards away... 
     where, at the end of a line, a STRANGE BLACK SILHOUETTE is 
     dropping slowly, implacably, into frame... 

                              EDDIE
               You shouldn'ta turned the gun on
               that kid, man. You shouldn'ta --

                              NICK
               Do you want this money or don't
               you? Now shut up! Shut up --

     BOTH PUNKS FREEZE at the sudden, inexplicable sound of 
     BOOTS CRUNCHING ON GRAVEL. They turn slowly. Their JAWS 
     DROP.

     Standing at the edge of the roof, bathed in moonlight, is a 
     BLACK APPARITION. IT DOES NOT MOVE.

     EDDIE stands rooted to the spot, a choked gurgle in his 
     throat, as if he's just seen his own death. The BLACK 
     FIGURE advances, spreading  its arms. Or rather, its WINGS: 
     GREAT BLACK BATWINGS, flapping in the wind.

     NICK drops to the gravel, gropes for the gun, brings it up.

     And still the BLACK FIGURE draws closer, deliberate, 
     menacing. On its chest: THE EMBLEM OF A BAT, in an oval 
     yellow field, glowing like a target in the darkness... 

     NICK FIRES TWICE. TWO CLEAN HITS. The strange black figure 
     is knocked bodily to the roof.

     Trembling, sweating buckets, NICK gets to his feet. He 
     whacks a motionless EDDIE on the arm --

                              NICK (cont.)
               I'm gettin' outta here.

     -- and bends to retrieve his loot. EDDIE lets out a 
     strange, pre-verbal squeal... 

     ... and NICK sees THE HUMAN BAT, BACK ON ITS FEET, 
     NIGHTMARISH, UNDEAD, MOVING SLOWLY AND INEVITABLY CLOSER.

     Panic. Sheer, raw, unrelenting panic. Stolen money flutters 
     out of NICK's hands. He scuttles around the periphery of 
     the roof, his feet skidding on the gravel as he searches 
     for a way down. The BLACK SPECTRE is blocking his path to 
     the fire escape. Trapped like a rat, NICK FIRES WILDLY.

     EDDIE is frozen in place, his eyes glazed over, his face 
     drained of blood. The BAT treads calmly past. A LEG snakes 
     out. A BLACK BOOT catches EDDIE high on the chest --

     -- LIFTS HIM CLEANLY OFF HIS FEET --

     -- AND SENDS HIM FLYING THROUGH THE AIR. EDDIE slams into a 
     brick chimney and slumps to the roof unconscious, a broken, 
     weightless puppet.

     THIS ACTION IS SO SMOOTH, SO AUTOMATIC, THAT THE BAT DOES 
     NOT EVEN BREAK HIS STRIDE. NICK sees his chance and CHARGES 
     past the black wraith, scrambling toward the fire escape... 

     A GLOVED HAND slices through the air, and NICK pitches 
     forward, his legs ensnared in a tangle of WIRES. Screaming 
     now, he drags himself across the gravel roof, the looming 
     figure of the BAT at his heels... 

     ... until there's no place left to go. NICK cowers against 
     the ledge, his pants torn, his hands and knees bloody. He 
     has dissolved into total mindless hysteria.

     Almost by reflex, NICK keeps shooting. He'd do better if he 
     could manage to open his eyes. By now the hammer is falling 
     on an empty chamber, but NICK continues, obsessively, to 
     pull the trigger. He weeps; he moans; he wails... 

     THE BAT grabs a fistful of NICK's shirt, and with 
     supernatural ease HOISTS HIM into the air.

                              NICK (cont.)
               Don't kill me... don't kill me... 

     When NICK finally opens his eyes, he realizes THE BAT is 
     standing on the ledge of the roof -- HOLDING HIM OUT, at 
     arm's length, over six stories of nothingness.

     The gruesome black apparition speaks, in a rasping whisper:

                              BATMAN
               I won't kill you. I want you to do
               me a favor.

     NICK looks down. Far, far below, CARS wink silently past.

     He looks up. And sees, in the mirrored lenses where 
     BATMAN's eyes should be, the twin reflections of his own 
     stricken face.

                              BATMAN (cont.)
               Tell your friends. Tell all your
               friends.

     NICK HOWLS. Almost as an afterthought, THE BATMAN heaves 
     him roughly back onto the roof. And then -- casually, 
     without a moment's hesitation -- STEPS OFF THE LEDGE OF THE 
     ROOF, INTO MIDAIR.

     Trembling, NICK crawls to the ledge and looks over... 
     finding ABSOLUTELY NO TRACE of the Batman.

     NICK is still screaming as we PAN UP to the bilious yellow 
     globe of Gotham's moon. MAIN CREDITS ROLL:

                                                 CUT TO:

     INT. GOTHAM CITY DEMOCRATS' CLUB - NIGHT

     An oversized CAMPAIGN POSTER fills one wall: "A NEW GOTHAM. 
     HARVEY DENT FOR DISTRICT ATTORNEY". We TILT DOWN to find 
     the man himself, determined, dynamic HARVEY DENT, 
     addressing a crowd from behind his podium.

                              DENT
               ... it is no longer enough to go
               after the small-time punks and petty
               criminals who infest the streets of
               Gotham City. Crime and corruption
               must be attacked at the root!

     ANOTHER ANGLE - THE AUDIENCE

     Civic-minded politicos decked out in fund-raiser finery. 
     They applaud DENT's tough talk wildly. They've just shelled 
     out $500 a plate for a chicken dinner, and by God they're 
     going to enjoy this.

     Tuxedoed WAITERS move among the tables, deftly refilling 
     water glasses. As they do, we SEE an EMPTY PLACE SETTING -- 
     the only one in the hall. Some well-meaning moneybags has 
     laid out half a grand and then neglected to show up.

     The engraved placecard reads: BRUCE WAYNE.

     ANGLE ON DENT

                              DENT
               If elected, my first act as district
               attorney will be to return an
               indictment against Boss Carl
               Grissom!

                                                 CUT TO:

     INT. APARTMENT - NIGHT

     A woman's apartment, decorated in pastel pinks and mauves. 
     Original paintings and sculptures everywhere. The place 
     reeks of money.

     In the foreground: a MAN'S HAND, long, elegant, manicured.
     Manipulating a DECK OF CARDS, doing a one-handed shuffle 
     with extraordinary finesse.

     In the background: a TV set tuned to the 11 o'clock news, 
     with highlights of HARVEY DENT's campaign speech.

                              DENT
                     (on the TV screen)
               Together we can make Gotham city a
               safe place for decent people to live
               and work and play.

     THE HAND sets the deck on an end table, raps it twice, 
     turns up four aces off the top. This most unusual deck 
     sports a .22 calibre BULLET HOLE straight through the 
     middle.

                              JACK NAPIER
               Decent people shouldn't live here.
               They'd be much happier someplace
               else.

     JACK NAPIER, 32, is right-hand man and chief enforcer to 
     Boss Carl Grissom. His features are delicate, almost 
     feminine, and he takes a vain, gangsterish pride in his 
     appearance. He is also absolutely merciless.

     He trains a cold eye on DENT's televised image as ALICIA 
     HUNT -- 26, beautiful, Carl Grissom's kept woman -- glides 
     over in her negligee and snuggles up.

                              ALICIA
               Anything new?

                              JACK
               The usual gas. If this clown could
               lay a hand on Grissom... I would've
               had to kill him by now.

     ALICIA finds JACK's necktie draped over a nearby chair. She 
     begins knotting it playfully about his neck.

                              ALICIA
               If Grissom knew about us... he
               might kill you.

     JACK seems uninterested in her affections. His eye darts 
     back and forth between the TV and his own reflection in a 
     nearby vanity.

                              JACK
               Don't think so, angel. I'm too
               valuable. That's the way I've
               planned it.
                     (pause)
               And besides, he doesn't know.

     JACK checks his watch, reaches for his topcoat, and stands 
     in front of the vanity. He runs a hand through sculpted 
     hair, checks out his Albert Nipon ensemble.

                              ALICIA
               You look just fine, Jack.

     He smiles at himself before turning to the door.

                              JACK
               ... I didn't ask.

                                                 CUT TO:

     EXT. ALLEYWAY - NIGHT

     The scene of the earlier mugging, a half-block off Gotham 
     Square. Only now, the deserted alleyway is a beehive of 
     activity: police cars, an ambulance, a forensics van.

     EDDIE THE PUNK goes past on a stretcher, catatonic. 
     Watching him are a porcine cop, LT. ECKHARDT, and a POLICE 
     MEDIC.

                              MEDIC
               That one there won't say a word. The
               other one's raving his head off.

                              ECKHARDT
               Variety, huh? The spice of life.

     At the mouth of the alley, we find ALEXANDER KNOX --
     thirty, hyperactive, a crime reporter for the Gotham
     Gazette. At the moment, he's chatting with a uniformed
     PATROLMAN.

                              PATROLMAN
               They found him hugging a drainpipe.
               He was scared to come off the roof.

                              KNOX
               Great, but tell me: is this another
               you-know-what? 'Cause if so, it's
               the third one this week.

                              PATROLMAN
                     (testily)
               I dunno. What's "what"?

                              KNOX
               Good answer. I'm gonna put you in
               for a commendation.

     KNOX spots ECKHARDT and the MEDIC, waves cheerily, and 
     saunters down the alley. ECKHARDT curses under his breath.

                              ECKHARDT
               Oh Christ, it's Knox.

                              KNOX
               Hiya, gents. This anything I should
               know about?

                              ECKHARDT
               Nothing out of the routine.

     At this exact moment two uniformed PATROLMEN drag a brain-
     fried NICK past the mouth of the alley.

                              NICK
               A bat, I tell you, a giant bat!
               He wanted me to do him a favor...!

     KNOX tilts one eyebrow. ECKHARDT and the MEDIC trade 
     disgusted looks.

                              KNOX
               No offense, boys, but these guys are
               seeing something up there.

                              ECKHARDT
               No comment. Print what you like.

                              KNOX
               Come on. One question. Is there a
               six-foot bat in Gotham City?

     KNOX's tone is jokey, but only half-jokey. ECKHARDT snorts 
     in disgust and turns away. KNOX shouts after him:

                              KNOX (cont.)
               If so, is he on the police payroll?
               If so, what's he pulling down after
               taxes?

     EXT. STREET - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT

     We pick up LT. ECKHARDT as he emerges onto the side street. 
     He's headed for his car when he spies a STRETCH LIMO idling 
     across the street. Leaning on the hood, waving hi, is the 
     dandyish JACK NAPIER -- flanked by two impressive GOONS.

     ECKHARDT throws a nervous glance back in KNOX's direction. 
     He turns left, gestures to JACK to meet him farther up the 
     block. By the time he reaches the corner JACK has swaggered 
     up alongside him.

     ECKHARDT takes a fat brown envelope from JACK and stuffs it 
     quickly in his coat.

                              JACK
               You didn't show up.

                              ECKHARDT
               We had another bat sighting.

                              JACK
               I'm sure that was vitally important.
               Listen: things are heating up.
               Someone is leaking information to
               Harvey Dent.

     ECKHARDT bristles. There's no love lost between these two.

                              ECKHARDT
               I'm doing the best I can. If it's a
               problem --

                              JACK
               Eckhardt... our problems are your
               problems.

                              ECKHARDT
               I'll work on it.

     JACK reaches out and grabs ECKHARDT by the lapels of his 
     topcoat -- an Italian job, obviously expensive. He rubs the 
     material between his fingers.

                              JACK
               Very nice, Lieutenant. But a little
               ostentatious on a cop's salary,
               don't you think?

                              ECKHARDT
                     (knocking his hands away)
               I answer to Grissom, punk. Not to
               you.

                              JACK
               You're a smart boy, Eckhardt. You
               should be thinking about the future.

     ECKHARDT laughs in his face.

                              ECKHARDT
               Ambition.
                     (nodding his head)
               Forget it, Jack. You'll never run
               that organization.

                              JACK
               And why's that?

                              ECKHARDT
               You're a psycho, friend. You're an
               A-one crazy boy and Grissom knows
               it.

     JACK lashes out and BACKHANDS ECKHARDT across the face. The 
     fat cop, stunned, turns bright red and CHARGES JACK.

     JACK claps a hand on ECKHARDT's face and shoves him back 
     full-force. The cop sprawls on his ass in the doorway of an 
     all-night Cuban-Chinese restaurant.

     By now PATRONS are staring out of the restaurant windows. 
     ECKHARDT is livid. His hand goes instinctively to his gun.

                              JACK
               Here. Use mine.

     JACK pulls an automatic from his pocket and tosses it in 
     ECKHARDT's lap. He looks down and laughs, daring ECKHARDT 
     to pick it up -- just as the two enormous GOONS from the 
     stretch limo appear behind him for reinforcement.

     ECKHARDT wipes blood from his mouth as JACK -- an A-one 
     crazy-boy grin on his face -- reaches down for the gun.

                              JACK (cont.)
               It's all right, boys. Lt. Eckhardt
               here is a good cop. A real good cop.
                     (pause; smiling)
               Inexpensive.

                                                 DISSOLVE TO:

     INT. GOTHAM GLOBE - CITY ROOM - DAY

     Gotham city's leading tabloid daily. COPY BOYS rush to and 
     fro; REPORTERS pound out articles on computer terminals. 
     ALEXANDER KNOX saunters in, a sheath of typed pages in his 
     hand, and pauses at a CARTOONIST's drawing table.

                              KNOX
               What have you got for me, Jerry?

     JERRY holds up a cartoon: a HUMAN BAT, with an awful, 
     fanged rodent's face, wearing a business suit. The caption 
     at the top reads: "HAVE YOU SEEN THIS MAN?"  KNOX nods in 
     approval.

                              KNOX (cont.)
               Nice, but... maybe a little more gore
               on the fangs, huh?

     He pats JERRY on the shoulder, moves on. A BESPECTACLED 
     COLLEAGUE spots him and calls out:

                              COLLEAGUE
               Hey Knox, you got a visitor.

                              KNOX
               I'm real busy, Clark. Be a pal and
               dust him, okay?

                              COLLEAGUE
               This one you might want to dust
               yourself.

     Curiosity piqued, KNOX moves toward his desk... and stops 
     in his tracks. Propped up on the desk are a PAIR OF LEGS. 
     The legs -- exceptionally nice ones -- are attached to a 
     WOMAN leaning back in KNOX's swivel chair, taking a nap, 
     her face obscured by a big outrageous hat.

                              KNOX
               ... Vicki Vale.

     The hat tips back. VICKI VALE, her face framed by a shock 
     of bright red hair, flashes a dazzling smile. She pulls 
     KNOX over for a quick smooch and laughs.

                              VICKI
               How'd you know it was me?

                              KNOX
               Honey -- I would know any randomly
               selected square inch of Vicki
               Vale.
                     (grinning)
               If I had a good enough hint.

     He points at the oversized CAMERA BAG on his desk. It bears 
     the monogram "V.V."  VICKI catches on, makes a face at him.

                              KNOX (cont.)
               Where the hell have you been?

                              VICKI
               A nice, restful vacation.

     She reaches into the camera bag and pulls out a stack of 
     glossy 8x10's: COMBAT PHOTOS from some unspecified war-torn 
     corner of the world. KNOX leafs though them, impressed.

                              KNOX
               God, a girl could get hurt doing
               this.

                              VICKI
               I do get hurt.

     She unbuttons her sleeve, rolls it back to show KNOX a long 
     fresh scar on the inside of her arm. He winces -- then 
     points to the scar and adds, slyly:

                              KNOX
               Got any more of those?

                              VICKI
               Nothing I'm at liberty to reveal
               here. What's new and hot in Gotham
               City?

                              KNOX
               It's too good, Vick. We got a six-
               foot bat that swoops out of the
               night and preys on evildoers.

                              VICKI
                     (laughing)
               Evildoers, huh? Big or small?

                              KNOX
               Small so far. I mean -- they don't
               allow bats in boardrooms, do they.

                              VICKI
               Speaking of which... I hear the
               notorious Bruce Wayne is throwing a
               big do for the Harvey Dent campaign.

                              KNOX
               Yeah. Hottest ticket in town. Every
               law'n'order freak in the city's
               gonna be there.

     KNOX suddenly freezes. It's just occurred to him that VICKI 
     may have a purpose in all this.

                              KNOX (cont.)
               Wa-a-it. Vicki. You're not saying --

     She reaches back into her camera bag and hands over an 
     INVITATION. KNOX is all but panting with excitement.

                              KNOX (cont.)
               Aw, Vicki. Vicki!
                     (apprehensively)
               Got a date?

     She flutters her great big eyelashes, shakes her head no. 
     KNOX grabs her face and plants a kiss on her forehead, 
     nearly knocking her out of the swivel chair.

                              KNOX (cont.)
               Vicki, baby, I love you, I've always
               loved you. Will you marry me?

                              VICKI
                     (straightening her clothes)
               No.

                              KNOX
               Well, I'm starving. Will you at
               least buy me a hamburger?

                              VICKI
               Yes, but please -- be gentle.

     Overwhelmed with glee, he offers her his arm.

                                                 CUT TO:

     INT. PENTHOUSE - DAY

     A HUGE PLATE GLASS WINDOW opens on the best view in Gotham. 
     This spectacular penthouse suite is just one of the power 
     perks available to CARL GRISSOM, kingpin of the Gotham City 
     rackets, fat, fifty, and utterly without charm.

     GRISSOM, behind a big broad desk, addresses his LIEUTENANTS 
     -- a fearsome assemblage of bloodless white-collar types 
     and few outright goons, sprawled in chairs throughout this 
     makeshift 'boardroom.'  The big boss waves a copy of the 
     Gotham Globe -- with HARVEY DENT's face on the cover.

                              GRISSOM
               Nine points ahead in the new poll. I
               don't like the way this is shaping
               up.

     JACK NAPIER slouches in an easy chair off to GRISSOM's 
     right, doing his trademark one-handed shuffle.

                              JACK
               We can always pop him. -- Or pop
               someone close to him.

                              LIEUTENANT
               Let's feed him to the bat.

     This suggestion draws CHUCKLES from several members of the 
     crowd. GRISSOM is unamused.

                              GRISSOM
               He's going after our front
               companies. Specifically Ace
               Chemical. Which would tie us
               in with Councilman Kane, Senator
               Miller... on up the line.
                     (pause)
               We have to clean out our files
               before the subpoena comes down.

                              LIEUTENANT
               How do we go? The usual fire?

                              GRISSOM
               I'm thinking break-in. Trash the
               office, remove the relevant
               documents... 

                              JACK
               "Industrial espionage."

                              GRISSOM
               That's right. And Jack --
                     (pause)
               I'd like you to handle this
               operation personally.

     JACK has just turned up the third ace off the top of the 
     deck. His hand freezes in midair.

                              JACK
               ... Me?

     At this exact moment, METAL DOORS slide back -- and ALICIA 
     HUNT steps out of GRISSOM's private penthouse elevator. 
     She's carrying a handful of SHOPPING BAGS.

                              GRISSOM
               Hello, sweetheart. I wonder if you'd
               mind waiting in the other room.

     ALICIA's gaze meets JACK's as she vanishes through a side 
     door. The eye contact is not lost on GRISSOM.

                              JACK
               Why do you need me to handle a
               simple break-in?

                              GRISSOM
                     (emphatically)
               Because I want someone I can
               trust.

     JACK bridles, but doesn't protest. Nervously, he turns the 
     fourth card off the top of the deck. It's not an ace.

     It's a JOKER -- a Joker with a neat, round, .22 calibre 
     HOLE through its face.

                              GRISSOM (cont.)
               We'll work out the details later.
               But it's got to be soon. -- All
               right, that's all for now.

     GRISSOM'S CRONIES get up to go. JACK, troubled, lingers 
     behind a moment.

                              GRISSOM (cont.)
               You don't mind, do you Jack? It's an
               important job. I can't trust it to
               somebody who'll screw up.

                              JACK
               I understand.

                              GRISSOM
                     (smiling)
               Jack. Don't forget your lucky deck.

     JACK pockets the deck and leaves. GRISSOM sits behind the 
     big desk and GRINS WOLFISHLY.

                              GRISSOM (cont.)
               My friend, your luck is just about
               to change.

     He reaches for the phone. ALICIA appears in the doorway 
     nearby, modeling her new purchases for him. He smiles 
     coolly at her as he speaks into the receiver.

                              GRISSOM (cont.)
               Get me Lieutenant Eckhardt.

                                                 CUT TO:

     EXT. WAYNE MANOR - ESTABLISHING - NIGHT

     A vast, rambling mansion on sixty wooded acres a half-
     hour's drive from Gotham: old money, and how. Out front, a 
     team of red-jacketed VALETS are parking expensive cars.

     INT. BALLROOM - NIGHT

     A DEALER'S HAND pushes cards out of a shoe (the card kind, 
     not the Florsheim kind). It's casino night at Wayne Manor; 
     the ballroom has been outfitted with roulette wheels, 
     blackjack tables, etc., and the various members of Gotham's 
     power elite are happily -- and legally -- throwing money 
     into Harvey Dent's campaign kitty.

     DENT himself is surrounded by a gang of political cronies, 
     telling jokes, calling in favors. VICKI's off in another 
     group, looking luscious, drawing compliments from big shots 
     and envious, furtive glances from their wives. And, in a 
     corner of the room, all alone in his cheap suit, stands 
     ALEXANDER KNOX -- staring inquisitively up at the ceiling.

     A butler, ALFRED, appears alongside KNOX with a trayful of 
     champagne glasses. He too looks up at the ceiling.

                              KNOX
               How high up would you say that is?

                              ALFRED
               I'd say about thirty feet, sir.

                              KNOX
               You know, if you cut your bathroom
               in half, you'd have my apartment.

                              ALFRED
               Which bathroom is that, air?

                              KNOX
               The small one.

     KNOX takes a drink and ALFRED moves on. A moment later, 
     VICKI detaches herself from her little circle of admirers 
     and hooks up with KNOX.

                              KNOX (cont.)
               Man, I feel like Robin Leach. You
               actually know all these people?

                              VICKI
               Some. I am a rich bitch, remember.
                     (pause)
               I'm quoting.

     KNOX winces at the reminder. She smiles and takes his arm.

                              KNOX
               Yeah, I guess we move in different
               circles. -- Though I did meet a
               one-eyed pimp last week.

     ANGLE ON JAMES W. GORDON

     Gotham's Police Commissioner, a distinguished-looking gent 
     in his late fifties. He's at a craps table, blowing into 
     his fist. ONLOOKERS root him on as he lets the dice fly.

     Snake eyes. Crapped out. GORDON passes the dice as KNOX and 
     VICKI wander up alongside him.

                              KNOX
               Commissioner Gordon! What do you
               hear from our pointy-eared friend?

     KNOX puts his hands up behind his head and wiggles his 
     fingers -- like little bat ears. GORDON groans.

                              GORDON
               Knox, for the ninth time, and you
               can quote me -- there is no bat.

                              KNOX
               Aww, Commissioner. There's gotta be
               one honest cop in Gotham city.

     HARVEY DENT is working the room. He ambles up, claps a 
     friendly hand on GORDON's shoulder.

                              DENT
               How's your luck, Jim?

                              KNOX
               Mr. Dent. What's your stand on
               winged vigilantes?

     DENT exchanges a meaningful look with GORDON.

                              DENT
               Mr. Knox, I think we have enough
               real problems in this city without
               worrying about ghosts and goblins
               and Halloween characters.

     EXT. ACE CHEMICAL CO. ESTABLISHING - NIGHT

     A NEON SIGN reads: "ACE CHEMICAL. FOR A MODERN TOMORROW."  
     From the SIGN we pan over to a METAL SLUICE GATE -- dumping 
     TONS of CHURNING TOXIC SLUDGE into Gotham's East River.

     INT. VAN - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT

     TIGHT ON the rear-view mirror. JACK NAPIER is meticulously 
     applying BLACK CAMOUFLAGE PAINT to his face. He could be 
     getting ready for a date.

     The van is parked outside a chain-link fence which 
     surrounds the Ace Chemical complex.

     JACK'S POV - THROUGH WINDSHIELD

     The SECURITY GUARD in a glass booth at the entrance to the 
     parking lot. ONE OF JACK'S BOYS creeps up behind the booth 
     and takes the GUARD out.

     INT. VAN - ON JACK

     He turns the key in the ignition, shifts into first.

                                                 CUT TO:

     INT. WAYNE MANOR - NIGHT

     KNOX and VICKI are taking an unauthorized tour of BRUCE's 
     house, wandering through rooms decorated in wildly 
     divergent motifs, eyeing an astounding collection of 
     artworks and antiques from every corner of the world.

                              KNOX
               My question is, where does one man
               get all this junk.

                              VICKI
               All over the world. They say he
               spends most of the year overseas --
               until recently, anyway.

                              KNOX
               Holy shit... 

     KNOX goes goggle-eyed as they enter the LIBRARY.

     INT. BRUCE WAYNE'S LIBRARY - NIGHT

                              KNOX (cont.)
               ... We found the arsenal.

     One wall is lined to the ceiling with leather-bound 
     volumes. On the other walls hang EXOTIC WEAPONS. Halberds. 
     Maces. Blowguns. Bolas. Thugee ropes and samurai swords... 
     every arcane implement of death the human mind has ever 
     devised. KNOX lets out a low whistle.

                              KNOX (cont.)
               This guy has just gotten
               interesting. What else do you know?

                              VICKI
               Just what I've heard. Rich.
               Reclusive. Old money and lots of it.

                              KNOX
               Likes to kill?

                              VICKI
                     (smiling)
               Women find him magnetic.

                              KNOX
               I bet they like him for his big
               charity balls.

                              VICKI
               That, and the sweet smell of two
               hundred million bucks.

                              KNOX
               Well, you know me. The more they've
               got, the less they're worth.
                     (scanning the room)
               This guy must be the most worthless
               man in America.

     Just then, A VOICE FROM BEHIND intrudes.

                              BRUCE WAYNE
               You disappoint me. Why not the
               world?

     KNOX turns. We get our first good look at the smiling face 
     of BRUCE WAYNE: 32, tall, athletic, impeccably mannered... 
     and intensely handsome.

                              KNOX
               I assume in my usual charming manner
               I've just insulted the host.
                     (extending a hand)
               Alexander Knox.

                              BRUCE
               Bruce Wayne. -- I've read your work.
               I quite like it.

                              KNOX
               Great. Give me a grant.

                              BRUCE
               I might consider it if you introduce
               me to Miss Vale.

     KNOX blinks at VICKI. BRUCE already seems to know who she 
     is. KNOX shrugs and forges bravely ahead:

                              KNOX
               "This is Miss Vale." -- That felt
               redundant.

                              BRUCE
                     (to VICKI)
               You're just back from Corto Maltese.
               I saw your combat photos. Quite a
               departure for you.

                              VICKI
               That's intriguing. They haven't been
               published yet.

     BRUCE smiles and ignores the implied question.

                              BRUCE
               ... You have an extraordinary eye.

     He's laying on the charm now. KNOX, his territorial 
     instincts aroused, pipes up:

                              KNOX
               Some people think she has two.

     VICKI shoots KNOX a sidelong glance:

                              VICKI
               Don't mind my friend. He's a little
               nervous tonight.

     KNOX, chastened, calls off the dogs and sizes up his 
     competition. BRUCE is charming, all right, but there's 
     something formal, maybe even calculating about it -- he
     could be reading his clever remarks off cue cards. It's 
     almost as though he's an actor doing a brilliant imitation 
     of charm.

     This is a man who thinks three moves ahead. KNOX doesn't
     like him. But VICKI -- who's used to seeing male charm 
     turned on and off, at will -- doesn't seem to mind at all:

                              VICKI (cont.)
               This is an amazing house. I'd love
               to shoot it sometime.

                              BRUCE
               I don't... seek publicity. -- Will
               you be staying in Gotham for a
               while?

                              VICKI
               As far as I know.

                              BRUCE
               Good. Then with any luck we'll run
               into each other.

     Suddenly ALFRED, the butler, appears in the doorway behind 
     them. He clears his throat. BRUCE turns.

                              ALFRED
               Excuse me, sir. Commissioner Gordon
               was compelled to leave -- very
               unexpectedly. He asked me to convey
               his regrets.

                              BRUCE
               Thank you, Alfred.
                     (to VICKI)
               I hope you'll excuse me. It was a
               great pleasure meeting you.
                     (to KNOX)
               And you.

     Without bothering to shake hands BRUCE does a sharp 180 and 
     strides hurriedly out of the room.

                              KNOX
               I know the rich are different, but
               that guy is real different.

     VICKI, staring off after BRUCE, doesn't seem to hear him.

                              KNOX (cont.)
               Hello? Vicki?

                              VICKI
               Oh. Sorry. I was thinking.

                              KNOX
               What were you thinking?

                              VICKI
               Yum, yum.

                              KNOX
               Well, he must like the way he
               looks. He's got a mirror in every
               room.

     And indeed, the two of them are standing before an enormous 
     WALL MIRROR, eight feet wide, running from floor to 
     ceiling.

                              VICKI
               I get it. Bruce Vain.

     She pokes KNOX. He groans at the dumb pun. And suddenly we

                                                 CUT TO:

     REVERSE ANGLE - THROUGH THE MIRROR

     looking DOWN ON KNOX and VICKI -- THROUGH ONE-WAY GLASS -- 
     as they continue to chat. Behind the mirror... recording 
     everything that happens in the room... is a small, silent, 
     state-of-the-art SURVEILLANCE CAMERA.

     CLOSEUP - VIDEO MONITOR

     showing KNOX and VICKI in the library. CAMERA PULLS BACK to 
     reveal that the screen we're watching is only one in a 
     whole vast bank of video monitors. From this control 
     center, we can see everything that's happening in the 
     house.

     Now we ZERO IN on a single screen: GUESTS moving backward, 
     with exaggerated speed, as a videotape REWINDS.

     At the panel, BRUCE WAYNE hits a button. And now we see 
     COMMISSIONER GORDON talking to a uniformed POLICEMAN.

                              PATROLMAN
               ... anonymous tip. Tonight. The Ace
               Chemical Company.

                              GORDON
                     (obviously agitated)
               Good Lord, it we could put our hands
               on Jack Napier... Why wasn't I told
               about this? Who's in charge of
               the --

                              PATROLMAN
               Lt. Eckhardt, sir.

                              GORDON
               Eckhardt. Oh my God... 

     And suddenly COMMISSIONER GORDON is grabbing for his coat. 
     The monitor goes black. BRUCE reaches up, loosens his tie.

                                                 CUT TO:

     EXT. ACE CHEMICAL CO. - PARKING LOT - NIGHT

     UNMARKED POLICE CARS are pulling into the lot, headlights 
     off. ECKHARDT circulates among his ARMED SWAT TEAM, handing 
     out xeroxed copies of a PHOTOGRAPH.

     The PHOTOGRAPH is a full-face shot of JACK NAPIER.

                              ECKHARDT
               Shoot to kill.

     INT. ACE CHEMICAL - FILE ROOM - NIGHT

     SPARKS FLY. A SAFECRACKER, in welder's mask, trains a 
     blowtorch on the office safe. Behind him, JACK'S HOODS are 
     at work on the filing cabinets.

     The SAFECRACKER kills his blowtorch and opens the metal 
     door of the safe, giving JACK a good look at its contents:

                              SAFECRACKER
               ... Empty.

                              HOOD I
               Just like the file cabinets.

                              HOOD II
               I don't get it. If this place is
               cleaned out already, what do we need
               five men?

     JACK shakes his head. His boys are antsy, ready to mutiny. 
     By now it's depressingly obvious: they've been set up.

     Then, as if they needed any proof -- a SIREN blares 
     outside.

     EXT. ACE CHEMICAL - NIGHT

     ECKHARDT'S SWAT TEAM goes wide-eyed as a CONVOY OF POLICE 
     BLACK-AND-WHITES roars into the Ace parking lot. UNIFORMED 
     COPS pile out of their squad cars, relieving the SWAT TEAM. 
     ECKHARDT goes livid as COMMISSIONER GORDON approaches.

                              ECKHARDT
               What are you trying to do, blow the
               collar?

                              GORDON
                     (to SWAT TEAM)
               You men are dismissed. We'll take
               over from here.
                     (to UNIFORMED COPS)
               Any man who opens fire on Jack
               Napier... will answer to me.

     ECKHARDT tries to slink off. GORDON grabs him roughly.

                              GORDON (cont.)
               You. Stick around.

     INT. ACE CHEMICAL - THAT MOMENT

     JACK and his HOODS ducking out of the office. It's two 
     stories above the refinery floor, accessible by a network 
     of steel ladders and CATWALKS running between the walls.

     Down below, a CORRUGATED METAL DOOR begins to rise.

                              COP
               Freeze!

     One hood goes into a crouch and OPENS FIRE. Half of his 
     colleagues dive back into the office, looking for a rear 
     exit. The others take off across the CATWALKS.

     ANGLE ON GORDON

     standing in the doorway as his MEN rush into the building 
     and take their places behind heavy machinery. SHOTS RING 
     OUT as the HOODS scatter.

                              ECKHARDT
                     (snidely)
               Nice work, Commissioner.

                              GORDON
               I'm in charge here. Not Carl
               Grissom.

     INT. HALLWAY - THAT MOMENT

     TWO HOODS run down a tiled corridor in the office section 
     of the complex. They're almost at the end of the hall when 
     a CAPED BLACK SHADOW steps into their path.

     It stands there, motionless. EXTENDS ITS ARMS -- like giant 
     WINGS -- revealing the yellow-and-black insigne on its 
     massive chest. BATMAN.

     One millisecond later, the shocked HOODS are racing back in 
     the opposite direction.

     THE BATMAN flings a handful of STEEL BALL-BEARINGS across 
     the tiled floor. HOOD I tumbles to the floor and lands 
     hard, losing his breath. HOOD II rolls and pulls a GUN.

     BATMAN hurls a BOOMERANG -- its edges scalloped, like a 
     bat's wing. HOOD II finds his gun hand PINNED TO THE WALL 
     by the twin prongs of the BATARANG.

     THE BATMAN strides briskly toward them, businesslike, 
     taking his time. He grabs a handful of HOOD I's hair, lifts 
     his head off the floor, KNEES HIM IN THE FACE.

     He turns to the petrified HOOD II. CHROME-STEEL TALONS 
     spring out of his fingertips. He strolls past HOOD II,
     reaching out casually to give him a QUICK NICK on the chin.

     HOOD II slumps against the wall, unconscious.

     ANGLE ON JACK

     down on the floor, racing along a wall, THROWING SWITCHES 
     -- anything to create a diversion. With every switch he 
     throws, ANOTHER GIGANTIC MACHINE roars to life. CENTRIFUGES 
     SPIN. HUGE POLYMER EXTRUDERS spit out thick strands of 
     plastic gunk. OVERHEAD CHEMICAL TANKS rotate into place 
     over giant basins.

     JACK SEES a squad of COPS on his tail, moving from machine 
     to machine, keeping covered. He SHOOTS AND RUNS.

     ANGLE ON CATWALKS

     BLASTING AWAY, HOODS III and IV scuttle across the elevated 
     walkways, keeping down, avoiding police fire. One of them 
     starts up a vertical ladder leading to the next catwalk up.

     BATMAN plunges past on the end of a rope. A BLACK-GLOVED 
     HAND snatches at HOOD III's collar as he climbs and YANKS 
     HIM CLEANLY OFF THE LADDER. They drop to the lower catwalk.

     HOOD IV gapes. He LEVELS HIS GUN at BATMAN, who stands his 
     ground, holding onto the rails of the catwalk for support. 
     A bullet hits him squarely in the chest. He does not fall.

     HOOD IV turns and scrambles. BATMAN goes to his belt for a 
     miniature SPEAR GUN. He points it at HOOD IV and FIRES... 
     planting a BARBED HOOK in the HOOD'S LEG.

     ANGLE ON COPS

     staring up in utter disbelief at the action on the catwalk.

                              COP
               LOOK!

                              GORDON
               My God... it's him.

     ANGLE ON CATWALK

     HOOD III, on his feet now, charges BATMAN from behind. 
     BATMAN -- not even turning to face him -- DROPS HOOD III 
     with an ELBOW. Now he has a HOOD on either side.

     He takes a STEEL BILLY CLUB from his belt, whips it once 
     through the air. It telescopes out into a FOUR-FOOT STAFF.

     Like a drum majorette from hell, he WHIRLS THE STAFF as the 
     HOODS CONVERGE on him. HOOD III takes a debilitating JAB 
     UNDER THE JAW. BATMAN SPINS on his heels and SLAMS THE 
     STAFF into HOOD IV's BACK -- knocking him OFF THE CATWALK 
     to the factory floor forty feet below!

     INT. ACE LOADING BAY - THAT MOMENT

     JACK spots a possible out. He hits a button on the wall; 
     STEEL DOORS RISE to reveal ACE CARGO TRUCKS in the parking 
     lot outside. Beyond the trucks... AN ARMY OF COPS waiting 
     for JACK to make his move.

     No go. He turns. Behind him, other cops -- the inside team 
     -- are rushing at him in full riot gear. JACK ducks behind 
     a forklift and darts into the adjacent room.

     INT. CHEMICAL SUPPLY ROOM - A MOMENT LATER

     JACK sprints through the room, firing FOUR SHOTS at the 
     metal CHEMICAL TANKS on the wall. TOXIC CHEMICALS gush out 
     onto the floor in streams. The streams run together... 
     begin to SMOKE and SIZZLE.

     COPS RIGHT BEHIND HIM. JACK can't resist taking one last 
     pot-shot at a FIFTH CHEMICAL TANK.

     AN EXPLOSION knocks him off his feet.

     INT. FACTORY FLOOR - A MOMENT LATER

     COPS LOOK ON IN PUZZLEMENT as a RIVER OF CHEMICALS courses 
     out into the main refinery. A second later, they go UP IN 
     FLAMES. A WALL OF FIRE bisects the factory floor.

     JACK RACES ALONG behind the spreading wall of flame. The 
     cops can't see him now. He ducks behind a huge machine, 
     hits a switch -- and SLUICE GATES OPEN. CHEMICAL SLUDGE 
     begins to churn. A big HOLE IN THE WALL appears as a gate 
     opens on the East River. It's the waste dump!

     Up on the catwalk, BATMAN has a perfect view of JACK. If 
     JACK can just sprint through the flames without getting 
     shot, he'll make it to the river. BATMAN hooks a rope to 
     his Batarang, FLINGS IT at a catwalk across the floor.

     JACK bolts. BURSTS THROUGH the wall of fire. And just as he 
     does --

     BATMAN leaps off the catwalk and swings down toward him! 
     His foot catches a THIRTY-FOOT ROLL of plastic, six feet in 
     diameter, one of several standing upright on the floor. The 
     plastic roll DROPS into JACK's path, BLOCKING HIS EXIT.

     An instant later, BATMAN lands on top of JACK. Wraps an arm 
     around his throat and RAISES his free hand. DRUG-TIPPED 
     STEEL TALONS appear. But before he can paralyze JACK... 

                              VOICE
               HOLD IT!

     In all the ruckus, HOOD V has managed to circle back behind 
     the heavy machinery. Now he's got a GUN pointed DIRECTLY AT 
     COMMISSIONER GORDON'S HEAD.

                              HOOD V
               Let him go or I'll do it.

     BATMAN releases JACK and stands back. JACK chuckles to 
     himself: what loyalty. Then, with plenty of time, he 
     strolls across the floor to a Jacob's ladder mounted on the 
     back wall... and BEGINS TO CLIMB toward the catwalks.

     All action stops. BATMAN doesn't move. The COPS don't move. 
     HOOD V stands there sweating, his gun hand shaking as he 
     waits for JACK to climb safely out of shooting range.

     ECKHARDT's pig-like eyes glisten. His hand drops to his 
     side. He's half-tempted to pull a gun and get the 
     Commissioner plugged.

     ANGLE ON JACK

     at a crouch, groping his way along the rail of the catwalk. 
     He reaches a paneled glass window propped open by a 
     supporting rod. It's a forty-foot drop to the swirling 
     black currents of the East River... and freedom.

     He's about to climb out when his eye falls on a .38 
     AUTOMATIC -- which lies, abandoned, on the gridwork floor 
     of the catwalk mere yards away.

     ANGLE ON FACTORY FLOOR

     The HOOD, one arm around GORDON. With his gun at the 
     Commissioner's temple, he backs slowly toward the door.

                              HOOD V
               Nobody makes a move. We go out
               clean.

                              JACK'S VOICE
               ECKHARDT!!

     ALL EYES TURN to the catwalk overhead, where JACK stands 
     poised with the .38 in his fist. A SINGLE SHOT drops 
     ECKHARDT cleanly.

     The moment's distraction is all BATMAN needs. He hurls a 
     NINJA WHEEL -- a small, ratcheted, razor-sharp disc -- at 
     the FOREARM of HOOD V. One jerk of a thin filament WIRE -- 
     a sudden SHRIEK -- and GORDON IS FREE.

     The THUG lurches forward. His GUN DROPS to the floor, 
     DISCHARGING ACCIDENTALLY.

     AN UNGODLY HOWL OF PAIN echoes out from the catwalk above. 
     JACK REELS and STAGGERS, his hands CLUTCHING AT HIS CHEEKS. 
     BLOOD GUSHES from between his fingers.

     JACK NAPIER HAS BEEN SHOT THROUGH THE FACE.

     A YOUNG COP, unnerved by the sight of JACK's agonized 
     pirouette, draws his gun and OPENS FIRE.

                              GORDON
               NO!!

     But the bullet has caught JACK in the arm. He spins, 
     totters to the edge of the catwalk... and TOPPLES OVER. The 
     COPS look on helplessly as JACK plunges TWO STORIES DOWN 
     into a CATCH BASIN full of BUBBLING TOXIC WASTE, SCREAMING 
     ALL THE WAY.

                              GORDON (cont.)
               Goddammit, we had him. We --

     And suddenly, with JACK out of the picture, all attention 
     focusses on THE BATMAN. COPS reach for their guns, circle 
     warily around him. Cornered now, he backs off slowly, HANDS 
     ON HIS BELT.

                              GORDON (cont.)
               Hold it right there, Mister.

     THE BATMAN raises his hands in a gesture of surrender. Then 
     -- as the COPS advance -- he flicks TWO TINY CAPSULES onto 
     the factory floor.

     A BLINDING FLASH OF LIGHT. COLORS BURST in a wild 
     pyrotechnic display. COPS stumble backwards, momentarily 
     dazzled, as a THICK WALL OF BLACK SMOKE conceals BATMAN 
     from view.

     A TINY GRAPPLING HOOK rockets out of the dense curling 
     cloud and CATCHES on a catwalk overhead.

                              COP
               LOOK!

     The COPS are firing wildly into the smoke. But it's too 
     late. At the end of a cord, THE BLACK MAJESTIC FIGURE OF 
     THE BATMAN whips upward, rising out of the smoke like an 
     avenging angel -- and DISAPPEARING into the shadowy 
     heights, safely out of range.

                              GORDON
               HOLD YOUR FIRE!

                              COP
               ... Who is this guy?

                              GORDON
               I don't know, but he's one hell of a
               showman.

                                                 CUT TO:

     EXT. ACE CHEMICAL CO. - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT

     A BLACK SHADOW scurries across the roof. From the 
     illuminated sign with its neon ace, WE PAN DOWN past the 
     chemical sluice to a SECOND ACE... a card from JACK's lucky 
     deck, pierced by a neat, round bullet hole, bobbing on the 
     oily surface of the foul, polluted river.

     As deadly toxins gush forth, OTHER CARDS from the deck 
     swirl past: a nine. A deuce. A queen. And finally, a JOKER 
     -- SHOT CLEANLY THROUGH THE FACE.

     A BONE-WHITE HAND BREAKS THE SURFACE as we

                                                 SHOCK CUT TO:

     INT. GOTHAM GLOBE - CITY ROOM - DAY

     A BANNER HEADLINE on the late edition of the Globe: "BAT 
     MAN FOILS ROBBERY. WHO IS MASKED VIGILANTE?"

     Behind the newspaper, feet propped up on his desk, is a 
     jubilant KNOX. He's on the horn to COMMISSIONER GORDON.

                              KNOX
               Commissioner. Do us both a favor.
               Don't tell me some lie you'll have
               to retract later.

     CLICK. KNOX grins, lowers the paper, finds himself looking 
     up at the smiling face of VICKI VALE.

                              KNOX (cont.)
               Vick! Looks like our friend the bat
               is getting ambitious. -- Why the
               dopey grin?

                              VICKI
               Guess who's got a date with Bruce
               Wayne.

                              KNOX
               Bruce Wayne? Date? He called you up
               and asked you for a date?... Shit.
                     (shouting)
               HEY MIRANDA! C'MERE!
                     (to VICKI)
               I want you to pay close attention to
               this. Miranda -- tell my friend here
               what you told me about Bruce Wayne.

     A SUPERANNUATED SOUTHERN BELLE toddles over. MIRANDA REITZ, 
     60, is the society editor of the Globe.

                              MIRANDA
               You mean Mister One-Nighter?

                              KNOX
               Yeah. "Mister One-Nighter."
                     (to VICKI)
               Because that's the average length of
               his relationships with women.

                              MIRANDA
               The current record is almost two
               weeks. That cover girl -- what's her
               name? You must've shot her, Vicki --

                              KNOX
               Tell her about the peanuts.

                              VICKI
               Peanuts?

                              KNOX
               Yeah. Peanuts. Which is how he goes
               through women.

                              MIRANDA
               Like Planter's Peanuts.

     VICKI is about to break out into helpless giggles.

                              VICKI
               Plain or roasted?
                     (standing up)
               Alex, I'm very flattered that you've
               gone out and done all this research.

                              KNOX
               Why?
                     (blushing suddenly)
               Aw, come on, Vicki, I'm a reporter.
               I'm curious. I do this for a living.
               -- What'd you tell him?

                              VICKI
               I told him yes.

     KNOX fumes. VICKI shakes her head and laughs. She takes 
     KNOX's face in her hands, plants a kiss on his forehead.

                              VICKI (cont.)
               You're awfully sweet to be
               concerned, but it's really not
               necessary. I'll call you, okay?

     She exits. KNOX stands there looking poleaxed.

                              KNOX
               ... What was that?

                              MIRANDA
               That was one of the most gracious
               fuck-yous it's ever been my pleasure
               to watch. -- What a nice girl.

     KNOX, totally flustered, sighs and sinks into his chair.

                              KNOX
               Miranda, I'm busy. Go be productive.

                                                 CUT TO:

     EXT. COASTLINE - DAY

     A CABIN CRUISER slices through the waves. In the distance, 
     closer to the shore, we see a throng of SAILBOATS.

     EXT. DECK - YACHT - DAY

     BRUCE's forty-foot cabin cruiser, aptly christened "DIE 
     FLEIDERMAUS." BRUCE and VICKI are on the deck, in chairs, 
     soaking up sun, gazing off at the sailboats.

                              VICKI
               Do you sail?

                              BRUCE
               Too much work. I'm not really the
               physical type. -- Thank you, Alfred.

     ALFRED has just appeared from belowdecks with a tray of 
     drinks for BRUCE and VICKI. VICKI watches as BRUCE reaches 
     for his glass. His forearm looks like a thin layer of skin 
     over braided telephone cables.

                              VICKI
               You do a very convincing imitation.
                     (sipping her drink)
               Mm, this is tasty. What's yours?

     He smiles, slides the drink over toward her, gestures for 
     her to try a sip.

                              VICKI (cont.)
               ... Ginger ale?

                              BRUCE
               Two drinks and I start swinging from
               the rooftops.
                     (beat)
               Tell me, Vicki. There's something
               I'm very curious about. What took
               you down to Corto Maltese?

                              VICKI
               ... I guess I needed a change.

                              BRUCE
               You were one of the most successful
               magazine photographers in the city.
               Everyone wanted you.

                              VICKI
               Have you ever been to Corto Maltese?

                              BRUCE
               Not since the shooting started.

                              VICKI
               We went there once when I was
               little. I played on the beach. And
               at nights -- they had a band -- I
               danced with my father on the hotel
               patio.
                     (shrugging)
               That was Corto Maltese. When the war
               broke out I had to go back. And I
               promised myself that this time... I
               wouldn't look away.

                              BRUCE
               What did you see?

                              VICKI
               ... Terror.

     The conversation is getting rather intense -- at both ends. 
     VICKI seems to have hit some weird chord within BRUCE.

                              BRUCE
               There's terror everywhere. Some
               types are just more -- familiar
               than others.

     For a moment BRUCE seems to be drifting back into his 
     familiar 'preoccupied' mode. VICKI laughs apologetically.

                              VICKI
               I'm sorry. I didn't mean to -- I
               know it all seems a million miles
               away, out here on the water, with
               all this --

                              BRUCE
               Insulation?

     VICKI is momentarily stuck for a reply. In some way she 
     can't quite grasp, he seems to be challenging her.

                              VICKI
               Bruce, really, when I say these
               things I don't mean to criticize
               you.

                              BRUCE
               I think you see things very clearly.

                              VICKI
               I'm happy to talk about something
               else. I don't want to be depressing.

                              BRUCE
                     (smiling)
               Do you assume that if I know you
               better I won't like you as much?

     VICKI starts laughing. BRUCE is a notorious womanizer, but 
     if this is a come-on, it's like no come-on she's ever seen.

                              VICKI
               I'm sorry, Bruce, I have to ask. Are
               you like this with the other women
               you know? -- Because I just can't
               seem to get a handle on this
               conversation.

                              BRUCE
                     (taking her hand)
               Vicki, if I say anything cryptic, or...
               ambiguous, I think you should put
               the most flattering possible
               interpretation on it. Because even
               if it doesn't sound that way... 
               that's how I'll mean it.

     Bingo. The guy's a chessplayer, but on the other hand he's 
     also rather touchingly, almost childishly, sincere. Before 
     she knows it, VICKI finds herself melting.

     INT. GOTHAM CITY OPERA HOUSE - NIGHT

     Rigoletto. THE DUKE onstage, launching into his big 
     crowd-pleaser, "La Donna e Mobile."

     WE PAN THE AUDIENCE, finding several mobile young DONNAS in 
     the crowd -- drop-dead beauties in slinky gowns. Although 
     most eyes are fixed, reasonably enough, on the stage, DONNA 
     #1 is staring with undisguised envy at a PRIVATE BOX above 
     the orchestra seats. Her mouth twists in disgust.

     She scans the crowd, finds her counterpart (DONNA #2) some 
     rows back, on the arm of a bald bigwig. DONNA #2 is wearing 
     a similar sour expression, staring up at the same box.

     DONNA #3 is even less discreet than her comrades. She has 
     her opera glasses trained on the couple in the box.

     HER POV - THROUGH OPERA GLASSES - THE BOX

     BRUCE and VICKI. He whispers in her ear. She smiles and 
     whispers back.

     A beat. He whispers again. This time she doesn't laugh. But 
     her lips part slightly. SCREEN GOES BLACK as the opera 
     glasses SNAP SHUT.

     ANGLE ON CROWD - DONNA #3

     staring icily at the DUKE as he finishes up to a round of 
     TUMULTUOUS APPLAUSE.

     INT. WAYNE MANOR - NIGHT

     BRUCE and VICKI enter. He takes her coat, drops it on a 
     chair by the door. VICKI is giddy, all champagned up.

                              VICKI
               -- but it's not fair. I'm half
               drunk and you're not even --

                              BRUCE
               Would you like me to take you home?

                              VICKI
               God. You would.
                     (sidling up to him)
               Come on, Bruce. I just want to get
               two drinks in you. As an
               experiment.

                              BRUCE
               Maybe we should just kiss.

                              VICKI
               ... We could try that.

     WIDER ANGLE

     BRUCE embracing VICKI in the vastness of the darkened entry 
     hall, framed by long semicircular STAIRWAYS on opposite 
     walls. A SUDDEN FLASH OF LIGHTNING transports us to:

     EXT. OFFICE BUILDING - ESTABLISHING - NIGHT

     Broken windows, graffiti on the walls: a decrepit rathole 
     near the Gotham docks.

     INT. DOCTOR'S OFFICE - NIGHT

     TIGHT ON a face swathed in bandages. The patient sits erect 
     in a wooden chair, surrounded by the grimy paraphernalia of 
     an unlicensed gangland doctor.

     The DOCTOR, a nervous little ferret with the bedside manner 
     of a back-alley abortionist, steps up with a scissors.

                              DOCTOR
               Well, Mr. Napier, let's see how we
               did.

     He begins to snip away. As the bandages come off, we get:

     JACK NAPIER'S POV

     The last strands of gauze peel away. The DOCTOR stands 
     there, looking at his handiwork. His mouth falls open. His 
     eyes bug out. He GAGS.

                              JACK (V.O.)
               Mirror.

     The DOCTOR just stands there staring AT CAMERA, stock-
     still, apparently transfixed by the sight of JACK's face.

                              JACK (V.O.)
               Mirror.

     ANGLE ON DOCTOR

     He clears his throat, reaches apprehensively for a hand 
     mirror, and passes it out of frame to JACK. Two beats. 
     Then, the sound of GLASS SHATTERING as the mirror drops to 
     the floor.

     JACK begins to laugh. THE DOCTOR gets a little edgy.

                              DOCTOR
               You understand the facial muscles
               were completely severed --

     JACK keeps on laughing.

     The DOCTOR turns uneasily away, gestures apologetically at 
     his seedy equipment.

                              DOCTOR (cont.)
               -- you can see what I have to work
               with here --

     MORE LAUGHTER. The trembling DOCTOR covers his face with 
     one hand, whining now, not daring to look at JACK.

                              DOCTOR (cont.)
               I'm sure that with proper recon--
               recon-- reconstructive surgery --

     A DOOR SLAMS. JACK is gone. The grateful DOCTOR breathes a 
     sigh of relief and steadies himself on an operating table.

     EXT. OFFICE BUILDING - OVERHEAD ANGLE - NIGHT

     From a point high above we see JACK emerging into the 
     alley, pulling on a hat, wrapping a muffler about his head. 
     We can't see his face. But we can't forget his LAUGH.

                                                 CUT TO:

     INT. BRUCE WAYNE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

     VICKI nestled peacefully under the covers. Beside her is 
     BRUCE: hands behind his head, staring up at the ceiling.

     It's almost as though BRUCE is not used to sleeping at 
     night. He doesn't know what to do with himself.

     He looks at VICKI. She's terribly lovely. But despite all 
     that, we can't shake the feeling that BRUCE... would really 
     rather be somewhere else.

                                                 CUT TO:

     EXT. STREET - NIGHT

     LOUD MUSIC. KIDS in punk regalia stand outside a rock club 
     as JACK stalks past. The wind knocks his hat off.

                              KID
                    Nice hair, dude!

     JACK ignores them as he bends to retrieve his hat. Then he 
     gazes up at the steel-and-glass facade of a SKYSCRAPER -- 
     and strides deliberately across the street.

     INT. GRISSOM'S PENTHOUSE - NIGHT

     The spectacular Gotham skyline, seen through the plate-
     glass window of GRISSOM's conference room. The doors to the 
     private elevator hiss open and JACK wanders in. He plops in 
     the big plush swivel chair behind GRISSOM's desk.

                              GRISSOM (O.S.)
               That you, sugar bumps?

     GRISSOM waddles in unsuspectingly from the adjoining room. 
     He's fresh out of the shower, a towel wrapped around his 
     impressive girth. He's using a smaller towel to dry his 
     hair, and so it's a moment before he sees the bundled-up 
     figure at his desk.

                              GRISSOM (cont.)
               Who the hell are you?

                              JACK
               It's me. "Sugar Bumps."

                              GRISSOM
                     (recognizing his voice)
               Jack?
                     (advancing cautiously)
               Thank God. I can't believe it's you.
               I heard you'd been --

                              JACK
                     (standing up)
               Is that what you "heard"?

     JACK gestures him over to the empty chair. GRISSOM doesn't 
     move until he sees the GUN pointed at his belly.

                              JACK (cont.)
               YOU SET ME UP!
                     (beat)
               Over a girl. You must be insane!

     GRISSOM surreptitiously reaches for a desk drawer.

                              JACK (cont.)
               Keep your hands on the desk.

                              GRISSOM
               Sooner or later you would've tried
               to take me, Jack. You may get me
               now, but your life won't be worth a
               dime.

                              JACK
               I've died once already. It wasn't so
               bad. -- In fact I recommend it.

     GRISSOM is beginning to panic now. It's obvious that JACK 
     is utterly, hopelessly deranged.

                              GRISSOM
               Jack, listen -- we'll cut a deal --

                              JACK
               JACK? JACK? DO I LOOK LIKE A JACK??

     And now, for the first time, he flings away the hat. RIPS 
     THE MUFFLER from his face. And -- as GRISSOM gasps in shock 
     -- STANDS REVEALED in his full horrendous glory.

     His flesh is bleached bone-white. His hair is a luminous 
     seaweed-green. And his cheeks are torn and puckered from 
     the bullet wound, TWISTING HIS MOUTH INTO A HIDEOUS, 
     PERPETUAL HARLEQUIN'S GRIN.

                              JACK (cont.)
               I'm not a Jack any more.
                     (pause; cackling)
               You made me a Joker!

     THE CACKLE BUILDS INTO FURIOUS, HYSTERICAL LAUGHTER. 
     GRISSOM, revulsed, terrified, pushes himself away from the 
     desk, back toward the window which overlooks the city.

                              GRISSOM
               Jack -- I'm warning you. WIPE THAT
               LUNATIC GRIN OFF YOUR FACE.

                              JACK
               HA! That's the best part. I CAN'T!!

     And with that JACK pulls the trigger. And fires. And fires 
     again until the CLIP IS EMPTY.

     EXT. GRISSOM'S BUILDING - NIGHT

     We TILT UP the chrome-and-glass facade of the skyscraper, 
     arriving finally at the TOP FLOOR: a PLATE GLASS WINDOW 
     spiderwebbed with cracks where Jack's bullets hit.

     INT. GRISSOM'S PENTHOUSE - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT

     The room is still dark. JACK -- or, as we'll know him from 
     this moment on, THE JOKER -- sits in GRISSOM's swivel 
     chair, staring out at the moon-drenched skyline.

                              JOKER
               What a view. Our little city. It
               always brings a smile to my face.

     He reaches for a nearby glass of liquor and glances down at 
     GRISSOM -- who lies dead on the floor, the towel still 
     wrapped around him. THE JOKER laughs softly to himself.

                              JOKER (cont.)
               Guess it's my little city now.
               Wonder what it'll look like when I
               get done with it.
                     (pause)
               I bet it'll be something real fine.
               Real fine and pretty.

     INT. BRUCE WAYNE'S BEDROOM - MORNING

     The sun is just up, and VICKI finds herself alone in bed. A 
     SOFT, OFF-KEY BARITONE VOICE drifts out of the adjacent 
     bathroom: BRUCE in the shower, singing "Honeysuckle Rose."

     She breaks into a huge smile and climbs out of bed. Somehow 
     she's wound up wearing BRUCE's ribbed formal shirt.

     INT. BATHROOM - A MOMENT LATER - MORNING

     BRUCE in his opulent deco shower stall, still SINGING to 
     himself. VICKI sneaks up behind him, opens the door. He 
     instantly STOPS SINGING -- as if he's been hit by a brick.

                              VICKI
               I didn't mean to scare you. I just
               had to come in here and see it that
               was really you singing.

     She smiles, teasing him. He doesn't respond. He acts as if 
     she's caught him doing something shameful -- exposed him.

                              VICKI (cont.)
                     (singing)
               "Don't buy sugar -- you just have to
               touch my cup." Come on. "You're my
               sugar --"
                     (no response from BRUCE)
               Bruce, you are such a case.

     BRUCE seems somehow unable to sing along. But be quickly 
     recovers his composure -- and forces a crooked, almost 
     childish smile.

                              BRUCE
               I don't sing very well.

                              VICKI
               Then there's one thing in the world
               you don't do very well. And I know
               what it is. -- Now you'll have to
               kill me.

     He kisses her good morning, steps out and reaches for a 
     towel. His body is one big mass of BRUISES AND ABRASIONS.

                              VICKI (cont.)
               Poor thing. You should stay off that
               horse.

     INT. GLOBE - CITY ROOM - DAY

     KNOX, in a surly mood, examines the morning edition of the 
     Globe. He's turned to page six -- the gossip page -- and 
     there, under Miranda Reitz's byline, is a picture of VICKI. 
     It seems she and BRUCE are the talk of the town.

                              KNOX
                     (disgusted)
               ...Peanut.

     A COPY BOY approaches his desk with a MANILA FOLDER:

                              COPY BOY
               Here's that morgue file you wanted.

     KNOX leans back in his chair. The file is labelled "BRUCE 
     WAYNE: 1982-1987."  KNOX opens it and begins to leaf 
     through old clippings from back issues of the Globe.

     WAYNE FOUNDATION TO FUND LOW-COST HOUSING. MILLIONAIRE 
     HEADS CHARITY DRIVE FOR GOTHAM HANDICAPPED. HURRICANE 
     VICTIMS SAY 'THANK YOU' TO BRUCE WAYNE. KNOX's face sags in 
     dismay. Every article seems to be telling us just how swell 
     a rich philanthropist can be.

                              KNOX
               Come on. Gimme some dirt!

     Then he notices something odd. In the whole fat file of 
     clippings, there are no pictures of Bruce Wayne -- with two 
     partial exceptions.

     One is a group shot, Bruce in the middle, waving at the 
     camera and blocking our view of his face. The other is an 
     ancient picture of a collegiate Bruce, stern-faced, hair 
     down to his collar. The caption reads "BRUCE WAYNE IN 
     1973" -- years out of date even when it ran in the paper.

                              KNOX (cont.)
               ... Why don't you like your picture
               taken?

     INT. APARTMENT LOBBY - NIGHT

     A DOORMAN DOZES in the plush lobby of ALICIA HUNT's 
     apartment building on the East Side of Gotham. Through the 
     glass doors we see ALICIA outside in the chill wind, 
     peering inside, hesitant to enter.

     As silently as possible she uses her key and steps in, 
     tiptoeing past the doorman, trying not to wake him. She's 
     almost made it when he SITS BOLT UPRIGHT, startling her.

                              DOORMAN
               Miss Hunt!
                     (smiling)
               No need to sneak in. The rent's been
               taken care of.

                              ALICIA
               ... The rent? Paid?

     INT. ALICIA'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

     ALICIA, mystified, lets herself in and turns to lock the 
     door. She's startled once more by a VOICE FROM BEHIND.

                              VOICE
               Honey -- I'm home!

     She pivots. Her eyes widen. She SHRIEKS.

     Sitting cross-legged in an easy chair, a twisted grin on 
     his loathesome face, is THE JOKER. He's in a smoking jacket 
     and slippers, reading the paper, a dry martini at his side.

     This grim parody of domesticity sends poor ALICIA into a 
     dead faint.

     INT. PENTHOUSE SUITE - DAY

     It looks for all the world like a corporate boardroom. At a 
     long table sit Gotham's most distinguished criminals: 
     GANGLORDS and RACKETS BOSSES from every corner of the city. 
     They stare suspiciously at the head of the table.

                              JOKER (O.S.)
               So that's how it is, gents. Until
               Grissom decides it's safe to come up
               for air... I'm running the show.

     Now we see what they see: THE JOKER, dressed rather 
     flamboyantly in a big slouch hat. His FACE is layered with 
     flesh-toned makeup, and his HAIR's been rinsed black.

     Unfortunately, he can't conceal his ghoulish SMILE.

                              GANG BOSS
               So why don't we hear this from
               Grissom?

                              RACKETEER
               I got something I'd like to know.
               How come you're wearing that stupid
               smirk?

                              JOKER
               'Cause I got an army, chum. And I
               got Grissom's army. And this city
               is mine.

     CARMINE ROTELLI, an especially oily mobster, speaks up:

                              ROTELLI
               I don't like taking orders, from
               Grissom. And I especially don't like
               taking orders from Grissom's goon.

                              JOKER
               I've considered that possibility.

                              ROTELLI
               And what happens if we say no?

                              JOKER
                     (chuckling)
               Nobody wants a war, Carmine. If we
               can't do business, we shake hands
               and part friends.

                              ROTELLI
               That's it?

                              JOKER
               That's it.

     THE JOKER extends a hand. ROTELLI reaches out to shake it. 
     He doesn't see the JOY BUZZER concealed in the JOKER's 
     palm.

     40,000 VOLTS course through ROTELLI's body. He drops back 
     into his seat a blackened husk, SMOKE pouring out from his 
     sleeves and shirt collar.

     The CRIMELORDS recoil in horror. Before they can make a 
     move, a squad of ARMED THUGS burst into the room.

                              JOKER (cont.)
               Looks like Carmine got a little hot
               under the collar.

                              CRIMELORD
               ... You're insane!

     The JOKER is a wee bit agitated. He removes the hat and 
     mops sweat from his brow, exposing a patch of CHALK-WHITE 
     FLESH -- to the great bewilderment of the ONLOOKERS.

                              JOKER
               That's what they said about Lee
               Iacocca. Now GET OUT OF HERE. -- And
               THINK IT OVER!

     The sickened CRIMINALS file out cautiously. That leaves THE 
     JOKER alone in the room with the charred corpse of ROTELLI. 
     THE JOKER sinks into a chair and -- as is his wont -- 
     ADDRESSES THE STIFF:

                              JOKER (cont.)
               Heck, they're not such bad guys. I
               say we give 'em a couple of days to
               come around.
                     (thoughtful pause)
               We-e-ll... maybe one day.
                     (then, casually)
               Aaah, screw it. Let's grease 'em.

                                                 CUT TO:

     INT. SMALL BACK ROOM - NIGHT

     A poker game. A CRIMELORD from the JOKER's board meeting 
     picks up his hand and fans out the cards. FIVE JOKERS.

     He looks up, puzzled. The last thing he sees is a HIRED 
     KILLER bursting in through the door, GUN IN HAND.

     EXT. GOTHAM PARK - DAY

     A COSTUMED CLOWN with a wheeled cart, filling balloons from 
     a helium tank, passing them out to the kids. CRIMELORD #2 
     strolls past. The CLOWN offers him a balloon, which be 
     politely refuses.

     THE CLOWN reaches into his cart for a RED METAL TANK. But, 
     as we quickly find out, it's not a helium tank -- it's a 
     FLAMETHROWER.

     EXT. HALLIDAY PLAZA - DAY

     A sunny, landscaped quad surrounded by corporate 
     skyscrapers: trees, grass, marble fountains, flags of many 
     nations. Amid the pedestrians we catch BRUCE and VICKI, all 
     smiles, cutting through the plaza on the way to lunch.

                              VICKI
               ... To tell you the truth, I'd just
               about given up waiting.

                              BRUCE
               I said I'd call you the minute I got
               free. And I did. -- And here we are.

                              VICKI
                     (teasing him)
               Hm hmm. Lunch. Not even dinner.

     He stops in his tracks, takes her by the shoulders.

                              BRUCE
               Vicki. Do you want the whole truth?
               All coyness aside?
                     (long pause)
               I wish I had more time to give you.
               Every day I don't see you, I miss
               you.
                     (beat)
               Now. Are you going to waste this
               lovely afternoon being all mad at
               me?

     All this, of course, is delivered with devastating 
     sincerity. VICKI finds herself totally disarmed.

                              VICKI
               Okay, I'm a sucker. You sound so
               much like someone I used to... 
                     (stopping suddenly)
               Bruce? I know this is silly, but --
               you're not married, are you?

     He stops and laughs. She smiles crookedly, takes his arm.

     ANOTHER ANGLE - ACROSS PLAZA - THAT MOMENT

     PHILLY RICORSO -- another CRIMELORD from the boardroom -- 
     enters the plaza flanked by a cadre of PAID BODYGUARDS.

     ON BRUCE AND VICKI

     A PAINTED STREET MIME walks alongside them, feeling his way 
     along an imaginary wall. VICKI groans.

                              VICKI
               All street mimes should be executed.

                              BRUCE
               ... Looks like a convention.

     And indeed, there are HALF A DOZEN STREET MIMES converging 
     on the center of the plaza.

     RICORSO and co. approach the mirrored-glass entrance of a 
     skyscraper. In the lobby, A MIME -- who's been annoying the 
     passersby -- THROWS A BOLT, LOCKING THE DOORS from inside.

     A BODYGUARD bangs on the glass. Nearby, ANOTHER MIME 
     reaches into a trash bin -- and pulls out a MACHINE GUN.

     SUDDEN SCREAMS OF TERROR from the onlookers.

     VICKI turns to BRUCE. Before she can get his name out, he's 
     HOISTED HER BODILY and THROWN HER behind a marble fountain.

     SERIES OF SHOTS

     BRUCE'S EYES darting birdlike around the plaza -- INTERCUT 
     with the following POV SHOTS, ALL IN SLOW MOTION:

     -    TWO MIMES with machine guns. One of them lining PHILLY 
          and co. up against the glass doors, the other holding 
          the CROWD at bay;

     -    A WOMAN in the crowd fainting. A THIRD MIME gleefully 
          imitating her swoon, to no one's amusement;

     -    PHILLY and his goons, COWERING, hands in the air, as 
          OTHER MIMES cruelly mimic their terrified poses... 

     ... and suddenly BRUCE is RUNNING FRANTICALLY, looking for 
     a secluded spot, an alleyway, anything. No go. He's out in 
     the open, with onlookers everywhere. In his civvies, he's 
     just another citizen... TOTALLY IMPOTENT.

     He darts around a corner, backs against a wall. WOMEN, 
     CHILDREN, GROWN MEN race past. No privacy. He's 
     practically quaking now, in the throes of some terrible 
     anxiety. He looks up at the sky overhead, terrified.

     A BRILLIANT SUN bears down on him as MACHINE GUNS CHATTER.

     ANGLE ON PHILLY AND BODYGUARDS

     BODIES JERKING as GLASS rains down in shards.

     ANGLE ON BRUCE

     his back arched, his mouth agape, his face drained of blood 
     as the sounds of carnage echo through the plaza. It's 
     almost as if the bullets are striking him.

     A moment later, it's all over but the screaming. VICKI 
     emerges from the crowd and finds BRUCE slumped against the 
     wall, nearly catatonic. She moves to touch him.

     As if by reflex he reaches out and GRABS HER BY THE ARMS -- 
     with a grip so strong it could crush bone. She GASPS, looks 
     up -- and sees, in his traumatized EYES, a look so raw, so 
     desperate, that it virtually defies comprehension.

                              VICKI
               BRUCE!!

     He blinks rapidly. He relaxes his grip. Before VICKI's 
     eyes, he's changing... becoming the BRUCE she knows.

                              BRUCE
               Oh my God... are you all right?

     He reaches for her. Involuntarily, she steps back.

     He sees her reaction and his face goes slack -- frightened, 
     pleading. This time she lets him embrace her... but her 
     face is full of bewilderment and doubt.

     INSERT - TELEVISION SCREEN

                              ANCHORWOMAN
               ... live from Halliday Plaza, where a
               gangland-style execution claimed the
               life of racketeer Philly Ricorso.
               Ricorso's death is the third in a
               rash of underworld killings... 

     CUT TO TWO-SHOT: the ANCHORWOMAN and COMMISSIONER GORDON.

                              ANCHORWOMAN (cont.)
               Commissioner, you've heard the
               rumors. Are these murders the work
               of the mysterious 'Batman'?

     A PIERCING CACKLE fills the air. CAMERA PULLS BACK from the 
     TV, placing us in the JOKER's boardroom. Behind the big 
     desk he SWIVELS INTO VIEW, phone in hand.

                              JOKER
               All reet! I think it's about time
               we called another meeting, huh?

                                                 CUT TO:

     INT. WAYNE MANOR - DAY

     ALFRED on the phone, a feather duster in his hand.

                              ALFRED
               I'm sorry, Miss Vale. I've given him
               your messages. That's all I can do.

     ANGLE WIDENS. BRUCE is sitting mere feet away, obviously 
     distraught, locked in some sort of internal struggle.

     INT. VICKI'S APARTMENT - THAT MOMENT - DAY

                              VICKI
               Please tell him... I'm not trying to
               make his life difficult. I'd just --
               I'd just like to know what's going
               on.

     A KNOCK at the door as VICKI hangs up. She goes to open it, 
     finds KNOX -- wearing a big, cheshire-cat smile.

                              KNOX
               Hiya, peanut. I got something I'd
               like you to see.

     INT. LIBRARY - DAY

     A MICROFILM MACHINE. As VICKI looks on curiously, KNOX -- 
     all eagerness now -- threads up a roll of film and begins 
     cranking through back-issue newspapers.

                              KNOX
               Okay, here we go. Check it out.

     He steps back. VICKI stares down at the display screen. A 
     FRONT-PAGE BANNER HEADLINE reads:

                      THOMAS WAYNE MURDERED
            Prominent Doctor, Wife Slain in Robbery
            Unidentified Gunman Leaves Child Unharmed

     Beneath it, a PHOTO: cops kneeling over corpses. Medics 
     with stretchers. And off to one side, a YOUNG BOY -- BRUCE 
     WAYNE -- his arms wrapped around the waist of a BEAT COP.

     The BOY stares straight at the camera. His face is a mask 
     of UNFORGETTABLE AGONY. You can't take your eyes off it.

                              VICKI
               Oh my God... I've seen this picture.

                              KNOX
               I guess so. Pulitzer Prize, 1963.

                              VICKI
               His face. Allie, look at his face.

     TIGHT ON THE BOY'S contorted face, staring out in shock and 
     disbelief, his features recognizable across all the years 
     -- permanently, indelibly traumatized. The same face VICKI
     saw in Halliday Plaza.

                              KNOX
               Yep. He watched the whole thing
               happen. -- Recognize the beat cop?
               Jim Gordon.

                              VICKI
               Oh, Bruce... 

                              KNOX
               Something like this -- what do you
               suppose this could drive a guy to?

     INT. RESTAURANT - DAY

     A greasy spoon off the lobby of the Globe building. KNOX
     and VICKI in a booth.

                              VICKI
               Alexander, you are on drugs.

                              KNOX
               He walks out on his own party. Half
               an hour later, the Caped Crusader
               turns up in full bat-drag.
                     (beat)
               Sees an execution, freaks out in an
               alleyway. No place to change.
                     (smiling)
               Yeah, Vicki, he's "married" all
               right.

                              VICKI
               You're pissing me off, Allie. I know
               exactly why you're doing this.

                              KNOX
                     (leaning forward)
               Oh? Why is that, Vicki?

     VICKI wilts under the challenge. She holds her silence for 
     a second, then changes the subject.

                              VICKI
               He's best friends with Jim Gordon
               and Harvey Dent. They would know.

                              KNOX
               ... Okay, Vicki, I have a confession
               to make. I'm the Batman.

     VICKI snorts, rolls her eyes impatiently.

                              KNOX (cont.)
               Don't believe me? Why not?

                              VICKI
               Alexander... I know you.

                              KNOX
               Right. And they know him. And
               that's why it would never occur to
               them for a minute that their old
               buddy Bruce puts on a cape at night
               and goes out looking for --

                              VICKI
               This is pointless. I'm leaving.

                              KNOX
                     (grabbing her arm)
               Your little chum is out of his mind.
                     (relaxing his grip)
               Next time you call him up and he
               can't go out Friday night -- think
               it over.

                                                 CUT TO:

     INT. ACE CHEMICAL CO. - DAY

     LOW ANGLE on the JOKER. He stands on a catwalk high above 
     the refinery floor, lord of all he surveys, overseeing 
     production like a demented middle manager.

     INT. STOREROOM - DAY

     A dank, windowless room in the bowels of Ace Chemical, 
     which the JOKER has converted into a makeshift lair. SAP-
     LIKE GOO drips in puddles from exposed pipes overhead.

     CAMERA DRIFTS across the JOKER's cluttered desk. Shipping 
     manifests. Ledgers. PSYCHOTIC DOODLES scrawled in crayon.

     More significantly: an old CONTRACT dating back to the mid-
     seventies. It's half-obscured by other papers, but the 
     initials 'CIA' are plainly visible.

     Then: a BOUND REPORT with the title 'DDID NERVE GAS: 
     RESULTS OF PRELIMINARY EXPERIMENTATION.' Across its title 
     page, a diagonal rubber stamp: 'DISCONTINUED January 1977.'

     And finally: a sheaf of PHOTOS. Laboratory apes, chimps and
     orangutans, all DEAD. Their LIPS are drawn back, exposing 
     HIDEOUS, CHEMICAL-INDUCED GRIMACES.

     ON ONE WALL: POSTER-SIZED BLOWUPS of the grinning apes.

     ON THE OPPOSITE WALL: a large-scale photographic 
     reproduction of the Gotham City skyline, its bottom half 
     HIDDEN FROM VIEW by the JOKER's desk.

     The PHONE RINGS. The JOKER -- who has been sitting on the 
     floor by the cityscape -- POPS INTO FRAME and picks it up.

                              JOKER
               How's that first shipment coming?

                              VOICE ON PHONE
               Right on schedule. Oh, we got that
               address for you -- 79 East End,
               #12-C.

                              JOKER
               Mmm. How'd you find it?

                              VOICE ON PHONE
               Called her agent.

     The JOKER nods in satisfaction and resumes his place on the 
     floor. Like a happy kindergartener, with paste pot and 
     scissors, he's CLIPPING PHOTOS from a magazine -- horrible 
     scenes of death, destruction, panic, mutilation.

     One by one, he's PASTING these shots on the blowup of 
     Gotham city -- all along sidewalk level -- creating a 
     massive photomontage of ANARCHY IN THE STREETS.

     We've seen these photos before. VICKI VALE took them... in 
     Corto Maltese.

     INT. PHOTOGRAPHER'S STUDIO - DAY

     In foreground, ROWS OF MAKEUP in startling profusion: 
     mascara, blusher, eyeliner, lipstick. HALF A DOZEN 
     BEAUTIFUL MODELS giggle into their makeup mirrors.

     In the background VICKI wanders past with a stylish friend, 
     CLAIRE, who owns and operates the studio.

                              CLAIRE
               ... of course, after Corto Maltese,
               this must all seem pretty tame.

                              VICKI
               Not to me. I need a job.

                              CLAIRE
               Now Vicki. Everyone knows you've
               got your hooks in Bruce Wayne.

                              VICKI
               Then "everyone" must know something
               I don't.

                              CLAIRE
                     (cattily)
               Oh. Really. Well. -- Come on,
               dear, Tony's dying to see you.

     In a corner of the studio, TONY, a gaunt, tubercular Brit, 
     is shooting a swimsuit layout with two SUPERMODELS. They 
     all ad lib greetings to VICKI as TONY darts around 
     hyperkinetically, snapping the girls in a series of poses.

                              TONY
               Yes, ladies, smiles, show me
               those smiles, fabulous, tropical
               smiles, think Tahiti, I want to
               see teeth, yes, those glorious
               teeth --

     As VICKI looks on, the SUPERMODELS freeze in place 
     simultaneously, a strange, STRICKEN LOOK on their faces.

                              TONY (cont.)
               My God no, don't stop now, those
               smiles, I need those smiles --

     Suddenly the girls are LAUGHING -- but the laughter is 
     unnatural, involuntary. VICKI, sensing that something is 
     terribly wrong, lays a hand on CLAIRE's arm.

     The MODELS, now wearing HUGE SMILES, begin to TWITCH 
     SPASMODICALLY. TONY snaps away.

                              TONY (cont.)
               Yes! Oh baby, YES! That's --
                     (beat)
               No! Too far, too far! Pull back,
               pull back!
                     (dropping the camera)
               OH MY GOD!

     The SUPERMODELS PITCH TO THE FLOOR, shuddering 
     convulsively, their LIPS drawn back in FRIGHTFUL, FROZEN, 
     LAB-APE GRINS. VICKI GASPS. CLAIRE SCREAMS. TONY SCREAMS.

                                                 CUT TO:

     INT. TELEVISION STUDIO - EVENING

     The Eyewitness News set, with anchors PATSY NARITA and
     DAVE McELROY. Behind them, BLOWUPS of the two dead 
     SUPERMODELS.

                              PATSY
               The fashion world was stunned today
               by the sudden deaths of top models
               Kelly Brinkley and Christie Emberg.
               Cause of death has been attributed
               to a violent allergic reaction,
               although authorities have not yet
               ruled out the possibility of drug
               use. Dave?

     Behind DAVE, on the bluescreen: a HUGE STATUE, covered in 
     canvas -- not unlike New York's Statue of Liberty.

                              DAVE
               In Gotham, plans continue for the
               city's 300th birthday celebration.
               The four-day event will conclude
               with the unveiling, in Gotham
               Harbor, of the newly restored 'Lady
               Gotham'... 

     A TECHNICIAN'S HAND passes a slip of paper into frame.

                              DAVE (cont.)
               This bulletin just in. Nine more
               mysterious deaths at a beauty parlor
               in --

     Off to the left, PATSY begins to LAUGH. DAVE FROWNS.

                              DAVE (cont.)
               Patsy! This is hardly the --
                     (his eyes widen)
               PATSY!!

     An offscreen CRASH. Suddenly DAVE is up out of his seat, 
     mouth agape in horror.

     PATSY HAS GONE INTO CONVULSIONS. CAMERA WHIPS VIOLENTLY 
     RIGHT AND LEFT as she jerks out of her seat and TOTTERS 
     UNCONTROLLABLY across the set, LAUGHING INSANELY.

     TECHNICIANS rush the soundstage in an unrehearsed frenzy. 
     PATSY spins like a dervish and LURCHES BACKWARD over the 
     newsdesk in a death spasm, giving us a quick look at the
     grisly Joker's grin etched on her now-lifeless face.

     DAVE gestures frantically to the cameraman:

                              DAVE (cont.)
               KILL THE CAMERA!! KILL THE --

     Suddenly, CRACKLING VIDEO STATIC wipes out the screen. A 
     moment later, we're looking at:

     SPLITSCREEN CLOSEUP - THE SUPERMODELS

     Their gorgeous faces sprout BIG, ANIMATED-CARTOON GRINS as 
     a BOUNCY TUNE -- "Put on a Happy Face" -- comes up 
     underneath.

                              MODELS (CARTOON VOICE)
               ... Love that Joker!

     INT. SUPERMARKET - DAY

     THEME MUSIC CONTINUES as a grinning, deranged pitchman -- 
     THE JOKER -- pushes his shopping cart down the aisle. The 
     shelves are filled with products bearing his TRADEMARK 
     HARLEQUIN'S FACE. He waves merrily in time to the music.

     INT. STUDIO - VIDEO CONTROL BOOTH - THAT MOMENT

     PANICKED TECHNICIANS swarm the booth. The studio feed has 
     been JAMMED. Every monitor shows THE JOKER'S COMMERCIAL.

                              DIRECTOR
               WHERE'S IT COMING FROM??

                              TECHNICIAN
               I DON'T KNOW!

     CLOSEUP - THE JOKER

                              JOKER
               ... new improved Joker brand. With
               the secret ingredient... SMYLENOL!
                     (a sweep of the hand)
               Let's go to our blind taste test.

     TIGHT ON an anonymous MAN -- GAGGED AND BLINDFOLDED, tied 
     to his chair, squirming, struggling. On the table before 
     him is a package labelled "BRAND X." A SUPERIMPOSED TITLE 
     reads: "NOT AN ACTOR."

                              JOKER (cont.)
               Ooh. He's tense. Irritable. Out of
               sorts.
                     (wagging a finger)
               He's been using Brand X! But with
               new improved Joker brand... 

     ANGLE WIDENS to include a BLINDFOLDED CORPSE, limp in his 
     chair, GRINNING HORRIFICALLY.

                              JOKER (cont.)
               ... it's a SMILE EVERY TIME!!

     EXT. IDYLLIC PASTORAL SETTING - DAY

     THE JOKER in a field of wheat. On a picnic blanket before 
     him are TWO CLEAN-CUT MODELS -- one male, one female, BOTH 
     DEAD... and GRIMACING HORRIBLY.

                              JOKER (cont.)
               -- and the world smiles with you!
               Irresistable -- oh-so-kissable --

     He grabs the dead MODELS by the hair. THEIR TEETH CLINK as 
     he forces their heads together for a post-mortem kiss.

     SERIES OF SHOTS

     Television sets all over Gotham, as startled citizens react 
     to the JOKER's maniacal promo.

                              JOKER
               I know what you're saying. Where can
               I buy these fine, fine products?
               Well, that's the gag, folks, you
               never know. Chances are... you've
               bought 'em already!!!

     As his RANT CONTINUES, we SEE:

     -    A YOUNG MAN watching the bedroom TV as he dresses for 
          a date. He's got an aerosol deodorant can poised under 
          one arm, ready to spray. He looks down at the can, 
          suddenly uncertain. Could it be...?

     -    A FAMILY in their kitchen, eyeing a 12-inch portable 
          as MOM serves dinner. They dig in automatically, then 
          FREEZE with their forks in midair.

     -    A MIDDLE-AGED MATRON at the living-room TV. Shocked, 
          she calls to her husband -- and gets no reply. We 
          FOLLOW HER to the bathroom door.

          On the floor she sees AN OVERTURNED SHAMPOO BOTTLE. 
          Then: her HUSBAND, slumped down in the tub, a lethal 
          GRIN on his face. She lets out a SHRIEK.

     INT. WAYNE MANOR - STUDY - NIGHT

     ALFRED THE BUTLER in a crouch, glued to the tube.

                              ALFRED
               ... Sir!

     HIS POV: THE JOKER in tight closeup. Offscreen, an INFANT 
     begins to squall. THE JOKER cocks an eyebrow.

                              JOKER
               Baby's got a tummyache? Here's
               something that'll fix him quick!

     He tosses a JOKER PRODUCT out of frame. Then -- leering -- 
     he gives the camera a BIG JUICY WINK.

                              JOKER (cont.)
               Now on your grocer's shelf. So
               remember -- use Joker brand -- and
               put on a happy face!!

     MUSIC UP. VIDEO SNOW fills the screen as the jammed 
     transmission end. ALFRED looks over his shoulder.

     TRACK IN ON THE GRIM, DETERMINED FACE OF BRUCE WAYNE.

     -    The Gotham Globe cartwheeling into frame:

                         PANIC GRIPS GOTHAM
                Contaminated Products Claim 72 Lives
                WHO IS THE MYSTERIOUS "JOKER"?

     -    An ANCHORWOMAN on the evening news. Her complexion is 
          curiously sallow. BLACK BAGS show under her eyes.

                              ANCHORWOMAN
                  ... sixteen new deaths, with no clues
                  as to the Joker's identity or
                  demands. The list at potentially
                  lethal products now includes:
                  perfume -- mascara -- cold cream --

     -    The makeover counter at Bloomingdale's. SECURITY 
          GUARDS rush to the scene as THREE MATRONLY CUSTOMERS
          go into simultaneous smiling fits.

     -    An ANCHORMAN with a BIG UGLY ZIT on his nose:

                              ANCHORMAN
                  Men's cologne toothpaste mouthwash
                  -- underarm deodorant --

     -    A SUBWAY CAR jammed with STRAPHANGERS. HUGE PATCHES OF 
          SWEAT under every arm. The doors slide open; ONCOMING 
          PASSENGERS RECOIL VISIBLY at the unendurable stench.

     -    The original ANCHORWOMAN, whose look is now 100% 
          natural. Her hair is frizzy. Her eyebrows are missing 
          altogether. Every wrinkle on her face is plainly 
          visible.

                              ANCHORWOMAN
                  Hair spray -- eyebrow pencil --
                  moisturizing cream --

     -    A LARGE DRUGSTORE. CASHIERS sit idly by the registers. 
          The store is utterly devoid of customers.

                                                 CUT TO:

     EXT. STREET - DUSK

     From across the street we see VICKI headed down the 
     sidewalk toward a museum. A GLOVED HAND reaches for a pay 
     phone.

                              VOICE
               She's outside the Fluegelheim.

     INT. ALICIA HUNT'S PENTHOUSE - THAT MOMENT

     A BONE-WHITE HAND slams a phone receiver down. THE JOKER is 
     at his vanity. He's rinsed his hair black. He's applying 
     pounds of pancake makeup to his bleached face, his puckered 
     cheeks. In the right light he could almost pass for human.

     In all the city, he's the only person still using 
     cosmetics.

     A DREAMY, DRUGGED VOICE intrudes:

                              ALICIA
               Jack? Who was that?

     As he looks up at the mirror, we get a quick glimpse of 
     ALICIA behind him. The voice, the long blonde hair, are 
     unmistakable. But for some reason, ALICIA'S FACE is 
     COVERED... by a SHINY WHITE PORCELAIN DOLL'S MASK.

                              JOKER
               Get dressed. We're going out.

     INT. FLUEGELHEIM MUSEUM - EVENING

     A Gotham landmark, the Fluegelheim looks like something 
     Frank Lloyd Wright would've dreamed up -- a large open 
     atrium encircled by a stucco RAMP, which spirals up along 
     the interior walls to the CEILING four stories above. You 
     walk up this gently-inclined ramp to view the paintings.

     INT. FLUEGELHEIM - ROOFTOP TEA ROOM - EVENING

     The upper terminus of the ramp opens on an airy, fern-
     filled dining room popular with tourists and elderly 
     matrons who work up an appetite looking at art. VICKI 
     enters, camera bag slung over one shoulder, portfolio in 
     hand.

                              VICKI
               I'm meeting Mr. Wayne. Is he here?

                              MAITRE D'
               No, but your table is ready.

     INT. TEA ROOM - TWENTY MINUTES LATER - EVENING

     VICKI, sipping on a gin and tonic, checks her watch. A 
     WAITER brings her a small parcel, wrapped in brown paper, 
     bearing a single word: URGENT.

                              WAITER
               Miss Vale, this just arrived for
               you.

     As the WAITER leaves, she tears off the wrapper. Inside is 
     a small white box and a NOTE -- SCRIBBLED IN CRAYON.

               DEAR V. VALE,
                    PUT THIS ON RIGHT NOW.

     Unsigned, of course. VICKI, puzzled, opens the box to find 
     a MINIATURE GAS MASK.

     She hears a strange HISSING NOISE. A few feet away, GREEN 
     SMOKE is billowing out of an air-conditioning vent.

     TRAYS OF FOOD CRASH TO THE FLOOR as WAITERS pass out. ART 
     LOVERS drop forks, go face down in their pasta salad.

     VICKI hurriedly fits the gas mask over her nose and mouth. 
     Within seconds, she's the only one conscious in the room.

     INT. MUSEUM - THAT MOMENT

     GREEN SMOKE plumes up toward the ceiling as we TILT DOWN 
     toward the floor of the atrium. PATRONS and SECURITY GUARDS 
     lie sprawled on the floor, twisted at odd angles, out cold.

     The mist is beginning to clear now. The doors swing open 
     and in strolls THE JOKER, looking quite dapper in his
     street makeup and BIG PURPLE PIMP'S HAT.

     A SQUAD OF GOONS enters behind him. Some of them are 
     carrying large cartons. They lock the entry doors, place a 
     "CLOSED" sign in front of them, and begin uncrating LARGE 
     CANS OF BLACK PAINT.

     The JOKER steps up onto the ramp, examines the artwork with 
     an appreciative eye.

                              JOKER
               Okay, boys, let's broaden our minds.

     He stops in front of an Ingres odalisque. Stands back a 
     pace or two to get a better look. Then pulls out a STRAIGHT 
     RAZOR and cuts a LONG DIAGONAL GASH in the canvas.

     He ambles up the ramp, stepping over collapsed patrons, 
     pausing at every fourth or fifth painting. Monet water 
     lilies, a Degas ballerina -- all get the razor treatment. 
     Behind him his CRONIES work their way up the ramp, HEAVING 
     BLACK PAINT on every canvas the JOKER has missed.

     He cocks an eyebrow at Edvard Munch's "THE SCREAM."

                              JOKER (cont.)
               I kinda like this one. Leave it.

     INT. TEA ROOM - A MOMENT LATER - EVENING

     VICKI at her table, still wearing the gas mask, scared as 
     hell. The overhead lights wink out and the room goes dark. 
     The JOKER saunters over and pulls up a chair.

                              JOKER
               I think it's safe to take that off.

     VICKI recognizes the deranged smile instantly. She removes 
     the gas mask, tries to gather her wits.

                              JOKER (cont.)
               You're quite beautiful.

                              VICKI
               ... Thank you.

                              JOKER
               Unfortunate, but I think we can work
               around it.

     He sets a couple of CANDLESTICKS on the table and reaches 
     for his lighter. A LONG JET OF FLAME shoots out, Jerry 
     Lewis-style, as he lights the candles.

                              JOKER (cont.)
               You're Vicki Vale. I guess you know
               who I am. -- Is this your
               portfolio?

     She nods. He opens it, begins leafing through the record of 
     VICKI's career. Newspaper photos from the Globe, at first.
     Then fashion layouts, magazine covers of celebrities. 
     Artier B&W shots from VICKI's first couple of exhibitions.

                              JOKER (cont.)
               Crap. Crap. Crap, crap, crap... 
               Ahhh. Now here's what caught my eye.

     He's come to the COMBAT PHOTOS from Corto Maltese.

                              JOKER (cont.)
               The panic. The bloody skulls. The
               armless screaming fellows... you
               know, the atrocities.
                     (smirking)
               Somehow, when you shoot it, it all
               comes out so clean, so lovely.

     VICKI is squirming, but she doesn't think it wise to debate 
     the point. Not with this lunatic, anyway.

                              JOKER (cont.)
               I guess I'm just an old cornball,
               but... I live for beauty. I look
               around at my little city, it gets me
               down.
                     (indicating the photos)
               We don't have anything like this.
               Well, it came to me that what this
               city needs... is beautification. Kind
               of a big makeover.
                     (enraptured)
               Miss Vale, I finally realized that
               one man can make a difference. You
               know the saying. "In his image... 
               created he them"?

     VICKI gazes at the awful face of this deranged visionary, 
     getting more frightened by the minute.

                              VICKI
               And you want a --

                              JOKER
               A visual record, yes. A before-and-
               after kind of thing.
                     (leaning closer)
               This could make your reputation.

     Her first impulse is to get up and run. But she fights the 
     impulse. She won't run... not until she gets this maniac
     on film. She reaches for her camera bag.

                              VICKI
               Maybe we should start with a
               portrait of the artist. People might
               like to see the face behind the
               makeup.

                              JOKER
                     (momentarily puzzled)
               ... Behind the makeup?

     Then it sinks in. By candlelight, in the darkened 
     restaurant, with his pancake makeup and his black rinse 
     job, he looks practically normal. VICKI must think she's
     looking at his real face!

                              JOKER (cont.)
               Oh. Yes. I see what you mean.

     He finds a pitcher, pours a glass of water, and very 
     carefully SETS IT ON THE TABLE in front of VICKI. Then -- 
     suddenly, inexplicably -- HE BARKS AT HER:

                              JOKER (cont.)
               Silly little TWIT -- I can't take
               you ANYWHERE!

     He sits back and grins expectantly. VICKI is thoroughly 
     nonplussed by this bizarre outburst. A moment passes.

     He obviously wants her to do something, but she hasn't
     got a clue as to what it is. Growing impatient now, he 
     POINTS at the WATER GLASS:

                              JOKER (cont.)
               Well? What are you waiting for??

     Now VICKI gets the point. She picks up the glass and HURLS 
     ITS CONTENTS in THE JOKER'S FACE.

     His hands go up. He writhes. He shrieks -- like the Wicked 
     Witch of the West dissolving. He reaches for a napkin to 
     wipe his face clean... and begins to CACKLE.

     His awful white-and-green clown's face revealed behind the 
     running makeup, he LEERS at her.

                              JOKER (cont.)
               You see, Miss Vale -- that was my
               makeup.
                     (leaning forward)
               What do you think?

     VICKI is repulsed, but she's determined to tough it out.

                              VICKI
               I've seen worse. Much worse.

                              JOKER
               Strong stomach, huh? I like that in
               a woman. -- Maybe we can do business
               after all.

     He seems to have calmed down a bit. It's almost as if he's 
     coming on to her. But just then, a tiny BELL sounds behind 
     them... and a VOICE intrudes:

                              VOICE
               Jack?

     The JOKER turns. ALICIA steps out of a ROOFTOP ELEVATOR and 
     moves toward them, drugged, wraithlike. She's still wearing 
     the porcelain DOLL'S MASK we saw earlier.

                              JOKER
                     (to VICKI)
               Christ, it's my girlfriend.
                     (to ALICIA)
               WHAT?

                              ALICIA
               You said I could look at the
               pictures before you -- before you --

                              JOKER
               Shucks, honey, I forgot.
                     (rolling his eyes at
                      VICKI)
               I'm in trouble now.
                     (to ALICIA)
               This is business, sweetie. Why don't
               you go outside and see how the boys
               are coming?

     VICKI can't take her eyes off this strange figure drifting 
     eerily through the abandoned tea room.

                              VICKI
                     (hesitantly)
               ... Why the mask?

                              JOKER
               Alicia! Come here, have a seat. Show
               Miss Vale why you wear the mask.

     ALICIA sits down numbly and begins to undo the mask.

                              JOKER (cont.)
               You see, Miss Vale, Alicia's beautiful.
               One in a million. A work of art. In 
               fact... 

     We're looking at ALICIA's profile as the mask comes off. 
     The side that's turned to us is indeed beautiful. But the 
     side we can't see... SENDS VICKI RIGHT OVER THE EDGE.

                              JOKER (cont.)
               She makes you look sick.

     VICKI lurches out of her seat, knocking it over, HER FACE 
     FROZEN IN HORROR. She finds her CAMERA, holds it out like a 
     weapon as THE JOKER advances on her.

                              VICKI
               You SCUM! You SICK FILTH!... You DID
               THAT to her!

                              JOKER
               What? I improved her a little... 

     VICKI backs away, snapping the shutter on her camera. HE 
     BLINKS as the flash gun goes off repeatedly.

                              VICKI
               I'll see you burn. I'll see you dead.
               -- GET AWAY FROM ME!!

                              JOKER
               Miss Vale, was it something I said?
                     (brightly)
               Do you want to sniff my flower?

     There's a BRIGHT PURPLE BOUTONNIERE in his lapel. He holds 
     it up for VICKI's inspection as he moves menacingly closer.

                              VICKI
               NO!

     The JOKER squeezes a concealed BULB. A JET OF CLEAR LIQUID 
     spurts out of the FLOWER, NARROWLY MISSING VICKI.

     She GASPS. BUMPS INTO A TABLE. ACRID BLACK SMOKE rises from 
     the floor where the clear liquid hit. Acid.

                              JOKER
               Come on, Miss Vale... STOP AND SMELL
               THE ROSES!!

     He backs VICKI into a corner. And then -- abruptly --

     A SKYLIGHT SHATTERS IN A HAIL OF GLASS! A CAPED SHADOW 
     DROPS TO THE FLOOR OF THE RESTAURANT! And THE JOKER is face 
     to face with... 

     THE BATMAN!

     On his wrist is a STEEL GAUNTLET. Ha AIMS IT at the JOKER 
     like a weapon. Then PIVOTS SUDDENLY -- POINTS HIS ARM 
     THROUGH THE DOOR OF THE RESTAURANT --

     -- AND FIRES A METAL SPIKE into the adobe wall of the RAMP 
     OUTSIDE!!

                              JOKER (cont.)
               ... YOU!!

     On the end of the spike is a CORD leading to BATMAN's belt. 
     In the wink of an eye he's GRABBED VICKI -- DRAGGED HER OUT 
     OF the tea room -- and PLUNGED OVER THE RAMP WALL, FOUR 
     STORIES STRAIGHT DOWN TO THE ATRIUM FLOOR BELOW!!!

     The JOKER races to the edge of the ramp.

                              JOKER (cont.)
               GET 'EM!! GET 'EM!!

     His GOONS are stationed at various points along the ramp, 
     still defacing masterpieces. They pull their guns and OPEN 
     FIRE as BATMAN and VICKI plummet past.

     ANGLE ON BATMAN AND VICKI - AS THEY FALL

     He holds the gauntlet overhead, ROPE whistling through it. 
     As we watch, the gauntlet sprouts STEEL WINGS -- forming a 
     BULLETPROOF SHIELD over their heads!

     TWO FEET ABOVE the marble floor, THE ROPE jerks them up 
     short -- like a bunjee cord. GUNS BLAZE as BATMAN and VICKI 
     drop safely to earth and MAKE FOR THE EXIT.

     The doors are LOCKED. BATMAN spots the black "CLOSED" sign 
     on a metal stand. He HEAVES IT through the glass doors.

     VICKI hustles through. He points her to a side alley.

     EXT. SIDE ALLEY - THAT MOMENT - DUSK

     VICKI rounds the corner just as BATMAN lobs a SMOKE PELLET 
     into the doorway of the Fluegelheim.

                              BATMAN
               GET IN THE CAR!

                              VICKI
               WHICH CAR?

     VICKI suddenly feels quite stupid. Because -- while there 
     are many cars parked along the side alley -- there is only 
     one BATMOBILE.

                              VICKI (cont.)
               ... Oh.

     The BATMOBILE is sleek, futuristic, and... well, 
     indescribable. Imagine your own. VICKI climbs into the 
     passenger seat and is immediately dazzled by a stunning 
     array of electronic gadgetry.

                              BATMAN
               Ignition!

     As BATMAN sprints down the alley, a COMPUTER DISPLAY on the 
     dashboard registers his unique voiceprint. A tinny, 
     synthesized VOICE repeats the command:

                              COMPUTER
               Ignition.

     The engines are revving up even as BATMAN vaults into the 
     cockpit alongside VICKI.

     Guns in hand, the JOKER'S GOONS Are stumbling out of the 
     Fluegelheim, hacking, coughing, blinded by smoke. They DIVE 
     FOR THEIR LIVES as the BATMOBILE comes barrelling out of 
     the alley at ninety miles an hour.

     THE JOKER emerges just as the BATMOBILE careens off.

                              JOKER
               I WANT HIM!! I WANT HIM!!

     The JOKER climbs into the back of a van labelled "MONARCH 
     PLAYING CARDS."  Half his GOONS pile into the van behind 
     him, the other half into a second car nearby.

     EXT. STREETS - THAT MOMENT

     SIRENS HOWL as POLICE CARS converge on the Flugelheim.

     INT. BATMOBILE - THAT MOMENT

     roaring out into CITY TRAFFIC.

                              VICKI
               Look! Police!

                              BATMAN
               I called them.

                              VICKI
               Shouldn't we --

     A POLICE CAR whizzes past the BATMOBILE. TIRES SKID. The 
     COP CAR does a quick 180 and sets out in hot pursuit of the 
     BATMOBILE. BATMAN FLOORS THE ACCELERATOR in response.

     INT. VAN - THAT MOMENT

     TIGHT ON the demented face of THE JOKER. A GOON calls out 
     from the front of the van.

                              GOON
               There they are! Dead ahead!

     THE JOKER screams into a RADIO DISPATCHER'S MIKE.

                              JOKER
               ALL UNITS! SOUTHBOUND ON RIVERVIEW!

     SERIES OF SHOTS

     The JOKER'S ARMY. THUGS in cars. CREEPS in Italian 
     restaurants. CROOKED COPS at a coffee shop. LIGHTS FLASH, 
     BEEPERS SOUND, and within seconds they're racing to the 
     streets, eager to join the chase.

     SERIES OF SHOTS - THE STREETS

     COP CARS. GOON CARS. THE BATMOBILE streaks through an 
     intersection, nearly causing a pileup. THE JOKER'S VAN 
     makes short work of a SABRETT'S HOT DOG STAND in its path.

     INT. BATMOBILE - THAT MOMENT

     PEDESTRIANS GAWK as the sleek supercar RIPS UP THE 
     PAVEMENT.

                              VICKI
               What about her? What about the girl?

                              BATMAN
               He won't kill her.
                     (gritting his teeth)
               GODDAMMIT!

     They're moving up on an EMPTY BLOCK -- a NIGHT CONSTRUCTION 
     TEAM. A HUGE PIECE OF HEAVY MACHINERY backs up slowly and 
     inexorably, BLOCKING THE INTERSECTION.

     BATMAN GUNS THE ENGINE. SWERVES LEFT. TRIES TO SLIDE PAST. 
     And HITS THE BRAKES -- stopping inches short of a head-on 
     collision with a lamppost.

     He jumps out of the car. No chance to get through. THE 
     JOKER'S VAN is two blocks back and coming up fast.

     ONLOOKERS and CONSTRUCTION WORKERS are beginning to form a 
     crowd around them.

                              VICKI
               Can't we --

                              BATMAN
               Too many people. Come on!
                     (as she scrambles out)
               SHIELDS!!

     The BATMOBILE's computerized VOICE replies:

                              COMPUTER
               Shields.

     With a series or CLANGS, CHROME-STEEL PLATES slide into 
     place -- across the cockpit, over the tires -- leaving the 
     BATMOBILE an inert, impenetrable BLOCK OF BLACK METAL.

     BATMAN and VICKI sprint through the CONSTRUCTION SITE, 
     vaulting over mounds of loose dirt and concrete rubble.

     INT. VAN - MOVING - NIGHT

     THREE POLICE CARS, red lights blazing, OVERTAKE THE JOKER'S 
     VAN and bear down on the abandoned BATMOBILE.

                              GOON AT WHEEL
               Are they ours?

                              JOKER
               ... I don't know. We'd better get out
               of here.
                     (into RADIO MIKE)
               Westbound on 36th. DO YOU COPY??

     The VAN does a discreet U-turn and rumbles off sedately 
     down the street.

     EXT. SIDE STREET - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT

     BATMAN and VICKI zigzag past storefronts and candy stands, 
     dodging astonished PEDESTRIANS.

     INT. CAR - MOVING - THAT MOMENT

     FOUR GOONS with GUNS. They spot BATMAN and VICKI coming off 
     the side street. GOON I, the driver, speaks into a radio:

                              GOON I
               We got 'em!

                              JOKER (V.O.)
                     (over radio)
               Take 'em! I want his head!

     EXT. STREET - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT

     BATMAN and VICKI race down the sidewalk. The car is gaining 
     on them; and then, from behind --

     BATMAN and VICKI are caught in a SPRAY OF BULLETS. They 
     dive. Drop behind a parked car. And don't come up.

     They've ducked into a BLIND ALLEY.

     INT. ALLEYWAY - NIGHT

     Hunkered on the pavement, they watch the car glide past the 
     mouth of the alley. VICKI sighs in relief. BATMAN -- still 
     alert, his muscles tensed -- puts a restraining hand on her 
     arm. He looks overhead, sees a catwalk spanning the width 
     of the alleyway five stories up.

                              BATMAN
               How much do you weigh?

                              VICKI
               ... A hundred and eight?

     He does some quick mental calculations. A beat. Then the 
     CAR reappears -- backing up -- blocking their only avenue 
     of escape. BATMAN unfurls a rope, HEAVES A BATARANG UPWARD, 
     and grabs VICKI roughly about the waist.

                              BATMAN
               HANG ON!

     The JOKER'S THUGS pile out of the car. The BATARANG catches 
     on the catwalk, and BATMAN triggers the spring-action REEL 
     on his utility belt -- jerking him and VICKI INTO THE AIR.

     BULLETS zing past as they whip upward like fish on a line. 
     One story; two stories; and then... 

     They slow. They STOP. They DANGLE IN MIDAIR as the Joker's 
     goons advance. BATMAN wriggles, twists. They lurch upward 
     another few feet -- and stop again. VICKI SCREAMS.

     Her additional weight is too much for the reel mechanism. They're
     stranded two stories up -- SITTING DUCKS.

                              BATMAN (cont.)
               Whatever happens -- DON'T LET GO!!

     In the wink of an eye he's detached the reel from his own 
     waist and hitched it around VICKI's belt. Before she has a 
     chance to protest, he LETS GO.

     VICKI rockets upward at blinding speed, shrieking all the 
     way. BATMAN, his cape billowing, PLUMMETS DOWNWARD.

     VICKI slams up into the catwalk and BOBS on the end of the 
     line as BATMAN lands with a loud crash, overturning a row 
     of garbage cans. The GOONS are on him in a flash -- one per 
     limb. Random kicking and flailing. BATMAN manages to slam 
     two GOONS into a wall, but before he can get to his feet --

     -- GOON #3 slams a lead pipe into the back of his skull.

     BATMAN is down for the count. The THUGS dust themselves off 
     and circle around his prostrate form, still wary.

     The LEAD THUG holds his colleagues back, draws his gun, and 
     fires TWO SHOTS, point-blank, at the yellow-and-black 
     INSIGNE on BATMAN's chest. The body jerks.

     They move closer. And stop.

                              GOON I
               ... No blood.

                              GOON II
               Jesus.

                              GOON III
               Wait a minute.

     GOON III screws up his courage and crouches beside the 
     body. He examines THE BATMAN'S TUNIC... and RIPS IT OPEN.

                              GOON IV
               ... What is that?

                              GOON III
               Some kind of body armor.

                              GOON I
               He's human after all. -- Take that
               mask off.

     EXT. ROOFTOP - ON VICKI

     Five stories overhead, VICKI has pulled herself up onto the 
     roof of the adjacent building. She watches transfixed as 
     the THUGS bend over to remove BATMAN's cowl. But at this 
     height -- and this angle -- she can't see his face. On a 
     sudden impulse she reaches for her CAMERA BAG.

     ANGLE ON GOONS

     peering-down open-mouthed at the unconscious face of BRUCE 
     WAYNE. Blood seeps from BRUCE's left nostril.

                              GOON I
               Well?... Who is this guy?

                              GOON II
               I dunno. You seen him before?

                              GOON III
               Maybe he's got some kind of I.D.

                              GOON IV
               Good idea. Let's check his wallet.

                              GOON I
               We'll worry about it later. Plug
               him.
                        (beat)
               In the head.

     GOON II draws his automatic. And at that very instant... A 
     FLASH GUN EXPLODES OVERHEAD.

     Startled, the THUGS look up. ANOTHER CAMERA FLASH.

                              GOON III
               Goddam, it's the redhead!

     ON VICKI

     A chunk of ledge chips off mere inches from her head as the 
     GOONS OPEN FIRE. She ducks back behind the overhang, holds 
     the camera out over the ledge, and KEEPS ON FLASHING.

     ON BRUCE

     HIS EYES WINK OPEN.

     ON VICKI

     momentarily idle. She's used up her roll. The GOONS KEEP 
     SHOOTING as she reaches in her bag for new film. She finds 
     it, loads the camera with astonishing dexterity -- and 
     then, on instinct, reaches back inside the bag for a 
     TELEPHOTO LENS. All the better to see you with, Batman... 

     ON THE THUGS

     No response from VICKI. They begin to relax a little.

                              GOON II
               Did you hit her?

                              GOON I
               Who cares? Wax that freak.

     They turn their attention to BRUCE. A GLOVED HAND snakes 
     out with lightning speed -- GRABBING GOON I BY THE COATTAIL 
     and pulling him DIRECTLY INTO THE LINE OF FIRE. GOON II bas 
     pulled the trigger twice before he knows what's happened.

     In one fluid motion BRUCE HEAVES GOON I's lifeless body 
     THROUGH THE AIR, knocking GOON II backward over a garbage 
     can. GOON II falls and CRACKS HIS HEAD on the nearest wall.

     GOON III takes a rabbit punch to the throat. He's on the 
     way down when he catches a STEEL-TOED BOOT in the gut.

     Four seconds after all this began, BRUCE is alone in the 
     alleyway with GOON IV. GOON IV has his gun pointed right at 
     BRUCE, but he's shaking too much to pull the trigger.

     BRUCE smiles. GOON IV SCREAMS and RUNS FOR HIS LIFE.

     Through all this, VICKI's telephoto camera has been poised 
     on the ledge, snapping away. BRUCE looks up at the FLASH 
     GUN and shakes his head. He bends to retrieve his cowl.

     ON VICKI

     She finally dares to peek down at the alley. Limp goons 
     everywhere. And, in addition, THE BATMAN -- leaping up, 
     grabbing the edge of a fire escape, climbing up to meet 
     her.

     VICKI thinks fast. She may have a clean shot of BATMAN'S 
     FACE. She advances the film in the camera and removes the 
     roll, then drops it down her blouse.

     But BATMAN is likely to want that roll. So she straightens 
     her skirt and scurries across the roof, away from the 
     alley. She should have a minute or so before be gets there.

     It's a three-foot drop to the next roof over. VICKI 
     clambers down and quickens her pace, tossing a nervous 
     glance over her shoulder every couple of steps.

     Then, somehow -- and she'll be damned if she can figure out 
     how -- she walks smack into THE BATMAN. And GASPS.

                              BATMAN
               ... Not even a 'thank you'?

                              VICKI
               Well -- I think you might consider
               thanking me. You were good as
               dead.

                              BATMAN
               That's because you lied about your
               weight.
                     (a long pause)
               Thank you.

     VICKI NODS and tries to walk past him. He grabs her arm.

                              BATMAN (cont.)
               I'll have to ask you for that film.

                              VICKI
               I just wanted to distract them. I
               wasn't trying to get a picture of
               you.

     BATMAN looks down at the camera hanging from her neck. The 
     telephoto lens must jut out six inches. VICKI gulps.

                              BATMAN
               Please.

                              VICKI
               I won't let you have it.

     THE BATMAN is amused. He smiles menacingly.

                              VICKI (cont.)
               I know you can break my neck and
               take it. But the Joker's on that
               same roll. I --

                              BATMAN
               The Joker is a murderer. And you
               were as good as dead. So --

                              VICKI
               Look, I appreciate what you did for
               me. But this is my job. And I'm
               keeping those pictures.

                              BATMAN
               All right, here's a compromise. I'll
               develop the photos. You keep the
               Jokers and I'll keep the rest.

                              VICKI
               How do I know you won't keep them
               all?

                              BATMAN
               Because I'll take you with me.

     He reaches out, holds her gently by the shoulders. His 
     voice is deep and soothing. True, VICKI is a little dizzy 
     from all that's happened, but she's undeniably drawn to 
     him.

     Still cautious, though. She reaches into her bag and hands 
     over a roll of film. The original roll -- not the telephoto
     shots, which are still stashed in her blouse.

                              BATMAN (cont.)
               Thank you, Vicki.

                              VICKI
               ... Where are you going to take me?

     No reply. She looks up into his mirrored eyes. He pulls her 
     closer to him. Brushes back her hair, runs one hand 
     delicately along the line of her cheek... 

     ... AND BREAKS A TINY CAPSULE under her nose. VICKI SLUMPS 
     into BATMAN's arms.

                                                 CUT TO:

     EXT. ALLEYWAY - NIGHT

     Street level. BATMAN emerges carrying VICKI's inert form in 
     his arms. He pauses and peers around the edge of a wall at 
     the BATMOBILE two blocks down.

     The car is still there, the chrome-steel shields intact. 
     But DOZENS OF COPS and CURIOSITY-SEEKERS are SWARMING ALL 
     OVER the fearsome machine.

     BATMAN snorts in frustration. AN ENORMOUS THREE-TON 
     CATERPILLAR WINCH rumbles up the street toward the 
     Batmobile.

     He's about to get towed. BATMAN takes a RADIO TRANSMITTER
     from his utility belt and SPEAKS INTO IT.

                              BATMAN
               Shields open.

     EXT. STREET - ON BATMOBILE

     TWO COPS are crawling along the hood of the car. From 
     within they hear the tinny computerized voice:

                              COMPUTER
               Shields open.

     The steel plates begin to retract.

                              BATMAN (V.O.)
                     (over radio)
               Ignition.

                              COMPUTER
               Ignition.

     The stunned COPS gaze into the Batmobile's cockpit.

                              COP
               There's somebody in there!

     They TUMBLE OFF THE HOOD as the turbine engines ROAR TO 
     LIFE and THE BATMOBILE BEGINS TO MOVE.

     COPS AND ONLOOKERS quickly clear a path. They stand there 
     stunned as the futuristic auto PICKS UP SPEED and advances 
     toward the end of the block. The LEFT TURN SIGNAL flashes 
     dutifully. And the BATMOBILE VANISHES AROUND THE CORNER.

     PANDEMONIUM BREAKS LOOSE as the COPS bolt for their cars.

     EXT. STREET - NIGHT

     SIRENS WAIL. PASSERSBY STARE SLACKJAWED at the driverless 
     BATMOBILE as it tears down the street, passing, darting, 
     dodging buses and CUTTING OFF TAXIS -- all with a squad of 
     COP CARS in hot pursuit.

     EXT. ALLEYWAY - NIGHT

     BATMAN sees the BATMOBILE rounding the corner and 
     approaching on the straightaway. He takes VICKI in his arms 
     and STEPS DIRECTLY INTO THE PATH OF THE ONRUSHING 
     HEADLIGHTS.

                              BATMAN
               STOP!

     BRAKES SQUEAL. The BATMOBILE stops one yard short of BATMAN 
     and VICKI. A moment later BATMAN is AT THE WHEEL.

     SIRENS BUILD. LIGHTS FLASH. The COP CARS are now visible 
     behind them. BATMAN floors the pedal; the Batmobile's 
     powerful AFTERBURNERS kick in; and the hapless cops KILL 
     THEIR SIRENS as BATMAN zooms off into the night at 140 mph.

                                                 DISSOLVE TO:

     EXT. BACK ROAD - NIGHT

     A deserted stretch of road, lined by ancient tall pines on 
     either side. The BATMOBILE roars past.

     INT. BATMOBILE - NIGHT

     VICKI is gradually coming to on the passenger's side.

                              VICKI
               ... How long have I been out?

                              BATMAN
               Quite a while. I took the scenic
               route.

                              VICKI
                     (gazing around her)
               Well, I've certainly enjoyed it.
               What's that?

     He's just hit a BUTTON on the dashboard.

                              BATMAN
               Garage door.

     EXT. ROAD - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT

     At the side of the road, a FALLEN TREE, surrounded by 
     underbrush, RISES HYDRAULICALLY INTO THE AIR -- revealing a 
     SECRET ROAD invisible from the main thoroughfare.

     Doing sixty, the BATMOBILE makes a hairpin turn. Seconds 
     later, the FALLEN TREE drops back magically into place.

     INT. BATMOBILE - A MOMENT LATER - NIGHT

     As they cruise down the hidden road, VICKI STUDIES BATMAN'S 
     FACE. KNOX's words are very much on her mind.

                              VICKI
               I meant to ask you. Up on the roof
               -- how did you know my name?

     BATMAN SMILES in response. VICKI smiles with him.

                              VICKI (cont.)
               I'm serious. How did you know?

     No reply. VICKI frowns, looks through the windshield, and 
     SEES -- much to her horror -- an enormous SHEER CLIFF WALL 
     LOOMING DEAD AHEAD.

     Wide-eyed, she looks at BATMAN. Still smiling, he HITS THE 
     GAS -- SPEEDING UP. She lets out a SCREAM.

     ANGLE ON CLIFF WALL

     One second to impact. Suddenly the cliff wall VANISHES 
     ALTOGETHER -- revealing, in its place, the GAPING MOUTH OF 
     AN UNDERGROUND CAVERN.

     The Batmobile zooms through. A moment later, the CLIFF WALL 
     -- which is nothing more than a HOLOGRAPHIC PROJECTION -- 
     winks back into existence, showing no trace of the cavern.

     INT. BATCAVE - NIGHT

     We all know this place. Although we haven't had time to 
     acquire the familiar mementos -- the dinosaur, the giant 
     penny -- the BATCAVE is unmistakable. Vast banks of 
     blinking computers. A state-of-the-art crime lab. A fully-
     equipped workshop for hammering out new toys. It's the 
     biggest and best secret clubhouse a boy could wish for.

     BATMAN climbs out of the car. He removes his cape, strips 
     off his bullet-riddled jersey and his body armor. There are 
     TWO BIG BRUISES on the center of his chest.

     VICKI looks on as he goes to a rack along one wall and 
     picks out a fresh tunic -- one of four. She wanders over to 
     examine the row of bat-suits -- and the BODY ARMOR.

                              VICKI
               What is this stuff? Kevlar?

                              BATMAN
               Better. It's not on the market yet.

                              VICKI
               It doesn't protect your head,
               though.

                              BATMAN
               That's why I wear a target on my
               chest.

     THE BATMAN takes obvious pleasure in showing her his 
     futuristic bachelor's pad. His tone is jokey, almost 
     flirtatious. Behind the mask, he's a lot looser, more 
     carefree, than some guys we could name... 

     ... like Bruce Wayne.

     VICKI is, to put it mildly, awed. She wanders around gaping 
     at millions of dollars' worth of equipment.

                              VICKI
               How'd you find this place?

                              BATMAN
               Stumbled across it when I was a boy.

     VICKI'S HEAD jerks up abruptly. In the dim recesses 
     overhead, BATS ARE SCREAMING. She shivers.

                              BATMAN (cont.)
               They don't come down here. They're
               afraid of the lights.

                              VICKI
               I don't like bats. Not that kind.

                              BATMAN
               They used to terrify me. But I
               forced myself to keep coming back,
               and --
                     (smiling)
               -- I guess I became the thing I
               feared the most. I'll do your photos
               now.

     He goes to a HIGH-SPEED PHOTO PROCESSING MACHINE -- the 
     kind they have at Fotomat, only better -- and loads the 
     roll.

     VICKI wanders over to the edge of a DEEP BLACK PIT. She 
     kicks a pebble over. Long seconds pass; no sound.

     She looks up. Suspended over the bottomless pit are a pair 
     of GYMNAST'S RINGS. This guy is dedicated.

                              VICKI
               Who pays for all this?

                              BATMAN
               I have sponsors.

                              VICKI
               The computers?

                              BATMAN
               I'm running a check on the tainted
               products. There is a pattern.
               Beauty products. Personal hygiene.

                              VICKI
               No more makeup. -- Looks like we'll
               all be showing our true faces now.

     She looks straight at him. It's almost a direct request. 
     But BATMAN is preoccupied with the matter at hand.

                              BATMAN
               I've tracked all the records. Every
               shipment, every warehouse, every
               loading dock. Nothing. No
               opportunities for tampering. Somehow
               the Joker is supplying tainted
               ingredients... at the source.

                              VICKI
               Wait. You can just tap into any
               corporate database you want?
               Anywhere?

                              BATMAN
               Oh, no. I let the FBI do that. Then
               I tap into the FBI. -- Your photos
               are ready.

     He holds up a hand to VICKI: stand back. Then he checks out 
     the pictures -- SMILING as he shuffles through the prints.

                              VICKI
               You could've killed him, you know.
               You could have killed the Joker.

                              BATMAN
               I had to save you, Vicki.
                     (turning to face her)
               Here you go. I think I'll let you
               keep the whole set.

     She looks at the photos. Joker. Joker. Joker. And four 
     shots of the BATMAN in action. He's without his mask, but 
     there's no clean angle on his face.

     VICKI doesn't quite know why, but her head is reeling.

                              BATMAN (cont.)
               Care for an autograph?

     He takes one of the prints, scrawls on it, hands it to her 
     with the inscription: "TO VICKI. LOVE, B."

     Now he turns to shut down the photo machine. VICKI is 
     trembling. Her hand goes to her belt, finds the telephoto 
     roll concealed in her blouse. She steps up silently behind 
     him, reaches for his cowl. At the last second... she STOPS.

                              VICKI
               ... Bruce?

     HE FREEZES IN PLACE for an indecisive moment. Then:

                              BATMAN
               Are you talking to me?

     He turns in seeming incomprehension. And shows her a 
     SMILE... the same crooked, curious, childlike smile she saw 
     on BRUCE's face that morning when she caught him singing.

                              BATMAN (cont.)
               Maybe we've had enough for one
               night. I'll take you home.

     Almost in a trance now, she lets him lead her to the 
     BATMOBILE. As she takes her seat he reaches into his 
     utility belt for another KNOCKOUT CAPSULE.

                              BATMAN (cont.)
               Do you want to do it this time?

     VICKI doesn't move. She looks at the capsule in her hand as 
     he walks over to the driver's side and gets in.

                              BATMAN (cont.)
               Don't be afraid. I'm here.

     She takes one last look at the familiar SMILE beneath the 
     mask... then breaks the capsule and BREATHES DEEP.

     FLAME ERUPTS from the rear of the Batmobile as the after-
     burners kick in and BATMAN screeches off. A FIERY RED GLOW 
     fills the screen, BURNING OUT THE IMAGE as we

                                                 DISSOLVE TO:

     EXT. GOTHAM STREET - 1963 - NIGHT (DREAM SEQUENCE)

     The red glow resolves itself into a DREAMLIKE STREET SCENE: 
     liquid, weightless figures moving in a tinted, soundless 
     cityscape as DISTANT, TINKLY CARNIVAL MUSIC plays 
     underneath. We're outside a theatre watching first-nighters 
     emerge from the opening of a hit musical.

     In the crowd we pick out THREE FIGURES: DR. THOMAS WAYNE, 
     his wife MARTHA, and -- in THOMAS's arms -- their young son 
     BRUCE. BRUCE hasn't made it through the show. He's asleep, 
     head nestled peacefully against his father's shoulder.

     THOMAS rouses the boy gently, sets him down on the 
     sidewalk. BRUCE rubs the sleep from his eyes as THOMAS puts 
     an arm around his wife. Together they begin walking.

     IN A SINGLE CUT the crowd has DISAPPEARED, and the WAYNES 
     are walking toward us up a deserted street. THOMAS and 
     MARTHA are laughing, making jokes, reaching down to tousle 
     BRUCE's hair. Their FACES, as they draw closer, are FULL OF 
     JOY. And then, without warning --

     A HANDGUN enters frame.

     The WAYNES freeze in their tracks. THOMAS steps 
     protectively in front of his wife, reaches for his wallet, 
     begins unbuckling his watch. He won't put up a fight.

     MARTHA's hand goes involuntarily to the PEARL NECKLACE at 
     her throat.

     The GUNMAN sees it, gestures for her to hand it over. But 
     MARTHA is paralyzed, afraid to move.

     The GUNMAN steps past THOMAS, SNATCHES AT THE NECKLACE.

     The instant his wife is threatened, THOMAS ATTACKS. The 
     pearl strand BREAKS in the GUNMAN'S HAND as he drops toward 
     the sidewalk.

     A SILENT BURST OF FLAME erupts from the muzzle of the gun.

     THOMAS CRUMPLES. MARTHA emits a PIERCING SHRIEK -- a shriek 
     we cannot hear --

     -- a shriek cut short by a second burst of flame.

     BRUCE stands paralyzed in shock. THE GUNMAN scoops a 
     handful of pearls off the sidewalk, reaches for MARTHA's 
     purse, and rises slowly -- his gun levelled directly at the 
     boy.

     Almost catatonic, BRUCE stares down at the corpses of his 
     parents. At their hands, somehow intertwined. At the tiny 
     glinting pearls and the spreading pool of blood around 
     them.

     He looks up with a gaze so bleak, so petrifying... that the 
     GUNMAN turns and runs.

     AND WE CUT. To an exact reproduction of the Pulitzer Prize-
     winning photo... the cops bent over the bodies, the medics 
     with their stretchers, the boy BRUCE, his arms wrapped 
     tightly around the waist of OFFICER GORDON.

     There's only one difference. BRUCE's head is turned away 
     from us. We can't see his face.

     And now a HAND enters the frame. Much like the GUNMAN's 
     hand, but feminine, beckoning. BRUCE, hearing his name, 
     LOOKS UP; then, agonized, ashamed, he BURIES HIS FACE in 
     GORDON's side. GORDON gestures angrily at the intruder.

     But the hand keeps beckoning. And ultimately BRUCE turns. 
     Showing us the tear-stained face from the famous photo. A
     face slack with horror. The horror of his parents' death... 
     and more importantly, the horror that someone would dare to
     violate this most private and terrible of moments.

     At last we see what BRUCE sees: a WOMAN crouched on the 
     sidewalk nearby. The WOMAN is holding a camera. The WOMAN 
     is smiling prettily at BRUCE.

     The WOMAN is VICKI VALE.

     A FLASHBULB EXPLODES. FILLING. THE SCREEN with its blinding 
     white light, SCORCHING OUT THE IMAGE as a HARSH RINGING 
     SOUND cuts through the silence.

                                                 CUT TO:

     INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

     VICKI AWAKENS. She sits up in bed, tremulous, distraught. 
     The bedside phone is ringing. She reaches for it, but her 
     hand freezes in midair. She knows who's calling.

     Three rings later, she manages to lift the receiver. To her 
     amazement, she finds she cannot speak. Finally, she hears a 
     VOICE at the other end of the line.

                              BRUCE (V.O.)
               Vicki... ?

     INT. BRUCE WAYNE'S STUDY - NIGHT

     BRUCE at a big mahogany desk in his somber, book-lined 
     study. The room is dark but for a small table lamp.

                              BRUCE
               Vicki, I've been thinking about you.
                     (long pause)
               I know it's late. I'm sorry. I --
               Are you there?

     INTERCUT BRUCE AND VICKI

                              VICKI
               Yes, Bruce -- I'm here --

                              BRUCE
               I'm sorry about the way things went
               between us. I'd very much like to
               see you again.

                              VICKI
               Well, Bruce... I don't think... that
               would be possible.

                              BRUCE
               I wish you'd reconsider.
                     (groping)
               I didn't stand you up today. The
               museum was closed when I got there.

                              VICKI
               I, uh... 

     ON VICKI

     Her voice trails off. She's profoundly shaken. She knows.

                              BRUCE (V.O.)
               Vicki? Vi --

     She returns the receiver to its cradle.

     ON BRUCE

     He hears the click. His lips part slightly. He hangs up and 
     sits there at the desk, staring straight ahead.

     INT. VICKI'S BATHROOM - NIGHT

     TOTAL DARKNESS. VICKI stands before the bathroom mirror. 
     She holds the OPENED ROLL OF TELEPHOTO SHOTS over the sink.

     Then she strikes a match. IGNITES the film. Drops it into 
     the sink, and -- with hollow eyes -- WATCHES IT BURN.

     INT. VICKI'S APARTMENT - LATER - NIGHT

     It's four in the morning. VICKI, wrapped in a bathrobe, 
     still shaky, pours her fifth cup of coffee. Sitting across 
     from her is a rumpled and stubbly ALEXANDER KNOX.

                              KNOX
               Vicki, it all fits. The stuff you're
               telling me -- the car, the equipment
               -- somebody's paying for it.

                              VICKI
               I just can't --

                              KNOX
               The FBI. You know who's got the FBI
               computer contract? Wayne
               Technologies.
                     (shaking his head)
               The guy's bats all right. He's bat
               shit crazy. This is gonna be the
               most incredible --

                              VICKI
               But he's not.

                              KNOX
               Not what?

                              VICKI
               He's not crazy.

     KNOX slaps his forehead in frustration, sprawls back in his 
     chair.

                              KNOX
               Vicki. We got a wealthy millionaire
               here... who dresses up like a bat. He
               goes out at night and swings around
               -- in his cape -- on a rope.
                     (throwing up his hands)
               Okay. Maybe I'm crazy.

                              VICKI
               Allie... he wants to tell me.
               That's why he took me there. Because
               he's trying to tell me.

                              KNOX
               Gimme a break. If he wants to chat,
               he can talk to his car.

     The joke dies. VICKI stares dead ahead. KNOX looks on in 
     utter disbelief as it all comes into focus: he's lost her 
     loyalty. VICKI is in over her head with BRUCE.

                              VICKI
               He has to tell someone. And I'm the
               one. He's trying to tell me.

     KNOX, hurt in a way he doesn't fully understand, gets up 
     and pulls on his coat. He stares at her coldly:

                              KNOX
               Well, when he does you know my
               number.

     EXT. NEWSSTAND - DAY

     CUSTOMERS are lining up to buy the early edition of the
     Globe, which carries the full-page banner headline:

                       WAR OF THE FREAKS
             Batman, Joker in Fluegelheim Shootout

     In the midst of the hubbub a DELIVERY TRUCK cruises past, 
     dumping a bundle of AFTERNOON EDITIONS on the sidewalk. 
     "WAR OF THE FREAKS" has been relegated to the lower right-
     hand corner of the page -- supplanted by more pressing 
     news:

     INT. WAYNE FOUNDATION - DAY

     BRUCE in a plush office suite downtown, on the phone to his 
     broker. Behind his desk is a big plate-glass window with a 
     fortieth-floor view of the financial district, so he can 
     wave at his fellow millionaires on their way down.

                              BRUCE
               Don't sell. It won't last. We'll
               ride it out.

     With exaggerated calm, he hangs up. He lifts the receiver 
     to dial another number, then hesitates and hangs up again.

     INT. RECEPTION AREA - A MOMENT LATER - DAY

     BRUCE, affecting an air of nonchalance, strolls past a 
     squad of SECRETARIES at desks. Phones are ringing off the 
     hook.

     INT. HALLWAY - A MOMENT LATER - DAY

     BRUCE ambles past a couple of COLLEAGUES. One of them is 
     shambling catatonically down the hall, bumping into walls. 
     The other is WAILING HYSTERICALLY.

                              WAILING COLLEAGUE
               ... a nine-million-dollar bath!

     BRUCE nods in sympathy as they pass. He stops outside the 
     door to a men's room, looks around cautiously, then enters.

     INT. MEN'S ROOM - A MOMENT LATER - DAY

     A small anteroom outside the bathroom proper, with a bank 
     of PAY PHONES on one wall. BRUCE checks the bathroom to 
     make sure it's empty, then digs out a quarter and dials a 
     number. He cups one hand confidentially over the receiver:

                              BRUCE
                     (the familiar rasp)
               Vicki?... This is Batman. I thought

               discuss it.

     BRUCE automatically claps a hand over the mouthpiece. His 
     face goes slack as he hangs up -- with VICKI'S TINNY VOICE 
     still squeaking on the other end of the line.

                     (through loudspeaker)
               Yes?

                              KNOX
               Alexander Knox. Gotham Globe.

                              ALFRED (V.O.)
               Mr. Wayne is out for the day.

                              KNOX
               Actually, I wanted to talk to
               Batman. Pass that on to Mr. Wayne,
               would you?

     KNOX starts cockily off down the driveway -- then STOPS. 
     Behind him, the iron gates are SLIDING OPEN.

     INT. BRUCE'S LIBRARY - TEN MINUTES LATER - DAY

     KNOX, agitated, drums his fingers on the edge of a big 
     leather chair. BRUCE stands across from him.

                              BRUCE
               I've been expecting to hear from
               you.

                              KNOX
               Well, that's how it is, chum. She
               tells me everything.

                              BRUCE
               What is it you want?

                              KNOX
               Simple. You know the score. One
               column -- and I can bring all this
               tumbling down. I can take you off
               the streets once and for all.
                        (a shaky pause)
               I want you to hang up the suit. And
               I want you to stay away from Vicki.

                              BRUCE
               I can't do that. Not while the
               Joker's still out there.

                              KNOX
               Then stay away from Vicki. That's
               all I want, man. I just want your
               word.

     BRUCE turns away, evading his gaze. KNOX fumbles in his 
     jacket for a cigarette.

                              KNOX (cont.)
               See, I don't know how it happened --
               she's a smart girl and you are an
               extraordinarily screwed-up guy -- but
               she's in love with you.

                              BRUCE
               There's something I don't
               understand. If you've got the story,
               why haven't you printed it?

                              KNOX
               Because I --
                     (beat)
               Because she'd never speak to me
               again.

     KNOX is a bundle of nerves now. No longer cocky, he stubs 
     out his newly-lit cigarette -- and begins to PLEAD OPENLY.

                              KNOX (cont.)
               Come on, Bruce. Be straight. What
               have you got to offer? You gonna
               marry her? Batman and Mrs. Batman?
                     (laughing bitterly)
               Gimme a break, huh? Who's gonna be
               Best Rodent?

     BRUCE sinks into a chair, exhales sharply. He can't even 
     put up an argument. The two of them sit there, not looking 
     at each other, as ALFRED appears in the doorway.

                              BRUCE
               Do you want a drink?

                              KNOX
               Yeah, a drink. "Civilized."  Man-to-
               man, right?

                              BRUCE
               Alfred, bring something for Mr.
               Knox. -- I'll have one too.

                                                   CUT TO:

     EXT. GOTHAM PARK - LATE AFTERNOON

     The weekend-long BIRTHDAY GALA is getting underway, and 
     Gotham Park is mobbed with CELEBRANTS enjoying a FREE 
     CONCERT. Onstage: FIVE ELVIS IMITATORS, dressed in 
     everything from black leather to white spangled jumpsuits, 
     representing the King in progressive stages of 
     deterioration.

     INT. VICKI'S APARTMENT - DUSK

     She's on the sofa beside a disconsolate BRUCE.

                              VICKI
               ... So we just pretend none of this
               ever happened. We never met. We --
                     (frightened)
               You're going to get yourself killed,
               Bruce. You know that, don't you?

                              BRUCE
               It wouldn't matter much.

                              VICKI
               I don't understand it. You can do so
               much good for people. As Bruce
               Wayne.

     He sinks back on the sofa, closes his eyes. He's had the 
     same argument with himself a thousand times.

                              BRUCE
               Money makes money, Vicki. The
               foundation runs itself. -- I'm
               extraneous to the process.

                              VICKI
               You're one man. You can't save
               everybody.

                              BRUCE
               What it I could save a handful?
               -- What if I could save one?

     VICKI is sick of watching BRUCE torment himself. She stands 
     up, almost crying now, and ACCUSES HIM DIRECTLY:

                              VICKI
               Bruce, at the rate you're going, you
               can't even save yourself.

                              BRUCE
                     (staring right at her)
               Sometimes... I don't know if there's
               enough of me left to save.

     VICKI is totally drained. She heads for the kitchen.

                              VICKI
               Oh, God. I've got to have some
               coffee or something.

     A moment's breather as BRUCE sits on the sofa reflecting. 
     Then, suddenly, a KNOCK at the door.

     VICKI reappears and moves to answer the door. BRUCE -- on 
     his feet instantly -- grabs her by the shoulder.

                              BRUCE
               Are you expecting anyone?

     She nods no. He goes to the peephole in the door.

                              BRUCE (cont.)
               Who's there?

     THROUGH THE PEEPHOLE he sees a DELIVERY BOY.

                              DELIVERY BOY
               Package tor Miss Vale.

                              BRUCE
               Set it down by the door. On the
               left-hand side.

     The DELIVERY BOY sets the package down and wanders off, 
     tipless, muttering something about "cheap shits." After a 
     moment's interval, BRUCE opens the door and bends to pick 
     up the mysterious package.

     Another brown-paper parcel... ADDRESSED IN CRAYON.

                              VICKI
               BRUCE!

     He strides past her, handling the parcel gingerly, and sets 
     it down on the kitchen counter.

                              VICKI (cont.)
               It's just like the last time. He
               sent me a present before he --

                              BRUCE
               Very thoughtful. Don't touch it.

     As VICKI watches, he goes into the living-room and finds 
     his ALLIGATOR ATTACHE CASE. He opens the case, removes a 
     LAPTOP COMPUTER and a handful of business papers... then 
     lifts out a false bottom to reveal his UTILITY BELT.

                              VICKI
               Oh, Bruce. Don't tell me you carry
               it around with you.

                              BRUCE
               I feel naked without it.

     He takes out a tiny ULTRASOUND SCANNER -- rather like a 
     stethoscope, with a miniature sonar display where the 
     earpieces should be -- and runs it over the package.

                              BRUCE (cont.)
               Not a bomb. But it could be rigged.
               Wait in the next room.

     He takes a small GAS MASK from his belt, puts it on, then 
     SLITS THE WRAPPING with a steak knife.

     Nothing. Cautiously, he pulls back the flaps. The box is 
     full of STYROFOAM POPCORN. BRUCE shoves a hand down into 
     the popcorn... and extracts a HUMAN EAR.

     In the doorway behind him, VICKI lets out a squeal.

     BRUCE grabs the box and dumps TWO DOZEN EARS on the 
     counter.

                              BRUCE
               ... They're wax.

     VICKI finds a hand-scrawled NOTE among the ears.

                              VICKI
               "It worked for Van Gogh. Let's make
               up. I'll need you soon." -- Whew.

                              BRUCE
                     (lost in thought)
               That does it. It's going to be this
               weekend.

     The KITCHEN PHONE rings. VICKI reaches for the receiver. 
     Her eyes go wide and she gestures him over.

     INT. ALICIA HUNT'S APARTMENT - THAT MOMENT

     ALICIA, in her porcelain mask, on the phone.

                              ALICIA
               I thought you ought to know -- he's
               coming for you... 

     ON BRUCE AND VICKI

     Faces pressed together as they listen in. BRUCE covers the 
     mouthpiece with one hand.

                              BRUCE
               Keep her on the line!

                              VICKI
               ... Where are you calling from?

     As VICKI struggles to keep the conversation alive, BRUCE 
     rushes into the living room and crouches beside his LAPTOP 
     COMPUTER. He plugs it in, flips open the screen, punches up 
     a telecommunications program.

     A moment later VICKI enters from the kitchen.

                              VICKI
               I'm sorry, she hung up. What are --

                              BRUCE
               Finding out where she is.

                              VICKI
               How can you do that if she's already
               off the line?

                              BRUCE
               I've had an automatic tracer on this
               number ever since he tracked you to
               the museum.

     INT. BATCAVE - THAT MOMENT

     MASSIVE COMPUTERS click and whir. At BRUCE's prodding, 
     INFORMATION comes up on the monitor: a number, a name -- 
     ALICIA HUNT -- and an East Side address.

     INT. VICKI'S APARTMENT - THAT MOMENT - EVENING

     THE SAME INFORMATION scrolls across BRUCE's screen.

                              BRUCE
               Got it!

                              VICKI
               What now!

                              BRUCE
               Hang on. I have to leave a message.

     HE FREEZES. He's heard something in the hallway outside.

     INT. HALLWAY - THAT MOMENT

     ELEVATOR DOORS open on THREE THUGS. One of them uses a key 
     to lock the car in place on VICKI's floor. The key is on 
     the end of a ring which contains dozens of other keys.

     The KEY RING belongs to a DOORMAN, who's riding in the 
     elevator with the JOKER's trio of thugs. He's dead, alas. 
     The THUGS dump him unceremoniously on the floor of the hall 
     and march toward VICKI's apartment.

     INT. VICKI'S APARTMENT - A MOMENT LATER

     BRUCE is nowhere in sight. VICKI is at the sink washing 
     dishes, acting nonchalant. She pretends not to hear the 
     DOOR unlocking behind her.

     She turns -- and faces the THREE ADVANCING THUGS.

                              THUG I
               Hi, Miss Vale. Let's not put up a
               fight, huh? 'Cause we'd hate to have
               to --

     BRUCE steps into the doorway behind them. With a single 
     sweep of the arm, he flings THREE DRUG-TIPPED NINJA WHEELS 
     at the thugs, catching one in the neck, one in the 
     shoulder, one in the hip. They COLLAPSE in quick 
     succession.

                              BRUCE
               There's a garage in this building?

     VICKI nods yes. BRUCE -- all business now that he's in his 
     element -- disappears into VICKI's bedroom.

     She peeks around the corner. He reemerges carrying a BLACK 
     NYLON STOCKING, which he stuffs into his pocket. VICKI is 
     full of question, but he shushes her before she can speak.

                              BRUCE (cont.)
               I've got to take him out now.

     He stoops down beside the THUGS and pulls the elevator key 
     off the key ring -- which he then tosses to VICKI.

                              BRUCE (cont.)
               Pick an apartment and stay there.
               And listen: call the police. Give
               them that address. Every available
               man.

     He starts out the door, stops just long enough to take a 
     dumbfounded VICKI in his arms for a kiss.

     INT. UNDERGROUND GARAGE - A MOMENT LATER - EVENING

     THE JOKER'S VAN, bearing the Monarch Playing Card logo. TWO 
     ARMED GOONS lean against the hood. They watch as the 
     elevator opens and an ordinary fellow in a suit steps out.

     BRUCE pulls car keys from his pocket and strolls past the 
     thugs, head down, whistling. As he walks around the van, 
     his hand brushes against it -- leaving a MAGNETIZED HOMING 
     DEVICE, almost too tiny to notice, stuck to the fender.

     He walks another six paces, then stops short. He feels 
     around in all his pockets, making a big show of having
     forgotten something.

                              BRUCE
               Oh, hell!

     The GOONS eye him curiously as he strides back toward the 
     elevator. The doors are closing before it strikes them that 
     something is amiss.

                              GOON
               Hey, boss, something's up. The
               elevator's working.

     INT. VAN - ON JOKER

     Frustrated, snarling, ready to throw a tantrum.

                              JOKER
               DAMMIT! You can't get good help
               these days. -- Let's move out.

     EXT. STREET - EVENING - OVERHEAD ANGLE

     From high above the street we see the JOKER'S VAN pulling 
     out of VICKI's building. We're up on the roof, with BRUCE. 
     He hits a button on his utility belt, and a RED SIGNAL 
     LIGHT begins to flash.

     BRUCE clamps the utility belt around his waist. Pulls the 
     BLACK NYLON STOCKING over his head. And suddenly, he's 
     BOUNDING ACROSS THE ROOFTOPS in pursuit of the JOKER.

     EXT. CROSS STREET - A MOMENT LATER - EVENING

     The VAN turns right at the intersection. Nothing unusual. 
     But for some reason, PEDESTRIANS are pointing at the sky, 
     staring goggle-eyed at the rooftops.

     Far above them, a MAN -- dressed in a suit, a tie, a yellow 
     belt and a BLACK STOCKING MASK -- is gliding across the 
     intersection on a ROPE.

     INT. VAN - A MOMENT LATER

     The VAN DRIVER guns through a red light. BRAKES SQUEAL on 
     either side. In the back of the van, the JOKER GROWLS:

                              JOKER
               Slow down, you maniac!

     EXT. INTERSECTION - THAT MOMENT - EVENING

     As the VAN ROARS PAST, a MOUNTED POLICEMAN shakes his fist. 
     His horse shies, rears back, turns in a circle. He's just 
     about gotten the beast calmed down when a MAN IN A STOCKING 
     MASK plummets down on a rope from nowhere and lands 
     directly behind him on the horse's back.

     BRUCE elbows the startled COP. Now there's only one rider. 
     The VAN turns left. BRUCE gallops straight ahead through 
     the intersection, hoping to cut the JOKER off.

     INT. ALICIA HUNT'S APARTMENT - THAT MOMENT

     ALICIA peers out through the window. On the street below, 
     UNMARKED CARS are converging.

     INT. VAN - THAT MOMENT

     The JOKER and co. are two blocks away from ALICIA's. They 
     see a POLICE SWAT TEAM sealing off the building.

                              DRIVER
               Boss! Jesus! They've --

                              JOKER
               They'll be sorry. They'll be
               sorry. -- GET OUT OF HERE!

     EXT. SIDE STREET - THAT MOMENT - EVENING

     BRUCE on horseback, charging past elegant old brownstones, 
     drawing stares from passersby. We get a quick look at the 
     FLASHING RED SIGNAL LIGHT on his belt.

     EXT. RIVERVIEW DRIVE - THAT MOMENT - EVENING

     A YELLOW VW BUG rips up the street at 70 mph.

     INT. VOLKSWAGEN BUG - THAT MOMENT

     We can't see the driver. But we do see, on the seat 
     beside him, a VIDEO DISPLAY with a shifting grid map of the 
     city -- and on it, a FLASHING SIGNAL blinking in perfect 
     sync with the one on BRUCE's belt.

     EXT. SIDE STREET - THAT MOMENT

     BRUCE sees the VW bug rounding the corner and STREAKING 
     TOWARD HIM. He reins in the horse; it rears back on its 
     hind legs in a classic western pose; the BUG zooms past --

     -- and ALFRED THE BUTLER heaves out a BROWN LAUNDRY BUNDLE, 
     neatly tied in string.

     BRUCE snatches it out of the air, gives ALFRED a quick 
     salute -- and the BUG is gone.

     INT. JOKER'S VAN - EVENING

     The JOKER and his boys are stalled in heavy traffic at the 
     southern border of Gotham Park. POLICE BARRICADES are 
     everywhere; the surrounding streets have been roped off for 
     the birthday gala. HORNS HONK in anger.

                              JOKER
               MOVE! Can't you do something??

                              DRIVER
               It's some kind of detour. They're
               backed up for blocks!

     The JOKER snorts. He happens to glance into the side-view 
     mirror. What he sees there... CURDLES HIS BLOOD.

                              JOKER
               Oh my God. How does he do it... ?

     EXT. STREET - A BLOCK AWAY - THAT MOMENT

     THE BATMAN, IN FULL COSTUMED GLORY, GALLOPING UP THE STREET 
     ON HORSEBACK -- passing stunned COPS, weaving in and around 
     the stalled autos, GAINING FAST on the JOKER.

     INT. VAN - THAT MOMENT

     THE JOKER climbing all over the DRIVER. He HITS THE GAS, 
     RUNS THE VAN UP ON THE SIDEWALK, and -- at the first 
     opening he sees -- CRASHES THROUGH A POLICE BARRICADE INTO 
     GOTHAM PARK ITSELF.

     BATMAN is half a block behind him now. As he follows hot on 
     the JOKER's heels, TWO HELICOPTERS swing into the park from 
     overhead.

     EXT. GOTHAM PARK - EVENING

     CROWDS EVERYWHERE. On the central platform where we saw the 
     FREE CONCERT earlier, an EMCEE mans the microphone:

                              EMCEE
               -- the most spectacular, most death-
               defying aerial stunt ever devised.
               Tonight -- for the first time
               anywhere -- THE FLYING GRAYSONS!

     He points up at the two approaching HELICOPTERS, flying 
     side-by-side in tight formation some forty feet apart.

     ANGLE ON HELICOPTERS

     ONLOOKERS GASP as TWO TRAPEZES drop from the bellies of the 
     twin copters. Dangling from the trapezes are the FLYING 
     GRAYSONS -- a husband-and-wife aerialist team in spangled 
     red-and-green suits. They begin swinging toward each other 
     in a plane perpendicular to the path of the copters.

     EXT. GOTHAM PARK - GROUND LEVEL

     PANIC DOWN BELOW as the JOKER's van barrels through the 
     crowd, HORN BLARING. BATMAN is moving up swiftly.

     On each wrist he's wearing a MINIATURE ROCKET LAUNCHER. He 
     lets fly with TWO SALVOS. The first explodes harmlessly 
     against a tree. The second HITS THE REAR DOOR OF THE VAN -- 
     driving it off the access road down into the brush, where 
     it nearly topples over sideways.

     ANGLE ON FLYING GRAYSONS

     GRAYSON has just completed a double somersault in midair, 
     landing in the capable hands of his wife. Now they're 
     swinging again, building momentum as he prepares to make 
     the return leap back to his own trapeze.

     INT. HELICOPTER - THAT MOMENT

     In the bay of the helicopter stands a kid, fifteen, 
     compact, tough, and wiry: DICK GRAYSON. Like his parents, 
     he's wearing a red-and-green suit. From the copter, he's 
     got a perfect bird's-eye view of the BATMAN-JOKER chase.

                              PILOT
               Ready to go, Dick?

                              DICK
               What's all the ruckus down there?

     EXT. PARK - GROUND LEVEL - THAT MOMENT

     The VAN bounces over rocks and bushes, narrowly avoiding 
     trees, with BATMAN in hot pursuit.

     INT. VAN - THAT MOMENT

     At the foot of a hill, the JOKER spies a truck. On its 
     side, in bright red letters, a WARNING: "DANGER - 
     FIREWORKS. FLAMMABLE LOAD."

     The JOKER reaches into the back for a HIGHWAY FLARE.

                              JOKER
               Head for the truck!

     INT. HELICOPTER - THAT MOMENT

     Hovering over the chase scene, DICK catches sight of the 
     JOKER. He GASPS IN SHOCK as a LIT FLARE flies from the back 
     of the VAN... directly into the FIREWORKS TRUCK.

     EXT. PARK - GROUND LEVEL - A MOMENT LATER

     THE BATMAN is thrown off his horse by the shock of a 
     massive EXPLOSION. All at once, THE SKY IS FULL of 
     BURSTING, INCANDESCENT COLORS!!

     THE JOKER hangs out of the rear of the van, looking up, an 
     expression of PURE DELIGHT on his face.

                              JOKER
               I love fireworks!

     ANGLE ON HELICOPTERS

     LURCHING AND SPINNING IN THE SKY as FIREWORKS rocket past. 
     One of them takes a dead hit on the rotor. JOHN GRAYSON 
     falls to his death instantly; a moment later, the COPTER 
     plummets into the trees with a resounding, fiery CRASH.

     MARY GRAYSON hangs from the second copter as it bobs and 
     weaves out of control. ONLOOKERS SCREAM IN TERROR.

     EXT. STREET - THAT MOMENT

     THE JOKER'S VAN bursts out of the park and speeds up a 
     wide, cordoned-off avenue. Overhead, THE SECOND COPTER 
     veers wildly, out of the park now, swinging dangerously 
     close to the tall buildings along the avenue.

     INT. HELICOPTER - THAT MOMENT

     DICK GRAYSON at the mouth of the bay, hanging on by a 
     canvas strap. He watches helplessly as his MOTHER swings 
     into a POWER LINE and drops three stories to the pavement.

                              DICK
               NO! NOOOOOOOO!!!!

     His face is contorted with rage and pain. The PILOT 
     struggles desperately to right the copter, barely avoiding 
     a collision with the nearest building. And then -- before 
     THE PILOT can make a move to stop him -- DICK HAS JUMPED 
     OUT OF THE COPTER.

     ANGLE ON DICK

     With astonishing physical grace, he DIVES. GRABS A 
     FLAGPOLE. Executes a perfect somersault. FLIPS onto a 
     nearby fire escape. VAULTS to the next fire escape down. 
     And LEAPS OUT OVER THE STREET --

     -- MAKING A PERFECT TWO-POINT LANDING on his intended 
     target... THE ROOF OF THE JOKER'S VAN!!

     INT. VAN - THAT MOMENT

     THE JOKER hears a THUNK overhead. He casually lifts his gun 
     and BLOWS A HOLE THROUGH THE ROOF OF THE VAN.

     EXT. ROOF OF VAN - MOVING - THAT MOMENT

     The blast just misses DICK. He sprawls flat, YANKS at the 
     chrome luggage rack on the roof of the van, and BREAKS OFF 
     A FOUR-FOOT SHAFT OF METAL.

     ANOTHER SHOT through the roof. DICK rolls forward, hoists 
     his chrome spear over the windshield.

     INT. VAN - THAT MOMENT

     SPLINTERED GLASS flies everywhere as DICK RAMS THE SHAFT 
     THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD. THE DRIVER dodges left and LOSES 
     CONTROL OF THE WHEEL.

     EXT. ROOF OF VAN - MOVING - THAT MOMENT

     The VAN careens wildly toward an OVERPASS. DICK rises up 
     into a crouch just in time to see a sign which reads 
     "DANGER -- LOW CLEARANCE." He's about to get his head taken 
     off!

     ONE SECOND BEFORE IMPACT a BLACK-CAPED SHADOW swings across 
     the street and SCOOPS DICK OFF THE ROOF OF THE VAN.

     EXT. STREET - NIGHT

     BATMAN AND DICK tumble to the pavement. THE VAN knocks over 
     a fire hydrant and STOPS. DICK is already on his feet, 
     ready to CHARGE THE VAN, when BATMAN throws a powerful arm 
     around his waist.

                              DICK
               LET ME GO! LET ME --

     THE JOKER steps casually out of the van. TWO GOONS with 
     MACHINE GUNS emerge behind him. PEDESTRIANS SCREAM as the 
     GOONS level their guns at the CROWD.

                              DICK (cont.)
               YOU PIECE OF -- YOU MOTHERF--

     DICK is kicking, screaming, clawing, biting. BATMAN has his 
     hands full restraining the kid.

                              JOKER
               Like your boyfriend. He's kinda
               hot.
                     (glowering at BATMAN)
               Hands off the belt.

                              BATMAN
               Take me. Let the boy go.

                              JOKER
               Gosh, I could kill you, but then
               you'd miss my party. And I'd be
               real, real sad if you couldn't make
               it.

                              BATMAN
               What are you talking about?

                              JOKER
               Batman! Don't you even recognize
               your old pal Jack? After all... 
                     (cackling insanely)
               You made me what I am today.

     BATMAN cocks his head in puzzlement as DISTANT SIRENS 
     BLARE. The JOKER and his HOODS -- guns still aimed at the 
     crowd -- back away and race off on foot, vanishing into the 
     night.

     DICK BREAKS FREE and BOLTS AFTER THEM. BATMAN throws him to 
     the street with a flying tackle. The boy is hysterical.

                              DICK
               HE KILLED MY PARENTS! HE KILLED
               MY --

     BATMAN flinches at the sound of the words. He reaches into 
     his belt and -- mercifully -- breaks a KNOCKOUT CAPSULE 
     under DICK's nose.

                                                 DISSOLVE TO:

     INSERT - TELEVISION SCREEN

     A taped report from the hallway outside ALICIA's apartment. 
     COPS and FORENSICS MEN mill about in the b.g.

                              REPORTER
               ... on a tip attributed to the
               mysterious Batman. The apartment was
               booby-trapped with the Joker's
               laughing gas, leaving 17 policemen
               dead.
                     (beat)
               Also found dead at the scene was
               Alicia Hunt, 26, a former model --

     CAMERA PULLS BACK to reveal that the TV SCREEN is part of 
     BRUCE'S BANK OF MONITORS, deep in the Batcave. The other 
     screens show the various rooms of Wayne Manor, all empty.

     We move now to the video display of a COMPUTER WORKSTATION, 
     showing TWO FACES side-by-side: a mug shot of JACK NAPIER 
     and a freeze-frame of the JOKER from one of his pirate 
     transmissions. A GRAPHICS PROGRAM abstracts the twin heads 
     into THREE-DIMENSIONAL, ROTATING TOPOLOGICAL GRIDS -- and, 
     as we watch, the two spinning heads COLLIDE AND MERGE.
     Except for the fearsome grin, they MESH PERFECTLY.

     Yet another terminal: BRUCE's database. The same phrase
     flashes again and again, scrolling up the screen: ACE 
     CHEMICAL CO. ACE CHEMICAL CO. ACE CHEMICAL CO.

     And, finally: BRUCE HIMSELF, slumped at a table, his head 
     in his hands. He's realized, to his horror, that he is
     responsible for the birth of the Joker. And frankly...
     he would just as soon be dead.

     INT. WAYNE MANOR - GUEST BEDROOM - DAY

     DICK GRAYSON is sprawled on a huge four-poster bed, 
     unconscious, softly moaning. He COMES TO with a jolt.

     Breaking into a sweat almost instantly, he looks at his 
     unfamiliar surroundings. A shadowy figure stands nearby.

                              DICK
               ... Where am I?

                              BRUCE
               My name is Bruce Wayne. You're
               welcome to stay here as long as you
               want.

     BRUCE steps out just as ALFRED enters with a breakfast 
     tray. DICK makes a puzzled face. What the hell is going on 
     here?

     INT. HALL OF JUSTICE - DAY

     Beneath the statue of blind Justice, BRUCE and HARVEY DENT 
     march through the portico, engaged in a heated argument.

                              DENT
               We'll send a team into Ace the
               moment the warrant comes through.

                              BRUCE
               He'll be ready when you do. Remember
               what happened at the apartment.

                              DENT
               All right, Bruce, what do you
               suggest?

                              BRUCE
               I suggest a nice big bomb.

                              DENT
               Good. A bomb. On a blind tip from
               Bruce Wayne. -- We do have laws.

                              BRUCE
               Then for God's sake, Harvey, cancel
               the anniversary celebration.

                              DENT
               We've told him we'll deal. What
               could he possibly have to gain by --

                              BRUCE
               Do you still think the Joker cares
               about money??

                              DENT
               I don't know. I'm just a D.A. I
               don't have access to all your
               expert sources.

     Mexican standoff. BRUCE stalks off fuming. DENT hangs back 
     a moment, then turns down the hall.

     EXT. WAYNE MANOR - ESTABLISHING - DAY

     The ornate, wrought-iron GATE which opens on the long 
     driveway snaking up toward Wayne Manor. It's bolted shut.

     INT. WAYNE MANOR - DAY

     A glass-enclosed room which houses an enormous HEATED 
     INDOOR SWIMMING POOL. DICK GRAYSON does a couple of laps, 
     then climbs out and towels himself off.

     He looks out at the estate: tennis courts, a riding stable 
     in the distance. He's not happy. All this opulence could 
     drive a guy stark staring nuts in short order.

     INT. GUEST BEDROOM - DAY

     An OPEN SUITCASE on the bed. DICK fingers a gold ashtray 
     bearing the figure of Winged Victory -- then shrugs and 
     tosses it into the suitcase on top of his gymnast's 
     costume. When he looks up he sees BRUCE in the doorway 
     behind him.

                              DICK
               ... Your butler wouldn't gimme a ride
               so I figured I'd hoof it.

                              BRUCE
               Sorry. I can't let you leave.

                              DICK
               You can't keep me here, man. That's
               kidnapping.

                              BRUCE
               If I let you leave, you'll do the
               same thing again. You'll go after
               the Joker... and you'll wind up dead.
                     (turning to go)

                              DICK
               Hey, man. Look at you. You're
               rich. You got everything you want.
               How do you know what's in my mind?

     BRUCE turns to face him. The little hellion's eyes are 
     filled with raw, burning hatred. BRUCE knows the feeling.

                              BRUCE
               I don't care what's in your mind.
               You're staying.

     BRUCE reaches for a key in his pocket. Without warning, the 
     kid RUSHES him, throwing a rock-solid punch. With blinding 
     speed, BRUCE sidesteps him, parries the blow, and winds up 
     spinning DICK around -- INTO A WALL.

     DICK is stunned, but he has to laugh. This rich boy has a 
     move or two. BRUCE stands there, silently challenging him.

     A second later, the kid is airborne -- upping the ante with 
     a scissor-kick aimed squarely at BRUCE's gut. In a blur of 
     motion BRUCE checks the kick, swings an arm into DICK's 
     chest, and sends the boy sprawling flat on his back.

     INT. WAYNE MANOR - KITCHEN - THAT MOMENT

     ALFRED, in his apron, fixing a tray of snacks. He looks up 
     curiously at the ceiling. From the sound of it, a battle 
     royal is shaping up in the guest bedroom.

     INT. GUEST BEDROOM - THAT MOMENT

     DICK'S BODY -- head down, feet up -- flies through the air. 
     He SMASHES INTO a closet door and slumps to the carpet. 
     Shaken now, and sweating profusely, he looks up at BRUCE... 
     who stands calmly over him, adjusting his necktie.

     A long, tense moment passes between them. Then:

                              DICK
               ... You're him.

     No reply from BRUCE. Their gazes lock. And suddenly... 

                              ALFRED (V.O.)
               FREEZE!

     DICK and BRUCE look around. The puny, mustachioed butler 
     stands in the doorway, feet spread in a Dirty Harry stance, 
     a .44 MAGNUM trained on DICK.

                              BRUCE
               It's all right, Alfred. Everything's
               under control.

                              ALFRED
               ... Very good, sir.

     ALFRED relaxes, musters his dignity, and turns to go.

                                                 CUT TO:

     INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - AFTERNOON

     CANNED APPLAUSE as THE JOKER marches out onto a makeshift 
     STAGE to give his QUARTERLY REPORT to the stockholders.

                              JOKER
               Thankya, thankya. Ladies and germs,
               I'm here to tell you... we have had
               one helluva quarter.

     He waves a pointer at three SALES CHARTS on portable 
     easels.

                              JOKER (cont.)
               Panic's up. Terror's up. And fear --
               fear's gone straight through the
               roof. You guys should be proud --
               'cause I couldn'ta done it without
               each and every one of you!

     MORE CANNED APPLAUSE. The JOKER takes a bow.

                              JOKER (cont.)
               I feel it's time to expand the
               Joker line. I was askin' myself,
               what are the products that every
               consumer wants most? And that's when
               it hit me: the water you drink, and
               the air you breathe! Huh? Bingo!
                     (strutting across stage)
               Now, some of you have your eye on
               the profit margin. You're thinkin':
               this boy's too ambitious. You
               don't approve. In fact, some of you
               have been talking about turning me
               in to the cops. Or knocking me off.

     He pauses. GLARES OUT at the audience. NO RESPONSE.

                              JOKER (cont.)
               But that's okay. I understand. Not
               everyone shares my eye for beauty.
               And just to show there's no hard
               feelings, I'm throwin' a little
               shindig tonight -- and you're all
               invited!

     THE CANNED APPLAUSE goes right off the meter.

                              JOKER (cont.)
               How 'bout it? IS EVERYBODY HAPPY??

     REVERSE ANGLE - THE AUDIENCE

     Familiar faces all around -- the major players of the 
     Gotham underworld. But despite the enormous twisted grins, 
     no one here is laughing or applauding. No one here is
     living. The JOKER is playing to a roomful of smiling 
     corpses.

     One of them topples out of his chair and lands with a plop.

                              JOKER
               Look at that, folks. We got 'em
               rolling in the aisles!

     INT. BRUCE'S BEDROOM - TOWARD DUSK

     VICKI lies in BRUCE's bed, under the covers, propped up on 
     the pillows. BRUCE is in his robe over by the window, 
     looking out at his estate.

                              BRUCE
               All this apparatus, Vicki... this
               house, and the money, and the
               power... it was never mine. It was
               something I inherited. Bruce Wayne
               was something I inherited.
                     (pause)
               All I ever hoped for was someone who
               could see through Bruce -- who could
               see me -- and not be frightened.

                              VICKI
               I'm not frightened of you, Bruce.
               I'm frightened for you.

                              BRUCE
               In all these years... why couldn't I
               see how it would turn out?

     He turns toward her. His face is ravaged with guilt. Now 
     she's truly afraid.

                              BRUCE (cont.)
               I'm responsible, Vicki. If it wasn't
               for me, there'd be no Joker.

                                                 CUT TO:

     INT. BATCAVE - EVENING

     TIGHT ON a tiny electronic device: two cylindrical steel 
     casings bracketed together, topped by a DIGITAL TIMER. 
     BRUCE makes a few adjustments with a jeweler's screwdriver, 
     hits a trigger, and watches the TIMER tick off seconds. 30. 
     29. 28. At 25 seconds, BRUCE kills the
     countdown and CLAMPS THE DEVICE into an empty packet on his 
     utility belt.

     He stands up wearily. He's in his bat-suit, minus the cape 
     and cowl. Behind him, hanging back discreetly in the 
     shadows, is his loyal butler ALFRED.

                              BRUCE
               Where's the boy?

                              ALFRED
               Upstairs. He's quite docile.

                              BRUCE
               I know that feeling. It won't last.

     BRUCE takes a moment to survey the Batcave as ALFRED looks 
     on tremulously.

                              BRUCE (cont.)
               He's a long way ahead of where I was
               at his age.
                     (taking ALFRED's
                      shoulders)
               I want you to treat him just as if
               he were me. Promise.

                              ALFRED
               Yes, sir.

                              BRUCE
               He'll be taken care of financially.
               Beyond that... you know what to do.
               Don't let all this go to waste.

     Their eyes lock for a long moment. ALFRED is unable to 
     speak. Finally BRUCE turns and starts slowly up the long 
     circular stairway which leads from the Batcave to Wayne 
     Manor. On the third step he pauses:

                              BRUCE (cont.)
               Alfred? -- Thank you.

     As BRUCE disappears up the stairs, a shaken ALFRED steadies 
     himself against a lab table, fighting back tears.

     INT. BRUCE'S BEDROOM - EVENING

     BRUCE draws the curtains, sets an alarm clock. The current 
     time is 7:09 PM.

     He sits cross-legged on the floor, slumps forward slightly, 
     and closes his eyes. He inhales, exhales, taking deep, 
     regular breaths. His muscles relax. Ten seconds later, 
     BRUCE has plunged into DEEP SLEEP.

     Time passes. The clock shows 7:19, 7:32.

     At 7:44 we TRACK IN on BRUCE's unconscious face, drawing 
     closer and closer until HIS EYELIDS FILL THE FRAME, 
     twitching with the irregular movement characteristic of 
     R.E.M. sleep. Without warning his EYES SNAP OPEN.

     HOLD ON BRUCE'S GAZE -- grim, alert, determined -- as the 
     clock hits 7:45. An ALARM SOUNDS, BREAKING THE SILENCE with 
     its grating electronic WHINE.

                                                 DISSOLVE TO:

     EXT. ACE CHEMICAL - AERIAL SHOT - NIGHT

     The trademark ace on the illuminated sign. From our vantage 
     point high above, we can see THREE CARGO TRUCKS rolling out 
     the main gates. A half-mile away, THE BATMOBILE cruises up 
     the waterfront, approaching soundlessly, its headlights 
     off... preparing for a final showdown with the JOKER's 
     forces.

     INT. ACE CHEMICAL - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT

     The JOKER'S MINIONS, working late, readying a huge 
     shipment. At an open loading bay, we find a DISPATCHER with 
     a clipboard, directing MORE UNMARKED TRUCKS in the lot 
     outside.

                              DISPATCHER
               Boston, Philly: loading bay one.

     EXT. ACE CHEMICAL - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT

     The BATMOBILE stops short of the main gate. ENGINES ROAR 
     and the supercar ACCELERATES, SMASHING THROUGH THE GATE and 
     taking half the chain-link fence with it.

     In the guard's booth, ARMED GOONS pull guns as the 
     BATMOBILE streaks across the parking lot and LAUNCHES A 
     ROCKET at the corrugated metal door which opens on the 
     factory floor. A THUNDEROUS EXPLOSION tears a gaping hole 
     in the door.

     INT. ACE CHEMICAL - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT

     The BATMOBILE cruises through the flaming wreckage and 
     SKIDS TO A HALT on the refinery floor. The JOKER'S MEN are 
     everywhere. They take one look at the BATMOBILE, PANIC, and 
     PELT THE CAR with a barrage of MACHINE-GUN FIRE.

     CRACKS begin to spread across the Batmobile's plexiglass 
     dome. Within moments, the windshield SHATTERS -- and 
     COLLAPSES ALTOGETHER.

     INT. BATMOBILE - THAT MOMENT

     BULLETS rip through the upholstered passenger seats. It 
     doesn't matter. The car is empty. No one's driving.

     TRACK IN on the computer console -- where a familiar tinny 
     voice calmly repeats its pre-programmed command:

                              COMPUTER
               ... Detonate.

     A beat. Then: BLAM.

     INT. POLICE CAR - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT

     A CONVOY approaches Ace Chemical -- GORDON's team preparing 
     to raid the plant. Inside each car: SPECIAL UNIT COPS 
     dressed in asbestos suits, gas masks in their laps.

     All at once, a BRILLIANT RED GLARE suffuses the sky.

                              COP
                    Good Lord!

     EXT. ACE CHEMICAL - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT

     THE JOKER'S MEN running for their lives across the parking 
     lot, KNOCKED FLAT by the force of SIX DEAFENING EXPLOSIONS. 
     For a few seconds everything is flame and fury. And then --

     All that's left of Ace Chemical is a pile of charred rubble 
     and a PILLAR OF THICK BLACK SMOKE, spiraling up to the sky.

                                                 CUT TO:

     EXT. ANDREWS ISLAND - NIGHT

     DAZZLING FIREWORKS explode in the night sky over Gotham 
     Harbor. SEARCHLIGHTS sweep across the mammoth, welcoming 
     stone figure of LADY GOTHAM -- still wrapped in canvas, 
     ready to be unveiled.

     THOUSANDS OF RUBBERNECKERS jam every square inch of 
     Andrew's Island. COPS ON HORSEBACK speak into walkie-
     talkies as they patrol the edges of the crowd. Across the 
     Harbor, Ace Chemical is going up in flames -- but as far as 
     the crowd can tell, with all the noise and excitement, it's 
     just another part of the celebration.

     At the base of the statue, GOVERNOR GILROY speaks into a 
     microphone:

                              GOVERNOR GILROY
               As Governor of this great state, it
               is now my honor to unveil for you a
               very special lady -- a lady who
               stands tall for life and liberty --
               America's favorite lady... LADY
               GOTHAM!

     The CROWD begins to APPLAUD RHYTHMICALLY, chanting 'LADY 
     GOTHAM! LADY GOTHAM!' It's like Times Square on New Year's 
     Eve, waiting for the big ball to drop. GILROY hoists a pair 
     of oversized scissors and cuts a ceremonial ribbon: 
     hydraulic CRANES kick into gear: CABLES DROP FREE, and the 
     canvas cover draws back from LADY GOTHAM's face... 

     ... to a chorus of SCREAMS from the crowd. LADY GOTHAM IS
     WEARING A GRISLY JOKER GRIN!!!

     Suddenly -- in the midst of the hysteria -- THE 
     SEARCHLIGHTS DIE. The STAGE LIGHTS BLINK OUT. ANDREWS 
     ISLAND IS PLUNGED INTO DARKNESS. Instantaneous mass panic: 
     the GOVERNOR shouts to his aides as ONLOOKERS mob the 
     stage. COPS are knocked from their horses as the CROWD 
     stampedes. PANDEMONIUM RULES.

     And across the harbor... block by block... GOTHAM CITY IS 
     GOING DARK.

     EXT. GOTHAM SKIES - AERIAL SHOTS - NIGHT

     QUICK SHOTS of FOUR HELICOPTERS hovering at different 
     points over the blacked-out city. LOUDSPEAKERS blare out a 
     PRE-RECORDED MESSAGE:

                              JOKER (V.O.)
               HAPPY BIRTHDAY, Gotham. Here's a
               little token of my esteem. HAVE
               FUN... 'cause THE PARTY'S ON ME!

     INSANE LAUGHTER echoes. CARGO BAYS open wide. The JOKER'S 
     HELICOPTERS begin LEAFLETING THE CITY... with MONEY!

     SERIES OF SHOTS

     ANARCHY IN GOTHAM as high-denomination bills flutter to 
     earth, blanketing the streets. HOPELESSLY OUTMANNED COPS 
     try to maintain order as SOLID CITIZENS trample one another 
     in a paroxysm of ANIMAL GREED. BUILDINGS EMPTY as APARTMENT 
     DWELLERS race outside. ALL TRAFFIC STOPS as DRIVERS climb 
     out of their cars to SNATCH MONEY FROM THE AIR.

     DARKNESS EVERYWHERE. In the pitch-black subways, TERRIFIED 
     COMMUTERS are seized by claustrophobia. GLASS SHATTERS, 
     DOORS BREAK OPEN as they claw their way out of stalled 
     subway cars and SPILL OUT onto the tracks.

     On the streets above, GOTHAM'S CRIMINAL ELEMENT is having a 
     field day. The cops are preoccupied, utterly helpless 
     against the first waves of RIOTING AND LOOTING.

     FLAMES ERUPT. PUNKS race down the street carrying fur coats 
     and color TV's. LOOTERS break through the display window of 
     an electronics store, and climb in among the goodies... 
     only to FLY OUT, two seconds later, on the wrong end of a 
     SHOTGUN BLAST. THE JOKER'S DREAM IS COMING TRUE.

     EXT. STREET - NIGHT

     In a crouch on the pavement, snapping photos of the wild 
     street action, is VICKI -- fearless, professional, doing
     her job. A battered FORD ESCORT cruises up behind her.

                              KNOX
               VICKI!

     VICKI sees KNOX, climbs into the passenger seat. He's 
     wearing a big smile. They're jazzed, oblivious to danger.

                              KNOX (cont.)
               Couldn't turn down the job, huh? A
               girl could get hurt this way.

                              VICKI
               Yeah. Deja vu.

                              KNOX
               What do you say? Let's head for the
               lights.

     In the distance, above the tops of the buildings, BEACONS 
     are sweeping the sky.

     EXT. BROAD AVENUE - NIGHT

     Stationed all up and down Gotham's widest thoroughfare are
     huge portable SEARCHLIGHTS -- mounted on trucks with
     portable generators, unaffected by the power outage.

     On the money-covered sidewalks, TOTAL BEDLAM. But on the 
     street itself, a bizarre PARADE is taking place, just as if 
     nothing's wrong. Rumbling up the avenue at two-block  
     intervals, moored to floats, are DOZENS OF ENORMOUS 
     BALLOONS in the shapes of cartoon characters and historical 
     figures. It's like a hellish Thanksgiving's day procession.

     The LEAD-OFF BALLOON is a gigantic, grotesque CLOWN -- 
     smiling ghoulishly, dressed in white pierrot frills. We 
     TILT DOWN to the FLOAT BENEATH IT... 

     ... and there, atop a mountain of roses where the prom
     queen should be, sits the JOKER -- smiling, waving daintily 
     at the rioters and looters, presiding over the carnage like 
     some demented parade marshal.

                                                 CUT TO:

     EXT. LAKE - NIGHT

     A desolate rural setting. UTTER SILENCE. Moonlight glints 
     on placid waters. We track in on a small sign bearing the 
     legend: "GOTHAM CITY RESERVOIR."

     Far off in the distance, HEADLIGHTS ARE APPROACHING.

     EXT. ACCESS ROAD - AERIAL SHOT - MOVING - NIGHT

     The THREE CARGO TRUCKS from Ace Chemical roll ominously 
     TOWARD THE RESERVOIR on their deadly mission. And then -- A 
     STREAKING BLACK SHADOW ENTERS FRAME, overtaking the TRUCKS.

     THE BATWING! A phenomenal ULTRALIGHT AIRCRAFT, swift, 
     sleek, jet-black and infinitely maneuverable, it SOARS 
     EASILY past the trucks, swooping low just long enough to 
     release a BOMB over a concrete bridge.

     EXT. ACCESS ROAD - A MOMENT LATER

     The BRIDGE EXPLODES, blocking the trucks' path to the 
     reservoir. PUZZLED DRIVERS climb out of their cabs and 
     wonder what to do next.

     They spot the BATWING in the distance -- banking, doing a 
     sharp 180. For a moment they gape in disbelief. Then they 
     HEAD FOR THE TREES as the BATWING DIVES DIRECTLY AT THE 
     TRUCKS, firing THREE ARMOR-PIERCING SHELLS... and 
     destroying the JOKER's lethal cargo once and for all.

     ANGLE ON BATMAN

     in the cockpit, his jaw set, not even looking back at the 
     wreckage as his plane screams off toward the Gotham 
     skyline.

     EXT. GOTHAM STREET - NIGHT

     FRIGHTENED PEDESTRIANS race past OVERTURNED CARS. A PARADE 
     FLOAT, run aground on the sidewalk, begins to BURN.

     Above it, a damaged BALLOON -- the cartoon character 
     UNDERDOG -- is losing helium, warping and buckling in on 
     itself, sinking down gently toward the flames. Down the 
     street, KNOX'S FORD ESCORT is coming up fast.

     INT. FORD - MOVING - THAT MOMENT

     VICKI snapping photos out the window as UNDERDOG drifts 
     downward. FLAMES lick up at his belly -- and the cartoon 
     blimp EXPLODES.

                              KNOX
               So much for Underdog.

     THEN -- as they drive past -- A SECOND EXPLOSION. And all 
     at once the STREET IS FULL OF DEADLY GREENISH GAS!

                              VICKI
               ALLIE!! THE WINDOWS!!

     EXT. STREET - A MOMENT LATER - NIGHT

     The Ford Escort, windows up, swerves out of a THICK 
     SPREADING CLOUD of GREEN LAUGHING GAS -- threatening to 
     engulf the entire block!

     INT. FORD - MOVING - THAT MOMENT

                              KNOX
               WHAT HAPPENED?!?

     VICKI stares back at the green cloud. Turns. And sees, up 
     the street, THE JOKER'S PROCESSION: BALLOONS BY THE DOZEN!

                              VICKI
               Oh my God. Compressor tanks. He's
               got the balloons rigged with
               compressor tanks!!

                              KNOX
               Jesus Christ, the guy's a genius.

     INT. BATWING - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT

     BATMAN, at the controls, gliding over the Gotham streets. 
     He looks down, sees a BILLOWING HAZE of DENSE GREEN FUMES. 
     At its periphery: LOOTERS reeling and staggering, falling 
     to the pavement, LAUGHING THEMSELVES TO DEATH.

     INT. FORD - MOVING - THAT MOMENT

     VICKI staring through the windshield. Overhead, an AIRCRAFT 
     streaks past... an aircraft with SCALLOPED BLACK BAT WINGS.

                              VICKI
               LOOK! IT'S BRUCE!!
                     (frantically)
               Allie -- the balloons. We've got to
               find some way to tell him!

                              KNOX
               Great. How??

     They speed up the street toward the PARADE. SPOTLIGHTS 
     SHINE. Suddenly KNOX's eyes bug out. He SLAMS ON THE BRAKES 
     and SKIDS TO A HALT.

                              KNOX (cont.)
               COME ON!

     EXT. AVENUE - A SECOND LATER - NIGHT

     Before VICKI can speak, KNOX has grabbed a tire iron from 
     the back of the car and RACED OUT ONTO THE STREET. He 
     flings the TIRE IRON through a glass STOREFRONT.

     It's a COSTUME SHOP. In the window, MANNEQUINS dressed in 
     party costumes: Frankenstein. Ronald Reagan. And, that 
     current popular sensation... THE BATMAN.

     As VICKI catches up with him, KNOX drags the Batman dummy 
     out of the store window. RIPS OFF ITS BLACK CAPE. And 
     DASHES MANIACALLY UP THE SIDEWALK.

     Waving the cape, he VAULTS onto the back of a SPOTLIGHT 
     TRUCK. VICKI's face goes slack. Now she gets it.

                              KNOX
               GIMME A HAND UP HERE!

     VICKI climbs aboard. They drape the cape over the face of 
     the spotlight. Then they put their shoulders to the swivel 
     assembly -- tilting the spotlight -- AIMING THE BEAM... 

     ... DIRECTLY AT THE JOKER'S WHITE CLOWN BALLOON!!!

     INT. BATWING - THAT MOMENT

     BATMAN stares at the CLOWN BALLOON dead ahead. On its 
     massive distended belly... a BURNING YELLOW OVAL. And in 
     the center of the oval... THE BLACK SILHOUETTE OF A BAT.

     BATMAN'S MOUTH drops open. He understands.

     EXT. AVENUE - ON JOKER'S FLOAT - THAT MOMENT

     THE JOKER reaches into a big sack and begins distributing 
     MINIATURE GAS MASKS, like party favors, to his cronies on 
     the float. Then he pulls out a radio-operated REMOTE 
     CONTROL DEVICE and points it up at the CLOWN BALLOON.

     He hits a button. The CLOWN begins to INFLATE. Its joints 
     bulge. Its FACE SWELLS UP as the COMPRESSOR TANK concealed 
     inside it releases its noxious contents. The JOKER is 
     BEAMING, a look of PURE UNALLOYED JOY on his face... 

     ... when his PARADE FLOAT BLOWS TO SMITHEREENS BENEATH HIM! 
     The JOKER and his men CARTWHEEL THROUGH THE AIR and TUMBLE 
     TO THE ASPHALT as THE BATWING WHIPS PAST OVERHEAD, soaring 
     through the stone canyons of Gotham at a 90-degree angle to 
     the ground!

                              JOKER
               No... NOOOOO!!!

     ANGLE ON CLOWN BALLOON

     as it rises, rises, swelling to grotesque proportions in 
     the starless night. The tallest buildings are far below it 
     now. Finally it BURSTS -- and the deadly GAS inside it 
     disperses harmlessly in the wind.

     EXT. AVENUE - THAT MOMENT

     THE JOKER on the edge of a tantrum as he digs amid the 
     rubble of his float for the remote device. At last he finds 
     it; aims it up at the other balloons in the procession; 
     hits a button repeatedly... 

     ... and HOWLS IN FRUSTRATION. Nothing's happening. The 
     damned thing is broken. He heaves it to the street in a
     fit of pique.

     A SCREAMING COMES ACROSS THE SKY as the BATWING swings back 
     for another pass, BUZZING the JOKER at an altitude of 
     twenty feet. SIZZLING LASER FIRE sweeps the street.

     CABLES SNAP and BALLOONS DRIFT UPWARD as BATMAN'S LASERS 
     sever their moorings. The JOKER can only look on 
     helplessly, in stunned disbelief.

     As he's watching his plans evaporate... HIS EYES FALL ON 
     THE MAKESHIFT BAT-SIGNAL.

                              JOKER
               There. There. -- GET 'EM!!

     ANGLE ON SPOTLIGHT TRUCK

     A SPRAY OF MACHINE-GUN FIRE shatters the Bat-signal. KNOX 
     throws VICKI to the street, ducks down behind the 
     spotlight, and tosses her his CAR KEYS.

                              KNOX
               GET THE CAR!

     The JOKER'S GOONS are coming up fast as VICKI reaches the 
     Ford, starts it, and comes ROARING UP toward KNOX. He jumps 
     off the truck as VICKI twists the wheel, lays a track of 
     rubber, and noses the car back in the opposite direction.

     GUNFIRE as KNOX jumps inside and they PEEL OUT.

     INT. FORD ESCORT - MOVING - A MOMENT LATER

     KNOX's breathing is ragged, but he breaks out in HYSTERICAL 
     LAUGHTER nonetheless. The two of them are totally 
     exhilarated. They can't believe what they've just done.

                              KNOX
               HOLY SHIT!!

                              VICKI
               You okay?

                              KNOX
               Yeah. Yeah. Little winded. DID YOU
               SEE THAT?!

                              VICKI
                     (laughing wildly)
               God yes, Allie. I've gotta say --
               that was the ballsiest move I
               ever --

                              KNOX
                     (ecstatic)
               Holy shit. Holy --

     He GURGLES. AN ENORMOUS GOUT OF BLOOD bubbles up between 
     his lips -- and BURSTS.

                              VICKI
               ALLIE!!

     His hand goes to his stomach -- and comes away bloody. He 
     looks down in genuine bewilderment.

                              KNOX
               Jesus, Vicki.

     That quickly, he's dead. VICKI lets out an awful wail and 
     slams on the brakes. She sits there in the middle of the 
     street, POUNDING THE WHEEL, TEARS pouring down her face.

     EXT. GOTHAM HARBOR - NIGHT

     In the sky, CARTOON CHARACTERS drift lazily out to sea.

     EXT. BROAD AVENUE - NIGHT

     THE JOKER and his boys running like hell down the avenue, 
     past the parade. They reach the last of the floats -- the 
     one bringing up the rear -- then CLIMB ABOARD and disappear 
     through a CONCEALED HATCH.

     WOOD SPLINTERS as the top of the float begins to ROTATE 
     mysteriously. The muzzle of a CANNON breaks through the 
     parade decorations. And one moment later... 

     A ROSE-COVERED TANK is rumbling up Broad Avenue!

     INT. BATWING - THAT MOMENT

     BATMAN sweeps past overhead. He sees the tank, unleashes a 
     burst of LASER FIRE. It bounces harmlessly off the tank, 
     leaves a trail of SMOKING ASPHALT on the street. He swoops 
     low overhead, hits a button on his control panel as he 
     streaks OVER THE TANK and into firing range.

     INT. TANK - THAT MOMENT

     THE JOKER and his MEN clap hands to their ears as an EAR-
     SPLITTING ULTRASONIC SHRIEK reverberates in the tank. The 
     JOKER screams out commands, to no avail. No one can hear
     him. He falls on the controls, begins hitting buttons.

     EXT. STREET - THAT MOMENT

     The TANK TURRET swings wildly. A HEAT-SEEKING MISSILE rips 
     through the night, narrowly missing the BATWING... and 
     BLOWING A HOLE in the side of a skyscraper.

     INT. BATWING - THAT MOMENT

     THE BLAST all but knocks the BATWING out of the sky. BATMAN 
     stabilizes the plane, climbs for the clouds. When he's 
     clear of the buildings, he grits his teeth and rolls out.

     He's coming back for more!

     INT. TANK - THAT MOMENT

     The JOKER stares at a tiny BLIP on his radar screen.

                              JOKER
               He'll be back... he'll be back!!

     EXT. BROAD AVENUE - ON BATWING

     The black ultralight hurtles down Broad Avenue at full 
     speed, on a suicide mission. MISSILES streak past on either 
     side. MACHINE GUN FIRE peppers the dome of the cockpit. The 
     REAR STABILIZER WING takes a direct hit... and BURSTS INTO 
     FLAME!

     The BATWING, trailing thick black smoke, bears down on the 
     tank like a kamikaze plane. BOMB BAYS OPEN as BATMAN dumps 
     the last of his high explosives DIRECTLY INTO THE PATH OF 
     THE TANK. The BATWING takes a hard bounce off the top of 
     the tank and CRASHES TO THE STREET.

     And suddenly a GAPING CHASM opens underneath the tank as 
     the bombs go off -- and BROAD AVENUE BEGINS TO SPLIT WIDE 
     OPEN!

     INT. SUBWAY TUNNEL - THAT MOMENT

     BROKEN CONCRETE SLABS rain down on a SUBWAY CAR stalled in 
     the tunnel DIRECTLY BENEATH BROAD AVENUE. SUPPORT GIRDERS 
     groan and GIVE WAY as the STREET ITSELF COLLAPSES -- and 
     the front end of the TANK drops through, CRUSHING THE 
     SUBWAY TRAIN BENEATH IT!

     EXT. BROAD AVENUE - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT

     The rear end of the TANK projects out through the rubble. A 
     hatch pops open. The JOKER crawls out through the smoke and 
     pulls himself up to the street.

     He's down to his last three GOONS. He points to the 
     BATWING: bent, broken, WEDGED ON ITS SIDE in the asphalt 
     SEAM running up Broad Avenue -- half in, half out of the 
     tunnel.

                              JOKER
               You do him. I'm outta here.

     The GOONS look on in dismay as the JOKER scurries off. They 
     sidestep blackened debris and move up cautiously on the 
     Batwing. Through the cockpit dome they can see BATMAN... 
     inert in his harness, beaten to a pulp, all but dead.

     A JET OF FLAME drives them back momentarily. They reach for 
     their guns, move in warily... 

                              VOICE
               Yo.

     The frightened GOONS turn in unison. An abrupt flurry of 
     motion -- feet and fists flying -- quick flashes of red and 
     green --

     -- and THREE GOONS lie paralyzed on the street. The only 
     one left standing is a fifteen-year-old boy garbed in a 
     red-and-green aerialist's uniform... DICK GRAYSON.

     INT. BATWING - THAT MOMENT

     BATMAN slumps at the controls. Beneath him, asphalt SHIFTS 
     and BUCKLES. The Batwing lurches to the right, drops a foot 
     or two into the tunnel. Metal braces collapse and the 
     plexiglass dome of the cockpit SHATTERS LIKE AN EGGSHELL.

     TONGUES OF FIRE lick at his face. He's helpless, pinned in 
     place. He manages to look up -- and SEES, through a dream-
     like haze, A HAND extended toward him:

                              DICK
               HEY! COME ON!

     And suddenly DICK is clambering down into the flaming 
     wreckage. He gets an arm around BATMAN's chest and with an 
     extraordinary effort HAULS HIM OUT OF THE BATWING.

     EXT. STREET - A MOMENT LATER - NIGHT

     They stagger across the ruptured street. BATMAN grimaces in 
     agony. His right leg -- shattered -- is like rubber beneath 
     him. His ribs are crushed. He's barely conscious.

                              DICK
               Now we're even, huh? Even up.

                              BATMAN
               How did you... 

                              DICK
               I hitched. MOVE IT!

     DICK drags BATMAN to safety as the Batwing ERUPTS INTO 
     FLAME behind them.

                              BATMAN
               The Joker. Is he --?

                              DICK
               Forget it. Relax.
                     (beat)
               ... He's mine now.

     DICK snatches an abandoned .38 off the pavement.

                              BATMAN
               DICK!

     THE BATMAN tries to pull himself erect. The pain is 
     unendurable. His body has finally failed him.

     He collapses on the pavement, powerless to intervene, as 
     DICK races off with murder in his eyes.

     EXT. GOTHAM CATHEDRAL - NIGHT

     A BELLTOWER's jagged spire, jutting up into the night sky, 
     piercing the moon. Down at street level, the JOKER is 
     scrambling up the marble steps at the entrance to the old 
     abandoned cathedral. He pulls a WALKIE-TALKIE off his belt.

                              JOKER
               Gotham cathedral. Come and get me.

     HEAVY PANELED DOORS groan on tired hinges as THE JOKER 
     forces his way inside. A beat. Then DICK GRAYSON appears, 
     hot on his trail, sprinting up the steps two at a time.

     INT. CATHEDRAL - A MOMENT LATER - NIGHT

     Ancient and creepy. A huge pipe organ, shattered stained
     glass windows, row after row of mahogany pews... all 
     forgotten, covered with dust and cobwebs. The JOKER wanders 
     about, staring at the statuary, the rusted icons.

     DICK enters silently behind him. He kneels behind a rear 
     pew, brings up the gun, and squeezes off THREE QUICK SHOTS 
     at the JOKER. The JOKER dives, takes cover, and RETURNS 
     DICK'S FIRE. Then: silence.

     In a crouch, groping his way along the wall, THE JOKER 
     finds what he wants: a small door opening on a wooden 
     stairway, leading to the belltower. He ducks inside and 
     starts up.

     DICK'S GUN drops with a thud. His hand slips from the back 
     of the pew. In the second before he slumps to the floor, 
     unconscious, he sees a curious sight: a TINY BLACK NINJA 
     WHEEL, imbedded in the flesh of his leg.

     Behind him -- framed in the arched doorway -- A RAGGED 
     BLACK GHOST begins his final unholy march down the center 
     aisle of the old cathedral.

     INT. CATHEDRAL - BELLTOWER - NIGHT

     A tiny stone chamber, 8'x8', open on four sides to the 
     wind. The enormous church bell has long since been removed.

     The JOKER stands in an archway, gazing at the gargoyles on 
     the roof below. He hits a button on the walkie-talkie:

                              JOKER
               I'm in the belltower. Don't land.

     INT. HELICOPTER - MOVING - NIGHT

     A PILOT replies through his radio headset.

                              PILOT
               E.T.A. two minutes. Hang on.

     The PILOT swings the copter right in a wide, swooping arc.

     INT. STAIRWAY TO BELLTOWER - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT

     BATMAN. Broken, beaten, his right leg useless, he hauls 
     himself up the steps one at a time. He should be dead.
     Dried blood cakes his face, his chest.

     Dizzy, exhausted, his body strained to the limit, he slumps 
     against a wall to steady himself, then reaches into his 
     utility belt for a painkiller -- and forces the capsule 
     back onto his dry, swollen tongue.

     Quaking all over, he tries to draw himself erect... and 
     TOPPLES OVER, landing with his full weight on the rotten 
     wood of the belltower stairs.

     THE STAIRWAY COLLAPSES, turning to splinters beneath him. 
     And suddenly BATMAN finds himself DANGLING PRECARIOUSLY IN 
     MIDAIR, hanging by one hand to an upper step.

     It would be so much easier to let go. He looks down at the 
     fragments of the shattered stairway, STILL FALLING, 
     vanishing into the dark depths of the stairwell.

     Then he looks up. At the trapdoor. A mere six feet away. 
     His TEETH CLENCH in a monstrous grimace. AND WITH AN 
     INHUMAN EFFORT, HE HOISTS HIMSELF UP ONTO THE UPPER STEPS.

     For a full five seconds he's blind with pain. A RAGGED 
     WOODEN SHAFT is buried in his right shoulder. Twitching, 
     trembling, he reaches up and YANKS IT OUT with his last 
     ounce of strength.

     The trapdoor is a foot above his head. It could be a mile. 
     BATMAN finally realizes he's not going to make it.

     He reaches down and rips open a Velcro seal on his utility 
     belt, revealing the strange TIMER DEVICE we saw him making 
     earlier. Before he can activate it his hand falls limply at 
     his side.

     THE BATMAN is out like a light.

     INT. BELLTOWER - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT

     The JOKER glances casually down at the trapdoor, wondering 
     what all the noise is about. He draws his gun, moves 
     cautiously to the trapdoor, and lifts it a few inches... 
     just enough to see the unconscious form on the stairs.

                              JOKER
               ... Batman?

     No reply. The JOKER stands there and lets out a little 
     snicker. He looks out through the archway, sees no sign of 
     his rescue copter. Then -- a look of curious amusement on 
     his face -- he steps down THROUGH THE TRAPDOOR and LUGS 
     BATMAN up into the belltower.

     He props BATMAN up against a wall. Still no sign of life. 
     The JOKER crouches beside him and -- almost tenderly -- 
     pats his face.

                              JOKER (cont.)
               Batman? Batman?

     THE BATMAN's lips part. But he's too weak to speak.

                              JOKER (cont.)
               I thought you'd be more comfortable
               here in the belfry.
                     (chuckling to himself)
               Before I kill you I'd like to see
               who you are. Would that be okay?

     BATMAN emits a tiny low moan. The JOKER takes it as a yes 
     and reaches over to undo his cowl.

     BRUCE WAYNE stares up with dulled, sightless eyes. The 
     JOKER reaches into his pocket for a purple handkerchief, 
     moistens it, dabs at the caked blood on BRUCE's face.

                              JOKER (cont.)
               Oh my, aren't we pretty.
                     (brightening suddenly)
               I know you! You're the rich boy!!

     The JOKER is enormously tickled by this discovery. He claps 
     his hands together in sheer glee.

                              JOKER (cont.)
               My goodness, what in the world made
               you do it? It must've been
               something pretty terrible!

     He's practically dancing now. He's made a friend.

                              JOKER (cont.)
               You know, we should've sat down and
               had us a little heart-to-heart. I
               bet we would have got on famously.

                              BATMAN
               Mad... man... 

                              JOKER
               Well now, you're not exactly the
               picture of mental health, are you.

                              BATMAN
               ... Murderer... 

                              JOKER
               Bruce, we're both murderers. Think
               how many people you've killed by
               letting me live.

     A SPOTLIGHT cuts through the night sky. The JOKER hears his 
     helicopter approaching in the distance.

     BRUCE reaches down furtively. Finds the timer on his 
     utility belt. FLICKS A SWITCH... and the countdown begins.

     The JOKER pulls a straight razor from his pocket and opens 
     it gingerly.

                              JOKER (cont.)
               I have to do it now, Bruce, but it
               won't even hurt. Now relax. The
               bat's in his belfry, all's right
               with the world... 

     He has the razor almost up to BRUCE's throat when BRUCE 
     reaches out and GRABS HIS LAPELS in a death grip. The JOKER 
     is momentarily amused by this seeming display of affection.

                              JOKER (cont.)
               Why, Bruce... 

     Then he hears ticking.

     Looks down at the flashing digital display on BRUCE's belt. 
     0:26 seconds. 0:25 seconds.

     He SHRIEKS HORRIFICALLY and DROPS THE RAZOR.

     BRUCE won't let go of him. Finally he manages to lurch 
     convulsively away, sprawling on the floor of the belfry.

     BRUCE is wearing a great big Joker smile.

                              JOKER (cont.)
               IT'S NOT FUNNY!!!

                              BRUCE
               No... sense... of humor?

     The JOKER reaches out for the ticking time bomb. Thinks 
     better of it and retracts his shaking hand.

     He can see the copter approaching now, slicing through the 
     clouds. He screams, waves a flashlight in the air: his 
     signal beacon. 0:20 and counting.

     The JOKER scans the belltower frantically. His eyes fall on 
     the trapdoor. He races over, flings it open, starts down 
     the stairs in a frenzy.

     There are no stairs. They've collapsed. 0:16 and 
     counting.

     Screaming insanely, the JOKER vaults through the door and 
     makes for the open stone archway. The copter is directly 
     overhead now. A rope ladder drops from its belly.

     EXT. BELLTOWER - THAT MOMENT

     The helicopter descends, its whirling blades stirring up a 
     windstorm on the roof of the old abandoned cathedral. DEAD 
     LEAVES rise and swirl in the churning air.

     INT. BELLTOWER

     The JOKER makes a futile grab at the rope ladder, almost 
     losing his purchase on the archway parapet. He gestures 
     wildly for the copter to make another pass. 0:12 to go.

     EXT. BELLTOWER

     A maelstrom of swirling leaves. And now, among the leaves 
     -- roused from their resting place in the rotten rafters of 
     the old cathedral --

     -- A HORDE OF SQUEALING, CHITTERING BATS!! Filling the air 
     like a black cloud, HUNDREDS OF THEM, taking flight in
     blind uncomprehending fury --

     INT. BELLTOWER

     The JOKER leaps into empty space, grabs hold of the ladder, 
     cackles in mad triumph --

     -- AND SUDDENLY THE BELLTOWER IS FULL OF BATS. A SCREECHING 
     SWARM, HIDEOUS, BLACK-WINGED -- SWOOPING THROUGH THE 
     ARCHWAYS DIRECTLY AT THE JOKER --

     -- WHO SCREAMS IN TERROR -- LETS GO OF THE LADDER --

     -- and plunges into the night.

     TIGHT ON BATMAN. Six seconds remain. There is still time if 
     he makes his choice now.

     Surrounded by the flapping of leathery wings, his body 
     working on pure adrenalin, he unbuckles the belt. Lurches 
     into position. Heaves it out into the darkness.

     It snags on the bottom rung of the dangling rope ladder.

     INT. HELICOPTER - POV CO-PILOT

     The CO-PILOT is hanging out one side of the copter, just 
     enough to see what's going on.

                              CO-PILOT
               PULL UP!! PULL --

     EXT. CHURCHYARD - OVERHEAD ANGLE

     It's as if time has stopped. The world has grown suddenly 
     silent. We're looking down at the JOKER, whose body lies 
     splayed and broken on the flagstone surface of the 
     churchyard. Slowly, elegantly -- we have all the time in 
     the world, now -- we DRIFT DOWNWARD, closer, until his FACE 
     FILLS THE SCREEN, the familiar chilling grin still intact.

     Sad clown, A-one crazy boy, staring aimlessly at the stars. 
     Suddenly his face is bathed in a brilliant gasoline GLOW.

     POV JOKER

     Looking up he sees a beautiful display of fireworks, 
     bursting and burning, spirals of color snaking through the 
     sky as the helicopter explodes in eerie silence.

     REVERSE ANGLE - THE JOKER'S FACE

     It's all so lovely. The JOKER's expression is happy, almost 
     childlike, as he gazes up at this private show. Gradually, 
     though, the bright colors fade; and the JOKER's face begins 
     to relax, the twisted grin dissolving at last as darkness 
     sets in.

                                               FADE THROUGH TO:

     INT. TELEVISION STUDIO - NIGHT

     AN ANCHORWOMAN delivering an oncamera EDITORIAL.

                              ANCHORWOMAN
               As the details of the Joker's
               heinous plan become known, a city's
               gratitude goes out to the mysterious
               Batman. His whereabouts remain
               unknown, but Batman -- if you're
               alive -- if you're listening --
               thank you.

     EXT. CEMETERY - DAY

     VICKI at a fresh gravesite. She places a FLORAL ARRANGEMENT 
     in the urn at the head of the grave; stands back to examine 
     it; then bends once more to reposition the drooping 
     flowers.

                              VICKI
               I loved you too.

     As soon as the words come out, she begins to CRY. Then she 
     gets hold of herself; rises; turns up her collar; and goes.

     The headstone reads: "ALEXANDER KNOX, 1956-1987."

     INT. WAYNE MANOR - STUDY - DAY

     ALFRED, in his apron, on the phone.

                              ALFRED
               No, Mr. Wayne is in Thailand. I'm
               afraid he's quite unreachable.

     INT. WAYNE MANOR - DAY

     The glass-enclosed room which houses BRUCE's Olympic-sized 
     SWIMMING POOL. Outside, snow is falling.

     In the pool, on an inflatable rubber raft, is BRUCE WAYNE. 
     Beside him, waist-deep is the water, is VICKI -- helping 
     him rehabilitate his leg and shoulder.

                              VICKI
               I don't know why I'm doing this. I
               half wish you'd stay a cripple.

                              BRUCE
               Ohhhh... you don't mean that.

                              VICKI
                     (grasping for words)
               I don't, but... I do. It's just... I
               love you, Bruce. I --

                              BRUCE
                     (taking her hand)
               Vicki. Do you love half of me? Or
               all of me?

     A hard question for VICKI to answer. She thinks it over for 
     several beats, then SMILES... SLOWLY, SADLY.

                              VICKI
               I guess you did it, didn't you. You
               saved everyone.
                     (pause)
               Almost.

     For a moment he stares deeply into her eyes. Then he pulls 
     her over, takes her in a tight embrace.

                              BRUCE
               I don't know how to explain this so
               it makes sense... but you saved
               me.

     INT. BATCAVE - THAT MOMENT - DAY

     DICK GRAYSON stands at the brink of the bottomless pit and 
     looks up at the GYMNAST'S RINGS suspended overhead. He sets 
     his jaw and then -- with only a moment's hesitation -- 
     LEAPS INTO THE VOID.

     His hands find the rings. He launches himself HIGH INTO THE 
     AIR and does a spectacular TRIPLE SOMERSAULT, catching the 
     rings on his way down.

     Exhilarated, he makes a perfect landing on the edge of the 
     pit. 10-point-0. A SMILE OF PLEASURE comes to his lips.

     EXT. GOTHAM SQUARE - DUSK

     It's finally happened.  Hell's frozen over.

     Christmas is two weeks off, arid SNOW is falling in Gotham.
     Beneath its pristine white blanket, the city looks
     uncharacteristically serene -- almost inviting.  Peace has
     been miraculously restored: strangers wave hello.  Salvation
     Army Santas ring their bells on streetcorners.  And now, as
     night falls, an ILLUMINATED SIGN winks on above Broad Avenue:
     "JOYEUX NOEL GOTHAM -- Only 16 Shopping Days Left Till
     Christmas."

     The streets are bustling with jolly shoppers.  At a souvenir
     store, we find an exasperated MOM squabbling with her seven-
     year old.  Like many other storefronts in Gotham, this one is
     overflowing with bootleg BATMAN MERCHANDISE: t-shirts, key
     chains, ceramic figurines.  The kid is already wearing a
     Batman baseball cap and a little black cape, but he obviously
     wants more.

     Mom drags him off past another store window, this one full of
     SCRAP METAL, with a sign reading "AUTHENTIC FRAGMENTS OF THE
     BATWING -- $19.95 and up."  A PANHANDLER is perched at the
     entrance.  Beneath his array jacket is a grubby sweatshirt
     with the familiar yellow-and-black logo.  In Gotham this
     winter, Batmania is everywhere...

     EXT. GOTHAM SQUARE - LATER THAT NIGHT

     Two hours later, the SNOWSTORM's grown into a full-fledged
     blizzard.  The drifts are two feet deep and the streets are
     all but empty of cars.  A massive SNOW PLOW the size of a
     Panzer tank rumbles past, FILLING THE FRAME...

     ...and revealing, as it passes, a group of CAROLERS, all
     bundled up in mufflers and parkas.  Unbothered by the weather,
     they walk the street singing, spreading cheer and goodwill to
     the few passersby.

     They've just gone into a lovely a capella rendition of "Silent
     Night" when an oversized DELIVERY TRUCK, outfitted with snow
     chains, clanks slowly past in the wake of the plow.  Its sides
     are decorated with cartoon igloos advertising a popular ice
     cream snack -- POLAR BARS -- oddly inappropriate for this time
     of year.

     A streetcorner SANTA, with bell and bucket, WAVES at the truck
     as it rounds a corner.  The CAROLERS carol.  Then --

     -- a VIOLENT EXPLOSION rocks the street -- followed by the
     sound of AUTOMATIC GUNFIRE and a high, wailing SECURITY ALARM.

     EXT. SCHRACH AND CO. - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT

     Around the corner there's CARNAGE on the streets.  The windows
     have blown out of Gotham's leading jewelry store.  Gut-shot
     SECURITY GUARDS stagger and go face down in the snow as
     ROBBERS, dressed in white camouflage gear, clamber out through
     the shattered glass with SACKFULS OF LOOT.

     CAROLERS spill around the corner to see what's going on, but a
     spray of GUNFIRE sends them scattering in panic.  The POLAR
     BAR truck pulls even with the jewelry store, and as it does...

     The REAR DOORS open.  A RAMP slides down from the back of the
     truck.  The ROBBERS scramble aboard, and mere seconds later
     SLIDE out AGAIN -- riding atop five SKIDOO SNOWMOBILES.

     SIRENS HOWL.  A POLICE CAR appears, taking the corner just a
     trifle too fast -- FISHTAILING on the icy street and plowing
     into a drift.

     INT. SQUAD CAR - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT

     The COPS gun the engine, but their wheels are spinning in the
     snow -- no traction.  They're about to climb out and give
     chase on foot when, through the windshield, they see the
     Salvation Army SANTA...

     ...HOISTING AN AK-47 AND FIRING DIRECTLY AT THEM.  The
     windshield disintegrates and the COPS sink from view as SANTA
     races off to the last of the snowmobiles, which is already
     burdened with LOOT.

     EXT. STREET - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT

     MORE SQUAD CARS converge on the jewelry store -- but it's
     difficult to carry on a high-speed pursuit when the snow's a
     foot deep and the best you can do is 6 MPH.  The COP CARS skid
     to a halt, blocked by the rumbling SNOWPLOW.  By now, of
     course, the LOOTERS are gone -- scooting off on either side of
     the plow, sticking to the snowy sidewalks.

     EXT. STREETS - A MOMENT LATER - NIGHT

     SNOWMOBILES glide across the sidewalks, sending the few hardy
     souls who are out on the streets DIVING FOR COVER.  A couple
     of DERELICTS are cowering behind a fire hydrant, trying to
     avoid getting run over.  Every time they poke their heads out,
     another SKIDOO whizzes past, missing them by inches.

     The ROBBERS fan out in various directions.  These guys are
     obviously going to get away clean -- unless...

     The DERELICT points up at the night sky, where a BEACON is
     blazing in the darkness -- THE BLACK SILHOUETTE OF A BAT...

     INT. POLICE CAR - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT

     MORE SIRENS.  A COP takes a radio call as he streaks down the
     long wide avenue which borders Gotham Park -- one of the few
     streets which is relatively clear.  The COP at the wheel goes
     wide-eyed and nudges his partner in disbelief.

     Before their eyes, FIVE SNOWMOBILES appear from the cross
     streets up ahead and CONVERGE at the entrance to Gotham Park.
     Bringing up the rear is SANTA CLAUS.

                               COP
               What the hell -- ?

     EXT. ENTRANCE TO PARK - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT

     BRAKES SQUEAL.  Several squad cars are now massed at the
     entrance to the park -- but there's one problem.  The city's
     snow plows don't operate on the park roads -- and the entrance
     is blocked off with SAWHORSES reading "CLOSED TO TRAFFIC."  A
     huge steep drift prevents them from entering -- and so all
     they can do is stand by helplessly, WATCHING as the
     snowmobiles vanish into the trees.

     The COPS race about like headless chickens, trying to concoct
     a plan.  A couple of them are trying to scale the stone walls
     of the park.  Another is at his car, barking into a radio
     mike:

                               COP WITH MIKE
               Yeah, you heard me.  Snowmobiles!
                    (pause)
               So what do we do?  Chase 'em on foot??

     ALL EYES TURN at the blare of a horn.  The COPS peer down the
     long corridor of the cross street -- and see a STRANGE BLACK
     VEHICLE barreling toward them at 90 MPH, with no intention of
     stopping...

     THE BATMOBILE!!  COPS dive left and right.  A split-second
     later...

     ...a FORTY-FOOT JET of NOVA-INTENSITY FLAME erupts from the
     front of the jet-black supercar -- instantaneously DISSOLVING
     the drift that blocks the entrance to the park -- turning the
     ice and snow on the paths before it into water!

     The BATMOBILE screams past in the wink of an eye.  The COPS
     get to their feet; cold as it is, they're sweating.  One of
     them mops his brow and announces, dumfounded:

                               COP I
               ...That was Batman.

                               COP II
               NO SHIT!!

     COP II yanks COP I into the nearest squad car, and the others
     follow suit.  ENGINES REV.  As long as the BATMOBILE's cleared
     a path, they might as well join in the chase...

     EXT. BRIDLE PATH - THAT MOMENT

     TWO BURLY TEENAGERS -- both dressed in RED BERETS and PARKAS
     with BLACK BATMAN SWEATSHIRTS visible underneath -- are
     trudging along the path when they're STARTLED by a pair of
     speeding SKIDOOS.  Moments later, they spot a RED GLOW on the
     horizon...

     ...and their JAWS DROP as the BATMOBILE roars into view,
     BURNING OFF THE SNOW IN ITS PATH.  Thrilled beyond words, they
     WHOOP WITH GLEE, slapping high-fives as the car streaks past.

     INT. BATMOBILE - ON BATMAN - THAT MOMENT

     His face is weirdly illuminated by the flame still spitting
     from the front of the car.  Cool as ever -- approaching the
     chase as a simple problem in logic -- he checks a radar
     display on his dashboard and sees FIVE BLIPS.

     EXT. PARK - ON SQUAD CARS - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT

     The cops follow along in BATMAN's path.  The lead car LOSES
     CONTROL and plows headlong into a drift.  The DRIVER jams the
     pedal, but his rear wheels end up digging a deep rut in the
     ice.  He sits there cursing, pumping the accelerator as other
     COPS race past him on foot.

     INT. BATMOBILE - ON BATMAN

     The various ROBBERS have spread out, their vehicles BOUNDING
     over the hilly terrain of the park.  He spots two of them up
     ahead; as he draws closer, they PART WAYS, veering off to the
     left and right...

     ANGLE ON BATMOBILE - MOVING

     PODS OPEN on the front fenders, and MISSILE LAUNCHERS rotate
     into place.  The Batmobile fires a pair of HEAT-SEEKING
     TORPEDOS, which BURROW into the snow on either side and
     disappear.

     ANGLE ON LEFT SNOWMOBILE - MOVING

     The DRIVER looks back over his shoulder and sees what appears
     to be a BLACK SHARK FIN plowing through the snow behind him,
     GAINING FAST.  He takes evasive action, but the SHARK FIN
     always seems to follow.  Just as he approaches the crest of a
     hill...

     ...the TORPEDO slams into the rear of the SNOWMOBILE.  The
     force of impact knocks the ROBBER cleanly off.  His LOOT lands
     in the snow beside him, but the SNOWMOBILE keeps going --
     sailing over the crest of the hill and striking the rocks
     beyond with a deafening EXPLOSION.

     ANGLE ON RIGHT SNOWMOBILE - MOVING

     This ROBBER's a little smarter than his buddy.  When he sees
     the shark fin on his tail, he noses his snowmobile off into a
     GROVE OF TREES.  The trees are too closely spaced for the
     torpedo to maneuver; it strikes the nearest tree trunk and
     explodes harmlessly.

     The ROBBER is feeling good about himself, because the
     Batmobile can't follow either.  But BATMAN has a Plan B.  As
     he drives alongside the grove, he HITS THE ACCELERATOR,
     passing the snowmobile on its left.  A STEEL SPIKE attached to
     a cable launches from the side of the Batmobile and WEDGES
     ITSELF into a distant TREE.

     The cable goes taut, and the tree TOPPLES -- directly into the
     path of the second SNOWMOBILE.  The vehicle crashes into the
     trunk, and the hapless ROBBER goes cartwheeling head-over-
     heels into a drift.

     In the distance, COPS appear -- racing to the scene on foot,
     ready for mop-up duty.  BATMAN kills the flamethrower, hits
     the brakes, and FISHTAILS, doing a quick 180 on the snow.
     He's just spotted fresh quarry: snowmobiles three and four,
     whizzing over a rolling white pasture in the distance.

     EXT. PARK - THAT MOMENT

     We're at a makeshift CAMPSITE -- where a cluster of HOMELESS
     PEOPLE are burning refuse in a garbage can to keep warm.  They
     look on in puzzlement as the two SNOWMOBILES whiz past and
     disappear over a crest of a hill...

     EXT. LAKEFRONT - ON SNOWMOBILES #3 AND #4

     They bounce down the hillside and SKID -- arriving at the edge
     of a frozen-over LAKE.  With the roar of the Batmobile behind
     them, the two DRIVERS get the same idea simultaneously.
     Smiling, they rev their engines and set out over the surface
     of the lake.

     Now the Batmobile crests the ridge.  The car's weight tips
     suddenly and it begins to skid down the hill toward the lake.
     BATMAN sees what's happening and kills the flamethrower just
     in time -- but he can't brake the car on the snowy slope.  The
     prow of the Batmobile slides out onto the edge of the lake --

     -- and under its weight, the ICE begins to crack.  The left
     front tire takes a sudden dip -- and worse yet, the car is
     sliding forward.

     INT. BATMOBILE - ON BATMAN

     He shifts frantically from drive to reverse, trying to rock
     the car out of its predicament, but his rear wheels find no
     purchase.  He can hear the ice cracking beneath him.
     Grimacing, he throws a switch on the dashboard --

     EXT. LAKE - ON BATMOBILE

     -- and the trunk pops open.  An industrial-strength GRAPPLING
     HOOK shoots upward and digs in at a point beyond the crest of
     the hill; and a concealed WINCH ASSEMBLY begins to grind away,
     hauling the Batmobile uphill, out of danger.

     INT. BATMOBILE - ON BATMAN

     Suspended just above the icy lake, he sees the SNOWMOBILE
     vanishing into the distance.  He opens (yet another) panel on
     the dashboard...

     EXT. LAKE - ON SNOWMOBILES #3 AND #4

     The ROBBERS give each other a big thumbs-up.  They're almost
     halfway across the lake now and the Batmobile is disabled.
     All at once they hear a strange WHISTLING overhead...

     Fireworks?  No, it's a THERMITE BOMB -- rocketing past them,
     hitting the ice some forty feet ahead and EXPLODING GAUDILY.
     JAGGED CHUNKS OF ICE break free and SHIFT in the frigid water
     -- and the ROBBERS are skidding into the drink before they
     know what's hit them.

     ANGLE ON SNOWMOBILE #5 - MOVING

     The last of the robbers is SANTA CLAUS -- his big sack filled
     not with toys, but precious stones.  He approaches the edge of
     the park, negotiating his way through a maze of rocky
     outcroppings.  He squirts out from behind a boulder into a
     clearing...

     ...and GASPS in PANIC as a SEARING BURST OF FLAME erupts
     behind him.  The BATMOBILE speeds out from the other side of
     the boulder; SANTA twists his accelerator, desperately trying
     to build up speed.

     As it is, he's barely managing to stay ahead of the
     flamethrower.  But the jet of flame suddenly DIES; the HOOD of
     the Batmobile rises half a foot --

     -- and TWIN PROJECTILES launch into the air.  A heavy NET is
     strung between them -- and it lands SMACK ON TOP OF SANTA
     CLAUS, entangling the snowmobile and stopping him in his
     tracks.

     Immobilized, he watches through the net in horror as the
     Batmobile barrels down.  When the great black machine is
     almost atop him --

     -- it stops on a dime six inches from his heavily-padded
     frame.

     EXT. ENTRANCE TO PARK - A MINUTE LATER - NIGHT

     The COPS are spread out near the entrance.  They've rounded up
     the other ROBBERS and returned most of the loot.  They hear a
     dull ROAR in the distance...

     ...and a few seconds later the BATMOBILE streaks into view,
     dragging the NET behind it -- SANTA, his loot, and his
     snowmobile, all tied up in one tidy parcel.

     At the entrance to the park, the NET detaches itself from the
     Batmobile, dumping SANTA into the hands of the waiting COPS.
     Without stopping, the BATMOBILE roars out of the park and
     vanishes whence it came.  A mildly-humiliated COP turns to his
     colleague and SHRUGS:

                               COP I
               ...Merry Christmas.

     The second COP points to SANTA, still struggling in the net.

                               COP II
               Gift-wrapped and everything.

                                                       DISSOLVE TO:

     EXT. CITY HALL - DAY

     TV MINICAM CREWS are camped out on the steps of City Hall,
     with a sizable crowd watching from the street.  COMMISSIONER
     GORDON is reading from a prepared statement.

                               GORDON
               After a high-speed chase -- over $750,000
               in precious jewels were recovered intact
               by the police force -- working in concert
               with Batman.

     At the sound of Batman's name, a CHANTING goes up in the
     crowd:

                               VOICES IN CROWD
               TAKE BACK THE STREETS!  TAKE BACK THE
               STREETS!  TAKE BACK THE --

     GORDON winces and lets out a sigh.  The CHANTERS are a group
     of pugnacious, well-muscled KIDS, late teens and early
     twenties, all dressed in identical garb: black Batman
     SWEATSHIRTS and little red Guardian-angel BERETS.  They're
     obviously members of the same club -- just like the guys we
     saw in the park.

     GORDON waits for them to shut up, but they don't; so he grabs
     the mike and speaks slowly and distinctly, trying to be heard
     over the din.

                               GORDON
               I would like to stress -- that while this
               city enjoys a special relationship with
               Batman --
                    (louder)
               -- we do not condone vigilantism --
                    (practically screaming)
               -- IN ANY FORM.

     It's no use.  He's totally drowned out by the RED BERETS, who
     continue to shout and shake their fists.  Giving up, he
     returns the mike to a REPORTER and marches up the steps in a
     huff.  The RED BERETS CHEER.

                                                            CUT TO:

     INSERT - TELEVISION SCREEN

     The evening news: a live, on-the-spot interview from Gotham
     Square.  A superimposed GRAPHIC identifies a surly kid in a
     RED BERET as "MIKE SEKOWSKY -- SPOKESPERSON -- ORDER OF THE
     BAT."

                               SEKOWSKY
               And hey!  Where does this --
                    (BLEEP; expletive deleted)
               -- Gordon get off calling us ?
               We're not breakin' any laws.  We're a
               group of concerned citizens, that's all --
               just like Batman.

 WOMAN IN CROWD                You people are nothing but hoodlums!

 SEKOWSKY                Hey, lady -- we're out here on patrol
               riskin' our necks to protect old biddies
               like you.
                    (into mike)
               If this lame-o Gordon could do his job --

     MORE CATCALLS from the crowd.  The picture jumps suddenly as a
     minicam is jostled; some sort of SCUFFLE appears to be
     breaking out.  Before it does, CAMERA PULLS BACK from the TV
     screen, placing us in:

     INT. WAYNE MANOR - KITCHEN - NIGHT

     where ALFRED THE BUTLER is watching the Sekowsky interview
     with extreme dismay.  As he trims the crusts from a pair of
     hearty watercress sandwiches, he SLICES HIS FINGER OPEN.

     ALFRED makes a pained face -- it's all Sekowsky's fault.
     Onscreen, the fracas continues; SEKOWSKY has recommandeered
     the mike...

                               SEKOWSKY (on TV)
               We're provin' that the spirit of Batman is
               alive in this city.  We're gonna take back
               the streets!

     SEKOWSKY raises a fist.  Behind him, his CRONIES begin to
     chant: "TAKE BACK THE STREETS!  TAKE BACK THE STREETS!"
     Incensed, sucking on his finger, ALFRED moves to the TV and
     flicks it off.

     He turns on the radio in search of something more soothing.
     "Good King Wenceslas" pipes through the manor; smiling, ALFRED
     sets the sandwich plate alongside a steaming kettle on a
     Sterling silver tea service.

     INT. BRUCE'S LIBRARY - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT

     The CAROL CONTINUES UNDERNEATH as ALFRED, white linen draped
     over one forearm, sets the tea tray down on his master's big
     mahogany desk.  He digs in his pocket for a key and unlocks a
     side drawer.

     The drawer contains a stack of yellowed, aging NEWPAPER
     CLIPPINGS -- among them one which reads "THOMAS WAYNE
     MURDERED: Prominent Doctor, Wife Slain in Robbery.
     Unidentified Gunman Leaves Child Unharmed."  ALFRED digs
     around beneath the clippings and finds a concealed SWITCH at
     the rear of the drawer.

     Gears grind, and a sectional bookcase detaches itself from the
     wall -- sliding out a couple of feet to reveal a STONE
     STAIRWAY which descends into darkness...

     INT. BATCAVE - A MOMENT LATER - NIGHT

     Descending the stone stairs, ALFRED arrives in the Batcave.
     "Good King Wenceslas" is on the speakers down here as well.
     Across a catwalk the BATMOBILE rests on its little plateau,
     wrapped in a tarp.

     ALFRED clears some space on a lab table and sets the tea
     service down.  He glances up at the bank of video monitors and
     sees SEKOWSKY, still babbling, on several channels
     simultaneously.  He scans the cave, but there's no trace of
 BRUCE. 
 ALFRED                Sir?  -- MASTER BRUCE??

     As if in response, BATS screech and flutter in the distant
     recesses of the cavern.  ALFRED turns suddenly and sees BRUCE
     behind him, suspended from a thin filament wire, RISING OUT OF
 A BOTTOMLESS ABYSS. 
 BRUCE                I'm not deaf, Alfred.  I hear you.

     He's wearing his civvie -- tweed pants and cashmere sweater --
     but he's got the utility belt, with its spring-action reel,
     buckled about his waist.  Clutching a bundle, he hangs in
     midair for a moment, dangling over the void.  ALFRED slowly
     regains his composure:

 ALFRED                I took the liberty of preparing tea.
                    (indicating tbe monitors)
               I take it you've been watching the news?

     BRUCE, still dangling, glances up at the SEKOWSKY interview
     and nods.

 BRUCE                Yeah...lot of crazy people in this world.

     BRUCE rocks back and forth to build up momentum.  He kicks off
     on the nearest stone outcropping, lands gracefully on the
     Batcave floor, and unbuckles his belt.  Preoccupied, he drops
     his mysterious bundle on the lab table: a roll of black
     fabric, and a cluster of lightweight, hollow ALUMINUM RODS,
     connected by what appears to be SURGICAL TUBING.

 ALFRED                I should inform you...Christmas is
               approaching, and we've received our annual
               solicitation from the Fireman's Toy Fund.
                    (eyeing the equipment)
               If I may inquire...?

 BRUCE                Oh, yeah.  Watch this.

     BRUCE hits a trigger on a tiny gas canister attached to the
     tubing.  The tubing inflates and the rods spring erect --
     stiffening, wing-like, into something which looks remarkably
     like the skeleton of an umbrella.

 ALFRED                Most ingenious, sir.  What exactly it? BRUCE What does it look like? ALFRED To the untrained eye, sir, it looks remarkably like...the skeleton of an umbrella. Sounds good. BRUCE eyes his new invention, thinks it over, smiles slyly. BRUCE Good guess, Alfred. That's exactly right. BRUCE hits the trigger, and the rods WILT with a hiss. He sits at his lab table; ALFRED unfolds a napkin on his lap, pours a cup of tea. ALFRED Splendid, sir, and if I may say, I'm glad you're putting your time to such productive use. (beat) Now -- the Toy Fund. Our contribution last year was a half-million dollars... BRUCE We can do better than that. ALFRED Then there's the foster-parents program... the Gotham homeless crusade... BRUCE nods abstractedly and tucks into his sandwich. He seems oddly preoccupied -- not exactly melancholy, but his thoughts are obviously a million miles away. ALFRED looks on, concerned: ALFRED (cont.) Is something troubling you, sir? BRUCE Yeah...the holidays, I guess. Always gets me thinking about... (he changes the subject) And to tell you the truth, I'm a little -- concerned about Vicki. ALFRED (anxiously) Miss Vale, sir...? BRUCE Yeah. I've been thinking about it lately. Thinking about it a lot... (gravely; shaking his head) ...and I still can't figure out what to get her for Christmas. BRUCE shoots ALFRED a solemn, perplexed look -- and ALFRED heaves an audible sigh of relief as we CUT TO: INT. PRISON CELL - DAY TIGHT ON a stack of COOPS and CAGES, piled high against a bare concrete wall. Each cage -- and there are at least two dozen of them -- contains a twittering BIRD: starlings, pigeons, cardinals, titwillows... CAMERA PULLS BACK from the bars of the cages to reveal a VERY ODD FIGURE in prison greys. A CANARY, perched on his shoulder, SINGS HAPPILY as he stands in front of a grimy, cracked mirror, plastering back his hair, BUFFING HIS NAILS with quick, birdlike strokes. MR. BONIFACE is beak-nosed, epicene, and so fat that it seems his skin should burst; the adjective that comes to mind is "obscene." Despite his eccentric appearance, he comports himself with overblown, theatrical dignity. Fastidious and preening, he does not suffer insults lightly. CAMERA PULLS BACK FURTHER -- through another set of bars -- and we realize that MR. BONIFACE is himself caged. A PRISON GUARD arrives to slide back his cell door... GUARD Up and at 'em, Pengy. -- Pengy? MR. BONIFACE pointedly ignores the GUARD, refusing to acknowledge the odious (if wholly appropriate) nickname. GUARD (cont.) Boniface... MR. BONIFACE finally turns. With an expression of extreme distaste, he affixes a MONOCLE over one eye, returns the canary to its cage and allows himself to be ushered out. INT. WARDEN'S OFFICE - DAY MR. BONIFACE and his ATTORNEY sit at a long table across from the WARDEN and the members of the PAROLE BOARD. PAROLE OFFICER You want to return the money you stole. BONIFACE Intact. The map will show you where it's buried. The PAROLE OFFICER stares skeptically at a hand-scrawled MAP. PAROLE OFFICER All of it. Forty-two million dollars. MR. BONIFACE stares down humbly at the table -- as if he finds the mere mention of his transgression too embarrassing to bear. PAROLE OFFICER II Why this sudden change of heart? MR. BONIFACE Gentlemen, I want my debt to be repaid in full. I want to be a part of civilized society! (oozing sincerity) Prison life is not for me. The guilt, the fear, the constant shame...one meets a disturbingly low class of people. PAROLE OFFICER II Sure, but -- forty-two million dollars?? MR. BONIFACE nods plaintively. It's quite a perfomlance. He dabs at his face with a handkerchief; it's hot in here, and he's the delicate type... WARDEN His record's clean. Thirteen years without an incident. ATTORNEY I'd like to point out, my client's put his time to good use. A student of ornithology...articles published in several respected journals... The PAROLE OFFICER thumbs through a stack of magazines: Bird World, Ornithological Review, Beaks And Feathers, Nest Egg. MR. BONIFACE Birds, yes. My only source of solace. PAROLE OFFICER In light of this rather extraordinary gesture, I see no reason not to endorse your application for parole. BONIFACE Thank you, sir. You won't regret it. MR. BONIFACE shakes hands with the members of the PAROLE BOARD. As the GUARDS escort him out, a BLACK MYNAH BIRD SQUAWKS LOUDLY from its cage in the corner of the office: MYNAH CRIME DOES NOT PAY. AAWWK!! CRIME DOES NOT PAY. CHUCKLES all around. On his way out the ATTORNEY gestures toward the mynah -- and BEAMS at the parole board: ATTORNEY Personally trained by my client. INT. PRISON CELL - DAY Free time -- the cell doors are open and the convicts are milling around in the common area. T-BONE, 220 lbs. of dumb, hulking beef, saunters up to his cell and finds his bunkmate, MR. BONIFACE, staring at a stack of EMPTY CAGES. BONIFACE whirls on him suddenly, his face beet-red, APOPLECTIC WITH RAGE: MR. BONIFACE -- Where are my birds?!? T-BONE Shit, Pengy. I let 'em go. MR. BONIFACE Hermione. My canary. It's the dead of winter! T-BONE flops casually on his bunk, obviously enjoying MR. BONIFACE's profound distress. T-BONE They were all cooped up. With you leaving and all -- seemed like the humane thing to do. BONIFACE'S GAZE FALLS on a corner of the cell. He spots a scattering of YELLOW FEATHERS -- a patch of FRESH BLOOD. With a supreme effort of restraint, he turns and forces a smile... MR. BONIFACE I see. -- You might as well have this. I won't be needing it... He tosses a SONY WALKMAN to T-BONE, who flicks it on. The dim strains of CLASSICAL MUSIC are audible through the earphones... T-BONE Well, thanks, Pengy. No hard feelings. (chuckling to himself) Y'know, I'm gonna miss that pudgy little ass of yours. T-BONE tunes the Walkman to a rock station, slips the headset on, grins from his bunk. TWO GUARDS arrive. As they escort him out, MR. BONIFACE mutters: MR. BONIFACE You won't miss it long. EXT. PRISON - MAIN ENTRANCE - DAY It's fifteen degrees outside as MR. BONIFACE -- aka THE PENGUIN -- waddles forth from the prison gates, regally attired in cutaway and pin-stripes. He pauses to inhale a deep lungful of the icy air; then, with a smile of exhilaration, he removes his coat and STRETCHES -- spreading his wings, REVELING in the cold. A STRETCH LIMO pulls up. Two identically gaunt and vulture- like DANDIES, formally dressed, with bowler hats and umbrellas, step out to meet him. These two gentlemen -- FRICK and FRACK -- serve as the Penguin's general factoti and "business managers." FRICK Welcome back, Mr. Boniface. PENGUIN Mr. Frick. Mr. Frack. Our years of planning are about to pay off. INT. LIMO - MOVING - DAY Now that he's loose, the PENGUIN's rapacious side is beginning to show. His eyes twinkle with greed as he contemplates his own ingenuity. PENGUIN I take it they found the money all right? FRACK We buried it exactly as you specified. $42,271,009... PENGUIN How much have we got left? FRICK reaches into his coat for a BALANCE SHEET. FRICK Let's see -- an initial capitalization of 42 million and change, compounded over thirteen years, at an annual return of just under sixteen percent -- PENGUIN Fine, fine. How much? FRICK Seventy-nine million. -- Excluding the sum we buried. THE PENGUIN lets out a dry, heaving CHORTLE, midway between a normal laugh and a DUCK'S QUACK. He checks his watch and reaches into his pocket for a small ELECTRONIC DEVICE. PENGUIN Speaking of burials... EXT. PRISON YARD - DAY T-BONE on work detail. He's got the Walkman on and he's shoveling snow to the beat. He winces, and removes the headphones... The MUSIC he was listening to has been replaced by an eerie, high-pitched WHINE. He's twisting the knob, trying to find the station he was tuned to, when a PIGEON dives down STRAIGHT AT HIS HEAD. T-BONE HEY -- ! He drops the shovel as the bird STRIKES, glancing off his head. Before he can react, THREE MORE PIGEONS have swooped down at him, PECKING at his head and shoulders in a frenzy. He lets out a HOWL and staggers through the prison yard in a frenzy. DOZENS of PIGEONS are pouring over the prison walls, SHRIEKING HIDEOUSLY, descending on him. He falls to the ground screaming for help, but the other prisoners run like rabbits, terrified... By the time the GUARDS come racing across the courtyard, T-BONE's no longer even visible. There's just a swarming, man-shaped mass of PIGEONS, pecking away, flapping their wings insanely. Covering their faces as they move in, the GUARDS blow their whistles -- BEAT AT the pigeons with billy clubs. All at once, the PIGEONS take off en masse -- leaving T-BONE's mutilated corpse sprawled in the yard. A GUARD notices the Walkman, picks up the earphones to listen, and hears nothing but ROCK MUSIC -- "Surfin' Bird" by the Trashmen. Bird bird bird, bird is the word... EXT. ROAD - ON PENGUIN'S LIMO - MOVING An AERIAL VIEW of the LIMO as it cruises down the deserted road leading away from the prison. It disappears from view -- and all at once the frame is filled with PIGEONS, great squalling FLOCKS of them, dutifully following their master as he makes his way back to Gotham City. DISSOLVE TO: INT. WAYNE MANOR - ENTRYWAY - NIGHT ALFRED opens the front door and finds a bundled-up VICKI out on the portico, red-cheeked, flushed, and happy. She pulls him forward, gives him a quick peck on the cheek. VICKI Guess what, Alfred. I think I found a present for Bruce. She's got a long, skinny GIFT BOX propped up against the exterior wall. At first it doesn't want to fit through the door -- it must be eight feet long -- but with ALFRED's help she gets it inside. The faithful butler stares curiously at this odd-shaped gift... VICKI (cont.) Skis. -- Don't let on, okay? ALFRED He won't hear a word of it from me. VICKI He's such a nightmare to shop for. -- What do you get him year after year, Alfred? ALFRED (conspiratorially) I find you can't go wrong with surveillance equipment. Let me put this under the tree... VICKI Not so fast. She reaches into the pocket of her coat and pulls out another small gift. ALFRED stares at the tag -- "TO ALFRED, LOVE VICKI" -- and tries to suppress a HUGE GRIN. ALFRED Why, Miss Vale -- ! VOICE FROM BEHIND What's all this? ALFRED and VICKI turn. It's BRUCE, dressed for dinner, marching down the long stairway in the entry hall. VICKI waves frantically. VICKI Don't look. It's your present. VICKI rushes over to embrace him. He gapes at the long skinny box -- BRUCE What'd you get me? Kareem Abdul-Jabbar? VICKI frowns and gives him a kiss. She nestles up against him. WHISPERS in his ear: VICKI I'm going to give you the happiest Christmas you've ever had. Still in the clinch, BRUCE shoots a look at ALFRED. Taking the hint, ALFRED clears his throat and bends to pick up one end of the ski box. He backs out of the entry hall, dragging the box before him... CUT TO: EXT. GOTHAM PARK - NIGHT FIRES burn in garbage cans. TENTS and LEAN-TOS dot the snowy landscape. Men, women, and children wander aimlessly, huddling against the cold. An army of the HOMELESS has set up camp in Gotham Park. On the nearby periphery, PICKETERS -- half concerned citizens, half down-and-outers -- are marching the sidewalks, keeping a candlelight VIGIL. Hand-lettered placards read: "SAVE THE PARK." "PARKS ARE FOR PEOPLE." "THIS PARK IS OUR HOME." The source of the protest? A towering SIGN posted in a corner of the park, announcing the imminent consuuction of a new luxury highrise -- the GOTHAM PARK TOWERS -- a project of Shaw Construction, Inc. A LAMBORGHINI sits at a traffic light nearby... INT. LAMBORGHINI - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT BRUCE and VICKI, dressed for dinner, stare out at the demonstration. VICKI Homeless. (beat) I was just down here Tuesday. Seems like there's more every day. BRUCE starts to say something, but can't think of anything to say. VICKI (cont.) Christmas time. And they say there's over a thousand people living in the park already. BRUCE -- Yeah. The light changes. BRUCE throws the car into gear and -- at the next intersection -- turns the car right, into the park. EXT. PUB-IN-THE-PARK - NIGHT Despite the name, it's a tony little bistro catering to Gotham's elite. A PANHANDLER, underdressed for the cold, has been hustling the customers as they come out; a couple of PARKING ATTENDANTS are trying to drag him discreetly away as BRUCE'S CAR pulls up. A VALET opens the car for BRUCE and VICKI, who look on in concern as the PANHANDLER gets the bum's rush. The liveried DOORMAN shrugs apolagetically -- sorry for the inconvenience -- as they enter. INT. PUB-IN-THE-PARK - NIGHT Post-dinner. VICKI's got a sheaf of PHOTOS spread out on the table in front of BRUCE -- shots of Gotham's HOMELESS, being forcibly evicted from slum dwellings, erecting their SHANTYTOWNS in Gotham Park. VICKI They're already razing the tenements and SRO's downtown. These people don't have anyplace else to go. (beat) If the city starts selling off the park... BRUCE takes a good long look at his opulent surroundings. HUGE WINDOWS open on a serene and picturesque view of the park; CAMPFIRES flicker in the distance... BRUCE -- Yeah. I guess I'll pass on dessert. VICKI (taking his hand) Bruce, you do a lot more than most people even dream of. BRUCE Sure. Comes off the top of my taxes -- VICKI That's not what I meant. They exchange a long silent look. Of course she's referring to Batman. Still, the argument doesn't hold much water with BRUCE. BRUCE -- What I "do" doesn't come close to the root of the problem, Vicki. (long pause) I'm just a Band-Aid. VOICE FROM BEHIND Bruce! It's been ages! VICKI turns -- and rapidly closes her photo folder. Millionaire construction magnate RANDALL SHAW is in the restaurant table-hopping, and he's just glommed onto BRUCE. BRUCE Randall. You remember Vicki. -- How's the construction business? SHAW The park tower? All systems go. If we can get the junkies and winos cleared out... (a big grin) Not too late to get in on the deal. BRUCE I'll think about it. SHAW Say, Walter Barrett's due back from Europe. We should all get together at the club. (clapping him on the shoulder) Nice to see you again, Miss Veal. "Miss Veal" maintains a big phony smile as SHAW moves off to the next table. She murmurs to BRUCE through clenched teeth: VICKI What a pig. BRUCE I've known him since he was seven years old. He was a pig then too. VICKI Now he wants to gobble up the park... (shivering) Bruce -- isn't there something you can do about people like that? BRUCE What, tie him up with a bat-rope? VICKI No, you idiot. I meant you. Bruce. BRUCE nods -- oh, yeah. Subtle distinction. INT. PUB-IN-THE-PARK - NIGHT BRUCE and VICKI emerge from the restaurant. He hands his parking stub to a VALET. A crowd's beginning to form in the lot outside... The red-and-blue bubble of a POLICE CAR is flashing a short distance off, near the entrance to the park. TWO RED BERETS, in full Order-of-the-Bat regalia, look on as a recently-mugged WOMAN JOGGER gives her statement to the investigating COPS. BRUCE and VICKI, intrigued by the Batman-wannabes, move a little closer -- within eavesdropping range: RED BERET I We were on patrol. Saw the whole thing. JOGGER I was attacked. Three men in ski masks -- COP I (indicating the RED BERETS) And these two broke it up? JOGGER These two?? They ran like rabbits. I never saw anybody take off so -- RED BERET II Hey! Somebody had to go for the cops. COP II You. SHUT UP, all right?? (to the JOGGER) Lady, who was it that bailed you out?? JOGGER A kid. Thirteen or fourteen tops. He just came out of nowhere and -- tore into 'em. (shaking her head) It was so quick I didn't even see his face. Nearby, VICKI shoots a highly quizzical look at BRUCE, who responds with a mystified shrug. Her professional curiosity piqued, she wanders over to introduce herself to the JOGGER. An exasperated COP leads the RED BERETS away from the crime site: RED BERET I Dumb shit. Shouldn'ta been jogging in the park at night anyway. (sullenly) Look around you. It's fulla bums. BRUCE gestures at the RED BERET's Batman sweatshirt as he passes. BRUCE Nice outfit. RED BERET I Piss off, geek. DISSOLVE TO: EXT. WATERFRONT DISTRICT - NIGHT Snow blankets the abandoned warehouses rimming Gotham Harbor. FOGHORNS blare in the distance as a pair of STILETTO HEELS -- totally inappropriate for the weather -- click across the sidewalk and pause at mid-block, where a wide wooden plank leads down from street level to a seedy hole-in-the-wall bar: the WHARF RAT. INT. WHARF RAT - NIGHT A roughneck joint, about as trendy as the average bait shack. The clientele consists primarily of surly types who are saving up for their next tattoo. A TV over the bar is tuned to the late news: ANCHORWOMAN ...and tomorrow, the city's power elite will be turning out in force to greet millionaire industrialist Walter Barrett, who returns to Gotham after a five-year stay in Europe... The BARTENDER switches to a hockey game, because none of the rowdies at the bar give a shit about Walter Barrett. None, that is, except for a strapping young bruiser named RICKY, who gets up and makes his way to a pay phone in the corner. Moments later, the owner of the high heels enters; she opens her black fur coat and unwraps her muffler, revealing exotic, vaguely Eurasian features. She's dark and elegant, fine- boned, regal of bearing -- and her name, though we don't know it yet, is SELINA KYLE. She's not the kind of girl who typically frequents the Wharf Rat, and so her entrance creates quite a stir. A LONGSHOREMAN at the nearby pool table misses his shot and digs a rut in the felt. Two blowsy WHORES size her up territorially as she finds an open stool at the bar and settles in with serene indifference. The regulars, of course, are all but licking their chops. The only guy in the joint who hasn't noticed her yet is RICKY, who's still on the phone: RICKY Yo. Ricky here. What's the haps? In mid-conversation he notices SELINA. She smiles invitingly -- right at him. Mildly startled, he smiles back. RICKY (cont.) Midnight. No sweat. See you then. He hangs up eagerly. Then, with a deep breath, he hitches up his pants and swaggers over to SELINA's end of the bar. SELINA Well. "Ricky," is it? RICKY How'd you know that? SELINA I heard you on the phone. Talking to your girlfriend. RICKY Girlfriend? No, no. That was business. SELINA makes a big show of peeling off her gloves. SELINA If you've got time for a little pleasure ...maybe you'd like to buy me a drink. She clasps his hand. His EYES BUG OUT. Three enormous rings, a diamond bracelet -- there must be several thousand in rocks on her left hand alone. RICKY gapes at the sparklers, bedazzled. RICKY Jeez -- they look almost real. SELINA Why wouldn't they be? RICKY is not the smoothest guy around, and his line of thought is all too evident. He swallows hard and tries not to stare. RICKY You'd have to be crazy. Nobody'd wear the real thing to a dive like this. SELINA Oh, they're real, all right. So are these. She waves her FINGERNAILS -- long, polished, and talon-sharp -- in front of his eyes. With lightning speed, before he can react, she pins his wrist to the bar -- and with one quick stroke carves a THIN BLOODY STRIPE in the back of his hand. SELINA's eyes flash as he gasps in shock. He tries to jerk his hand away, but he can't break her grip. Then -- her dominance firmly established -- she releases his hand with a coy, Cheshire-cat smile. SELINA (cont.) Weren't we going to have a drink? He blinks, forces a chuckle, smiles unsteadily. She takes his wounded hand, lifts it slowly to her mouth, and LAPS GENTLY at the blood. RICKY is hypnotized. She's got an odd way of flirting, but RICKY finds it somehow -- intriguing. He dabs at his hand with a napkin and signals to the BARTENDER. CUT TO: EXT. WATERFRONT - PIER 31 - NIGHT Just after midnight; the snow's still failing, the waters are icy, and the wharfs are deserted -- almost. A small STEAMBOAT is docked at Pier 31, and the deck is lined with THUGS -- mean, ugly, and heavily armed. A similar contingent of gun-toting GOONS is waiting to greet them on the dock below. The boys on the dock hoist ASSAULT RIFLES as the BOAT THUGS extend a gangplank. Something major is about to happen... The CHIEF DOCK GOON gestures to his LIEUTENANT, who grabs a black MEDICAL BAG. Hands raised, the two of them start up the gangplank. Throughout all this, the DOCK GOONS keep their guns trained on the BOAT THUGS, covering their buddies. One of them turns to a colleague: DOCK GOON I Where's that goddam Ricky? DOCK GOON II Probably out gettin' laid. And here we are freezin' our balls off... EXT. STEAMBOAT - ON DECK - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT The LIEUTENANT unloads chemical testing gear from his doctor's bag. The lead BOAT THUG gestures to a stack of SHIPPING CRATES which rest atop a large NET spread out across the deck. BOAT THUG I You pick. The CHIEF GOON selects a crate at random. Two BOAT THUGS tip it on its side and, using a crowbar, pry off a FALSE BOTTOM -- revealing a dozen packets of WHITE POWDER. POV SHOT - HIGH ANGLE - THAT MOMENT We're now watching the scene from a vantage point atop a ramshackle boathouse at water's edge. Down on the deck of the steamboat, the LIEUTENANT goes to work testing the merchandise. LIEUTENANT It's pure. REVERSE ANGLE - THAT MOMENT A BLACK SILHOUETTE is peering down from the boathouse roof. The mysterious watcher ducks quickly out of sight; the only details that register are a pair of ominously familiar POINTY EARS... CHIEF GOON (O.S.) Let's do it. He gestures to his boys on the dock. A CRANE-AND-WINCH assembly rotates into place over the deck -- and the BOAT THUGS gather up the corners of the netting and attach them to the big hook. BOAT THUG I Hold it. Let's see the money. Down on the wharf, a DOCK GOON kneels beside a metal suitcase and opens it. Lots of long green inside. The BOAT THUG signals thumbs up, and the CRATES rise into the air as the goon with the suitcase starts up the gangplank. LOW ANGLE - ON GANGPLANK - THAT MOMENT The goon with the suitcase marches up. Beyond him, in the distance, a LITHE BLACK SHADOW vaults off the boathouse roof and makes a silent, graceful landing on the long shaft of the CRANE. ANOTHER ANGLE - THAT MOMENT The moment of maximum tension: grim faces all around, everyone holding a gun on someone else as the suitcase arrives on deck and crane swings over the pier. ANGLE ON CRANE - THAT MOMENT Razor-sharp, CHROME-STEEL TALONS slash suddenly through the air. ON DOCK - LOW ANGLE - THAT MOMENT The netting GIVES WAY, and TWO DOZEN SHIPPING CRATES rain down onto the pier, CRUSHING two DOCK GOONS underneath. The crates explode into splinters, littering the dock with drugs and random ART OBJECTS as the other DOCK GOONS scatter in panic. ON STEAMBOAT - THAT MOMENT Nobody knows quite what's going on. Panicking, the GOON with the suitcase full of money turns tail and dives for the gangplank. BOAT THUG I sees him and squeezes off a quick shot. Winged, the GOON topples off the gangplank and hits the drink, suitcase and all. Pandemonium. All at once, everyone's OPENING FIRE. Thinking he's been double-crossed, BOAT THUG I turns on the CHIEF GOON and SHOOTS HIM TWICE at point-blank range. BOAT THUG I YOU SON OF A BITCH! (to another BOAT THUG) Go after it. Get the money. GO!! He raises his gun, and the second BOAT THUG dutifully obeys -- diving off the deck into a hail of gunfire. Everyone's ducking for cover. BOAT THUG I barks orders at the pilothouse: BOAT THUG I Soltar las amarras! -- CAST OFF!! ANOTHER BOAT THUG LOOK! BOAT THUG I whirls, just in time to see a SHADOWY FIGURE landing cat-like on the deck mere yards away. Clad in inky black leather from head to toe, the intruder's face is concealed by what appears to be a BONDAGE MASK. Studded, with openings for the eyes and mouth, it spans one incongruous touch: a pair of POINTED CAT EARS. She bares her teeth and HISSES. It's a woman. BOAT THUG I is momentarily mesmerized. In the time it takes him to lift his gun, she's produced a CAT-O'-NINE-TAILS. She SNAPS it at him: REELS HIM IN; and with one lethal stroke, RAKES her steel talons across his face and throat. He slumps to the deck, lifeless. The other BOAT THUG rushes her; she catches him under the jaw with a sudden upthrust, LIFTS HIM INTO THE AIR, and sends him toppling into the water. The gangplank falls aside as the steamboat pulls away from the pier. She hoists an abandoned ASSAULT RIFLE, SCATTERS the DOCK GOONS with a round of automatic fire, and VAULTS off the boat -- landing in a graceful crouch on the edge of the pier. Most of the DOCK GOONS have taken flight, but a few unlucky specimens remain behind. She somersaults forward; takes one goon off his feet with a crack of the whip; knocks another off the dock with a twirling high-kick to the jaw; sends two more reeling with swift talon-slashes. The whole frenzied mop-up action takes just under ten seconds. Alone at last, she stands back to survey the scene. Counting the stiff's on the boat -- which is now receding in the harbor -- there must be well over a dozen dead. The snow is speckled with red. A half-dozen bodies lie sprawled in their own blood; one of them, the lone survivor, is face-down and softly MOANING. Retracting her steel claws, the MASKED WOMAN crouches amid the wreckage of the smashed shipping crates. BINDLES OF WHITE POWDER -- millions of dollars' worth -- are scattered all about the pier, but she couldn't seem less interested. Instead, she's checking the MANIFEST NUMBERS stamped on the sides of the crates. She finds crate #18396-BB and rummages among its contents until she comes up with a carefully-wrapped parcel. She opens it carefully and holds it up for inspection. The statuette of a RAVEN -- carved from solid onyx -- glistens in the moonlight. The WOMAN pauses long enough to slip a small CARD in the MOANING PUNK's back pocket. Then, cradling the raven under one arm, she dashes off on silent cat feet. A LANTERN approaches. It's an OLD SALT -- some kind of hapless night watchman -- and his face goes bone-white at the sight of the carnage on the docks. He kneels beside the moaning punk, turns the body over, and GASPS -- because the PUNK'S FACE has been CLAWED TO SHREDS. PUNK Murcielago. MURCIELAGO!! CUT TO: INT. PENGUIN'S LAIR - NIGHT The unique chamber in which we find ourselves is alive with the flutter and song of COLD-WEATHER BIRDS -- dozens of them, all chirping, flitting about in the rafters, alighting on special perches mounted in the walls. At the center of this penthouse room is a vast sunken POOL. ARCTIC TERNS loll on the surrounding rocks as a LACKEY with a wheelbarrow empties cracked ice into the already-frigid water. Carefully landscaped, it looks like the penguin exhibit at the Gotham Zoological Gardens. A MASSIVE, INDISTINCT SHAPE glides beneath the surface. It's not a whale; it's too pink. It is, instead, the PENGUIN -- and as he breaks the surface, sputtering, he sees FRICK standing in the open doorway. FRICK Mr. Boniface? Your...visitor has arrived. PENGUIN Thank you, Mr. Frick. Show her in. The PENGUIN moves to the edge of the sunken pool. Two of his LACKEYS swivel a CROSSBAR, which hangs from the ceiling by a long chain, into place over his head. He grasps it with both hands -- and the crossbar RISES, hoisting his formidable bulk out of the water. INT. HIGH-RISE - CORRIDOR - THAT MOMENT FRICK leads the VISITOR down a long corridor lined on either side with BIRD CAGES -- exotic songbirds with brilliantly-hued plumage. CAMERA TRACKS ALONG behind her, and although we can't see her face, there must be something distinctively feline about her -- because the BIRDS are shrieking and fluttering in their cages, RECOILING INSTINCTIVELY as she strolls past. FRICK opens a door and ushers her into... INT. PENGUIN'S LAIR - A MOMENT LATER - NIGHT Our visitor -- SELINA KYLE -- enters the penguin-pool room. Her teeth begin to chatter. The big bay windows have been thrown open, and SNOW is blowing in from outside. It's freezing in here. She sees the PENGUIN -- wearing a thin dressing gown and an APRON outfitted with SEED POUCHES -- scattering birdseed on the window ledge for the pigeons, totally oblivious to the cold. He turns, throws his arms wide in greeting, kisses the back of SELINA's hand. PENGUIN Ah, Miss Kyle! At last we meet. SELINA At last we meet. -- Pigeons? PENGUIN Yes, they're common birds -- dirty, stupid, unattractive -- but they're very obedient, and they do crap on people's heads. May I? She extends a SHOPPING BAG. The PENGUIN removes a parcel and unwraps it, revealing the RAVEN STATUETTE. He sets it on a nearby desk, fondles it reverently...and BEAMS at SELINA. PENGUIN (cont.) I see your reputation was not exaggerated. SELINA I've located the others. All but one. (shivering) I'm surprised you don't catch pneumonia -- ! With an apologetic smile, the PENGUIN pulls the windows shut. PENGUIN My normal body temperature is ninety-two degrees. Germs find me inhospitable. SELINA I see why they call you the Penguin. PENGUIN They may call me that...but rarely more than once. Champagne? She nods. He pours two glasses, hands one to SELINA, raises a toast. PENGUIN (cont.) My dear. Here's to the second biggest crime in the history of Gotham City. CUT TO: INT. POLICE OBSERVATION ROOM - NIGHT COMMISSIONER GORDON and another cop, LT. EDDIE BULLOCK, are in darkened antechamber adjacent to an interrogation room. BULLOCK It wasn't about the drugs. Whoever it was left thirty kilos sitting on the docks. They're watching, through a two-way glass panel, as a terrified man with a heavily-bandaged face tells his story. It's the lone survivor of the dock massacre, JULIO, and his voice is audible over a concealed intercom: JULIO (filter) Un silueta negra -- con colmillos, y garras -- el demonio. El murcielago. MURCIELAGO! GORDON What's that he keeps saying? BULLOCK "Murcielago." -- Bat. GORDON Nonsense. That dock looked like a slaughter-house. Batman's never committed murder. BULLOCK We did find this in his back pocket. BULLOCK hands GORDON a CARD. It reads: "THOSE WHO FEED ON THE SOUL OF GOTHAM WILL SUFFER MY WRATH" -- and in lieu of a signature, there's a little black BAT-EMBLEM in the bottom corner. While GORDON's staring at it, a POLICEMAN pokes his head in: POLICEMAN Commissioner? We've got Barrett. INT. POLICE INTERROGATION ROOM - THAT MOMENT A cubicle down the hall. The splenetic WALTER BARRETT, millionaire industrialist, is fidgeting in his chair as GORDON enters. BARRETT Fine welcome. These storm troopers of yours dragged me away from my coming-home party! (beat) I'd like to know the meaning of this -- GORDON I'd like to know how thirty kilos of pure cocaine wound up concealed in your personal effects. BARRETT Gordon -- I come from one of the oldest and most influential familles in Gotham. If you plan to accuse me of smuggling drugs, be my guest. (long, menacing pause) I'll have your badge before you leave this room. GORDON weighs the threat. He nods to the COPS in attendance... GORDON Book the son of a bitch. GORDON storms out. BARRETT jumps out of his chair, but the COPS restrain him. Outraged, he bats their hands away... BARRETT I believe I'm still entitled to a phone call. CUT TO: EXT. DOWNTOWN GOTHAM - DAY VICKI with her camera, squeezing off snaps. She's standing behind a SAWHORSE, part of a crowd of onlookers at a downtown DEMOLITION SITE. SURVEYORS and HARDHATS bustle about in a VACANT LOT, a full city block in size, fenced off and strewn with rubble. The only structure still standing is a lone, decrepit TENEMENT BUILDING; a WRECKING BALL is poised above it, ready to strike. A SIGN at one corner of the lot announces a forty-story OFFICE COMPLEX soon to be erected on this site by SHAW CONSTRUCTION, INC. Down below is RANDALL SHAW HIMSELF, in necktie and hardhat, speaking into a WALKIE-TALKIE: SHAW Come on! Let's move it! We're an hour behind as it is!! A few moments later, a CLUSTER OF PEOPLE emerge from the tenement building -- a mixed team of COPS and CONSTRUCTION GOONS who are forcibly removing a DESTITUTE FAMILY from the condenmed building. VICKI watches angrily... HER POV - TELEPHOTO LENS A quick series of shots: the SQUATTERS wailing and struggling, clinging to the doorways, unwilling to leave. Their few belongings are packed in a couple of CARDBOARD BOXES, which the cops heave rudely out onto the street. Finally, the handcuffs and nightsticks come out... ANGLE ON SHAW - THAT MOMENT - DAY A SURVEYOR grabs SHAW by the arm and points out the woman taking photos in the crowd. SHAW recognizes her instantly. His face turns into a mask of outrage -- as if he's been personally betrayed. SHAW Jesus Christ, that's Bruce Wayne's bimbo! He makes eye contact with her. VICKI stares back defiantly. He's about to stroll over and tell her off when a HARDHAT signals to him: HARDHAT Phone call, Mr. Shaw. Guy said it's urgent. SHAW (to tbe SURVEYOR) Hold the ball. I wanna hear it crash. He climbs into the cab of a nearby TRUCK, where he picks up a CELLULAR PHONE. INTERCUT - BARRETT AND SHAW BARRETT's still in custody at the police station -- using his one phone call to contact the construction magnate. BARRETT It's me, Randall -- Walter Barrett. I want you to call my attorney. That was my shipment they busted up last night. SHAW Jesus, Walter, I -- (suddenly puzzled) Why are you calling me?? BARRETT It's worse than that. Somebody took my raven. SHAW stares at the phone in horrified disbelief. ANGLE ON VICKI - THAT MOMENT SHE WATCHES as SHAW climbs out of the truck -- numb, in a daze. He signals to the WRECKING BALL OPERATOR; a WHISTLE blows, and the great iron ball knocks a MAMMOTH HOLE in the facade of the tenement. SHAW doesn't even stick around to watch it. He scurries off to his car at the end of the block. VICKI, highly intrigued, gets it all on film... INT. GOTHAM GLOBE - CITY ROOM - DAY VICKI's in a huddle with the Managing Editor, SCHULTZ, showing him her PHOTOS -- SHAW orchestrating the eviction of the SQUATTER FAMILY. SCHULTZ Great stuff, but we're looking at a shitfight with our beloved publisher. He and Shaw... (crossing his fingers) Old money sticks together. VICKI points to a photo of SHAW racing from the truck to his car. VICKI I'd sure like to know what shook him up so. He was out of there like a scared rabbit... Just then, a reporter -- WILK -- rushes up excitedly to SCHULTZ's desk. WILK Got a blind tip from downtown. You know that massacre on the docks? Batman. VICKI reacts in astonishment. SCHULTZ's jaw drops -- this is hot. EDITOR Whoa! Is this on the level? WILK Cops even got a note. "Those who feed on the soul of Gotham will suffer my wrath!" (grinning; to VICKI) Sounds like your pal's cranked it up a notch. VICKI starts to protest, but thinks better of it. INT. WAYNE MANOR - ENTRY HALL - EVENING ALFRED opens the door. A BANNER HEADLINE stares him in the face: BATMAN IMPLICATED IN DOCK MASSACRE Industrialist Linked to Drug Smuggling Ring VICKI, who's holding up the afternoon paper for ALFRED's inspection, peeks out glumly from behind the masthead. VICKI Seen the late edition? ALFRED I'm afraid so, Miss Vale. Master Bruce is sequestered in the cave. INT. BRUCE'S LIBRARY - A MOMENT LATER - EVENING On their way to the Batcave, ALFRED and VICKI pass through the library. They pause in front of the television -- which is tuned to a PANEL SHOW, with various experts discussing the hot issue of the day. ENVIRONMENTALIST (on TV) Walter Barrett's no saint. His factories have been dumping poison into the air and water for years. If he is mixed up with drugs... PUNDIT (on TV) That's not the issue. The issue is, do we entrust our public safety to some...masked vigilante. Does Batman have a license to kill? ALFRED (shaking his head) Ah, the public. Dishearteningly fickle. VICKI follows ALFRED out. We HOLD on the TV as the CAMERA PANS OVER to the third guest on the panel, loudly demanding air time. He's wearing a RED BERET and a BATMAN SWEATSHIRT: MIKE SEKOWSKY (on TV) Yo, here's the tip, man. Drug dealers are scum. If Batman did wax these punks...SO WHAT? They deserved it! End of discussion. INT. BATCAVE - A MOMENT LATER - EVENING ALFRED and VICKI arrive; BRUCE gestures for them to keep quiet. He's hunched over a TAPE RECORDER -- and COMMISSIONER GORDON'S VOICE is blaring from a nearby speaker... GORDON (O.S.; filter) Anyone could've written that note. INT. GORDON'S OFFICE - THAT MOMENT GORDON's in conference with a number of CITY OFFICIALS -- blissfully unaware that anyone might be eavesdropping. CITY OFFICIAL I And I suppose anyone could've taken out a boatload of armed thugs. A dozen men, Jim -- murdered in cold blood -- GORDON Before we forget, Batman's saved hundreds of lives! CITY OFFICIAL II He's still a vigilante. We don't know who he is, where he comes from, why he does it... CITY OFFICIAL I Street punks are one thing, Jim. This is Walter Barrett -- a personal friend of mine! As the conversation continues, CAMERA SLOWLY MOVES IN ON a COMPUTER TERMINAL in the corner. We see the tiny TRADEMARK embossed on the CPU -- "WAYNE TECHNOLOGIES." INT. BATCAVE - THAT MOMENT - ON BRUCE as he LISTENS through his concealed bug. CITY OFFCIAL II You've gotta bring him in, Jim -- at least for questioning. It would sure help if we could get that mask off... BRUCE shuts the recorder off. He turns to face ALFRED and VICKI -- BRUCE Ladies and gentlemen...I've been framed. CUT TO: EXT. GOTHAM CITY - NIGHT The BAT-SIGNAL blazing in the night sky. After a beat, the CAMERA TILTS DOWN to a cluster of EXCITED CITIZENS, who point and holler as the BATMOBILE streaks past. INT. SQUAD CAR - THAT MOMENT TWO COPS are parked in an alleyway, watching as the BATMOBILE whizzes past on the street. The DRIVER pulls out behind it as the second COP grabs his radio mike... COP One-delta-niner -- 10-80 on Riverview north-bound at 33rd -- 10-78, repeat 10-78. VOICE ON RADIO (filter) 10-4, one-delta-niner -- that's a 10-37, repeat 10-37. Backup on the way. EXT. STREET - ON BATMOBILE BARRELING TOWARD US on the street. The SQUAD CAR gains behind it. A SIREN HOWLS; a red-and-blue bubble begins to flash... The BATMOBILE makes a HAIRPIN TURN -- and ACCELERATES. OVERHEAD ANGLE - THE STREETS As the BATMOBILE rounds the corner and picks up speed, TWO MORE SQUAD CARS scream down the cross street, joining in the pursuit. All at once THICK BLACK SMOKE billows from the back of the Batmobile -- ENVELOPING the police cars, BLINDING THE DRIVERS... EXT. STREET - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT TWO SQUAD CARS parked in a V-formation -- a makeshift roadblock. ANXIOUS POLICEMEN mill about in front of them. They move into position as the BATMOBILE, still trailing smoke, rounds a corner and careens directly toward them... ANGLE ON BATMOBILE - THAT MOMENT The FRONT FENDER of the Batmobile detaches and EXTENDS itself from the body of the car. It BENDS in the middle; WING-PANELS flip into place, forming an arrowhead-shaped COW-CATCHER. EXT. STREET - ON ROADBLOCK A SHRIEKING HORN BLARES. The COPS see the Batmobile SPEEDING UP and dive for the sidewalk. The COW-CATCHER slams into the SOUAD CARS, pushes them effortlessly aside, and cruises through the gap. As the PURSUING CARS emerge from the smoke cloud and follow the Batmobile through, we TILT UP to the roof of a nearby building -- EXT. ROOFTOP - THAT MOMENT -- and realize that the Batmobile's on automatic pilot, because BATMAN's been on the roof all along -- watching the action with some dismay. His relationship with the Gotham PD appears to be on shaky ground. He speaks into his voice-activated REMOTE CONTROL UNIT: BATMAN Evasive. SIRENS HOWL below as he strolls across the rooftop, lost in thought. CUT TO: INT. PENTHOUSE APARTMENT - NIGHT At this height, the SIRENS are a distant insect drone. We're in the palatial digs of RANDALL SHAW, the construction magnate. There's obviously money to be made in real-estate development -- because the walls are lined with art, and the floor-to-ceiling windows open on the most spectacular view in Gotham. At the moment, SHAW's posing casually in front of his new Brancusi -- which rests on a pedestal near the windows. An UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN in a slinky black dress LOOKS ON, her back to the camera... WOMAN It's a fake. SHAW Hmm. It cost me a half a million dollars. You're sure? WOMAN Absolutely. You see, I...happen to know where the real one is stashed. The WOMAN wanders out of frame as SHAW smiles, impressed. He seems peculiarly nonchalant about the whole deal; at the moment, art is not the first thing on his mind. CAMERA STAYS ON HIM as he pours two glasses of red wine and circles in on his mysterious guest. SHAW I guess you'd know. I have some "friends" in the art world. They say that -- for certain hard-to-get items -- you're the one to call. WOMAN (O.S.) How flattering. SHAW They say for the right price...you could steal Michelangelo off the Sistine Chapel Wall. WOMAN (O.S.) Mr. Shaw. Do you believe everything you hear? SHAW Oh, I'm not one to judge. I admire people who take what they want. I'm just curious how you do it. SHAW hands her the wine, and for the first time we see her face. It's SELINA KYLE, perching seductively on the arm of the sofa... SELINA I find that the old methods work best. Setting her wine down, flashing her patented Cheshire-cat smile, SELINA moves in on him -- and they go into a deep, passionate kiss. Her long red nails dig into his back; SHAW drops his wine glass, which SHATTERS -- splashing red wine across the polished parquet floor. INT. PENTHOUSE - SHAW'S BEDROOM - NIGHT The action's gone horizontal. SELINA, peeled down to a sheer lace teddy, is on the bed atop SHAW -- tickling his throat with quick, lapping kisses. She rolls off suddenly; when he tries to sit up, she pushes him back down with a single finger. Sitting on the edge of the bed, she peels off her STOCKINGS, twisting them around into tight cords. With a coy smile she runs her finger in a circle around SHAW's hairy chest -- and then, abruptly, knots one stocking tightly about his wrist and ties it off on the bedpost. SHAW Hey, what are you doing -- ? He tries to break her grip. She BACKHANDS him sharply across the face. SELINA You're very inquisitive. You'll just have to be disciplined. An EDGY SMILE spreads across his face as she binds his other hand to the bedpost. None too quick, he's just caught on that all this is part of SELINA's kinky scene. She crosses quickly to the bathroom -- SHAW You know, I've...I've never really done this kind of thing before. -- and reemerges wearing her CATWOMAN mask...which seems perfectly appropriate in this context. SELINA I think people should indulge their fantasies. Don't you? Now that he's all trussed up, she crosses the room and reaches into an oversized bag. She withdraws an odd-looking chromium BRACE, slips it on over her wrist, and hits a trigger. SIX- INCH STEEL TALONS snick into place. SHAW's dopey smile fades... SHAW Hey, what are those -- what are you -- He lets out an awful, shrill SHRIEK as the camera WHIP PANS away from the bed to a Jackson Pollack on the wall nearby. A SPRAY OF BLOOD spatters across it -- in an aesthetically pleasing way -- and the SHRIEK ends in a LOW GURGLE as we CUT TO: INT. BUILDING LOBBY - A FEW MINUTES LATER - NIGHT A SECURITY GUARD is working a crossword at his booth near the entrance of the building. Behind him, a bank of MONITORS show various empty hallways throughout the building. He reaches for his coffee and sees a RED LIGHT flashing on a wall panel nearby. INT. SHAW'S PENTHOUSE - THAT MOMENT The penthouse is THROBBING with the clangorous sound of a BURGLAR ALARM. SELINA is standing by an OPEN WALL SAFE -- concealed behind a painting, which has been swung away on hinges -- and she's HOLDING HER EARS, wearing a look of complete exasperation: oh, shit. The GUARD'S VOICE crackles over a nearby intercom: GUARD (O.S.; filter) Mr. Shaw? What's going on up there? -- Mr. Shaw? Furious with herself, she reaches inside the safe and extracts a BLACK RAVEN statuette -- identical to the one she took on the docks. She slams the door shut and swings the picture back into place. EXT. STREETS - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT SIRENS echo in the streets. SQUAD CARS make sudden turns and streak off toward SHAW's building. EXT. ROOFTOP - HIGH ANGLE - NIGHT Watching the cars from his rooftop vantage, BATMAN raises an ANTENNA mounted on his utility belt and cups one hand to his head. An EARPIECE concealed inside his cowl gives him the police frequency: DISPATCHER (O.S.; filter) -- possible 15 in progress, 188 E. 69th at Gotham Park West. Move out. It's Randall Shaw. Repeat, all units -- BATMAN's eyes widen. He steps to the ledge and pulls a TINY METAL CYLINDER from his belt -- immediately recognizable as part of BRUCE's hydraulic umbrella-gizmo. But it's no umbrella. When BATMAN thumbs the switch, his BLACK CAPE begins to SPREAD and RISE -- stiffening, expanding -- INFLATING itself into a pair of RIGID BLACK BATWINGS. He steps OFF THE LEDGE, INTO MIDAIR -- SOARING SILENTLY ACROSS THE STREET LIKE A HUMAN HANG-GLIDER as the cop cars cruise past far below. INT. SHAW'S BEDROOM - NIGHT There's an awful BANGING at the front door. SHAW lies under the bloody sheets, hands folded, staring lifelessly up at the ceiling. SELINA, now dressed in full Catwoman regalia, slings a lightweight KNAPSACK over her shoulders. She picks up the nearest chair, RAMS IT through SHAW's plate-glass window, and clambers out onto the ledge outside. Ten seconds later the COPS burst in. They rush to the bedroom -- spot the shattered window, the inert gory mass on the bed -- -- but the real shock comes when they glance over at the wall. Painted there, in blood...is a big, red, dripping BAT. COP JESUS! EXT. ROOFTOP - SHAW'S BUILDING - NIGHT Forty stories up. The CATWOMAN, in a surefooted crouch, she scurries along the ledge -- SPRINGS at a cornice -- and in one lithe motion VAULTS UP onto the ROOF. She scampers across the rooftops, dropping from one to the next with rope and tackle, like a mountain climber -- -- until she reaches the building at the end of the block. Here she pauses to dig in her knapsack. She pulls out a retractable HOOK at the end of a rope, swings it around, HEAVES IT at the rooftop across the street... EXT. STREET BELOW - LOW ANGLE - THAT MOMENT POLICE pile out of cars and race for the entrance, totally oblivious to the odd scene taking place overhead -- where the small, barely-visible figure of a WOMAN, clad entirely in black leather, is doing a TIGHTROPE WALK across the intersection. EXT. ROOFTOP - A MINUTE LATER - NIGHT The CATWOMAN bounds across snowy rooftops until she decides she's out of danger. Then, weary and exhilarated, she drops to her knees; bathed in moonlight, she preens, stretches, emits eerie little purrs and hisses of pleasure. She's just made a kill and her blood is running high, so she's stopped for a moment of Quality Time. She hears an odd crunching noise two roofs over. Her whole body tenses and -- though her head doesn't move -- her eyes dart left. A CAPED SHADOW has just touched down at the end of a line. The gold BAT-EMBLEM on his chest is visible for the briefest of seconds before he steps back into the shadows. She acts like she hasn't noticed... ...but a little smile flickers across her lips just the same. TIGHT ON BATMAN - THAT MOMENT His eyes widen -- his LIPS PART as he watches her. If it's possible to see absolute consternation behind that mask, we're seeing it now. HIS POV - ON CATWOMAN - THAT MOMENT She still doesn't let on that she's seen him. Instead, she goes to the ledge of the roof and begins to STRUT, like a gymnast on the balance beam -- POSING for him in a little private show -- a strange, self-infatuated, AUTOEROTIC DANCE ROUTINE for BATMAN's benefit. EXT. ROOFTOP - THAT MOMENT His jaw is down around his knees. Whoa. He edges forward slightly, as if hypnotically drawn to her... She hears a noise. Stops. Makes a big show of looking left and right. Somehow afraid she'll see him watching, BATMAN jumps back into the shadows. She gathers her things; a small WHITE CARD flutters from her knapsack to the snowy roof, and she VANISHES over the edge. Snapping back to reality, he bolts across the roof just in time to see -- EXT. SIDE OF BUILDING - ON CATWOMAN - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT She's rapidly working her way down the side of the building, flipping down from one fire escape to tile next -- a master gymnast. Three stories up, she lands on a railing, then STOPS -- LAUNCHING HERSELF out over the street, making a perfect landing on the roof of a passing BUS. EXT. ROOFTOP - ON BATMAN - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT BATMAN turns -- and his eyes fall on the WHITE CARD. He kneels to pick it up; a brief three-word MESSAGE is scrawled upon it... LOOKING FOR LOVE? He goes goggle-eyed with astonishment. He rushes back to the edge of the roof and sees the BUS just turning toward the entrance to Gotham Park. He's reaching for his grappling-gun, figuring to follow, when a FLOODLIGHT catches him full in the face. EXT. STREETS BELOW - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT Down below, the cops are sweeping their beams across the rooftops. Two of them catch a quick glimpse of BATMAN just as he ducks back behind the cornice, out of view. COP Hey. You see what I saw...? This sends the astounded COPS rushing to their radios. Right on cue, COMMISSIONER GORDON's car pulls up. LT. BULLOCK, who's already on the scene, fills him in as he climbs out. BULLOCK It's Randall Shaw. Torn to ribbons. -- We just made Batman up on the roof. GORDON Oh God. EXT. GOTHAM PARK - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT The BUS rumbles deeper into the snowy park. A BLACK SILHOUETTE springs off the roof into the trees, disappearing among the branches... We TRACK WITH the bus as it moves through the park, arriving finally at: EXT. CLEARING IN PARK - SHANTYTOWN - NIGHT The little colony of HOMELESS PEOPLE in their cardboard shacks and lean-tos, still occupying the future site of the Park Towers. MARCHERS and PICKETERS are continuing their protest nearby, and some charitable organization's set up a makeshift soup kitchen on folding tables -- hot coffee and sandwiches. VICKI's on the periphery of the camp, camera in hand. She's trying to persuade a HOMELESS MAN to let his picture be taken. VICKI Please, just one. It's important for people to see what's happening. HOMELESS MAN They don't want to see us, lady. They just want us gone -- out of sight, and out of mind. (mumbling as he wanders off) Get worse before it gets better. It always does. VICKI TURNS. In the distance, the PICKETERS are shrieking and wailing. A VAN's just pulled up to the edge of the park, and a dozen HARDHATS are elbowing their way through the crowd. All at once they're swarming through shantytown with TIRE IRONS and BASEBALL BATS, overturning the sandwich tables, RIPPING DOWN the shabby tents and lean-tos. Some of the HOMELESS PEOPLE run. Those who resist meet with swift and sudden violence. A MARCHER jumps a hardhat, and gets a baseball bat in the gut for his trouble. VICKI waits for the police sirens, but they don't come. She backs off toward the trees, she begins SNAPPING PHOTOS FRANTICALLY, capturing the carnage on film. A HARDHAT is dismantling a lean-to with his tire iron -- sending the terrified family inside scurrying off into the snow -- when he glances up and sees VICKI taking his picture. He points her out to a colleague... ...and suddenly the two of them are RUSHING TOWARD HER with pure cold malice in their eyes. VICKI turns to run, but it's slow going in the snow. She SLIPS and FALLS; her attackers are almost upon her... ...when a SHADOWY FIGURE DIVES OUT OF THE TREES and TACKLES one of the HARDHATS. The FIGURE lands a powerhouse blow to the fallen HARDHATs jaw, knocking him out cold. The second HARDHAT turns and lifts his TIRE IRON. But the FIGURE, with surprising agility, is already rolling out of the way. As he rolls, he grabs the first guy's HARDHAT off his head and brings it up in front of him -- blocking the blow from the second guy's tire iron. In the same motion, he plants a FOOT in the second HARDHAT's belly and sends him REELING BACKWARD, HARDHAT II drops the tire iron, and the FIGURE snatches it out of midair as he gets to his feet. He moves in on the second HARDHAT, BRANDISHING the iron -- -- and while HARDHAT II is staring at it, the FIGURE HIGH- KICKS HIM in the face. HOP; KICK. HOP; KICK. The FIGURE has nailed him three times squarely on the jaw before he can hit the ground. The FIGURE turns toward VICKI. Her eyes go wide with astonishment. It's a KID, thirteen or fourteen at the outside, sunken-eyed, grimy-looking, in a torn-and-tattered RAINCOAT. She stares at him for the briefest of instants before he rushes off to the aid of his fellow homeless... She can't believe what she's seeing. The KID wades smack into the midst of the remaining HARDHATS, and kicks ass -- spinning, pirouetting, kicking, clawing in a furious display of pure athleticism. It seems like he's everywhere at once. There's only one other guy in Gotham City who can handle himself like this... Rallying behind him, the MARCHERS and HOMELESS PEOPLE snatch bats and tire irons from the fallen HARDHATS -- and the tide turns. The invasion is being repelled. Faced with renewed resistance, the few HARDHATS still left standing TURN TAIL and race off to their VAN. Triumph in shantytown. The MARCHERS and HOMELESS cluster together to lick their wounds -- and the KID, satisfied that everything is under control, turns and sprints off toward the trees. But one prostrate HARDHAT is only playing dead. As the KID runs past, the HARDHAT extends a TIRE IRON into his path -- TRIPPING HIM, sending him sprawling in the snow. The KID throws up his hands as the HARDHAT prepares to smash down at him... CLANG. The HARDHAT drops his tire iron and topples over, BOARDLIKE. The KID looks up and sees VICKI standing there with a baseball bat. He gives her a quick nod of acknowledgement as he gets to his feet -- thanks for returning the favor. He's about to light out again when -- VICKI WAIT! Don't be afraid. I wanted to thank you. I -- KID (cautiously) Twenty. VICKI What? KID Twenty bucks. VICKI's mildly taken aback, but she reaches for her purse just the same. She's barely gotten her wallet open when the KID snatches the bill out of her hands. They stare at each other for a long moment -- VICKI ...Who are you? KID Dick. -- and then he's bounding off like a shot. VAULTING up into a tree and vanishing amid the snowy branches. VICKI starts to follow, but there's no way she can keep up. Instead she digs into her CAMERA BAG... HER POV - THROUGH TELEPHOTO LENS Using the long lens, she tracks the KID's progress through the treetops. She can't actually see him, but occasional chunks of SNOW and ICE are falling to the ground as he jumps from limb to limb... For a moment it seems like she's lost him. As she sweeps the lens back and forth, scanning the trees, she catches sight of an EQUESTRIAN STATUE in the distance. She ups the magnification so she can see the plaque on the pedestal. The stone figure on the horse is Union war hero GEN. OLIVER WAYNE -- BRUCE's great-grandfather. As luck would have it, the KID drops to earth not ten feet from the statue -- VICKI's got him in her sights again. He looks around cautiously to make sure no one's following, then races toward a STONE BRIDGE which arches between two small hillocks, over a frozen creek. There's a DRAINAGE TUNNEL, four or five feet in diameter, mounted in the bridge abutment, the KID pries off a wire grate and clambers inside, then pulls the grate back into place behind him. Home sweet home. EXT. PARK - ON VICKI - NIGHT as she lowers the lens. Her face is full of conflicting emotions. She'd love to corner this boy vigilante and find out what his story is. But on the other hand -- even the homeless are entitled to their privacy... CUT TO: INT. PENGUIN'S AVIARY - NIGHT A CANARY sings in its cage as a BLACK CAT watches transfixed from a nearby chair. The cat arches its back -- waits -- and SPRINGS AT THE CAGE, BATTING at it in midair. The canary SHRIEKS; the cat YOWLS; a WOMAN snatches it up off the floor, cradles it in her arms... WOMAN'S VOICE Now Hecate. You don't want that scrawny little bird -- It's SELINA, looking ripe and slinky in a sheer black ensemble. At the desk behind her is the PENGUIN, in his customary cutaway and waist-coat, polishing his new RAVEN. He bares his teeth: PENGUIN Do you want me to wring that creature's neck? SELINA You try it, I'll do the same to you. (as he grumbles; bemused) I saw him, you know. PENGUIN Saw who? SELINA Batman. He was dreamy. She strokes the cat, in a reverie. The PENGUIN drops his polishing cloth, startled. PENGUIN Dreamy?!? Are you insane!? My God -- (sputtering wildly) Are you sure it was him? What did he do? SELINA He stood on a roof and watched me. He didn't realize I'd seen him. I don't think he knew quite what to make of me. (smiling) But he was definitely interested. This sends the PENGUIN into a frantic round of pacing. (Or waddling.) PENGUIN This scheme of yours is backfiring. We don't need him on our tails. Do you know how much money is at stake here? SELINA Money isn't everything. (casually) What's the point if we can't enjoy ourselves? She chuckles to herself. He stares at her in disbelief -- and SQUAWKS. CUT TO: EXT. GOTHAM SQUARE - MORNING The big SIGN over Gotham Square tells us there are only 9 shopping days left until Christmas. Down below, BRUCE is walking VICKI to work. VICKI Six-on-one, and he took 'em all out...then vanished into a drainage pipe -- right next to the statue of General Wayne. BRUCE My illustrious great-grandfather. Think it's the same kid we heard about? VICKI Must be. He reminded me of you. BRUCE chuckles. They pass a NEWSSTAND just outside the Globe building, pausing to stare at the headlines -- which SCREAM: NEW BAT-MURDER? Batman Suspect in Slaying of Millionaire Developer Commissioner Gordon Refuses Comment The accompanying photo is a full-color spread of the BLOODY RED BAT painted on SHAW's wall. BRUCE scowls at VICKI: BRUCE -- You work for this rag? (snatching up a paper) Your boss is calling for Gordon's resignation -- unless he brings Batman in for questioning... VICKI nudges BRUCE and points at a STOREFRONT across the street. THEIR POV - SOUVENIR SHOP The owner is in the store window, hastily removing all of his Batman merchandise and setting up new displays devoted to TEENAGE MUTANT NINJA TURTLES and THE SIMPSONS. A MOTHER drags her squirming TODDLER past the entrance -- the kid smells heavy markdowns on Bat-shit, but Mom clearly doesn't approve... BACK TO SCENE - ON BRUCE AND VICKI looking on in dismay. BRUCE crumples the paper in outrage: BRUCE I need a good PR man. NEWS VENDOR Hey, pal -- you buyin' or borrowin'? With a sullen look, BRUCE tosses the paper back on the rack. VICKI pulls him off toward the entrance of the Globe. VICKI That's what happens when you go after the rich and powerful. BRUCE Hey, it wasn't me, remember? I am rich and powerful -- As he's talking, BRUCE glances back at the newsstand. He sees an AD FLYER tacked up on one side -- "LOOKING FOR LOVE? Find it in the GOTHAM GLOBE PERSONALS." Looking for Love. Eyes widening, he digs in his pocket for a quarter and races back to the newsstand. VICKI keeps walking... VICKI Maybe it's almost...good. In a weird way. I mean, Shaw, and Barrett -- if people like that were really scared, maybe they'd -- She suddenly realizes she's talking to herself. She turns around and sees BRUCE back at the newsstand, hurriedly unfolding a copy of the Globe. She marches back and tugs at his sleeve. VICKI (cont.) Hey, I'm late for work. You can read that later. BRUCE Quiet. I'm looking for a personal ad. Her face screws up in confusion as BRUCE frantically scans the page. BRUCE (cont.) "Tall, Dark And Handsome -- You saw me on the roof 12/16. I was in black; you were too." VICKI Is this some kind of bad joke? BRUCE It's her. That cat woman, or whatever she is. (reading aloud) "I jumped a bus into Gotham Park hoping you'd follow, but you were too shy..." VICKI What does she want -- a date? BRUCE She's trying to contact me. Says she's gonna leave me another ad... The two of them exchange a look of utter perplexity. BRUCE's mind is racing; he seems bizarrely aroused -- in a way that makes VICKI just a trifle nervous... INT. GOTHAM GLOBE - CITY ROOM - DAY VICKI arrives at her desk and sets her portfolio down. She spots a message in the "in" file. She takes one look at it, and her eyes go wide with RAGE. She storms out in a fury... INT. PUBLISHER'S OFFICE - A MINUTE LATER - DAY Barging past a phalanx of SECRETARIES, VICKI bursts into the inner office of HARRISON J. PROVOST, publisher of the Globe. He's just opening his mail. He heaves a weary sigh as VICKI BARKS at him: VICKI WHY DID YOU KILL MY STORY? PROVOST Close the door. (waiting for her to calm down) Your story isn't news. With Shaw dead -- VICKI But the project's still going ahead! If attacking homeless people in the park isn't news, I'd like to know what is -- PROVOST There's a psycho out there in a mask and cape -- killing off Gotham's most prominent citizens! That's news. (beat) I've known Randall Shaw all my life. His family is in mourning. And it just so happens I don't believe in slandering the dead. VICKI FUMES. She turns and stares PROVOST straight in the eye. VICKI Mr. Provost -- how much money do you have tied up in the Park Tower project? PROVOST Vicki...I'm going to forget you made that remark. For the sake of your job, I suggest you do the same. VICKI stalks of -- and PROVOST goes back to his mail. He finds an envelope addressed in a shaky, psychotic scrawl, with the word "CONFIDENTIAL" underlined three times in ink. He tears it open -- -- and HIS FACE TURNS PALE as he stares down at the contents: a small business-sized card, signed with a BAT-EMBLEM... THOSE WHO FEED ON THE SOUL OF GOTHAM WILL SUFFER MY WRATH CUT TO: EXT. GOTHAM HALL OF JUSTICE - DAY WALTER BARRETT and his ATTORNEY emerge onto the front steps of the courthouse. BARRETT is instantly mobbed by REPORTERS. REPORTER I Mr. Barrett! Any comment on the arraignment? REPORTER II Is it true bail was set at two million dollars? ATTORNEY Stand back! My client has nothing to say at this time! The ATTORNEY clears a path for BARRETT, who climbs into a waiting CAR, shielding his face. REPORTERS cluster around it... As the car pulls out into traffic, we see a flock of PIGEONS taking wing from their perches on the statues outside the Hall of Justice. OVERHEAD SHOT - ON BARRETT'S CAR PIGEONS fill the frame, swooping down toward the CAR, which is idling at a traffic light far below. INT. BARRETT'S CAR - THAT MOMENT The liveried DRIVER drums his fingers as he waits for the light to change. BARRETT's in the back, speaking into his cellular phone. BARRETT It's time we called an emergency meeting of the Raven Society. Get back to me... Looking troubled, he hangs up. A fat white glob of PIGEON SHIT splatters across the windshield. Seconds later -- another SPLAT. BARRETT (cont.) Damn pigeons. DRIVER Just washed it, too. The DRIVER reaches for the wiper switch. They hear a tiny DINK as a SOLID PELLET bounces off the windshield. BARRETT and the DRIVER exchange a mystified look. A small, blinking CAPSULE has just lodged in the wiper-blade assembly... OVERHEAD SHOT - ON BARRETT'S CAR Just as the light changes, the CAR EXPLODES into a million fragments -- leaving a BLACKENED CRATER in the middle of the intersection. CUT TO: INT. BATCAVE - DAY TIGHT ON A VIDEO MONITOR -- showing FIRE TRUCKS in the intersection we've just left, hosing down the wreckage of BARRETT's car. BRUCE is watching intently when ALFRED appears behind him. ALFRED The Fluegelheim called again, sir. They want to know if you'll be attending the opening of the new Egyptian exhibit. BRUCE, still engrossed in his news broadcast, waves ALFRED off. BRUCE Cancel. ANCHORWOMAN (on TV) -- and, citing new evidence in the so- called string of "millionaire murders," Police Commissioner J.T. Gordon today swore out a warrant for the arrest of Batman. (beat) We go now live to Mike Sekowsky, spokesperson, Order of the Bat. SEKOWSKY Jeez! Talk about gratitude -- !! At the sight of SEKOWSKY's face, BRUCE kills the sound in disgust. ALFRED looks on helplessly as he paces the floor of the Batcave. BRUCE Well, Alfred, it's official. I'm a wanted man. (beat) "New evidence"...I've gotta find that woman. Did you check the personals? As ALFRED shakes his head no, a BUZZER sounds. They've got a visitor. BRUCE hits a switch on a monitor, and sees COMMISSIONER GORDON'S CAR sitting outside the wrought-iron gates of Wayne Manor. He throws a nervous look at ALFRED. ALFRED speaks into a microphone: ALFRED Who's there? GORDON Jim Gordon, Alfred. I've got to see Bruce. A spooky development. Does GORDON suspect? After a moment's hesitation, BRUCE nods to ALFRED -- let him in. ALFRED Mr. Wayne will see you, sir. INT. BRUCE'S LIBRARY - A MOMENT LATER A curious BRUCE ushers GORDON into the library, gestures toward the liquor cabinet. The Commissioner nods his head no. He's fidgety, ill at ease -- he obviously doesn't want to be here. GORDON Sorry to bother you. Bruce -- I'll get right down to it. You knew Shaw and Barrett -- BRUCE I saw them occasionally. We all sat on the board of the Fluegelheim... GORDON Did you have any...dealings with them, or -- BRUCE No. I never liked the way they did business. GORDON The thing is, Bruce, you're all lumped together in the public mind -- the Five Families of Gotham, that sort of thing -- and, uh... (taking a card from his pocket) Harrison Provost got this in the mail. BRUCE examines the card, -- "THOSE WHO FEED," etc. He stares at GORDON in mock-concern, playing it close to the vest... BRUCE Then Batman is behind all this. GORDON Batman or a damned good imitation. BRUCE Well. He's changed tactics, hasn't he. GORDON (shrugging; at a loss) Shaw, with his high-rises -- Barrett, a druglord, major polluter -- they weren't exactly model citizens. Who knows, it could be some crazy social-conscience kind of thing. BRUCE You mean he's going after...the root of the problem. GORDON shakes his head and gets up to go. BRUCE hands him the card. GORDON Let me know if you get one of these. We'll put all our resources at your disposal. BRUCE nods thoughtfully as ALFRED appears to see the Commissioner out. A moment later, the butler reappears. BRUCE Changed my mind, Alfred. I'll be dropping in on the Fluegelheim after all. CUT TO: INT. FLUEGELHEIM MUSEUM - NIGHT It's a party to celebrate the opening of the new Egyptian exhibit, and the Fluegelheim is hopping. BOARD MEMBERS, MUSEUM PATRONS, and SOCIALITES mill about in dinner jackets and evening gowns, making small talk. AN OPEN SARCOPHAGUS has been set up as a wet bar. On a raised concrete platform in the center of the hall, rimmed by a decorative moat, sits an ancient Egyptian SHRINE. The TEMPLE OF BASTET has been moved to Gotham and reconstructed in the Fluegelheim --sandstone walls, fountains, statuary and all. Guarding the entrance is a stately bronze statue of the goddess BASTET -- who has the body of a woman and the head of a pointy-eared CAT. She holds an aegis and a sistrum; four tiny KITTENS romp at her feet. BRUCE, who's just arrived, is taking an intense interest in the cat-goddess... VICKI What is it? BRUCE I just had a weird sense of deja vu. He glances over by the sarcophagus and sees PROVOST, the publisher, huddle with ELIOT TIPTREE III, transit magnate -- the remaining member of Gotham's "Five Families." The two of them are engaged in some urgent conversation which he can't quite make out... TIPTREE Harrison -- we really ought to warn Bruce. We owe him that much. BRUCE detaches himself from VICKI and strolls toward them. PROVOST and TIPTREE force smiles and wave, affecting an air of nonchalance. PROVOST (cont.) The man's a space cadet. Let him look out for himself. (as BRUCE arrives; cheerfully) Why, Bruce! What a delightful surprise. BRUCE Good to see you two. Looks like the Five Families are suddenly down to three. (looking around) In fact, if somebody dropped a bomb on this room right now -- TIPTREE chuckles nervously. PROVOST is even less amused. PROVOST Is that your idea of a joke, Bruce? BRUCE Not at all. Commissioner Gordon seems to think we should all be hiring bodyguards. TIPTREE PROVOST Oh, that's absurd. I already have. The two of them glower at each other. It's like an outtake from The Newlywed Game. BRUCE shrugs it off and makes a vacuous face: BRUCE Thing is, I can't imagine why Batman would be after us. Can you? PROVOST and TIPTREE are about to go into another round of hemming-and-hawing when a NEW FACE joins the party. It's SELINA KYLE -- stunning as ever in an extravagantly revealing dress slit up to the armpits. She's holding two glasses of CHAMPAGNE... SELINA You two look like you need a drink. -- And is this who I think it is? She flashes BRUCE her most winning, seductive, heavy-artillery SMILE. He BLINKS, temporarily speechless. PROVOST Selina Kyle -- Bruce Wayne. SELINA Our absentee board member! I've been wanting to meet you forever. TIPTREE Selina's the new Curator of Antiquities. She brought the Temple over block by block -- SELINA You two won't be terribly upset if I borrow Bruce for a moment, will you? Before he can protest, she's linked an arm around his and dragged him off. A nearby FAT MAN spots SELINA, wiggles his eyebrows and WAVES BRIGHTLY. His tongue is practically hanging out -- he's just dying to write her a check. SELINA SIGHS WEARILY to BRUCE: SELINA (cont.) Major contributor. -- I always seem to wind up in charge of fund-raising... BRUCE I can't imagine why. SELINA Tax year's almost over, you know. I hope we can count on your usual generous donation. (indicating PROVOST and TIPTREE) Someone's got to set an example for those two tightwads. BRUCE They're proccupied. This string of murders -- SELINA I asked them if they'd consider including us in their wills. (chuckling to herself) They didn't seem a bit amused... ANGLE ON VICKI - THAT MOMENT She's making small talk with a bunch of STUFFED SHIRTS and their overdressed WIVES. She glances across the room at the statue of Bastet, sees SELINA draped all over BRUCE. A frown crosses her face... ANGLE ON BRUCE AND SELINA - THAT MOMENT She's still clinging to his arm as they stare up at the statue. SELINA -- and this is my good friend Bastet, the Egyptian Cat Goddess. BRUCE I think we've already met. -- This is quite an expedition you've put together. SELINA I'm glad you think so. I have to say, Bruce -- you're not at all what I expected. BRUCE Sorry to disappoint you. SELINA Oh, it's not that. Not at all. It's just that I'd always heard you were... BRUCE What? SELINA (coyly) Oh...sort of a... BRUCE (smiling; fascinated) No. Come on. What? BRUCE's state of mounting infatuation is abruptly shattered when VICKI sidles up alongside him and -- territorially -- takes his other arm. The women exchange big, toothy, plastic smiles; stranded in the middle, BRUCE realizes they're waiting for him to introduce them. BRUCE Oh. Selina Kyle -- my friend Vicki Vale. SELINA The photographer. I've seen your pictures in the Gazette. VICKI The Globe. SELINA Oh, that's right. The tabloid one. -- What an original dress! VICKI, still smiling, cocks an eyebrow at BRUCE. He senses trouble coming and tries to head it off at the pass. BRUCE Selina supervised the reconstruction of the temple. Brought it back from Egypt... stone by stone. VICKI Really. She must be awfully tired. (to SELINA) How'd you get to be in charge of a huge project like this? SELINA It was easy. I slept with the Pharoah. She laughs at her own joke. VICKI responds with a dry little chuckle of her own. SELINA gives BRUCE a SHARP YANK on the sleeve. SELINA (cont.) Excuse us, won't you, sweetheart? We have some boring museum business to talk about. VICKI fumes. BRUCE shrugs apologetically as SELINA drags him off out of earshot. SELINA (cont.) I. Short leash. BRUCE Pull in the claws, okay? She's really terrific. SELINA I'm sorry, Bruce. Sometimes I get a little...aggressive, you know? (handing him a card) Look, I need to talk to you. Come by sometime. I'll give you the private tour. BRUCE Wait. Let me explain about Vicki -- SELINA (shushing him) I understand. Anyone who's that protective must have a pretty good reason for it. She shoots him one last smile -- sly, conspiratorial, unmistakably juicy. Then she's off in pursuit of another major funder. BRUCE is thoughtfully turning the card over in his hands when VICKI rejoins him. VICKI How's "business"? BRUCE Relax, okay? I like you better. He scans the room, trying to find PROVOST and TIPTREE. No luck. VICKI If you're looking for your fellow millionaires, they left some time back. CUT TO: INT. ROOFTOP - NIGHT The roof of the Gotham Globe. A STARLING circles overhead for a moment -- then DIVES down an exposed VENTILATION SHAFT. INT. GOTHAM GLOBE - THAT MOMENT TWO ARMED BODYGUARDS are standing watch outside an office. Brass letters on the door read "J. HARRISON PROVOST, PUBLISHER." INT. PROVOST'S OFFICE - THAT MOMENT PROVOST, agitated, working late. He speaks, sotto voce, into the phone: PROVOST Don't worry about that. I've had the office swept for bugs. No one's listening... INT. TIPTREE'S LIBRARY - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT TIPTREE in his paneled study at home. There's an open bottle on the table and he's been hitting the sauce -- hard. His VOICE QUAVERS: TIPTREE It's just so -- unfair. I mean...it was over a century ago. It's not like we're responsible. (hollow-eyed) How could he know? How could Batman know about the Raven Society?? INT. OFFICE - ON PROVOST - THAT MOMENT PROVOST Who knows and who cares. The point is, it's happened... He hears a CHIRP and looks up. It seems to be coming from a HEATING VENT on the wall. But then it stops, so he resumes his conversation -- PROVOST (cont.) I'm clearing out of the country, and I'm taking the raven with me. I suggest you do the same. INT. HEATING VENT - THAT MOMENT In the metal shaft on the other side of the grate is a tiny BIRD -- the same one we saw flying down the air shaft. Now that we've got a close-up view, we can see the thin BATTERY PACK wired to its underbelly...and the MINIATURE MICROPHONE taped to its leg. PROVOST (O.S.) I'll tell you how to reach me. And don't repeat this to anyone. CUT TO: INT. PENGUIN'S LAIR - DAY The PENGUIN stands over his indoor penguin pool. He's wearing rubber gloves, feeding LIVE FISH from an ice chest to his arctic birds. The vents in the windows are open, and the climate in the room is downright icy as SELINA's wrapped in fur, stroking her pet cat: SELINA He's just another rich idiot. (chuckling to herself) The odd thing is, he didn't seem a bit concerned. PENGUIN Then he is an idiot. SELINA He lives in some big sprawling manor. I'll have to get inside, scope it out... see where he's got the raven stashed. PENGUIN How do you plan to do that? SELINA How do you think! A feline smile from SELINA. The PENGUIN chuckles to himself, lobs a FISH out over the pool. A swooping GULL snatches it out of the air before it hits the water. FRICK arrives in the doorway. FRICK It's Mr. Provost, sir. He's planning to embark on an unscheduled Christmas vacation. PENGUIN Good! That should save us a trip to the bank. CUT TO: INT. FLUEGELHEIM - BACK ROOM - DAY A huge open room cluttered with all kinds of junk: archaeologist's tools, restoration equipment, etc., plus a healthy assortment of curios and oddities from all over. This is SELINA's private domain. CAMERA TRACKS past a glass case full of ugly, withered, turdlike specimens... BRUCE What have we got here? SELINA Mummified cats. Bastet's sacred animal. They were buried by the thousands at Bubastis. -- Oh, careful! BRUCE FREEZES with his hand poised over a set of four earthen JARS. Each has a lid carved in the shape of a HEAD: ape, jackal, man, falcon. SELINA (cont.) Canopic jars. In the process of mummification, the internal organs were buried separately. (pointing to each jar in turn) Lungs -- stomach -- liver -- intestine -- BRUCE withdraws his hand with a bemused shudder. BRUCE You're in a gruesome line of work. SELINA Keeps me interested. And that's not easy to do... BRUCE's attention turns to a crumbling statuette of an odd beast: a WINGED LION with the head of a FALCON. BRUCE This one I know. It's a gryphon, right? SELINA Very good. A mythical demon, half-bird, half-lion...sweeping down from the sky to deliver retribution and justice. BRUCE nods. He can dig it. He regards the gryphon for a long moment and CHUCKLES. BRUCE Poor guy. Birds and cats -- you wouldn't think the two halves would cooperate. SELINA Only under certain circumstances. (beat) I'm really glad you came, Bruce. I was afraid I'd given you the wrong impression. Or maybe it was the right impression. BRUCE What was it you wanted to talk to me about? SELINA Your collection. I'd love to see it. I mean, everyone says you've got a fabulous -- She breaks off in midstream and chuckles to herself. She toys demurely with her equipment. She looks up at BRUCE and switches tactics -- going for the direct approach. BRUCE braces himself... SELINA (cont.) Mainly I just wanted an excuse to see you again. Does she know you're here -- Vicki? BRUCE (shrugging) No. SELINA It must be strange. Having all that power, and money -- never really knowing if that's what people are attracted to. BRUCE What are you attracted to? SELINA I think you're a little bit nuts. (beat) I think you're a little -- bored with your life. Having everything you want. No variety, no...danger. And every once in a while you need to take a risk. Shake it all up. BRUCE How? SELINA Maybe by...coming here today. She leans back against a crate, moistens her lips. She's letting him have it with both barrels. SELINA (cont.) That's one thing I can give you, Bruce -- danger -- a little something you can't get at home. BRUCE hesitates -- but the lure is irresistible. He moves forward slowly; SELINA's eyes close; their lips draw slowly closer... ...and he SNEEZES IN HER FACE. She backs off in shock as he covers his face. His eyes are watering and he's WHEEZING. She rushes over -- SELINA Are you okay? BRUCE Is there a cat in here? Right on cue, SELINA's black cat HECATE lets out a loud MEOW -- and STRETCHES against BRUCE's pants leg. He brushes the animal aside and it LEAPS into SELINA's arms. BRUCE sniffles uncontrollably. BRUCE (cont.) Get it away! She drops the cat, which scampers off. BRUCE rubs his eyes. SELINA Poor thing. You're allergic! BRUCE Yeah, cats...ever since I was a kid... (snorting and weeping) Look, I'd better get some fresh air. Maybe another time, okay... He heads for the door before SELINA can stop him. He's gone, but she knows she's left a dent in his armor. She smiles in bemusement as HECATE jumps into her arms and PURRS. EXT. FLUEGELHEIM - A MOMENT LATER - DAY BRUCE stumbles out the museum feeling mildly discombobulated. He marches down the front steps past a NEWSSTAND -- where he stops to buy a copy of the afternoon GLOBE. He opens it to the PERSONAL ADS and finds what he's been waiting for: TALL, DARK, AND HANDSOME -- Christmas is coming. Why don't we trim the tree together? This puzzles him for a moment -- until he looks up the street. In the distance, at the very center of Gotham Square, WORKMEN are stringing lights around an enormous CHRISTMAS TREE, almost fifty feet tall. The LIGHTING CEREMONY is an annual event in Gotham. BRUCE smiles slightly, tucks the paper under one arm and walks to his car. DISSOLVE TO: EXT. GOTHAM SQUARE - NIGHT SNOW falls on a huge CROWD gathered around the big tree. The tree won't be lit for another twenty minutes or so, and so the ONLOOKERS are singing CHRISTMAS CAROLS from printed lyric sheets. A BAND is playing on a makeshift ORCHESTRA PLATFORM erected in front of the tree, leading the crowd in a spirited rendition of "God Rest Ye Merry, Gentlemen." The Square is rocking with good will toward men. When they get to the part about saving us all from Satan's power -- EXT. ROOFTOP OVERLOOKING SQUARE - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT -- the CAMERA TILTS UPWARD to BATMAN, watching the action from his usual gargoyle's perch. He's scanning the streets and the rooftops, waiting tor the CATWOMAN to make her move -- whatever it is. He glances at the building directly across the square from him. On the roof is a neon sign reading Gotham City Globe in ornate old-English letters -- and above that, a ROTATING METAL SCULPTURE of the world turning. His eyes rove downward along the facade of the building... EXT. GOTHAM GLOBE - THAT MOMENT At street level, an ARMORED CAR has pulled up in front of the Globe offices. THREE SECURITY GUARDS with rifles climb out of the ARMORED CAR, followed by a FOURTH -- who has an OBLONG BOX handcuffed to his wrist. Of course, we can't see what's inside, but to those of us in the know the box looks just about the right size for a RAVEN STATUETTE. The GUARDS scan the street and enter the building without incident. As they do, a NEWSPAPER DELIVERY VAN crosses the frame; mounted on its side is an ADVERTISING PLACARD which reads: BATMAN: HERO OR MENACE? Read All About It in the GOTHAM GLOBE! EXT. ROOFTOP - ON BATMAN He watches with some curiosity. An armored car: is this some part of the CATWOMAN's scheme? But no...the GUARDS are safely inside the building, and the CAR is leaving. He settles back to wait. INT. NEWSPAPER DELIVERY VAN - THAT MOMENT The innocuous-looking VAN rounds the corner of the Globe building. FRICK is at the wheel, FRACK is riding shotgun, and the PENGUIN is between them, peering out eagerly through the windshield. They turn into the Globe's BASEMENT GARAGE -- where dozens of similar vans are parked at the LOADING BAYS. Just part of the fleet... INT. PROVOST'S OFFICE - A MOMENT LATER The quartet of SECURITY GUARDS arrive at PROVOST's office. The publisher has already packed his suitcases for a speedy getaway. The LEAD GUARD -- the one cuffed to the RAVEN BOX -- sets his precious cargo on a desk and stands discreetly at arm's length while PROVOST unlocks it and checks its contents. Satisfied, he slams it shut. He reaches into his top drawer for an ENVELOPE, which he hands to his PERSONAL SECRETARY. PROVOST Open this in an hour. Phone my wife and tell her where to meet me. (to the GUARDS; edgily) No trouble on the way, I take it? LEAD GUARD No sir, Mr. Provost. We came straight from the bank vault. GUARD II 'Copter should be just touching down. We'll have you safely out of here in no time. EXT. ROOFTOP - ON BATMAN "Here Comes Santa Claus" echoes up from the streets. BATMAN watches as a COPTER descends toward the HELIPAD on the roof of the Globe... INT. CORRIDOR OUTSIDE OFFICE - A MOMENT LATER PROVOST and the LEAD GUARD with the raven box are at an elevator bank. The other GUARDS head for a stairwell. GUARD II We'll check the stairs. See you on the roof. The LEAD GUARD starts to press the UP button, but PROVOST pulls a key from his pocket instead: PROVOST No -- my private elevator. It's safer. INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT - THAT MOMENT shooting DOWN on the car as it rises. The shaft above it is filled with BIRDS -- starlings, crows, pigeons and the like, swooping and gliding among the gears and cables... EXT. ROOF OF GLOBE BUILDING - THAT MOMENT In BG, the helicopter on its pad, idling noisily, the rotors still spinning. In FG, the small dormer-like structure that houses the STAIRWAY. The metal access door opens, and the first of the GUARDS steps warily out, rifle at the ready. He smiles back at his pal. GUARD No way. They don't pay us enough to tangle with Batm-- A black-gloved, CHROME-TALONED HAND snakes around the edge of the dormer and RAKES ACROSS HIS THROAT... INT. ELEVATOR CAR - THAT MOMENT SWEAT beads up on PROVOST's lip as the GUARD hits the up button and the car begins to rise. Suddenly, the LIGHTS GO OUT. The car stops with a lurch. PROVOST What is it?? What's happening?? Suddenly, there in the darkness, they hear a series of loud POPPING SOUNDS...which could be gunfire... EXT. GOTHAM SQUARE - THAT MOMENT - ON CROWD singing "Here Comes Santa Claus" at the top of their lungs. Happy faces beam. No one hears anything unusual over the music... EXT. ROOFTOP - ACROSS STREET - ON BATMAN BATMAN straining to listen. We get another faint series of POPS -- barely audible over the CAROLING from below, and the loud PUTT-PUTT-PUTT of the helicopter blades. He can't really be sure he's heard anything at all. He scans the roof of the Globe building, but he can't see what's happening beyond the big steel globe sculpture and the neon sign... EXT. GLOBE BUILDING - ROOFTOP - THAT MOMENT The CATWOMAN lets fly with another burst of automatic fire from the dead GUARD's rifle. The helicopter is still idling, but no one's left to fly it -- the rooftop is littered with stiffs... INT. ELEVATOR CAR - THAT MOMENT PITCH BLACK. Pre-verbal GROANS and MURMURINGS OF FEAR issue from the darkness. An EERIE RED LIGHT kicks on -- the emergency generators -- and we see PROVOST backed up in a corner of the car, twitching and jumping like a crazed spastic. The GUARD, in a futile effort to placate him, points up at the LIGHT: GUARD There. Mr. Provost. See? The generator's kicked in. It's just an electrical problem. PROVOST is only marginally consoled. They hear a strange TWITTERING NOISE in the shaft above them... PROVOST starts babbling again. The GUARD slaps him across the face. But the TWITTERING has him a bit concerned as well. He stares up at the ceiling of the car as he PUNCHES BUTTONS on the panel; with another LURCH, the car begins to move. GUARD There. See? It's moving. We're fine. PROVOST It's going down. We're going DOWN!!! INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT - THAT MOMENT The BIRDS in the shaft have all ROOSTED on the TOP OF THE CAR. They're patiently riding it down as it descends... INT. ELEVATOR CAR - THAT MOMENT The car stops again. PROVOST is totally losing it. The exasperated GUARD grabs him and SHAKES HIM. GUARD Okay, Mr. Provost -- I'm gonna have a look through the trap door. But I need you to help me. Okay? You have to help. PROVOST nods and tries to get a grip on himself. The GUARD looks up at the trap door in the ceiling of the car. He can't reach it... He uncuffs the BOX containing PROVOST'S RAVEN from his wrist -- and STANDS on it. Still short. Unholstering his gun and using it as a prod, he can almost reach the trap door. He JUMPS UP and, poking with the gun, manages to dislodge the panel slightly. More TWITTERING. PROVOST and the guard look up through the tiny crack in the ceiling and see nothing but darkness. GUARD Probably just some bird that's gotten in the shaft. Now calm down. You'll have to give me a boost. The GUARD climbs back atop the raven box. PROVOST gives him a boost and he manages to catch hold of the lip of the trap door. GUARD (cont.) Okay, help me out...steady... PROVOST wraps both arms around the GUARD's wriggling LEGS and tries to hoist him upward. INT. SHAFT - ON ROOF OF CAR - THAT MOMENT From a vantage level with the roof of the car, we see the GUARD'S FINGERS, clinging to the lip of the trap door. Now his HEAD rises into view, pushing the panel aside as he pulls himself upward. He peers around. His BROW wrinkles as he sees a bizarre sight -- PASSELS of SQUAWKING BIRDS, walking back and forth in front of him, STRUTTING and PREENING mere inches from his face... INT. ELEVATOR CAR - THAT MOMENT The bottom half of the GUARD dangles from the ceiling. PROVOST still has his arms wrapped around the GUARD's knees. All at once, the GUARD begins to SCREAM -- his body JERKS and his legs KICK WILDLY. Still PROVOST struggles to hang on -- even as BLOOD spatters across the top of his bald dome... Finally, the GUARD's violent spasms are too much. PROVOST trips over the raven box, stumbles backward and lands on his ass in a corner of the car. The GUARD tumbles in a heap to the elevator floor, his face PECKED and CLAWED beyond recognition, his eyes gone altogether. PROVOST lets out a series of SHRIEKS. He peers at the open trap door, sees the BIRDS staring curiously down at him, and SHRIEKS AGAIN. The EMERGENCY TELEPHONE rings. He stares at it. It rings again. Shielding his eyes and screwing up his courage, PROVOST crawls across the floor and reaches for the receiver. PENGUIN (V.O.; filter) Sixteenth floor. Linens, housewares, ladies' lingerie! PROVOST W-who is this?? INT. GLOBE - BASEMENT LOADING BAY - THAT MOMENT NEWSPAPER DELIVERY VANS are parked in neat rows -- all driverless. FRICK is sitting with a boxful of electrical equipment next to a bank of ELEVATORS; all the cars have been LOCKED OPEN here in the basement, except for ONE -- PROVOST's private elevator, the doors to which are still closed. The PENGUIN stands beside it, speaking into a RED PHONE. PENGUIN Mr. Provost? If you want to get out of that car alive, I suggest you follow my instructions to the letter. As he talks, we see various NEWSPAPER EMPLOYEES sprawled on the concrete nearby, DEAD. A CORRUGATED METAL DOOR has been lowered over the LOADING BAY, separating the newspaper production staff from the VAN POOL. They're trapped on the other side. BANGING AWAY LOUDLY on the door... PENGUIN (cont.) SHUT UP IN THERE. (calmly; into phone) You should see a cord hanging just behind you. INT. ELEVATOR CAR - THAT MOMENT PROVOST looks over his shoulder and sees the aforementioned CORD descending through the trap door. PROVOST Yes -- yes, I see it -- PENGUIN (V.O; filter) Tie the cord to the handle of your box. PROVOST lets the phone drop. He grits his teeth, but hastens to obey. As he's knotting the cord around the handle of the box, a DINKY BIRD flutters down through the trap and sends him into a panic. Practically weeping, he reaches for the phone. PENGUIN (V.O.; filter) When you're done, I want you to give two sharp yanks on the cord. Cowering in terror, PROVOST reaches for the cord and yanks it twice. PROVOST Who are you?? Why are you doing this?? INT. LOADING BAY - ON PENGUIN Behind him, FRICK and FRACK are pulling on RED BERETS and BATMAN SWEATSHIRTS -- Order of the Bat gear. FRICK climbs into a NEWSPAPER DELIVERY VAN and starts the engine. PENGUIN Well, Mr. Provost, I guess you could call me an irate reader. And to be perfectly frank -- I'm doing this because I hate Garfield. Chuckling, the PENGUIN holds a SONIC DEVICE up to the mouthpiece of the phone. INT. ELEVATOR CAR - THAT MOMENT A SHRILL WHINE emanates from the receiver. All at once, the elevator car is FULL OF BIRDS -- squawking wildly, flinging themselves against the wall, going insane in the tiny confined space. PROVOST is screaming like a madman. The birds are in his hair, his face -- everywhere. He fights his way over to the panel and begins punching buttons in a frenzy... All at once the car PLUNGES DOWNWARD. It's as if the floor has DROPS AWAY beneath PROVOST's feet -- he's in FREE-FALL. INT. LOADING BAY - ON PENGUIN PENGUIN Going down! He hangs up the phone and steps a discreet distance back from the ELEVATOR DOORS. INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT - THAT MOMENT The RAVEN BOX dangles from its cord in FG as the CAR rockets uncontrollably downward. A steady stream ot BIRDS are making a quick exit from the trap door in the roof... INT. TOP-FLOOR LANDING - THAT MOMENT The CATWOMAN's on a landing near the stairwell, just below the dormer that leads to the roof. She pries open a pair of ELEVATOR DOORS... ...and a FLOCK of BIRDS pours out of the empty shaft, making for the open ACCESS DOOR a half-story above. She reaches inside, finds the cord attached to the RAVEN BOX, and reels it in. She rips off the lock and opens the box for a quick look at her trophy. It's there, all right -- another RAVEN just like the first two. An awful CRASH, from twenty-five stories down, RATTLES THE SHAFT... She makes a disgusted face, grabs the RAVEN, and bolts for the roof. EXT. ROOFTOP ACROSS STREET - ON BATMAN He watches in puzzlement as a VAST FLOCK OF BIRDS takes flight from the Globe roof across the square. Something weird is definitely going on. He's about to abandon his post -- -- but down below, the CAROLERS have stopped CAROLING. The big tree's about to be lit, and they're counting off the seconds: CROWD Ten! Nine!... EXT. GOTHAM SQUARE - CORNER NEWSTAND A ramshackle kiosk at street level. The NEWS VENDOR has stepped out onto the sidewalk to watch the tree festivities. A GLOBE DELIVERY VAN, its side bearing the "BATMAN -- HERO OR MENACE?" advertisement, cruises past and dumps a bundle of papers on the curb. EXT. GOTHAM SQUARE - ON CROWD AT TREE EXCITEMENT is BUILDING as the seconds tick off: CROWD ...Three! Two! One! The CHRISTMAS LIGHTS come on, and the CROWD breaks into CHEERS. The ORCHESTRA strikes up a sprightly version of "JINGLE BELLS." EXT. GOTHAM SQUARE - ON NEWSTAND The NEWS VENDOR is applauding and singing along like everyone else when a second newspaper van rumbles past... NEWS VENDOR Hey! No! I aleady got a -- He spots TWO MASKED MEN in the doorway of the van -- wearing RED BERETS and BAT-SHIRTS. They shove a BODY out the door -- The mutilated corpse of HARRISON PROVOST lands on the sidewalk with a THUD -- right beside a bundle of NEWSPAPERS which read "BATMAN MURDER SPREE BAFFLES POLICE." EXT. GOTHAM SQUARE - ON VAN - MOVING The NEWS VENDOR chases after the VAN, but it's already rounded a corner and is cruising along the periphery of Gotham Square. The CROWD is still singing merrily, unaware of its presence -- -- until the BACK DOORS fly open -- and a swarm of RABID, CHITTERING BATS screech out into the midst of the crowd!! EXT. GOTHAM SQUARE - ON CROWD AT TREE The CAROLERS break into MASS HYSTERIA as HIDEOUS BATS swoop down from above, CLAWING at their heads and shoulders. ORCHESTRA MEMBERS drop their instruments and stagger off the BAND PLATFORM, falling into the branches of the giant Christmas tree. EXT. GOTHAM SQUARE - ON SIDEWALKS CHRISTMAS SHOPPERS are teeming in and out of nearby STORES. They drop their SHOPPING BAGS and race about in utter CHAOS as the bats attack. WOMEN SCREAM. CHILDREN SCREAM. MEN SCREAM TOO. A MAN staggers backward through a GLASS STOREFRONT and lands on his butt in a WINDOW DISPLAY -- a big mechanical SANTA CLAUS on his North-Pole throne, chuckling merrily in a prerecorded voice: "HO HO HO." The MAN STRUGGLES WILDLY as the BATS converge on him. INT. DEPARTMENT STORE - THAT MOMENT HORRIFIED SHOPPERS scatter through the aisles as the BATS pour in through the broken window. WOMEN lined up for a FREE MAKEOVER squeal in panic as BATS arrive to rearrange their hairdos. EXT. ROOFTOP - ON BATMAN He stares down stunned at the PANDEMONIUM raging below. He glances across the street...and sees the TINY SILHOUETTE of a WOMAN standing atop the cast-iron GLOBE SCULPTURE, LAUGHING at the chaos, TAUNTING him. EXT. STREETS - OVERHEAD ANGLE - THAT MOMENT A few blocks away from Gotham Square. SIRENS HOWL. There's a steady stream of COP CARS speeding toward the site of the disturbance. One vehicle is moving in the opposite direction, against traffic -- a NEWSPAPER DELIVERY VAN. EXT. GLOBE BUILDING - ROOFTOP - A MOMENT LATER BATMAN touches down on the roof and stares in horror at the CORPSES strewn across the helipad. A dying GUARD raises a shaky hand... BATMAN crouches beside him. A GURGLE comes up from his throat and a bubble of BLOOD swells on his lips. All at once he hears a WOMAN'S VOICE from the shadows of the GLOBE SCULPTURE... CATWOMAN (O.S.) Some people just can't take discipline. (beat) Go ahead. Finish 'em off... His head jerks up. He can't see anything. A sudden WHOOSHING noise, and now the voice is coming from the other side of the roof. CATWOMAN (O.S.) You might as well. You're going to get blamed for it anyway. He stands. He gets a quick glimpse of a FELINE SHADOW springing past a skylight; she's jumping all around the roof, clinging to exposed pipes and fixtures. He reaches for a Batarang. CATWOMAN (O.S.) Oh, come on, angel. You know you want to. (purring loudly) Besides -- I want to see how you do it! BATMAN Who are you? He's barely gotten it out when she SLAMS INTO HIM from behind, feet first, knocking him to the rooftop. He tries to get up, but she comes at him with a couple of CARTWHEELING KICKS, knocking him back into a cornice. He ducks right just as a SHARP SPIKED HEEL strikes the exposed brick a mere three inches from his throat. He catches her leg, upends her -- but she somersaults away and lands on her feet. Cats always do... CATWOMAN My, aren't we frisky tonight. He flings the BATARANG. It CLANGS into the big NEON SIGN as she SPRINGS up into the darkness, out of reach. GLASS TUBING shatters and SPARKS FLY as she calls down from the shadows -- CATWOMAN I should tell you -- I've got nine lives to play with -- and you've only got one... He turns -- she drops DIRECTLY ONTO HIM -- and locked in a death grip, they STAGGER BACKWARDS across the roof, directly toward the HELICOPTER. The huge ROTOR BLADES are still turning... BATMAN ducks instinctively and the CATWOMAN breaks free -- FALLING BACKWARD onto the roof. It's a strategic move: when he rushes at her, she BRACES HERSELF against the ground and KICKS UPWARD with startling force. This time the spiked heel connects -- LIFTING BATMAN off his feet, KNOCKING HIM BACKWARD into the TAIL of the HELICOPTER. He slumps there, stunned -- and before he knows it, she's on him. She grabs his THROAT with one hand and clamps the other around his CROTCH. He tries to break her grip, but she's just as strong as he is. And she's LIFTING him -- forcing him upward, toward the REAR STABILIZING ROTOR on the tail of the helicopter! The rear ROTOR BLADES WHINE LIKE A BUZZSAW as his head rises perilously closer. At the last possible instant, he grabs a handful of her HAIR -- YANKS IT as hard as he can -- With a YOWL, she releases him. They tumble to the roof and she DIVES ATOP HIM. Her TALONS click into place -- he sees them poised directly above his EYES -- -- but manages to slam an ELBOW under her chin before she can strike. Now they're disentangled; they get up groggily and circle each other... SOMEONE IS BANGING on the metal door that leads up to the roof, trying to break it down. BATMAN turns for an instant -- a sudden CRACK -- -- and he finds himself all wrapped up in the CATWOMAN's CAT- O'-NINE-TAILS...which is also outfitted with a TASER. She sends a PARALYZING ELECTRIC CHARGE through his body and he collapses to the roof in a jittering heap. The BANGING on the door is louder... CATWOMAN Did I tell you I invited company? -- Keep 'em busy, angel, I've gotta scat. She kneels down and plants a BIG WET KISS on his twitching face. Then she scurries to the edge of the roof, DISAPPEARING -- -- just as the DOOR gives way -- and an ARMED SWAT TEAM comes crashing out onto the roof! Just coming around, BATMAN tries to roll out of sight -- but the COPS are swarming the place. They spot the BODIES on the tar and gravel, see BATMAN scuttling for cover, and draw the obvious conclusion. Pulling guns, they OPEN FIRE. BULLETS RICOCHET off the big metal GLOBE. BATMAN, as is customary in these situations, shoots a GRAPPLING HOOK at the roof of the next building over -- which is a couple of stories taller than the Globe -- and REELS HIMSELF UPWARD along the side wall. The SWAT COPS score a couple of dead hits which set him swinging like a pendulum, but his body armor holds and he clings to the line long enough to reach the roof. CUT TO: INT. NEWSPAPER VAN - MOVING - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT FRlCK and FRACK, still in their Order-of-the-Bat garb, are in the front seats; the PENGUIN is leaning out the side door. Someone's obviously tipped the COPS about the source of all the ruckus -- -- because a pair of POLICE CARS are on their tail and gaining fast. Still hanging in the doorway, the PENGUIN raises his UMBRELLA, peers down its length like a RIFLE SIGHT, and PULLS A TRIGGER. ANGLE ON SQUAD CAR - MOVING - THAT MOMENT A SONIC DART -- one of the PENGUIN'S BIRD MAGNETS -- lodges itself in the GRILLE of the foremost POLICE CAR. INT. SQUAD CAR - MOVING - THAT MOMENT The COPS in the car react in astonishment as PIGEONS begin HURLING THEMSELVES at the WINDSHIELDS. A DOZEN KAMIKAZE BIRDS bounce off in rapid succession. CRACKS begin to spread across the glass. The COPS can't see where they're driving. The car SWERVES WILDLY. And still the PIGEONS KEEP COMING -- COVERING THE WINDSHIELD -- TOTALLY OBSCURING THE STREETS FROM VIEW... EXT. STREETS - ON SQUAD CARS - THAT MOMENT The first car, COMPLETELY COVERED WITH BIRDS, smacks into a LAMPPOST and SKIDS. The second car CRASHES INTO IT. And the pigeons continue to pour down from the heavens, SWARMING onto the immobilized squad cars. INT. NEWSPAPER VAN - MOVING - THAT MOMENT The PENGUIN grins with delight as the van speeds off unmolested. PENGUIN Look at that, boys -- they do flock together!! CUT TO: EXT. GOTHAM SQUARE - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT AMBULANCES are pouring into the square as the BAT ATTACK continues. COPS are firing their guns blindly into the skies as they try to evacuate the citizenry. PARAMEDICS drop the stretcher they're carrying when BATS swoop down at their heads... EXT. ROOFTOPS - NIGHT BATMAN is still pursuing the CATWOMAN, who's perched one roof over, in a squat, wiggling a finger for him to follow. The roofs are icy and treacherous, but he matches her step for step, leap for leap, as she vaults from one building to the next, leading him on. Finally she reaches the edge of a building on the corner of the block; there's no place to go but down. She squats on the ledge and smiles, beckoning to him -- CATWOMAN Ooh. Where have you been all my life? He edges closer. Suddenly, she does a BACKFLIP -- DIRECTLY OFF THE EDGE OF THE ROOF. BATMAN hears GLASS SHATTERING. He hesitates a second -- moves closer to the edge of the roof -- PEERS OVER THE ICY CORNICE. BATMAN'S POV - THAT MOMENT Staring down, he sees a narrow LEDGE running around the facade of the building some ten or twelve feet below. The window of a corner apartment has been smashed; the curtains are flapping in the chill wind. EXT. ROOF - ON BATMAN - A MOMENT LATER - NIGHT She's obviously making her getaway through the apartment. BATMAN climbs up on the slippery cornice and prepares to drop to the ledge below -- cautiously, because it's a long way down. A sudden CRACK -- The CATWOMAN hasn't entered the apartment. Instead, she's followed the ledge around the corner of the building, silently doubling back onto the roof behind BATMAN. He TURNS just as her WHIP wraps itself around his left leg. She gives it a sharp tug -- his feet SKID on the ice -- and HE TOPPLES OVER THE EDGE OF THE ROOF. EXT. FACADE OF BUILDING - ON BATMAN He plunges downward for the briefest of seconds -- then JERKS UP SHORT, SLAMMING INTO THE WALL OF THE BUILDING. The WHIP has coiled itself around his leg, and for now it's holding tight. He's dangling upside down, bat-like; he bounces away from the wall; he SPINS in midair as one loop of the whip UNRAVELS, dropping him another foot or so. He manages to brace his left foot against the wall. It's a massive strain, but he's momentarily safe if he can keep from moving. The alternative is a twelve-story drop, straight down to the pavement... EXT. ROOF - ON CATWOMAN - THAT MOMENT She's wrapped the handle-end of the whip around an exposed pipe on the roof, anchoring BATMAN in place. With a cheshire- cat grin, she removes the RAVEN from her knapsack and holds it on the edge of the cornice. EXT. FACADE - THAT MOMENT BATMAN hanging immobile. Craning his neck, he can just see the RAVEN STATUETTE on the ledge above him -- bouncing slightly, and apparently talking to him... CATWOMAN (O.S.) Nevermore. Nevermore! Now the CATWOMAN appears beside it -- elbows on the cornice, chin propped up on her folded hands, like a chatty girl at a fern bar. CATWOMAN Cute, huh! I think it'll look nice over the fireplace. Maybe you can drop by and see it sometime. (demurely) I hope you won't think I'm too... aggressive or anything, but I find you very attractive. She toys aimlessly with the whipcord, batting at it like a cat with a piece of yarn. BATMAN grimaces. She speaks in a low, soothing, seductive tone -- almost a purr. Behind the bondage mask she bats her eyelashes. CATWOMAN (cont.) It's just so hard to meet interesting men these days. Don't you think so? (sighing) I have trouble with relationships. Men find me intimidating...kind of predatory, you know? Really I'm not. Really I'm just playful... BATMAN huffs and puffs, trying to bend at the waist so he can grab hold of the whip. She frowns and YANKS on it. His foot flies free of the wall, and another loop of the whip uncoils before he can stabilize himself. CATWOMAN (cont.) Don't laugh! I'm trying to open up to you! Angrily, she holds a STEEL CLAW to the whip -- ready to cut him loose. ANGLE ON BATMAN He's palmed the GRAPPLING-HOOK LAUNCHER from his belt. Holding it close to his body, out of view, he works it around into firing position. He'll shoot it right through her if he has to... CATWOMAN (cont.) I always seem to fall for the wrong guys. You know...most men are rats. ANGLE ON CATWOMAN She withdraws her hand from the whip, reverts to her philosphical mode. CATWOMAN Mice, really. It's disgusting -- they beg you to walk all over them and then they whine when you do it. Once you've had your fun there's not much you can do but kill them. (beat) But you seem different. I mean, you obviously understand about dressing up... that saves a lot of explaining. I think people should indulge their fantasies, don't you? BATMAN is sweating profusely. He can't hold his position much longer. And the CATWOMAN is dragging this insane flirtation out endlessly... CATWOMAN So I think I'll let you live. Cute boys like you are hard to find... (standing up) 'Bye, angel. I'll be thinking about you. And just like that, she VANISHES -- moving silently off with her raven, leaving BATMAN to dangle. He hangs there a moment, tries to twist himself around without moving his foot. He braces one hand against the wall; with the other, he lifts his grappling gun and FIRES. The HOOK SNAGS somewhere on the roof. BATMAN yanks the line taut and is laboriously trying to pull himself erect when -- -- the CATWOMAN reappears over the edge of the cornice! CATWOMAN Gee...I'm so fickle. A QUICK SWIPE of her STEEL TALONS, and the whipcord is neatly SEVERED. BATMAN'S FOOT slips out from under him -- but he's still got hold of the GRAPPLING GUN. He DROPS eight or ten feet... EXT. ROOF - ON CATWOMAN watching with amusement as BATMAN's weight causes the hook to DISLODGE. It skitters across the gravel surface of the roof and CATCHES, at the last instant, on the edge of the CORNICE -- -- which promptly CRUMBLES and GIVES WAY. Fascinated, the CATWOMAN leans over the edge of the roof and peers down... ANGLE ON BATMAN - AS HE FALLS He flails wildly, tangled in his cape, as the ground rushes up toward him. He gets a last-ditch inspiration -- finds the GAS CYLINDER on his belt and hits the switch. The rods in his cape begin to INFLATE... Six stories up, his BATWINGS spring erect, slowing his plunge. Five stories up, an UPDRAFT hits him and he suddenly INVERTS. Four stories up, he rights himself. Three stories up, he goes into a downward spiral, out of control, gliding in great wide arcs over the street... ...and a moment later there are no stories left. With an ugly crunch, he smacks into the slush-covered pavement and BOUNCES. Face down, he skids some twenty feet to a halt -- right in the middle of a BUSY INTERSECTION. EXT. INTERSECTION - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT A DELIVERY TRUCK hits the brakes and screeches to a stop, two feet away from BATMAN'S HEAD. He doesn't move. PEDESTRIANS are already gawking and pointing as the DRIVER climbs out and peers down at the inert caped figure lying face-down in the street: DRIVER What the hell is this? CARS are backed up, due to the panic in Gotham Square a few blocks over. HORNS are honking. A TRAFFIC COP marches over -- TRAFFIC COP Awright, what's the problem here? (spotting BATMAN) Jesus. He tries to clear the crowd away. A full-fledged GRIDLOCK is forming around the prostrate BATMAN. The COP blows his whistle, tries to maintain order as two unifonned PATROLMEN rush up to join him. They manage to roll the unconscious BATMAN over on his back. The assembled COPS stare down at the mask, the scuffed body armor. Still waxy, they finger the GUNS in their holsters... PATROLMAN Good God. Cowan -- get to the car -- radio the commissioner!! By now there must be two hundred people in the intersection, all surging forward to get a look. More COPS are arriving to beat them back. TRAFFIC COP Is he dead? What do we do? PATROLMAN The mask. Get the mask off. They hunker down over BATMAN. One of them tugs at his mask -- but the helmet-like cowl doesn't want to give way. He feels around -- TRAFFIC COP Some kinda seam here on the neck... The PATROLMAN nods okay, and the COP tugs at a Velcro-like fastening under BATMAN's chin. The instant it comes open -- -- a BURST of FINE GREEN MIST spews forth from concealed JETS in the gold-and-black BAT-EMBLEM, and the COPS reel backward, shrieking, gasping for breath and clewing at their eyes. Booby-trap -- they've just been Maced. One of the ONLOOKING COPS steps back in horror and confusion. On impulse, he draws his gun and FIRES TWICE at BATMAN. The body JERKS and the bullets RICOCHET OFF -- TRAFFIC COP DON'T SHOOT, you idiot. The crowd -- Before he can finish, a BLACK BOOT kicks the gun out of the ONLOOKING COP's hand. BATMAN is back among the living. SIRENS BLARE as he spins and rolls into a crouch -- lashing out with elbows and knees -- driving the cops back -- Fuck the crowd. TWO MORE COPS pull their guns and open fire in absolute panic. BATMAN slams backward into the delivery truck and crumples to the ground. As he falls, he grabs a couple of SMOKE CAPSULES from his belt and flings them to the pavement. Seconds later, a THICK CLOUD OF BLACK SMOKE is spreading through the intersection. BATMAN emerges into the midst of the crowd -- weaving in and out among the stalled vehicles -- EXT. INTERSECTION - ANOTHER ANGLE - NIGHT A MOUNTED COP rides up to the outer fringe of the traffic jam, drawn by all the confusion. He rears the horse back, turns it in a circle; blows his piercing whistle as he tries to reroute the incoming cars... Suddenly a WIRE wraps itself around his chest and arms. He looks down. He sees a BATARANG in the instant before a sudden JERK pulls him cleanly off his mount. BATMAN climbs up on the hood of the nearest car -- vaults over to the next -- and the next -- then hops into the saddle of the MOUNTED COP's waiting HORSE. He digs in his heels, maneuvering through traffic... EXT. POLICE CAR - A MOMENT LATER - NIGHT LT. EDDIE BULLOCK and another plainclothesman are a few blocks off trying to get through the jam. Their siren is on, but the cars blocking their path have no room to pull over. BULLOCK grabs the radio mike: BULLOCK Hell of a mess up here, Commissioner. We'll have to go in on foot... As they wait for a response, they see a HORSE charging past in the opposite direction. On the back of the horse...is BATMAN. Gaping, BULLOCK nudges his partner -- who throws the car immediately into REVERSE. As they watch, BATMAN kicks the horse's flanks and turns right -- toward Gotham Park. INT. GOTHAM PARK - A MOMENT LATER - NIGHT Two RED BERETS, members of the Order of the Bat, are on night patrol, strolling down a rambling path near the entrance to the park. RED BERET I This is wack, man. Nothing ever happens around here anymore. The other RED BERET lets out a WHOOP OF FEAR and yanks his partner out of the way. They tumble into a snowdrift as BATMAN'S HORSE vaults over the stone wall of the park and gallops past, nearly trampling them in the process. By now, SQUAD CARS are roaring into the park... INT. PARK - ANOTHER SECTION - A MOMENT LATER SIRENS BLARE and RED LIGHTS FLASH in the distance as the COP CARS spread out along the winding roads that run through the park. BATMAN reins the horse in suddenly as a black-and-white whips past on an access road just ahead of him, no more than twenty yards away. He turns the horse in a circle. MORE RED LIGHTS appear in the distance; another contingent of SQUAD CARS has just entered from the opposite side of the park. It's going to be tough getting out of here... Then: his eyes fall on the statue of his great-grandfather, GENERAL WAYNE -- two Waynes on horseback, not twenty feet apart. He thinks back to his earlier conversation with VICKI and gets an inspiration. He rides past General Wayne to the STONE BRIDGE which spans the little frozen creek. There he finds the DRAINAGE TUNNEL VICKI described, obscured by the wire-mesh grate. This must be where the boy vigilante holes up... He dismounts, ties his CAPE to the pommel of the horse's saddle and sends it off with a slap. He pries the grate loose and crawls inside. INT. DRAINAGE TUNNEL - THAT MOMENT A dank, but cozy, hideout; WARM STEAM hisses from a grate in the floor. RUMBLING SOUNDS fill the little chamber as a SUBWAY TRAIN passes directly underneath. A little farther back there's an ACCESS SHAFT, with a Jacob's ladder, leading to the train tracks below. Poking around, he finds a couple of cardboard BOXES -- the boy vigilante's stash. The first contains tins of food, plus various odds and ends. The second's more in line with what he needs -- it's full of OLD CLOTHING. A TRAIN rumbles past underneath. BRUCE removes his COWL and sets about putting together a civilian disguise that'll get him out of the park. A wool hat and a long, moth-eaten topcoat: perfect. As he's pulling them out of the box, he spies something extremely odd -- It's a COSTUME -- a spangled red-and-green GYMNASTS OUTFIT with a little yellow CAPE -- neatly folded and in pristine condition. He removes it carefully from the box and holds it up in front of him. Stitched on the vest is a single initial, "R," in a black circle. He stares at the whole mystifying ensemble in complete befuddlement... The roar of the train subsides, and he hears a SCUFFLING NOISE. Someone's in the tunnel with him. He lowers the costume abruptly -- -- revealing DICK, the boy vigilante, who's crouched in front of him not three feet away. The kid's just crawled up through the ACCESS SHAFT, and he's not at all happy to see an intruder messing with his stuff: DICK It's MINE! He lunges furiously at BRUCE. The two of them tumble back into the grate at the tunnel entrance, KNOCKING IT LOOSE -- EXT. PARK - MOUTH OF TUNNEL - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT A POLICE CAR streaks past on the bridge overhead mere seconds before BRUCE and DICK roll out into the snow, still grappling. BRUCE flings the kid into the bridge abutment. DICK lands hard; when he looks up, his EYES WIDEN, and a weird crooked smile comes to his face... Out here in the moonlight he can see his opponent. The body armor -- the gold-and-black emblem on the breastplate -- and above it all, the face of BRUCE WAYNE, exposed to view... As a siren howls nearby, BRUCE flattens himself against the bridge. Like it or not, his fate rests entirely in a strange little boy's hands. The kid sizes up the situation immediately. He nods his head up and down. Then he takes off his own ratty coat and throws it to BRUCE. BRUCE is in no position to look a gift horse in the mouth. He pulls on the coat, gives DICK a nod of acknowledgement, and starts to move off. DICK NO. WAIT! BRUCE turns, uncertainly. DICK throws him his woolen SKI CAP. The KID GIGGLES -- oddly, uncontrollably. Then he sprints off into the woods, dancing, leaping. As he disappears from view, he lets out a shrill, piercing, almost FERAL SHRIEK -- -- which is obviously intended to divert the cops. BRUCE makes haste in the opposite direction. EXT. PARK - ANOTHER SECTION - A MOMENT LATER BRUCE'S HORSE gallops through the trees, the black bat-cape still attached to its saddle and BILLOWING behind it. INT. SQUAD CAR - MOVING - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT TWO COPS scanning the park. The CAPED HORSE charges past in front of them and is momentarily silhouetted in the headlights. From a distance, it looks like BATMAN is still in the saddle. The COP at the wheel makes a sudden turn. A moment later, he SLAMS ON THE BRAKES. A MAN has just stepped out onto the road, directly in the squad car's path -- a hunched figure in an old coat and woolen ski cap, obviously one of the homeless. A COP leans on the horn and shouts out the window: COP Dumb son of a bitch!! The MAN -- BRUCE -- steps back out of the squad car's path. The COPS take off -- in hot pursuit of a riderless horse. CUT TO: INT. WAYNE MANOR - KITCHEN - PRE-DAWN A DOCTOR'S BAG rests on the kitchen table. ALFRED, in robe and slippers, rummages inside it and comes up with an ACE BANDAGE. ALFRED Commissioner Gordon called. He wants to install a full contingent of police guards here at the manor -- in round-the-clock shifts -- to protect you from Batman. BRUCE is sitting erect in a straightbacked chair. His shirt is open and he's holding his arms aloft while ALFRED wraps a full roll of adhesive tape around his battered RIBS. BRUCE Great. What'd you tell him? ALFRED I told him that since you were Batman, you'd require no protection from Batman. BRUCE makes a face: how droll. ALFRED tears off the tape with a brisk YANK -- and BRUCE lets out an involuntary YELP OF PAIN. BRUCE Jesus, Alfred -- !! ALFRED In future, sir...I strongly advise against trying to fly off twenty-story buildings. BRUCE It's just a few bruises. ALFRED One bruise, sir. Which covers your entire body. BRUCE gets up -- stiffly -- and buttons his shirt in gingerly fashion while ALFRED packs his first-aid gear in the doctor's bag. BRUCE I'm getting too old for this line of work. (beat) Cops placed me at the scene of the crime -- that weird kid of Vicki's saw my face -- ALFRED I shouldn't worry overmuch. I doubt the two of you move in the same circles. BRUCE -- and I got the living shit knocked out of me by a woman. ALFRED Sir -- such outmoded sexist attitudes are quite unbecoming. INT. UPSTAIRS BEDROOM - DAY In a lavishly-appointed guest room on Gotham's Upper East Side (or equivalent thereof), we find a pair of PLAINCLOTHES COPS settled in for a stakeout: rumpled topcoats thrown across antique chairs, french-fry bags and GREASY BURGER WRAPPINGS littering the carpet. HIGH-POWERED RIFLES propped against one wall. They peer through venetian blinds at an ELEGANT OLD BROWNSTONE across the street... HIS POV - ROOF OF BROWNSTONE - THAT MOMENT A UNIFORMED COP, also carrying a walkie-talkie, is keeping watch on the roof of the brownstone. He signals "all clear" to his counterpart watching from the house opposite. INT. UNMARKED CAR - THAT MOMENT TWO MORE PLAINCLOTHESMEN are parked at the end of the block, munching on donuts and watching the same brownstone. They spot a POSTMAN lugging his sack up the tree-lined street on his way to the brownstone. One of the PLAINCLOTHESMEN picks up his RADIO MIKE: PLAINCLOTHESMAN Mailman's coming. EXT. BROWNSTONE - A MINUTE LATER The POSTMAN marches up the front steps of the brownstone, sorting through letters and packages. He hasn't even rung the bell when the door is opened by ANOTHER COP -- who snatches the mail delivery from his hands and SLAMS THE DOOR IN HIS FACE. INT. BROWNSTONE - THAT MOMENT MORE COPS, at least half a dozen, are milling about inside -- unshaven, ties loosened, shirtsleeves rolled up. They're in for the long haul. The first COP gives a handful of letters to a couple of COLLEAGUES -- then hands over a PARCEL, wrapped in brown paper, to a pair of BOMB-DISPOSAL EXPERTS. They carry it gingerly into the kitchen. Into the midst of all this bustling activity strides COMMISSIONER GORDON: GORDON Anything suspicious! In the parlor, where all the shades are drawn, TWO COPS are examining each letter in turn, holding them up to a light bulb, CREASING THEM carefully before slitting them open. COP Nothing yet. Christmas cards and bills. He anxiously watches their progress. A VOICE calls from the kitchen. BOMB-DISPOSAL EXPERT (V.O.) Commissioner -- ? INT. KITCHEN - A MOMENT LATER GORDON enters. The bomb-disposal boys have their equipment scattered all over the kitchen table. They've slit the brown- paper wrapping of the PACKAGE, exposing a ROUND DECORATIVE TIN. BOMB-DISPOSAL EXPERT It's a fruitcake. He lifts the lid for GORDON to have a look. GORDON ...Have it analyzed. INT. BROWNSTONE - ENTRY HALL - THAT MOMENT A bleary-eyed ELLIOTT TIPTREE marches down the stairs carrying a pair of OVERSIZED SUITCASES. His WIFE and TWO KIDS are behind him -- all bundled up, preparing to embark on an extended vacation. POLICEMAN Mrs. Tiptree? The car's here. TIPTREE, fighting back tears, embraces his wife for a long wordless moment. Their LITTLE GIRL, aged six, tugs at Mommy's sleeve. LITTLE GIRL I don't wanna go to Grandma's. I wanna stay here with Daddy. MRS. TIPTREE She's got a nice tree just like ours, honey. Daddy'll be up as soon as he can. LITTLE GIRL She's old. She doesn't even have cable. LITTLE BOY What about our presents? He gestures toward the GIFTS piled high around the tree in the parlor. TIPTREE Don't worry. I'll bring 'em up with me. We'll open 'em when I get there. TIPTREE forces a smile for the kids. He CLUTCHES his wife's hand. GORDON Sorry, folks, but we'd better move along. MRS. TIPTREE Kids? Tell your Daddy goodbye... Tearful hugs all around; then a cadre of UNIFORMED COPS escort MRS. TIPTREE and the KIDS to the door. TIPTREE pulls GORDON aside. TIPTREE They'll be safe, won't they? GORDON As safe as we can make 'em. (beat; sternly) It would help if you could give us some small hint what this is all about. TIPTREE I told you. I... TIPTREE shrugs helplessly and stares at his shoes. GORDON is convinced he's holding something back. GORDON You have no idea what was in that box that Provost had delivered from the bank. TIPTREE shakes his head wearily. GORDON glowers as he turns to go. GORDON (cont.) All right, Mr. Tiptree. Merry Christmas. GORDON exits. TIPTREE wanders listlessly into the living room, pulls back the drapes, and WATCHES as his wife and kids ride off in a convoy of POLICE CARS. One of the COPS tries to pull him away from the window, but he refuses to move... ...until a PHONE RINGS. Everyone jumps at once. A TECHNICIAN hits a switch on a loudspeaker-and-tape-recorder assembly, then gestures for TIPTREE to pick up the receiver... TIPTREE Hello...? VOICE ON LOUDSPEAKER Mr. Tiptree? Andy here. Listen -- we've got a chance to grab a good-sized block of Atlantic Teledyne at twenty-six and an eighth -- The COPS heave sighs and turn off their tracing equipment. TIPTREE Not today, Andy. Let's talk after New Year's. TIPTREE hangs up and starts to BAWL right there in the middle of the room. The COPS turn away in sympathetic embarrassment as he goes to a corner wet bar and pours himself a good stiff jolt. INT. TIPTREE'S BEDROOM - DAY Wallowing in despair, TIPTREE sits at an antique secretary composing a LETTER. He takes a long pull on a glass of Scotch, signs his name, and inserts the letter into an envelope. He opens the desk drawer -- takes a long look at a .38 automatic stashed inside -- then finds a stamp and affixes it to the envelope. He addresses it to BRUCE WAYNE. A moment later he hears a noise at the window: TINK TINK TINK. He peers through the blinds and sees a CARRIER PIGEON on the ledge outside -- pecking at the glass, asking to come in. He raises the window and the PIGEON hops fearlessly inside, onto the sill. The bird, well-trained, struggles only slightly as he unties a tiny CAPSULE from its leg and removes a FOLDED NOTE. Scrawled across it is a handwritten message: IF POLICE SEE THIS YOUR FAMILY IS DEAD He opens the note and begins to read as the PIGEON takes wing. CUT TO: INT. BRUCE'S LIBRARY - DAY BRUCE is at his desk examining the morning editions. A BANNER HEAD-LINE shrieks: BATMAN SOUGHT IN PUBLISHER'S MURDER Bat Attack Panics Gotham Square J. Harrison Provost, 41, Leaves Distinguished Legacy He hears a VISITOR arriving in the entry hall. He gets up... INT. ENTRY HALL - THAT MOMENT - DAY BRUCE ambles out and sees SELINA, who's just arrived, doing her patetented thing on ALFRED. SELINA English accents are so stimulating. (beat) You have the most beautiful silver hair! ALFRED stammers as she reaches up to STROKE HIS HAIR. He's about to break into a sweat. He's eminently relieved when she turns and sees -- SELINA (cont.) Bruce! BRUCE Selina. What are you doing here? ALFRED affects a look of grandmotherly outrage as SELINA slinks over and takes BRUCE by the arm. She's on him like a barnacle. SELINA I wanted to see your things, remember? And I got tired of waiting for you to call me back. (gesturing toward ALFRED) He's adorable. How long have you had him? INT. HALLWAY - A MOMENT LATER - DAY BRUCE leads SELINA down a hallway to the armory. He glances back over his shoulder and sees ALFRED peering snoopily around the corner. BRUCE You heard about Harry Provost. SELINA It's incredibly awful. It got me a little worried. (sidling up closer) I hate to think of something happening to you. BRUCE Same here. SELINA It's odd, though. Danger, the thought of suddenly dying -- in a weird way it gets you sort of...aroused. Don't you think? BRUCE cocks an eyebrow at her. Everything gets her sort of aroused. INT. ARMORY - A MOMENT LATER SELINA BEAMS at the fantastic collection of armored gear and exotic weapons. She's like a kid in a toy shop. SELINA Bruce, this is incredible. (indicating a suit of armor) Malaysian -- ? BRUCE Not bad. Sarawak warrior caste. SELINA It's like -- everything in here is another little piece of your mind. I was right about you. (turning to face him) Promise, okay? Promise you'll show me every inch of this place. PAGE 87 MISSING FROM HARD COPY INT. BATCAVE - FIFTEEN MINUTES LATER ALFRED is at a PRINTER, scanning page after page of computer printout. He delivers his findings to BRUCE, who's seated at a nearby terminal, scanning data and tapping away at the keyboard. ALFRED The police have no files whatsoever on Selina Kyle. BRUCE (abstractedly) London...Cairo...Belgium... ALFRED What exactly are you -- BRUCE Her credit card records. (looking up) Every major art theft in the last five years -- she's been on the scene or close to it. ALFRED You mean she's some sort of -- collector? A...cat burglar, or -- BRUCE Could be. Museum curator, authenticator -- she's got the perfect cover for it. (beat) What would she want with that stupid raven? ALFRED Raven, sir? BRUCE That's what the Catwoman took from Provost. A little raven statuette, about so big... (shaking his head) But it couldn't have been that valuable. He continues to scan the screen. ALFRED is suddenly lost in thought. ALFRED How very odd. (long pause) I'm sure it's nothing, but -- BRUCE What, Alfred? ALFRED Your father had a raven, sir. A small statue of the very sort you describe. It used to sit on his desk. This piques BRUCE's interest. He swivels around in his chair and stares directly up at ALFRED. BRUCE What happened to it? ALFRED After your father's...demise, Mr. Tiptree came to the house and asked if he could have it. As a keepsake. I saw no harm... (shrugging) That was thirty years ago. BRUCE Wait a minute. Mr. Tiptree? ALFRED George Tiptree. Your friend Elliott's father. CUT TO: INT. TIPTREE'S BEDROOM - AFTERNOON TIPTREE has an oversized suitcase open on the bed. It's empty -- except for the BALLED-UP WADS of NEWSPAPER which he's stuffing inside it. His head turns suddenly at the sound of the doorbell... INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - A MOMENT LATER TIPTREE emerges from his bedroom and peers over a bannister into the ENTRYWAY below. Standing there is an unexpected visitor -- BRUCE WAYNE -- holding his arms aloft while a battery of COPS pat him down. BRUCE What are you looking for -- Batarangs? TIPTREE Bruce! Come on up. (to the COPS) I want to talk to Mr. Wayne alone. The COPS look on suspiciously as BRUCE ascends the stairs. INT. TIPTREE'S LIBRARY - A MOMENT LATER TIPTREE lets BRUCE inside and shuts the door behind him. BRUCE hands him a GIFT BOX. BRUCE I brought you a Christmas present. Sorry about the wrapping -- the police made me open it. TIPTREE opens the box and pulls out a diamond-studded TIE CLASP. He looks up at BRUCE with an odd mixture of bewilderment and gratitude. BRUCE nods for him to try it on, and he obliges... TIPTREE ...I'm afraid I don't have anything for you. BRUCE I think you may have something that belonged to my father. TIPTREE -- You know? He stares at BRUCE, astonished. His head sinks into his hands. TIPTREE (cont.) It'll all be over tomorrow. One way or another, it'll all be over. (looking up; despondent) I've decided, Bruce. I'm gonna give him the last two ravens. He's already got the others. BRUCE What are you talking about? Who? TIPTREE Batman. I don't know how he found out, but -- TIPTREE reaches for the bottle on his desk to pour himself a drink, but BRUCE angrily knocks the glass out of his hands. BRUCE It's time you told me what's going on here. TIPTREE Didn't you ever wonder where it came from, Bruce? All the privilege, all the power ...all the money? (beat) The ravens are a...a kind of map, Bruce. The key to an incredibly vast fortune. BRUCE Whose fortune? TIPTREE Gotham City's. FLASHBACK - PROCESSED FOOTAGE (MOS) The cobblestone streets of 19th-Century Gotham. A massive EXPLOSION blows open one wall of a municipal building, and total CHAOS erupts: fires starting, BYSTANDERS screaming, POLICE rushing to the scene... TIPTREE In 1880 the Gotham City Treasury was looted. It was a fantastic operation -- perfect military precision. The robbers made off with milllons in gold and silver bullion... A HORSE-DRAWN CART weighted down with gold bricks careens around a corner. Atop it are two men in MASKS, firing a GATLING GUN into the crowd. POLICE and ONLOOKERS tumble to the pavement, shot dead, as ANOTHER CART emerges from the wreckage of the treasury and takes off in the opposite direction. FLASHBACK - PROCESSED FOOTAGE (MOS) CITY OFFICIALS in a boardroom trading papers back and forth, arguing furiously with five calm, distinguished-looking GENTS -- one of whom is the bushy-bearded Civil War hero GEN. OLIVER WAYNE. TIPTREE (V.O.) The city was going under. Bankrupt... until five rich men stepped in to bail it out. In exchange they took the land rights, the mineral rights, the service contracts -- BACK TO SCENE - ON BRUCE AND TIPTREE BRUCE The Five Families. TIPTREE Our ancestors. They bought Gotham City -- carved it up and ran it into the ground. In five years they were rich beyond imagining. (pause) We've just been following in their footsteps. And in all this time no one's ever suspected -- BRUCE -- that they were the ones behind the robbery? FLASHBACK - PROCESSED FOOTAGE (MOS) The FIVE PATRIARCHS in front of a roaring fireplace at Wayne Manor, raising a celebratory toast. CAMERA PANS OVER to a nearby table; on it rest FIVE RAVEN STATUETTES. TIPTREE (O.S.) They had five ravens made. Five ravens which -- combined -- would reveal the location of the treasure they'd stolen. (beat) But they never touched it. They never needed to. It's still there to this day. BACK TO SCENE - ON BRUCE AND TIPTREE TIPTREE The ravens, and the secret -- have been passed down through generations. Father to son... (shaking his head) Your father -- died before he could tell you. BRUCE So they stole his piece of the puzzle. TIPTREE Yeah. I've got it, Bruce, and I'm going to hand it over. He's right, you know. We've all been feeding -- feeding on the soul of Gotham... BRUCE stares at him, stony-faced. There's one part of the story that doesn't quite add up. BRUCE (cont.) I don't believe you, Elliott. My father was a decent man -- an honorable man. He would never have taken part in a scheme like this. TIPTREE It wasn't his doing, Bruce. It was -- BRUCE That doesn't matter. If he knew that his fortune was based on a crime -- a crime against the city... (violently) Reputation or not, he would've tried to -- TIPTREE Christ, Bruce! Do you want me to spell it out for you?!? BRUCE backs off. An awful shiver of anticipation runs down his spine. TIPTREE (cont.) He was a decent man. He was an honorable man. That's why they had him killed. CAMERA ZEROES IN ON BRUCE'S HORRIFIED FACE as we get a SERIES OF SHOTS Quick, almost subliminal glimpses of BRUCE's primal trauma: a MUGGER snatching at his mother's necklace. THOMAS WAYNE lunging at him. The young JACK NAPIER firing at THOMAS. PEARLS showering down on the rain-drenched sidewalk. A second bullet felling his MOTHER -- -- and finally, young BRUCE himself, face wracked with PAIN and GRIEF -- BACK TO SCENE - ON BRUCE -- an expression which perfectly matches the one which the adult BRUCE is wearing as he relives it all thirty years later. Staggered and glassy-eyed, he stares off into space as TIPTREE finishes his tale. TIPTREE They killed him...to protect their secret ...and now the bill's come due. Now the bill's come due. CUT TO: EXT. WAYNE MANOR - ESTABLISHING - TOWARD DUSK The wrought-iron gate outside BRUCE's vast estate -- and beyond it, Wayne Manor itself, rising bold and stately against the setting sun. A COUNTY SHERIFF'S CAR cruises past... INT. WAYNE MANOR - BRUCE'S BEDROOM - THAT MOMENT BRUCE lies motionless on his bed. Scattered about him are SCRAPBOOKS, FAMILY PHOTOS and yellowed NEWSPAPER CLIPPINGS which describe the murder of his parents. Disoriented, he gazes about aimlessly at his familiar surroundings -- which no longer seem quite so familiar... He folds his arms formally across his chest and stares up at the ceiling, inert, as if the very weight of his heritage is crushing him down. Somewhere, a PHONE RINGS. He makes no move to answer it. INT. WAYNE MANOR - KITCHEN - DUSK VICKI's at the kitchen table drinking coffee. ALFRED, who's in his apron preparing dinner, picks up the ringing phone. ALFRED Thank you, yes, everything's fine. I'll expect your next call in an hour. (hanging up; to VICKI) The police are becoming an awful nuisance. VICKI I feel so awful for him, Alfred. There must be something we can do. ALFRED I realized long ago -- that there are places in Mr. Wayne's heart which no one will ever penetrate -- or share. (pause) He loves you, Miss Vale. But in certain ways he will always be alone. BRUCE (O.S.) ...Thanks for the testimonial. ALFRED turns and sees BRUCE standing in the doorway, staring at him. He starts to say something, but thinks better of it. He returns to his dinner preparations as BRUCE sits down across from VICKI. She extends a hand and he takes it -- making a visible effort to hold himself together. BRUCE Tiptree's planning some kind of rendezvous with 'Batman.' I think Batman ought to be there when it happens. ALFRED I see, sir. When shall we expect you back? BRUCE Get your cap. You're driving. INT. TIPTREE'S BROWNSTONE - NIGHT It's late, and the house is dark as TIPTREE treeds silently downstairs carrying an OVERSIZED SUITCASE. The lights are on in the kitchen, where the COPS are playing poker and watching TV. INT. PARLOR - A MOMENT LATER - NIGHT CHRISTMAS TREE LIGHTS twinkle in the darkness. TIPTREE kneels beside the tree and digs around among the packages. He pulls out an OBLONG GIFT BOX with a tag addressed "TO DADDY -- FROM SANTA." With a glance back at the kitchen, he soundlessly unwraps the package -- and opens it to reveal a matched set of RAVEN STATUETTES. He transfers them to the big suitcase -- then slinks into the hallway... INT. BEDROOM ACROSS STREET - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT The two STAKEOUT COPS are chuckling at a Charlie Brown Christmas special on a portable TV. One of them glances out the window and sees a man in a topcoat emerging from the brownstone, SUITCASE in hand... STAKEOUT COP I Shit -- that's Tiptree!! The COP grabs for his WALKIE-TALKIE. EXT. STREET OUTSIDE BROWNSTONE - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT TIPTREE is halfway down the block when two COPS burst out of the brownstone. COP Mr. Tiptree! What the hell are you -- HEADLIGHTS FLASH ON as the SURVEILLANCE CAR revs its engine. TIPTREE breaks into a RUN -- and the COPS from the brownstone follow suit. At the end of the block he vanishes down a SUBWAY ENTRANCE. INT. SUBWAY STATION - THAT MOMENT A VIOLINIST is panhandling outside the token booth as the COPS come racing down the stairs. The COPS trip over his open violin case, scattering small change across the conrete floor. They flash their badges at the booth and VAULT OVER THE TURNSTILE -- -- just in time to see TIPTREE, with his SUITCASE, scuttling down a stairway which leads to the train platform below. INT. SUBWAY PLATFORM - A MOMENT LATER TIPTREE steps onto an EXPRESS TRAIN. The doors slide shut behind him -- and the hapless COPS curse under their breath as he rolls off. COP We've gotta get back to the radio. INT. SUBWAY CAR - A MOMENT LATER - MOVING TIPTREE takes an open seat and looks around apprehensively. Being fabulously rich, be's probably ridden the subway twice in his life -- and at this time of night, EVERY FACE in the sparsely-populated car looks vaguely menacing. Derelicts, prostitutes, teen-gang members -- ALL OF THEM eye this well- heeled stranger with intense curiosity as he clutches his suitcase and stares anxiously at the floor... An ODD, GAUNT FIGURE enters at the end of the car. It's a DEAFMUTE. He shambles down the aisle passing out little white CARDS. One side is a guide to International Sign Language. The other reads: DEAF AND DUMB PLEASE HELP -- $1.00 TWO YOUNG TOUGHS take a card and tear it in half, chuckling, shining the DEAFMUTE on. A HOOKER, the heart-of-gold type, stuffs a buck in his tin cup. He reaches TIPTREE and extends a card; TIPTREE ignores him, refusing to make eye contact -- -- but the DEAFMUTE shoves the card insistently into his face. Now TIPTREE looks up. THIS CARD bears a personalized message: GOTHAM CENTRAL STATION B-TRAIN WEST TO RIVERVIEW TIPTREE's eyes widen. The DEAFMUTE -- who is in fact FRICK -- glowers down and holds out his cup. TIPTREE digs in his pocket; the smallest bill he's got is a twenty, but he hands it over anyway. Smiling at this act of generosity, FRICK moves on to the next car. TIPTREE stares down tremulously at the card. He fidgets with his TIE CLASP -- the one BRUCE gave him earlier... INT. LIMO - MOVING - NIGHT TIGHT on a hand-held ELECTRONIC TRACING DEVICE. A small BLIP moves across a shifting GRID not unlike a radar screen. BRUCE is in the back of the limo, eyeing the tracer intently. ALFRED's up front, at the wheel. BRUCE According to this, he's directly below us. ALFRED The subway, sir? BRUCE Yeah. Take a right. INT. GOTHAM CENTRAL STATION - THAT MOMENT It's slightly more crowded here in the hub of Gotham. TIPTREE emerges onto the platform and spies a squad of TRANSIT COPS thirty or forty feet away -- speaking into WALKIE-TALKIES as they scan the crowd. Sticking close to the tracks, he turns swiftly toward the nearest stairway -- blending in with the crowd, trying to hold the SUITCASE out of view. INT. LOWER PLATFORM - A MINUTE LATER TIPTREE IS RUNNING for the B-train just as the doors begin to close. He manages to thrust the suitcase inside -- but the doors SLIDE SHUT on his hand, and he DROPS IT. He stands there on the platform, his face turning BONE WHITE as the train lurches forward... False alarm. The train stops, and the doors hiss open again. INT. SUBWAY CAR - MOVING - A MOMENT LATER TIPTREE clambers aboard with a severe case of palpitations. As the train pulls out, a couple of rough-looking but helpful STREET TYPES show him to a seat and hand him his precious suitcase. He sits there panting... Moments later, a DEAFMUTE enters the car. TIPTREE does a take: it's the exact same guy who was riding the other line! Of course, he doesn't know about Frick's malignant twin -- FRACK... WIPE TO: INT. LOCAL STOP - TEN MINUTES LATER - NIGHT Having changed trains twice more since we left him, TIPTREE debarks at a deserted local stop. The station is EMPTY except for one other passenger, who's gotten off here as well -- a WOMAN in a long fur coat. TIPTREE WATCHES as she approaches on her way to the stairwell, STILLETO HEELS clicking across the floor. There's something familiar about her -- but she's wearing a big, broad-brimmed hat, and she TILTS IT DOWN as she passes, obscuring her face. It is, of course, SELINA... TIPTREE stands there expectantly with his suitcase, awaiting further instructions. They aren't long in coming. A BLACK MYNAH BIRD swoops out of the tunnel, lands on the platform, and STRUTS in front of him. MYNAH FOLLOW ME. AWWWKK! FOLLOW ME. The bird flutters its wings and takes off again -- INTO THE TUNNEL. TIPTREE stares after it in disbelief. Then the bird CAWS AGAIN -- its shrill voice echoing from the darkness of the tunnel: MYNAH (O.S.) FOLLOW ME. AWWWKK! TIPTREE clambers over the edge of the platform, dropping awkwardly to the tracks below. Suitcase in hand, he begins to walk... INT. LIMO - MOVING - NIGHT ALFRED tearing up the streets as BRUCE consults his tracer. BRUCE He's slowed down. Looks like he's under the park. ALFRED How do you propose to get down there, sir? We can't have Batman strolling up to buy a token. BRUCE I know another way in. (beat) Step on it. They're down there waiting for him. ALFRED turns the limo hard right -- into GOTHAM PARK -- past the statue of GENERAL WAYNE atop his horse... INT. SUBWAY TUNNEL - THAT MOMENT A LOCAL TRAIN roars by, filling the screen. When it passes, we see TIPTREE with his suitcase, walking along the express tracks at the far wall of the tunnel -- more frightened with each step. It's dark and eerie down here in the tunnels; the only illumination comes from dim LANTERNS spaced at fifty-foot intervals. He sees the lights of an EXPRESS TRAIN behind him, and quickly switches to the local tracks. The train rumbles past with a deafening blare, and the car lights briefly illuminate his surroundings. TIPTREE glances over at the inside wall of the tunnel... ...where he sees, huddled in an ALCOVE just off the tracks, a small gathering of HOMELESS PEOPLE. They've set up camp down here in the tunnels, away from the elements. Surrounded by bags full of old clothes, DINING on canned food and cheap wine, they stare curiously at the well-heeled stranger with the suitcase who's invaded their domain. TIPTREE eyes them fearfully and picks up his pace, hastening down the tunnel. The HOMELESS make no move to follow -- with one exception. A KID, thirteen or fourteen, in a ratty topcoat, climbs down onto the tracks and watches inquisitively as TIPTREE vanishes into the shadows. His face is familiar. It's DICK -- the boy vigilante from the park. INT. TUNNEL - FARTHER DOWN TRACKS - A MOMENT LATER In this stretch of the tunnel the LANTERNS don't seem to be working -- and the MYNAH is completely invisible. When he comes to a fork in the tracks, he has to wait for the sound of the bird's shrill voice to guide him: MYNAH AWWRRK! FOLLOW ME. TIPTREE stumbles ahead blindly in the darkness. He trips on the tracks and drops the suitcase. As he's getting to his feet, a FLASHLIGHT shines DIRECTLY IN HIS FACE... VOICE STOP THERE. The MYNAH BIRD flutters through the beam of light and perches on the shoulder of an UNSEEN FIGURE. TIPTREE COWERS and SQUINTS, trying to make him out, but the figure who stands before him is shielding his face with an open UMBRELLA. TIPTREE I've cooperated. I've done everything you said. PENGUIN Open the case. TIPTREE lifts the lid, revealirig TWO RAVENS in the suitcase. A CACKLING LAUGH echoes in the darkness. PENGUIN (cont.) ...Two ravens? TIPTREE The other one is Bruce Wayne's. (trembling) He doesn't know anything about this. You've got what you want. There's no need to -- PENGUIN Thank you, Mr. Tiptree. You may go. TIPTREE stands. He backs away from the suitcase warily. TIPTREE My family. You won't -- PENGUIN We'll certainly take your unexpected generosity into consideration. TIPTREE We -- ?!? (shielding his eyes) You're not Batman. PENGUIN No. I'm his brother-in-law -- Birdman. Now move out. INT. TUNNEL - HIGH ANGLE - THAT MOMENT TIPTREE marches slowly down the tracks, TOWARD CAMERA, silhouetted in the flashlight beam. The beam SHIFTS SLIGHTLY as the Penguin moves toward the suitcase and sets the light down -- -- and we catch sight of the CATWOMAN perched on a steel cross-girder above the rails, her CHROME-STEEL TALONS GLINTING as she waits for TIPTREE to pass underneath. INT. TUNNEL - ON TIPTREE looking increasingly twitchy as he approaches the cross- girder. He slips a hand into the pocket of his topcoat, WHIRLS SUDDENLY -- -- and brings up his .38 AUTOMATIC, firing THREE QUICK SHOTS at the PENGUIN. The shots RICOCHET LOUDLY off the umbrella -- which happens to be a bulletproof job. The PENGUIN lifts his brolly; FIRE SPITS out of the shaft -- -- and TIPTREE staggers backward. SHOT IN THE CHEST. He spins into a steel upright and topples, face-forward, onto the ELECTRIFIED THIRD RAIL -- FRYING HIMSELF in a shower of sparks. The smoke is still clearing when the CATWOMAN drops to the tracks. The PENGUIN rushes to her side to check TIPTREE for signs of life. CATWOMAN That idiot. Another six feet -- PENGUIN So sorry to spoil your fun. -- He brought two ravens. We've got a complete set! CATWOMAN What?? PENGUIN Yeah! They're in the suitcase -- An AWFUL RUMBLING fills the tunnel. They see the lights of a TRAIN approaching on the center track -- the same one they're standing on, the one TIPTREE's body is slumped across. The PENGUIN's first impulse is to run back toward the inner track, where the ravens lie, but the CATWOMAN is trying to drag TIPTREE out of the train's path... CATWOMAN GIVE ME A HAND! They pull the corpse onto the outer express track just as the train arrives. They stand against the outer wall, waiting for the train to pass... ...and when it does, they see DICK -- the boy vigilante -- standing on the inner track directly across from them. HOLDING THE SUITCASE. The kid takes off like a shot. The CATWOMAN and the PENGUIN exchange quick looks of utter disbelief -- and BOLT AFTER DICK. INT. TUNNEL - ON DICK The bulky suitcase is slowing his progress. He looks back over his shoulder; although the stubby-legged PENGUIN has fallen well behind, the CATWOMAN is gaining fast. PAGE 101 MISSING FROM HARD COPY INT. TUNNEL - ON DICK watching in the light from the train as the two costumed figures grapple in the distance. He races back toward the scene of the melee... INT. TUNNEL - OUTTER EXPRESS TRACK - THAT MOMENT ...where BATMAN and the CATWOMAN are trading punches, blow for blow. He knocks her off her feet with a vicious right hook, and she sprawls on the track, dazed and bleeding. She lifts a hand: no mas... He looks back toward the suitcase on the center track. Before he can make a move toward it, he spots ANOTHER TRAIN approaching on the outer tracks -- right on the heels of the last one. He crouches to pull the CATWOMAN's limp frame out of its path... ...but as he does so, a HORN BLARES -- and a SECOND TRAIN comes barrelling down the center track from the opposite direction! Now he's got trains approaching on either side, and there's no place to go -- The CATWOMAN is groggily getting to her feet. He LUNGES at her -- THRUSTS HER BACKWARD, toward an ALCOVE in the outer tunnel wall. INT. TUNNEL - ON DICK - THAT MOMENT The OUTER train is already speeding past, obscuring BATMAN and the CATWOMAN from view. The CENTER train is bearing down fast. A split-second before it arrives, DICK'S HAND snatches the suitcase out of its path -- and he TUMBLES TO SAFETY on the innermost LOCAL TRACK. He stands and watches as the two trains pass in opposite directions. He doesn't know if BATMAN is alive or dead... INT. ALCOVE - THAT MOMENT BATMAN and CATWOMAN are flattened in the tiny alcove -- there's not two inches of breathing space between them and the passing TRAIN. She's come around now, and she's FLAILING and CLAWING at him, trying to PUSH HIM OUT. HER HAND closes around his UTILITY BELT. As they struggle, she hits the trigger of a SMALL GAS CYLINDER... It's BRUCE's hydraulic BATWING DEVICE -- the one that saved him when he fell off the roof. But this time the results are altogether different. He GASPS IN HORROR as the WINGS OF HIS CAPE stiffen and inflate -- FORCING HIM AWAY FROM THE WALL OF THE TUNNEL. His OUTER WING strikes the TRAIN -- FLAPPING WILDLY against the passing CARS -- SNAGGING FINALLY on the ralling of the rearmost car -- -- and BATMAN is suddenly RIPPED OUT OF THE ALCOVE -- DRAGGED OFF DOWN THE TRACKS by the passing train! INT. TUNNEL - INNERMOST TRACK - ON DICK He's still there with the suitcase -- waiting apprehensively to see what's become of BATMAN. Finally the center train passes -- -- and he sees CATWOMAN standing ALONE IN THE ALCOVE -- smiling at him -- advancing menacingly. DICK TURNS TO RUN... A GUNSHOT rings out -- and the last thing he sees as he slumps to the tracks is a whiff of SMOKE pluming from the shaft of the PENGUIN'S UMBRELLA. The PENGUIN's panting -- soaked with sweat. The CATWOMAN snatches up the suitcase and rushes over to join him. She peers off into the tunnels after BATMAN, exhilarated... CATWOMAN God. Did you see him? Isn't he hot? PENGUIN Haven't you got anything else to think about? (mopping sweat from his brow) I'm hot. That was exhausting. CATWOMAN No pain, no gain! -- Suck it up. We're not out of here yet. She sprints off down the tracks. SQUAWKING, he waddles along behind her, as fast as his fat little legs will carry him... As they vanish into the darkness, the CAMERA TRACKS back -- past DICK, who lies unconscious on the tracks, bleeding heavily from his shoulder wound -- DEEPER INTO THE MAZE OF TUNNELS -- -- arriving finally on the ragged black figure of BATMAN as he staggers forth from the shadows, dazed and bloody. He scans the tunnel, finding no trace of his enemies -- and then his gaze falls on DICK. He limps over and KNEELS at the boy's side -- cradling his head protectively, staring helplessly into the blackness all around him... DISSOLVE TO: EXT. GOTHAM CITY SKYLINE - NIGHT The stark outlines of the city, BATHED IN MOONLIGHT. CAMERA ZEROES IN on the glowing, ornamental DOME of CITY HALL... INT. CITY HALL - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT A PENTAGONAL BALCONY girds the interior of the dome. We TILT DOWN to ground level -- where TWO AGED SECURITY GUARDS lie sprawled at odd angles on the marble floor, FATALLY SHOT. The PENGUIN closes his gun-umbrella and waddles across the atrium of City Hall, past a statue of blind Justice, to a point directly under the dome. There, encased in a plexiglass case, is a SCALE MODEL of GOTHAM CITY -- circa 1885, when City Hall was erected. He shouts up: PENGUIN LETS DO IT! INT. CITY HALL - BALCONY UNDER DOME - THAT MOMENT The CATWOMAN, FRICK, and FRACK are already up on the balcony. Lining its periphery are various DISPLAY CASES of historical interest; and positioned along the wall at each point of the pentagon are FIVE ARCHED NICHES -- each one containing a bronze bust. The patriarchs of Gotham's Five Families... The CATWOMAN and co. go to work quickly. She removes the FIVE RAVENS from a gunny sack as FRICK and FRACK work their way around the balcony, YANKING the busts from their recessed bases. She follows along behind them, replacing each bust with a RAVEN. When they're done, the PENGUIN yells up: PENGUIN Now. Give each raven a quarter-turn. His pals in the dome oblige -- TWISTING each raven in its recessed socket, in quick succession... INT. CITY HALL - ATRIUM - ON PENGUIN The moment of maximum tension. He stands there frothing at the mouth with anticipation. SECONDS TICK OFF, and nothing happens. CATWOMAN What happens now? PENGUIN I don't know. That's all...! He looks around expectantly as the others peer down at him from above. He really doesn't know what's supposed to happen next. Suspecting the worst, he throws his umbrella to the floor and begins STAMPING ABOUT IN A RAGE, SPUTTERING, flapping his arms like wings. PENGUIN (cont.) We've been TRICKED! It's a HOAX! It's a -- He SHUTS UP suddenly at the sound of a loud CHUNK. Somewhere behind him, ANCIENT GEARS are beginning to grind. He spins and stares at the SCALE MODEL of GOTHAM in its plexiglass case... The city model is TREMBLING slightly. As he watches, the DOME of the miniature CITY HALL -- in the dead center of the model city -- POPS OFF on a hinge. A METAL STRONGBOX rises into view... INT. DOME - ON BALCONY - THAT MOMENT The CATWOMAN, FRICK and FRACK stare down at the little metal box. The PENGUIN is already clambering atop the plexiglass case of the model, SMASHING AT IT with his umbrella, trying to get at the box. FRICK That's the treasure? CATWOMAN No. It's a map... She affixes a ROPE to the balcony railing and CLIMBS OVER. INT. CITY HALL - ATRIUM - ON PENGUIN The plexiglass case finally SHATTERS -- and the PENGUIN falls through, landing atop Gotham City. He snatches at the strongbox and gets to his feet, bestriding the city like a colossus. He's climbing down off the tabletop when the CATWOMAN, on her rope, touches down behind him. He hunkers down on the floor and knocks the rusted padlock off the box. He opens it and stares greedily at the contents -- a MAP and a bunch of old, crumbling PHOTOS. The CATWOMAN creeps over to his side: PENGUIN Bruce Wayne. So he doesn't know a thing about the treasure, eh...? (handing her the map) Look at this. It's right under Wayne Manor. It's been there all along! Now the CATWOMAN snatches at the PHOTOS. They show progressively closer views of ANCIENT GNARLED STALACTITES -- an odd, distinctive SUBTERRANEAN ROCK FORMATION... PENGUIN (cont.) Looks like some kind of cave. FADE THROUGH TO: INT. WAYNE MANOR - GUEST BEDROOM - DAY TIGHT ON THE FACE of DICK. He lies unconscious in a big soft frilly bed A WOMAN'S HAND wipes his feverish brow with a damp cloth; he moans slightly... His eyes snap open suddenly. He sits BOLT UPRIGHT with a yelp. VICKI No, no -- don't try to get up -- you're hurt. He pushes her aside and climbs out of bed anyway. His shoulder is bandaged, his arm in a sling. The pajamas he's wearing are three sizes too large. He paces about, staring at his unfamiliar surroundings. VICKI (cont.) It's all right. You're safe. You can stay here as long as you need to. DICK I don't belong here. You can't keep me here. Vaguely unnerved, he goes to a window, pulls back the shades, looks out at the grounds. VICKI It's "Dick", isn't it? Or do you prefer "Richard"? He stares at her as if she's nuts. VICKI opens a closet door: all of his ratty belongings are hanging inside -- including the red-and-green GYMNAST'S SUIT with the "R" insigne on the breast. VICKI "R" -- for Richard, right? See, all your things are here... (staring at the costume) What is it, some kind of gymnast's outfit? DICK It's none of your business. What is this, some kind of home? VICKI No, not that kind. There's a swimming pool -- tennis court -- you can have anything you want. DICK Tennis court?! -- Lady, you're rich. How the hell would you know what I want? VICKI tries to lay a soothing arm on his shoulder. He bats it away, pushes her aside and turns toward the door in agitation -- DICK I'm not staying. You can't make me -- -- and sees BRUCE standing in the doorway looking at him. BRUCE I can make you. DICK freezes -- as if BRUCE's mere presence has mesmerized him. The hint of a smile plays across his face: ohhhhh. I'm in Batman's house. BRUCE (cont.) Come on. Wanna go at it? (no response) Look, kid -- like it or not, you're my guest -- and long as you're here you might as well enjoy it. ALFRED appears with a tray of hot food and sets it down on a bedside table. DICK edges toward it and sits down. He waits for ALFRED to leave and then TUCKS IN HUNGRILY -- eyeing BRUCE all the while. BRUCE (cont.) Will you two be okay in here? VICKI nods yes. BRUCE backs out of the room. INT. WAYNE MANOR - OUTSIDE GUEST ROOM - DAY BRUCE pulls the door shut. ALFRED follows him down the hall. ALFRED What do you propose to do with him, sir? Keep him in the room for the rest of his life? BRUCE I don't know, Alfred. I've got other stuff to worry about. ALFRED The child is hurt, sir. At the very least we should attempt to locate his parents. BRUCE He hasn't got any parents. ALFRED How do you know that, sir? BRUCE turns and fixes ALFRED with a steely gaze. BRUCE ...I know. The PHONE RINGS as BRUCE starts down the long stairway. ALFRED picks up a hallway extension. He covers the mouthpiece: ALFRED Sir -- it's Miss Kyle. BRUCE rushes back upstairs to take the call. INT. PENGUIN'S LAIR - THAT MOMENT - DAY ARCTIC BIRDS chirping all around in the penguin-pool room. A SNOW OWL struts across the PENGUIN's desk as SELINA makes a phone call -- with the PENGUIN, FRICK, and FRACK hovering over her. SELINA Well! Tall, dark and handsome. Are we still on for tonight? INT. WAYNE MANOR - ON BRUCE He covers the receiver and stares intensely at ALFRED. On his look we DISSOLVE TO: INT. WAYNE MANOR - FRONT PARLOR - NIGHT Christmas carols playing. VICKI's got DICK helping her trim the tree. INT. BRUCE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT BRUCE is getting dressed for his date with SELINA. ALFRED Is this necessary, sir? After all...it is Christmas eve. BRUCE reaches for his UTILITY BELT. He empties the contents of one packet onto a dresser: a dozen tiny, red GLASSINE CAPSULES. He scoops up a handful of the CAPSULES and deposits them in his jacket pocket. BRUCE Stuff'll knock out a moose, much less a cat. ALFRED I don't like to see you going out on a date...unprotected, sir. BRUCE She'll be ready for Batman -- but not for me. (turning to go) It's the only way, Alfred. I've got to take her out tonight. INT. ENTRY HALL - FIVE MINUTES LATER (DICK'S POV) DICK watches from the front parlor as VICKI meets BRUCE at the bottom of the stairs. The two of them exchange a few brief words; he embraces her, strokes her hair gently -- then glumly sets his jaw and moves off toward the front door. VICKI reenters the parlor, trying to force an expression of cheer as DICK turns discreetly away. This is one weird household he's landed in... INT. SELINA'S LOFT - NIGHT SOFT MUSIC plays in the background as SELINA preens in front of a vanity, doing her eye makeup, taking great pleasure in her own reflection. She's looking especially sultry tonight in a glittering low-cut gown. She lowers one shoulder strap and strikes a pose in the mirror: better. She runs a hand through her hair, TOUSLING IT for that recently-ravished look. The DOORBELL rings, and by the time SELINA crosses over to answer it, she's lowered the other strap as well -- which means she has to hold up the top of her dress with one hand. BRUCE finds himsell dumbstruck as she lets him in. She pulls up both straps as she greets him nonchalantly: SELINA You're early. I'm afraid I'm not quite dressed. BRUCE enters and takes a long look around. It's a big open loft, only partly finished, filled with Egyptian artifacts. The walls feature modern paintings with CAT MOTIFS. The finished section is dominated by a huge BED on a raised platform -- three or four CATS are walking around on it, yowling at BRUCE. SELINA CHUCKLES as he scopes it all out. SELINA (cont.) If you're looking for my bondage gear, it's at the cleaners. BRUCE Christmas eve. No tree? SELINA No presents. I've been a bad girl this year. BRUCE takes a seat on the sofa while SELINA goes to a nearby wet bar. BRUCE I'm surprised you kept this date. I thought you would've lost interest by now. SELINA What makes you say that? BRUCE You've got what you want, don't you? SELINA I do now. (smiling) We've had this date for a long, long time. With that, she sets the drinks down on the table and moves in to KISS him -- a long, slow, wet kiss. But BRUCE seems strangely unresponsive. She breaks free and gives him a funny look. BRUCE How much is it going to cost me? SELINA What? BRUCE ...To get the ravens back. He watches her closely for a reaction. SELINA's shocked, but she conceals it well -- chuckling in apparent confusion. SELINA You're the oddest man I've ever met. (moving in on him) Let's talk later, Bruce. I've got kind of a short fuse... BRUCE tenses slightly as she KISSES him again -- leaving a crimson LIPSTICK SMEAR on his cheek. She works her way downward, kissing him around his neck and throat... HIS HAND reaches into his jacket pocket. He withdraws a tiny GLASSINE CAPSULE. But before he can use it -- He JERKS BACK suddenly -- pushes her away. His free hand goes to his neck, where a thin trickle of BLOOD is oozing from between two bright red LIPSTICK LIPS. She's bitten him... Now she SHUSHES him -- reaches over to the tiny wound and massages it gently with one hand. SELINA Did I hurt you? Just relax -- you'll start to enjoy it. BRUCE pulls away again. His eyes are strangely glazed. He tries to speak, but his tongue feels thick and swollen. SELINA (cont.) Bruce, you look faint. It must be the cats. BRUCE stands suddenly. It's as if he's mired in a slo-mo nightmare. His legs give way beneath him and he topples to the floor, INERT. His fingers go slack and the capsule rolls out; he tries to reach into his pocket, but his arm won't seem to work. SELINA's cat, HECATE, strolls across his prostrate form -- purring and stretching... BRUCE'S POV A worm's-eye view -- SELINA looms over him with a predatory smile on her face, shifting in and out of focus. BRUCE What di-- what did you d-- She runs a finger across her lips and holds it up -- bright red. SELINA I guess I've...gotten under your skin. BACK TO SCENE - ON BRUCE His hand goes to the BITE on his neck -- and he realizes SELINA's lipstick is spiked with a fast-acting PARALYTIC DRUG. He writhes helplessly on the carpet, his whole body gradually going slack. The PENGUIN, FRICK and FRACK stroll through the doorway and stand over him -- ALL LAUGHING... DISSOLVE TO: EXT. WAYNE MANOR - NIGHT A COUNTY SHERIFF'S CAR cruises past the manor, right on schedule. INT. WAYNE MANOR - PARLOR - NIGHT ALFRED on the telephone, checking in with the County Sheriff's boys. ALFRED Everything's fine, thank you. We'll talk in an hour. Behind him, VICKI is waiting up for BRUCE. She's curled up on the sofa, reading a book, throwing the occasional anxious glance at a big grandfather clock -- which strikes eleven o'clock. INT. WAYNE MANOR - GUEST BEDROOM - NIGHT DICK opens the bedroom door and peeks down the hall. He's got all his belongings tied up in a bundle on the bed; he opens a window and throws the bundle outside. There's a nice strong TREE BRANCH some ten or twelve feet from the window -- just close enough that he should be able to make it. He climbs up onto the windowsill, crouches, and SPRINGS. INT. CAR - OUTSIDE - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT A car full of trouble: SELINA, wearing a fur coat over her Catwoman garb, at the wheel; the PENGUIN riding shotgun; and FRICK in the back seat -- next to BRUCE, who's semi-conscious and stone limp. The car idles outside the wrought-iron gates of Wayne Manor. PENGUIN Try his mag card. FRICK digs in BRUCE's pockets and finds a bunch of RED CAPSULES. FRICK Look at this. He's a pillhead. Now FRICK finds a mag-striped card and INSERTS IT into an electronic device at the edge of the drive. The gates magically part. There's a large VAN just behind the car -- driven by FRACK, and carrying two random GOONS. Both vehicles pull in before the gates slide shut. INT. WAYNE MANOR - A MOMENT LATER VICKI hears a signal from the security panel in the kitchen announcing what should be BRUCE's arrival. She heaves a huge sigh of relief -- then rushes to the door and flings it open. She sees BRUCE standing there and her face lights up. VICKI Ohh. Am I glad to -- To her horror, BRUCE topples forward -- and lands on the floor, flat as a board. VICKI SHRIEKS as the PENGUIN enters, throwing his arms wide. PENGUIN MER-R-R-RY CHRISTMAS!! EXT. WAYNE MANOR - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT DICK has shimmied down to a lower branch. He lets go and drops to the snow, WINCING; his shoulder wound is bleeding again. As he grabs his bundle, he hears RAUCOUS LAUGHTER coming from around the house. He races over to peer around the corner. He sees the two cars out front. He sees the last of the goon squad barging in through the front door. His face full of confusion and conflict, he moves to a window. In the entry hall he sees BRUCE on the floor -- and VICKI surrounded by gun-toting intruders. One of them grabs her and twists her arm behind her back. INT. WAYNE MANOR - ENTRY - THAT MOMENT VICKI shrieking and struggling as she stares down at BRUCE. VICKI What did you do to him?? SELINA gives her a catty little smile. SELINA First-time jitters, I guess. Everything was going great, and then...he just went limp as a noodle. INT. WAYNE MANOR - ON STAIRWAY Drawn by the commotion, ALFRED rushes down the stairs to the entry hall, pulling a robe around him. He freezes in his tracks when he sees FRICK dragging VICKI into the front parlor, holding a gun to her head. PENGUIN You'd be the butler. Why don't you come on down and attend to your guests? ALFRED hesitates, until the PENGUIN pulls a gun on him. He marches down the stairs slowly, pausing by BRUCE's prostrate form. ALFRED Mr. Wayne. Is he -- ? PENGUIN You know how it is. Some guys just can't hold their egg nog. INT. FRONT PARLOR - A MOMENT LATER The PENGUIN marches ALFRED in where the rest of the gang's already assembled. FRICK throws VICKI down roughly on a sofa just next to the Christmas tree while the GOONS drag BRUCE inside. PENGUIN I should explain the occasion of our visit. There's a treasure underneath this house -- and I don't plan to leave until you tell me how to find it. Now who's going to talk -- Miss Vale? VICKI I don't know what you're talking about. PENGUIN The cave. Under the house. How do I get there? The PENGUIN gestures. FRICK holds the gun to her head. VICKI (cont.) I don't know! I swear, I would tell you -- PENGUIN (turning to ALFRED) Then maybe you'd like to tell me. ALFRED You're no more than a common thief. PENGUIN Wrong, you old idiot. I happen to be a very uncommon thief. (beat) Are you going to tell me, or does Miss Vale get an early present this year? FRICK cocks the gun. VICKI stares aghast at ALFRED, who scans the room, weighing his options. Trembling, he shuts his eyes -- ALFRED I...don't...know... PENGUIN Then go ahead, Mr. Frick...decorate the tree. FRICK's finger tightens on the trigger. VICKI winces. ALFRED starts to blurt something out. But a split-second before he can speak -- SELINA Wait! (crossing over to VICKI) We don't know how to get down there yet. We may need her when Bruce wakes up. The PENGUIN sighs and waves FRICK off. ALFRED and VICKI heave simultaneous sighs of relief. He throws her a shamefaced look -- but she gives him a tiny nod of acknowledgement: you made the right play. SELINA (cont.) Besides -- I want this one for myself. So pretty...I'm going to give her a brand new face for Christmas. The PENGUIN throws a look at BRUCE, who's still out cold on the floor. He turns to FRICK and FRACK. PENGUIN Why don't you two tie up our host? ALFRED sits beside VICKI while SELINA wanders off to tour the premises. FRICK and FRACK, meanwhile, drag BRUCE into a back parlor which opens off the room they're in. INT. BACK PARLOR - THAT MOMENT They dump BRUCE face down on a sofa -- then rip the telephone cords from around the baseboard and use them to bind his hands and feet. INT. FRONT PARLOR - ON MR. BONIFACE Still holding his gun on VICKI and ALFRED, he wanders about the room, admiring the various furnishings and expensive objects. PENGUIN It's all so plush and tasteful, isn't it? Just the sort of setting in which I've always imagined myself. ALFRED, on the sofa, can't resist letting out a snort of disgust. PENGUIN (cont.) I see. You think I'm vulgar. You think I'm...nouveau. ALFRED I think you're a dirty little man with a -- The PENGUIN silences him by sweeping one arm across a tabletop, sending a bunch of PRICELESS CHINA FIGURINES crashing to the floor. He points to ALFRED as FRICK and FRACK reappear. PENGUIN See, boys, that's old money talking. After a while, they actually start to believe they've earned all this. (smirking) I don't mind. Someday I'll be old money too -- when the statute of limitations runs out. SELINA (O.S.) Hey! -- Guess what I just found. Face full of anticipation, he TURNS -- just in time to see SELINA returning from the kitchen with a big silver tray of... SELINA (cont.) Christmas cookies! The PENGUIN is crestfallen, but that doesn't stop him from cramming a handful of cookies down his gullet. SELINA graciously serves VICKI and ALFRED, who munch away with limited enthusiasm. PENGUIN Let's spread out and see what we can find. (to FRICK and FRACK) You two -- keep an eye on our friends here. Give me a yell the minute Wayne comes to. FRICK and FRACK post themselves at the doors to the front parlor as SELINA, the PENGUIN and the GOONS fan out through the house. CAMERA TRACKS WITH THEM as they move past BRUCE -- -- and in a quick CLOSEUP we see his EYES OPEN -- his hands STRUGGLING against his bonds. SERIES OF SHOTS QUICK GLIMPSES of the intruders enacting their depredations as they search for the entrance to the cave. SELINA and the PENGUIN are flinging open doors, moving clocks, looking for secret panels; as they go, they systematically TEAR THE HOUSE APART -- smashing BRUCE's possessions, ripping paintings out of frames, etc. Meanwhile, the TWO GOONS are outside prowling around the grounds, looking for an exterior entrance -- and back in the parlor, FRICK and FRACK are keeping their guns trained on ALFRED and VICKI. INT. WAYNE MANOR - CORRIDOR OFF KITCHEN - NIGHT CAMERA TRACKS down a long, empty hallway -- arriving at a LOCKED DOOR with curtained-off glass panels. Suddenly, an ELBOW smashes through the glass -- a hand reaches inside and fumbles for the lock -- INT. FRONT PARLOR - THAT MOMENT FRICK and FRACK start at the sound of a SECURITY ALARM blaring from the kitchen. VICKI looks at ALFRED... FRICK Better check it out. FRICK stays behind as FRACK rushes out into the entryway and down a long hall to the kitchen. He tosses a glance back at VICKI and ALFRED, then steps out into the entryway himself. FRICK (cont.) What is it? What's going on?? VICKI and ALFRED look into the back parlor. DICK GRAYSON has sneaked in behind the sofa -- and he's busy sawing away at BRUCE's bonds with a letter opener. Both of them stiffen simultaneously -- if FRICK steps back inside, he'll have a clear view of DICK and BRUCE. INT. KITCHEN - THAT MOMENT FRACK has opened a panel on the kitchen wall, revealing the SECURITY SYSTEM from which the alarm emanates. A RED LIGHT is blinking, indicating DICK's break-in. FRACK throws switches frantically, trying to kill the sound. Finally he succeeds -- and SHOUTS: FRACK Some kind of security system -- INT. BACK PARLOR - THAT MOMENT DICK's gotten BRUCE free -- but BRUCE, still under the effects of the drug, isn't much use. He tries to get off the sofa and crumples in a heap. DICK Can you move, man? BRUCE Library -- got to get me to the library -- DICK slings an arm around BRUCE and drags him to a door opening onto the hallway. They're just about to step outside when FRACK comes marching back on his way from the kitchen. INT. FRONT PARLOR - ON VICKI AND ALFRED -- faces wracked with utter, desperate tension as they watch the situation develop. INT. ENTRY HALL - THAT MOMENT FRICK and FRACK conferring, ignoring VICKI and ALFRED for the moment. By now the PENGUIN is waddling in from a hallway: PENGUIN What is that ungodly racket? FRACK A security alarm. It went off in the kitchen. PENGUIN My God! Is someone in here? He struts over to huddle with his cronies. BRUCE and DICK are still poised in the doorway. It looks bad... INT. FRONT PARLOR - THAT MOMENT ALFRED looks at BRUCE and DICK -- then at FRICK and FRACK bickering with the PENGUIN in the entryway. He pats VICKI's knee -- gestures for her to keep her seat -- -- and LUNGES at FRICK, making a play for his gun. A moment of confusion ensues -- giving DICK and BRUCE just enough time to dart out into the hallway, duck around a corner, and vanish -- -- but ALFRED is a frail old gent, and he can't keep it up for long; a blow to the face sends him sprawling to the floor. FRICK instinctively pulls the trigger and SHOOTS HIM at point- blank range. VICKI rushes into the hallway -- screaming, crying. INT. LIBRARY - THAT MOMENT The room's a mess, books all over the floor. The groggy BRUCE props himself up against his desk. He manages to pull the bottom drawer open -- gropes frantically for the secret switch. He's CRYING. BRUCE Alfred... DICK I'll go back. BRUCE I can't...get down there...without you. DICK turns. To his amazement, the sectional bookcase is swinging open -- revealing the secret passage to the BATCAVE. INT. ENTRY HALL/FRONT PARLOR - THAT MOMENT We will all be pleased to know that ALFRED has only suffered a superficial wound to the arm. VICKI is on her knees beside him; the PENGUIN is watching them with utter contempt. PENGUIN What an extraordinarily stupid thing to do. VICKI SHUT UP. Help me with him. The PENGUIN rolls his eyes and orders FRICK and FRACK to give VICKI a hand without him. They carry him into the parlor, lay him out on the sofa. VICKI reaches into her purse for a handkerchief and begins binding his wound as the PENGUIN pulls FRACK aside. PENGUIN You and I had better check the ground floor and see what's going on. Mr. Frick -- do you think you'll be able to manage this pair? FRICK Yes sir. PENGUIN Oh, good. That does relieve my mind -- He turns, glances into the back parlor, and sees a pile of CUT CORDS on the love seat. The blood drains out of his face. PENGUIN (cont.) Where's Wayne??? INT. BATCAVE - THAT MOMENT DICK has just entered another world -- and he's looking around him in pure, unalloyed amazement. BRUCE is fumbling with a packet on a spare UTILITY BELT; he shakes out a fistful of pills and swallows them dry. Then he goes to his bank of monitors and begins flipping switches. They blink on one by one; DICK moves up behind BRUCE and looks on, dazzled. INSERT - MONITOR The screen shows The PENGUIN in a sun room, shouting to his two armed GOONS through a pair of French doors. PENGUIN Check the grounds! The shape he's in, he can't have gotten far. BACK TO SCENE - ON BRUCE He turns to his main control panel, reaches for a switch, and waits. EXT. WAYNE MANOR - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT The two GOONS outside, with guns and flashlights, roaming cautiously around the grounds. They turn suddenly -- -- as CORRUGATED-STEEL SECURITY PANELS slam into place over every ground-floor door and window in Wayne Manor! INT. SUN ROOM - THAT MOMENT The PENGUIN sees the same thing happening, only from inside. He listens helplessly as his GOONS pound on the steel panels from outside. It's just occurred to him that he's trapped in here... INT. BATCAVE - A MOMENT LATER DICK is up on a catwalk leading back to the library of Wayne Manor. BRUCE shouts up to him from the control console down below. BRUCE -- as soon as he gets to the East wing. Wait for my signal. You know what to do. DICK nods yes and bolts off. INT. FRONT PARLOR - A MOMENT LATER VICKI and ALFRED are still sitting at gunpoint. With the commotion going on all around them, FRICK is getting itchy- fingered. Suddenly the STEREO begins blaring at top volwne -- "SANTA BRING MY BABY BACK TO ME." FRICK turns and stares at it in confusion -- goes over to fiddle with the controls -- -- and suddenly BRUCE'S VOICE is coming through the loudspeakers. BRUCE (O.S.; filter) VICKI! RUN! NOW! She's off the sofa like a shot, DIVING for the entry hall. FRICK turns and takes aim -- -- but before he can squeeze the trigger, DICK's come out of nowhere to HIGH-KICK him in the face! The shot goes wild and the two of them tumble into the Christmas tree, knocking it over... INT. ENTRY HALL - THAT MOMENT VICKI hits the floor of the entry hall. HUGE OAKEN SLIDING DOORS are already slamming shut behind her. The same thing is happening all down the hall -- the East wing of the house is sealing itself off! INT. FRONT PARLOR - THAT MOMENT DICK CARTWHEELS across the carpet -- catching FRICK high on the chest and RAMMING him backward, into the hearth. Before FRICK can regain his balance, DICK's BEANED HIM across the back of the skull with a fireplace poker. He bends and picks up FRICK's gun -- which he tosses to ALFRED, who's been watching all this with some fascination from the sofa. DICK Here. You might need it. ALFRED Thank you, Master Dick. And...bravo. INT. KITCHEN - THAT MOMENT VICKI has made it to the wall phone. She can't seem to get a dial tone -- VOICE FROM BEHIND Do you really think we're that stupid? VICKI turns, and realizes to her horror that the VOICE is SELINA's. SELINA (cont.) I tawt I taw a puddy tat...!! With that she raises a hand -- and her CLAWS pop out. VICKI turns, grabs a carving knife from a wooden block -- but before she can do anything with it, a WHIP cracks and wraps around her wrist, jerking the knife loose. SELINA tugs on the other end, reeling her closer. SELINA You know, I've got a great recipe for Sliced Bitch -- VICKI lunges forward suddenly, causing the whip to slacken and throwing SELINA off-balance into the center island. While they're tangled up, VICKI grabs a MEAT CLEAVER and tries to bring it down on SELINA, but SELINA rolls effortlessly out of the way and returns the favor, SWIPING at VICKI with her claws. VICKI brings a Calphalon skillet up just in time to block the blow: CLANG. VICKI sweeps her arm across the countertop, showering SELINA with knives and appliances. It buys her enough time to make for the door -- but SELINA comes flying after her. Another downswipe with the claws -- but VICKI shoves a BUTCHER'S BLOCK into SELINA's path, and her TALONS wedge a half-inch deep in the wood. VICKI rushes out while she's trying to pry herself loose. INT. DINING HALL - A MOMENT LATER SELINA enters but finds no trace of VICKI. SELINA I love a good old-fashioned catfight -- but this is pissing me off. VICKI charges out from behind a sideboard, pushing a WHEELED COCKTAIL CART before her. It SLAMS full-force into SELINA, who lands on her back on the great long dining table. VICKI is in the doorway to the entry hall by the time she gets up. INT. ENTRY HALL - STAIRWAY - A MOMENT LATER VICKI races up the stairs. She has a good lead, but SELINA makes up the difference in a hurry. She takes the stairway in three giant bounds -- reaches the landing just as VICKI ducks down the hall and into a bedroom, slamming the door behind her and LOCKING IT. SELINA HERE, kitty kitty kitty...HERE, kitty kitty... She KICKS THE DOOR OPEN. INT. BEDROOM - THAT MOMENT SELINA enters and strikes a coy pose as she shuts the door behind her. VICKI has opened a pair of French doors leading to a balcony, but it's too long a drop. She stands there paralyzed as SELINA advances. SELINA So this is where you earn your keep. She GRABS VICKI -- holds her out at arm's length and shoves her roughly back onto the bed. VICKI flails wildly as SELINA kneels atop her... SELINA's CLAWS shred VICKI's blouse, revealing a frilly section of bra -- SELINA Mmm! Frederick's of Gotham? She plants a talon against VICKI's sternum and RAKES IT DOWNWARD, drawing a RED STRIPE on the exposed flesh of VICKI's belly. Now VICKI just loses it. She begins to SHRIEK uncontrollably. SELINA Not so loud, honey! The neighbors'll get the wrong idea. (laughing) Santa's coming. Time for all good girls to go to sleep... She raises her claw-hand and prepares to slash down at VICKI's neck. But an instant before she can strike -- VICKI goes wide-eyed and shuts up. A BLACK SHADOW falls across the moonlit bed. SELINA tenses -- -- as a BLACK-GLOVED HAND grabs a fistful of her hair -- BATMAN Miss me, "Angel"? He yanks her bodily off the bed. Before she knows what's happening, he delivers a POWERHOUSE UPPERCUT. She flies into the door and knocks it cleanly off its hinges. INT. HALLWAY/STAIRCASE - A MOMENT LATER BATMAN steps out after SELINA, who's only now picking herself up. SELINA Okay -- let's do it, huh? You and me... all the way this time. She HISSES and jumps him. They grapple -- a quick flurry of fists -- and he knocks her ass-over-teakettle down the long stairway. She gets to her feet, limping, and darts around a corner. BATMAN marches implacably down the stairs, taking his time... INT. HALLWAY - A MOMENT LATER VICKI rushes out of the bedroom. She looks down the hall and sees FRACK flying out of the guest room, UPSIDE DOWN -- slamming into the wall opposite. He slumps to the carpet, out cold. A moment later DICK strolls out. VICKI rushes to his side -- VICKI Come on. We'll be safe in the cave. INT. DOWNSTAIRS HALLWAY/ARMORY - A MOMENT LATER BATMAN PAUSES outside the door to the armory, which is slightly ajar. He pushes it in cautiously... ...and a HALBERD smashes through the wood frame -- slicing down mere inches from his face. It's the PENGUIN wielding the ax; he backs off in seeming terror as BATMAN advances on him. But then -- -- SELINA springs down from a perch above the doors -- landing on his back -- and the two of them are going at it again. It's a room full of exotic weaponry, and most of it gets a good workout in the next thirty seconds. BATMAN dodges a LANCE -- which embeds itself into the wall behind him, QUIVERING -- and swings a MACE squarely into SELINA's ribs. It's a crippling blow; she flies backward, knocking over a suit of exotic armor -- which TOPPLES, knocking over another -- and another -- -- until the various suits of armor have all fallen over, domino-style -- the last of them landing squarely atop the cowering PENGUIN. SELINA is badly hurt now. She makes it out of a rear door to the armory. BATMAN pauses to check on the PENGUIN -- he seems to be out for the count -- and sets off in pursuit of SELINA. SEVERAL MOMENTS PASS before the groaning PENGUIN comes around enough to dig himself out. INT. HALLWAY - A MOMENT LATER As the PENGUIN stumbles around a corner, he peers into the LIBRARY. VICKI is crouched by BRUCE's desk, reaching into a bottom drawer. A hidden panel in the bookcase pops open... INT. LIBRARY - THAT MOMENT As she helps ALFRED into the secret passageway, VICKI turns to DICK: VICKI Come on. Come with us. DICK No. I can still help... INT. HALLWAY - A MOMENT LATER The PENGUIN flattens against the wall as DICK sprints out of the library and heads off in the opposite direction. There's a flabbergasted look on his face -- he recognizes this kid. WIPE TO: INT. BATCAVE - A MINUTE LATER At the monitor bank, watching BATMAN's pursuit of SELINA, are VICKI and ALFRED. They pivot suddenly at the sound of a VOICE: PENGUIN Such primitive entertainment. He's holding a gun on the two of them. He stares about delightedly, taking in the prehistoric splendor of the cave. His eyes light up at the sight of the BATMOBILE, parked on its little plateau. PENGUIN (cont.) So Bruce equals Batman. It seems I've discovered two treasures! (an evil smile) Don't move. I'd be only too happy to shoot you both. He pulls out his packet of photos and begins to scan the cave. He spots the distinctive ROCK FORMATION in an upper vault of the cavern. It's a couple of plateaus over; a long narrow CATWALK runs past it, some ten or twelve feet below. PENGUIN The Gotham City Treasury. It's about to be stolen twice. ALFRED Don't be absurd. You'll never be able to get it out of here. PENGUIN Oh, I'll manage somehow. You two are my guarantee of that. (nudging VICKI with the gun) Let's have a look, shall we? You go first. He shoves her. She starts across the catwalk, his gun at her head. INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - THAT MOMENT SELINA's made it back upstairs, but she's moving at quarter- speed, favoring one leg and clutching her ribs as she lopes down the hallway. She's just passed the balcony overlooking the entry hall when BATMAN appears dead ahead in her path. He's ready to rumble -- but instead of responding, she packs it in. She stops, slumps against a wall and begins to laugh. SELINA It could've been so nice -- you and me -- if only you weren't so screwed up. BATMAN It's over. I don't want to hurt you any more. SELINA Tell me something -- one thing. If you don't enjoy all this...why do you do it? He just looks at her. He doesn't have an especially good answer. She sighs. SELINA (cont.) I'll never understand men. She SPINS SUDDENLY, delivering a high-kick to BATMAN's throat. As he reels backward, into a wall, she leaps up onto the narrow BANNISTER RAILING some thirty feet above the entry hall floor and goes into a CROUCH -- preparing to SPRING at the enormous crystal CHANDELIER mounted to the ceiling -- -- but just as she launches off, BATMAN rolls -- and brings up a GUN from his belt. He fires a RAZOR-SHARP DISK which sails past her head, cleanly SLICING THROUGH the chain which suspends the chandelier. The chandelier FALLS just as CATWOMAN catches hold of it -- and she finds herself PLUMMETING to the floor of the entry hall. On impact, the chandelier EXPLODES into a thousand fragments; the CATWOMAN lands hard on her back and lies sprawled in the midst of the wreckage, unmoving. BATMAN advances slowly down the stairs. Her arms and legs jut out at unnatural angles; she lets out an eerie, whimpering YOWL OF PAIN -- a cri du chat. He stands over her; she glares up at him. BATMAN Nine lives. CATWOMAN I can't move. I can't move. Her face is cut and bleeding. She tries to lift an arm and can't quite manage it. He crouches down beside her, still cautious... CATWOMAN (cont.) DON'T LOOK AT ME!! (pleading) Do me, baby...do me now...that's what I want. Please? BATMAN looks up. DICK is standing on the balcony overlooking them, highly curious as to what he'll do. BATMAN No. BATMAN slowly rises to his feet. She lets out another gruesome WHINE. CATWOMAN COME ON. Don't stop now. FINISH ME OFF. (almost weeping with pain) Son of a bitch. You're all alike... Her STEEL CLAWS snick into place. With an agonizing effort she lifts her forearm -- bends her wrist. She's trying to slit her own throat. He reaches for his belt, extracts a GLASSINE CAPSULE, and breaks it open with his thumb. He drops it amid the shattered glass around her face. A tiny cloud of GREEN GAS plumes out, and her hand falls limply at her side as she lapses into unconsciousness. BATMAN stands over her for a minute as DICK marches down to join him. DICK You should've done it, man. You should've killed her. BATMAN gives him a long, hard look -- but says nothing. BATMAN There's a radio in the cave. We'll send for help. INT. BATCAVE - A MOMENT LATER The PENGUIN and VICKI are on a catwalk just below the ROCK FORMATION. A STONE OUTCROPPING extends toward the catwalk, and he forces her to JUMP FOR IT. Now he has to follow; the prospect makes him nervous, but it's a short hop, and he clears it okay -- finding his footing on the rocky slope. They're cautiously making their way up toward the ROCK FORMATION when BATMAN appears suddenly at the far end of the catwalk -- sizes up the situation and FREEZES IN HIS TRACKS. PENGUIN Ah, the illustrious Mr. Wayne. Look at you now. Whatever would your friends say? (smiling) You've been an exceptionally congenial host -- but I must ask you to back off. The PENGUIN grabs hold of VICKI and HOLDS HER CLOSE as they climb the last few feet toward the grotto. BATMAN swings his cape around, concealing his hands from view. He takes a cautious step backward. CLOSEUP - BATMAN'S HAND His free hand closes around a BATARANG -- flicks it open. ANGLE ON ROCKS - PENGUIN AND VICKI They've pulled almost even with the rock formation. A LARGE DANK GROTTO is visible through a small gap in the rocks. PENGUIN No sudden moves. It's a long way down. Gun at her head, he peers into the grotto... HIS POV - INSIDE THE GROTTO A VAST FORTUNE in GOLD and SILVER BULLION, undisturbed in all these years. GLINTING in the darkness. Hanging upside-down, above it, like silent guardians, are BATS -- DOZENS of them -- their tiny wet red eyes GLIMMERING at the PENGUIN... He dislodges a rock. It tumbles into the grotto... ...and a startled BAT comes screeching out of the gap in the rocks -- FLYING DIRECTLY AT HIS FACE. ANGLE ON ROCKS - PENGUIN AND VICKI He BACKS AWAY IN HORROR as the bat streaks past him. He FIRES HIS GUN wildly. The SOUND OF IT rouses MORE BATS, and they come flying out of the hole -- a VAST, CHITTERING SWARM. VICKI SHRIEKS; the PENGUIN STUMBLES -- and the two of them FALL BACK ONTO THE ROCKS, hanging on for dear life. BATMAN VICKI! An instant later BATMAN lets fly with the BATARANG. Clean hit; the PENGUIN staggers back, and his GUN skitters down across the rocks. With BATS screaming all around her, VICKI takes a deep breath and VAULTS toward the CATWALK. She's a foot short; she grabs hold of the railing and HANGS THERE, over the ABYSS, trying to pull herself up. BATMAN races toward her -- -- but the PENGUIN, clambering down across the rocky outcropping, has managed to grab hold of his GUN. The BATS have begun to swirl up toward the higher recesses of the cavern, and he's able to draw a clean bead on BATMAN. THUNDEROUS ECHOES reverberate through the cave as the first shot strikes BATMAN and knocks him backward. As the second spins him around. As the third sends him TOPPLING OVER THE RAILING. VICKI screams. BATMAN manages to grab the rail with one hand. Now two of them are hanging from the catwalk -- sitting ducks -- and the PENGUIN is determined to empty the clip. The ECHOES are cacophanous. ANCIENT STALACTITES drop from the vaulted roof of the cavern, PLUMMETING DOWNWARD like deadly projectiles, shattering agaist the cave floor. And then -- BATMAN pulls a tiny DEVICE from his utility belt and FLINGS IT. It lands in the rocks at the PENGUIN's feet. He stares down at it, and two beats later -- -- it begins to emit an EERIE ELECTRONIC WHINE. Within moments, EVERY BAT IN THE CAVE is in a FRENZY -- HOMING IN ON THE SIGNAL. The PENGUIN looks up sees them coming. A CHOKED WAIL emits from his throat as he drops the gun and stands there, PARALYZED. He's just been beaten at his own game. He lets out a last awful HOWL as HUNDREDS OF BATS ENGULF HIM -- -- and he PLUNGES DOWN INTO THE PIT -- his hideous scream dwindling to a faint echo, then vanishing altogether... BATMAN manages to drag himself up onto the catwalk. He rushes over to VICKI, pulls her up, drapes his cape around her protectively. Gradually, as the BATS recede to their distant perches, he stands and helps VICKI to her feet. They embrace on the edge of the abyss. On the far plateau, DICK has hooked up with ALFRED. The butler is slumped against a lab table, weary and exhausted, clutching his wounded arm. DICK slings an arm around him and helps him to the stairway. CUT TO: EXT. WAYNE MANOR - NIGHT SQUAD CARS everywhere. FRICK and FRACK emerge in handcuffs, flanked by COPS. PARAMEDICS carry the still-unconscious SELINA past on a stretcher and load her into the back of an ambulance. INT. WAYNE MANOR - ENTRY HALL - NIGHT The place is an utter mess. Amid the carnage we find BRUCE conferring with COMMISSIONER GORDON and LT. BULLOCK. In b.g., a POLICE DOCTOR is dressing ALFRED's gunshot wound. GORDON ...and then Batman showed up? BRUCE He saved all our lives, Jim. I can't say for sure, but I'd bet she's the one behind the murders. GORDON God -- I pray you're right. (beat) One thing before we go, Bruce. Who's the kid? BRUCE looks into the front parlor, where VICKI and DICK are righting the fallen Christmas tree. BRUCE Oh, that's Vicki's little cousin. He's in town for the holidays. GORDON Well, he picked a hell of a time to visit. (turning to go) Merry Christmas, Bruce. Good luck cleaning this place up. GORDON and BULLOCK file out, followed by the POLICE DOCTOR. BRUCE smiles wearily to himself and strolls into the front parlor. INT. FRONT PARLOR - NIGHT ALFRED loads 'SILENT NIGHT' on the CD. VICKI ambles up to BRUCE: VICKI What are you going to do with all that gold? BRUCE I dunno. Might be a good start on a place to live -- for some people who don't have one. She hugs him. DICK plugs in the Christmas-tree lights; they blink to life just as the GRANDFATHER CLOCK strikes twelve. VICKI It's Christmas. BRUCE Yeah. Maybe you should -- open your present. She runs a hand along his cheek and laughs softly. VICKI Oh, Bruce, presents doesn't matter. None of it matters. We're all safe. We're together. BRUCE ...You might as well. He digs around in his jacket pocket and produces a tiny GIFT BOX, which he hands to VICKI. She unwraps it, opens it slowly -- and sees a DIAMOND RING inside. She gazes up at him, speechless. He gazes back. CAMERA PULLS UP and away until we can see the whole of the devastated room, and all the people in it -- VICKI, falling into BRUCE's arms; DICK, off to one side, watching them; ALFRED, tossing broken furniture into a roaring fireplace. And on the image of this decidedly eccentric family unit, we FADE OUT. THE END
BATMAN 2

     EXT. GOTHAM SQUARE - DUSK

     It's finally happened.  Hell's frozen over.

     Christmas is two weeks off, arid SNOW is falling in Gotham.
     Beneath its pristine white blanket, the city looks
     uncharacteristically serene -- almost inviting.  Peace has
     been miraculously restored: strangers wave hello.  Salvation
     Army Santas ring their bells on streetcorners.  And now, as
     night falls, an ILLUMINATED SIGN winks on above Broad Avenue:
     "JOYEUX NOEL GOTHAM -- Only 16 Shopping Days Left Till
     Christmas."

     The streets are bustling with jolly shoppers.  At a souvenir
     store, we find an exasperated MOM squabbling with her seven-
     year old.  Like many other storefronts in Gotham, this one is
     overflowing with bootleg BATMAN MERCHANDISE: t-shirts, key
     chains, ceramic figurines.  The kid is already wearing a
     Batman baseball cap and a little black cape, but he obviously
     wants more.

     Mom drags him off past another store window, this one full of
     SCRAP METAL, with a sign reading "AUTHENTIC FRAGMENTS OF THE
     BATWING -- $19.95 and up."  A PANHANDLER is perched at the
     entrance.  Beneath his array jacket is a grubby sweatshirt
     with the familiar yellow-and-black logo.  In Gotham this
     winter, Batmania is everywhere...

     EXT. GOTHAM SQUARE - LATER THAT NIGHT

     Two hours later, the SNOWSTORM's grown into a full-fledged
     blizzard.  The drifts are two feet deep and the streets are
     all but empty of cars.  A massive SNOW PLOW the size of a
     Panzer tank rumbles past, FILLING THE FRAME...

     ...and revealing, as it passes, a group of CAROLERS, all
     bundled up in mufflers and parkas.  Unbothered by the weather,
     they walk the street singing, spreading cheer and goodwill to
     the few passersby.

     They've just gone into a lovely a capella rendition of "Silent
     Night" when an oversized DELIVERY TRUCK, outfitted with snow
     chains, clanks slowly past in the wake of the plow.  Its sides
     are decorated with cartoon igloos advertising a popular ice
     cream snack -- POLAR BARS -- oddly inappropriate for this time
     of year.

     A streetcorner SANTA, with bell and bucket, WAVES at the truck
     as it rounds a corner.  The CAROLERS carol.  Then --

     -- a VIOLENT EXPLOSION rocks the street -- followed by the
     sound of AUTOMATIC GUNFIRE and a high, wailing SECURITY ALARM.

     EXT. SCHRACH AND CO. - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT

     Around the corner there's CARNAGE on the streets.  The windows
     have blown out of Gotham's leading jewelry store.  Gut-shot
     SECURITY GUARDS stagger and go face down in the snow as
     ROBBERS, dressed in white camouflage gear, clamber out through
     the shattered glass with SACKFULS OF LOOT.

     CAROLERS spill around the corner to see what's going on, but a
     spray of GUNFIRE sends them scattering in panic.  The POLAR
     BAR truck pulls even with the jewelry store, and as it does...

     The REAR DOORS open.  A RAMP slides down from the back of the
     truck.  The ROBBERS scramble aboard, and mere seconds later
     SLIDE out AGAIN -- riding atop five SKIDOO SNOWMOBILES.

     SIRENS HOWL.  A POLICE CAR appears, taking the corner just a
     trifle too fast -- FISHTAILING on the icy street and plowing
     into a drift.

     INT. SQUAD CAR - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT

     The COPS gun the engine, but their wheels are spinning in the
     snow -- no traction.  They're about to climb out and give
     chase on foot when, through the windshield, they see the
     Salvation Army SANTA...

     ...HOISTING AN AK-47 AND FIRING DIRECTLY AT THEM.  The
     windshield disintegrates and the COPS sink from view as SANTA
     races off to the last of the snowmobiles, which is already
     burdened with LOOT.

     EXT. STREET - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT

     MORE SQUAD CARS converge on the jewelry store -- but it's
     difficult to carry on a high-speed pursuit when the snow's a
     foot deep and the best you can do is 6 MPH.  The COP CARS skid
     to a halt, blocked by the rumbling SNOWPLOW.  By now, of
     course, the LOOTERS are gone -- scooting off on either side of
     the plow, sticking to the snowy sidewalks.

     EXT. STREETS - A MOMENT LATER - NIGHT

     SNOWMOBILES glide across the sidewalks, sending the few hardy
     souls who are out on the streets DIVING FOR COVER.  A couple
     of DERELICTS are cowering behind a fire hydrant, trying to
     avoid getting run over.  Every time they poke their heads out,
     another SKIDOO whizzes past, missing them by inches.

     The ROBBERS fan out in various directions.  These guys are
     obviously going to get away clean -- unless...

     The DERELICT points up at the night sky, where a BEACON is
     blazing in the darkness -- THE BLACK SILHOUETTE OF A BAT...

     INT. POLICE CAR - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT

     MORE SIRENS.  A COP takes a radio call as he streaks down the
     long wide avenue which borders Gotham Park -- one of the few
     streets which is relatively clear.  The COP at the wheel goes
     wide-eyed and nudges his partner in disbelief.

     Before their eyes, FIVE SNOWMOBILES appear from the cross
     streets up ahead and CONVERGE at the entrance to Gotham Park.
     Bringing up the rear is SANTA CLAUS.

                               COP
               What the hell -- ?

     EXT. ENTRANCE TO PARK - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT

     BRAKES SQUEAL.  Several squad cars are now massed at the
     entrance to the park -- but there's one problem.  The city's
     snow plows don't operate on the park roads -- and the entrance
     is blocked off with SAWHORSES reading "CLOSED TO TRAFFIC."  A
     huge steep drift prevents them from entering -- and so all
     they can do is stand by helplessly, WATCHING as the
     snowmobiles vanish into the trees.

     The COPS race about like headless chickens, trying to concoct
     a plan.  A couple of them are trying to scale the stone walls
     of the park.  Another is at his car, barking into a radio
     mike:

                               COP WITH MIKE
               Yeah, you heard me.  Snowmobiles!
                    (pause)
               So what do we do?  Chase 'em on foot??

     ALL EYES TURN at the blare of a horn.  The COPS peer down the
     long corridor of the cross street -- and see a STRANGE BLACK
     VEHICLE barreling toward them at 90 MPH, with no intention of
     stopping...

     THE BATMOBILE!!  COPS dive left and right.  A split-second
     later...

     ...a FORTY-FOOT JET of NOVA-INTENSITY FLAME erupts from the
     front of the jet-black supercar -- instantaneously DISSOLVING
     the drift that blocks the entrance to the park -- turning the
     ice and snow on the paths before it into water!

     The BATMOBILE screams past in the wink of an eye.  The COPS
     get to their feet; cold as it is, they're sweating.  One of
     them mops his brow and announces, dumfounded:

                               COP I
               ...That was Batman.

                               COP II
               NO SHIT!!

     COP II yanks COP I into the nearest squad car, and the others
     follow suit.  ENGINES REV.  As long as the BATMOBILE's cleared
     a path, they might as well join in the chase...

     EXT. BRIDLE PATH - THAT MOMENT

     TWO BURLY TEENAGERS -- both dressed in RED BERETS and PARKAS
     with BLACK BATMAN SWEATSHIRTS visible underneath -- are
     trudging along the path when they're STARTLED by a pair of
     speeding SKIDOOS.  Moments later, they spot a RED GLOW on the
     horizon...

     ...and their JAWS DROP as the BATMOBILE roars into view,
     BURNING OFF THE SNOW IN ITS PATH.  Thrilled beyond words, they
     WHOOP WITH GLEE, slapping high-fives as the car streaks past.

     INT. BATMOBILE - ON BATMAN - THAT MOMENT

     His face is weirdly illuminated by the flame still spitting
     from the front of the car.  Cool as ever -- approaching the
     chase as a simple problem in logic -- he checks a radar
     display on his dashboard and sees FIVE BLIPS.

     EXT. PARK - ON SQUAD CARS - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT

     The cops follow along in BATMAN's path.  The lead car LOSES
     CONTROL and plows headlong into a drift.  The DRIVER jams the
     pedal, but his rear wheels end up digging a deep rut in the
     ice.  He sits there cursing, pumping the accelerator as other
     COPS race past him on foot.

     INT. BATMOBILE - ON BATMAN

     The various ROBBERS have spread out, their vehicles BOUNDING
     over the hilly terrain of the park.  He spots two of them up
     ahead; as he draws closer, they PART WAYS, veering off to the
     left and right...

     ANGLE ON BATMOBILE - MOVING

     PODS OPEN on the front fenders, and MISSILE LAUNCHERS rotate
     into place.  The Batmobile fires a pair of HEAT-SEEKING
     TORPEDOS, which BURROW into the snow on either side and
     disappear.

     ANGLE ON LEFT SNOWMOBILE - MOVING

     The DRIVER looks back over his shoulder and sees what appears
     to be a BLACK SHARK FIN plowing through the snow behind him,
     GAINING FAST.  He takes evasive action, but the SHARK FIN
     always seems to follow.  Just as he approaches the crest of a
     hill...

     ...the TORPEDO slams into the rear of the SNOWMOBILE.  The
     force of impact knocks the ROBBER cleanly off.  His LOOT lands
     in the snow beside him, but the SNOWMOBILE keeps going --
     sailing over the crest of the hill and striking the rocks
     beyond with a deafening EXPLOSION.

     ANGLE ON RIGHT SNOWMOBILE - MOVING

     This ROBBER's a little smarter than his buddy.  When he sees
     the shark fin on his tail, he noses his snowmobile off into a
     GROVE OF TREES.  The trees are too closely spaced for the
     torpedo to maneuver; it strikes the nearest tree trunk and
     explodes harmlessly.

     The ROBBER is feeling good about himself, because the
     Batmobile can't follow either.  But BATMAN has a Plan B.  As
     he drives alongside the grove, he HITS THE ACCELERATOR,
     passing the snowmobile on its left.  A STEEL SPIKE attached to
     a cable launches from the side of the Batmobile and WEDGES
     ITSELF into a distant TREE.

     The cable goes taut, and the tree TOPPLES -- directly into the
     path of the second SNOWMOBILE.  The vehicle crashes into the
     trunk, and the hapless ROBBER goes cartwheeling head-over-
     heels into a drift.

     In the distance, COPS appear -- racing to the scene on foot,
     ready for mop-up duty.  BATMAN kills the flamethrower, hits
     the brakes, and FISHTAILS, doing a quick 180 on the snow.
     He's just spotted fresh quarry: snowmobiles three and four,
     whizzing over a rolling white pasture in the distance.

     EXT. PARK - THAT MOMENT

     We're at a makeshift CAMPSITE -- where a cluster of HOMELESS
     PEOPLE are burning refuse in a garbage can to keep warm.  They
     look on in puzzlement as the two SNOWMOBILES whiz past and
     disappear over a crest of a hill...

     EXT. LAKEFRONT - ON SNOWMOBILES #3 AND #4

     They bounce down the hillside and SKID -- arriving at the edge
     of a frozen-over LAKE.  With the roar of the Batmobile behind
     them, the two DRIVERS get the same idea simultaneously.
     Smiling, they rev their engines and set out over the surface
     of the lake.

     Now the Batmobile crests the ridge.  The car's weight tips
     suddenly and it begins to skid down the hill toward the lake.
     BATMAN sees what's happening and kills the flamethrower just
     in time -- but he can't brake the car on the snowy slope.  The
     prow of the Batmobile slides out onto the edge of the lake --

     -- and under its weight, the ICE begins to crack.  The left
     front tire takes a sudden dip -- and worse yet, the car is
     sliding forward.

     INT. BATMOBILE - ON BATMAN

     He shifts frantically from drive to reverse, trying to rock
     the car out of its predicament, but his rear wheels find no
     purchase.  He can hear the ice cracking beneath him.
     Grimacing, he throws a switch on the dashboard --

     EXT. LAKE - ON BATMOBILE

     -- and the trunk pops open.  An industrial-strength GRAPPLING
     HOOK shoots upward and digs in at a point beyond the crest of
     the hill; and a concealed WINCH ASSEMBLY begins to grind away,
     hauling the Batmobile uphill, out of danger.

     INT. BATMOBILE - ON BATMAN

     Suspended just above the icy lake, he sees the SNOWMOBILE
     vanishing into the distance.  He opens (yet another) panel on
     the dashboard...

     EXT. LAKE - ON SNOWMOBILES #3 AND #4

     The ROBBERS give each other a big thumbs-up.  They're almost
     halfway across the lake now and the Batmobile is disabled.
     All at once they hear a strange WHISTLING overhead...

     Fireworks?  No, it's a THERMITE BOMB -- rocketing past them,
     hitting the ice some forty feet ahead and EXPLODING GAUDILY.
     JAGGED CHUNKS OF ICE break free and SHIFT in the frigid water
     -- and the ROBBERS are skidding into the drink before they
     know what's hit them.

     ANGLE ON SNOWMOBILE #5 - MOVING

     The last of the robbers is SANTA CLAUS -- his big sack filled
     not with toys, but precious stones.  He approaches the edge of
     the park, negotiating his way through a maze of rocky
     outcroppings.  He squirts out from behind a boulder into a
     clearing...

     ...and GASPS in PANIC as a SEARING BURST OF FLAME erupts
     behind him.  The BATMOBILE speeds out from the other side of
     the boulder; SANTA twists his accelerator, desperately trying
     to build up speed.

     As it is, he's barely managing to stay ahead of the
     flamethrower.  But the jet of flame suddenly DIES; the HOOD of
     the Batmobile rises half a foot --

     -- and TWIN PROJECTILES launch into the air.  A heavy NET is
     strung between them -- and it lands SMACK ON TOP OF SANTA
     CLAUS, entangling the snowmobile and stopping him in his
     tracks.

     Immobilized, he watches through the net in horror as the
     Batmobile barrels down.  When the great black machine is
     almost atop him --

     -- it stops on a dime six inches from his heavily-padded
     frame.

     EXT. ENTRANCE TO PARK - A MINUTE LATER - NIGHT

     The COPS are spread out near the entrance.  They've rounded up
     the other ROBBERS and returned most of the loot.  They hear a
     dull ROAR in the distance...

     ...and a few seconds later the BATMOBILE streaks into view,
     dragging the NET behind it -- SANTA, his loot, and his
     snowmobile, all tied up in one tidy parcel.

     At the entrance to the park, the NET detaches itself from the
     Batmobile, dumping SANTA into the hands of the waiting COPS.
     Without stopping, the BATMOBILE roars out of the park and
     vanishes whence it came.  A mildly-humiliated COP turns to his
     colleague and SHRUGS:

                               COP I
               ...Merry Christmas.

     The second COP points to SANTA, still struggling in the net.

                               COP II
               Gift-wrapped and everything.

                                                       DISSOLVE TO:

     EXT. CITY HALL - DAY

     TV MINICAM CREWS are camped out on the steps of City Hall,
     with a sizable crowd watching from the street.  COMMISSIONER
     GORDON is reading from a prepared statement.

                               GORDON
               After a high-speed chase -- over $750,000
               in precious jewels were recovered intact
               by the police force -- working in concert
               with Batman.

     At the sound of Batman's name, a CHANTING goes up in the
     crowd:

                               VOICES IN CROWD
               TAKE BACK THE STREETS!  TAKE BACK THE
               STREETS!  TAKE BACK THE --

     GORDON winces and lets out a sigh.  The CHANTERS are a group
     of pugnacious, well-muscled KIDS, late teens and early
     twenties, all dressed in identical garb: black Batman
     SWEATSHIRTS and little red Guardian-angel BERETS.  They're
     obviously members of the same club -- just like the guys we
     saw in the park.

     GORDON waits for them to shut up, but they don't; so he grabs
     the mike and speaks slowly and distinctly, trying to be heard
     over the din.

                               GORDON
               I would like to stress -- that while this
               city enjoys a special relationship with
               Batman --
                    (louder)
               -- we do not condone vigilantism --
                    (practically screaming)
               -- IN ANY FORM.

     It's no use.  He's totally drowned out by the RED BERETS, who
     continue to shout and shake their fists.  Giving up, he
     returns the mike to a REPORTER and marches up the steps in a
     huff.  The RED BERETS CHEER.

                                                            CUT TO:

     INSERT - TELEVISION SCREEN

     The evening news: a live, on-the-spot interview from Gotham
     Square.  A superimposed GRAPHIC identifies a surly kid in a
     RED BERET as "MIKE SEKOWSKY -- SPOKESPERSON -- ORDER OF THE
     BAT."

                               SEKOWSKY
               And hey!  Where does this --
                    (BLEEP; expletive deleted)
               -- Gordon get off calling us ?
               We're not breakin' any laws.  We're a
               group of concerned citizens, that's all --
               just like Batman.

 WOMAN IN CROWD                You people are nothing but hoodlums!

 SEKOWSKY                Hey, lady -- we're out here on patrol
               riskin' our necks to protect old biddies
               like you.
                    (into mike)
               If this lame-o Gordon could do his job --

     MORE CATCALLS from the crowd.  The picture jumps suddenly as a
     minicam is jostled; some sort of SCUFFLE appears to be
     breaking out.  Before it does, CAMERA PULLS BACK from the TV
     screen, placing us in:

     INT. WAYNE MANOR - KITCHEN - NIGHT

     where ALFRED THE BUTLER is watching the Sekowsky interview
     with extreme dismay.  As he trims the crusts from a pair of
     hearty watercress sandwiches, he SLICES HIS FINGER OPEN.

     ALFRED makes a pained face -- it's all Sekowsky's fault.
     Onscreen, the fracas continues; SEKOWSKY has recommandeered
     the mike...

                               SEKOWSKY (on TV)
               We're provin' that the spirit of Batman is
               alive in this city.  We're gonna take back
               the streets!

     SEKOWSKY raises a fist.  Behind him, his CRONIES begin to
     chant: "TAKE BACK THE STREETS!  TAKE BACK THE STREETS!"
     Incensed, sucking on his finger, ALFRED moves to the TV and
     flicks it off.

     He turns on the radio in search of something more soothing.
     "Good King Wenceslas" pipes through the manor; smiling, ALFRED
     sets the sandwich plate alongside a steaming kettle on a
     Sterling silver tea service.

     INT. BRUCE'S LIBRARY - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT

     The CAROL CONTINUES UNDERNEATH as ALFRED, white linen draped
     over one forearm, sets the tea tray down on his master's big
     mahogany desk.  He digs in his pocket for a key and unlocks a
     side drawer.

     The drawer contains a stack of yellowed, aging NEWPAPER
     CLIPPINGS -- among them one which reads "THOMAS WAYNE
     MURDERED: Prominent Doctor, Wife Slain in Robbery.
     Unidentified Gunman Leaves Child Unharmed."  ALFRED digs
     around beneath the clippings and finds a concealed SWITCH at
     the rear of the drawer.

     Gears grind, and a sectional bookcase detaches itself from the
     wall -- sliding out a couple of feet to reveal a STONE
     STAIRWAY which descends into darkness...

     INT. BATCAVE - A MOMENT LATER - NIGHT

     Descending the stone stairs, ALFRED arrives in the Batcave.
     "Good King Wenceslas" is on the speakers down here as well.
     Across a catwalk the BATMOBILE rests on its little plateau,
     wrapped in a tarp.

     ALFRED clears some space on a lab table and sets the tea
     service down.  He glances up at the bank of video monitors and
     sees SEKOWSKY, still babbling, on several channels
     simultaneously.  He scans the cave, but there's no trace of
 BRUCE. 
 ALFRED                Sir?  -- MASTER BRUCE??

     As if in response, BATS screech and flutter in the distant
     recesses of the cavern.  ALFRED turns suddenly and sees BRUCE
     behind him, suspended from a thin filament wire, RISING OUT OF
 A BOTTOMLESS ABYSS. 
 BRUCE                I'm not deaf, Alfred.  I hear you.

     He's wearing his civvie -- tweed pants and cashmere sweater --
     but he's got the utility belt, with its spring-action reel,
     buckled about his waist.  Clutching a bundle, he hangs in
     midair for a moment, dangling over the void.  ALFRED slowly
     regains his composure:

 ALFRED                I took the liberty of preparing tea.
                    (indicating tbe monitors)
               I take it you've been watching the news?

     BRUCE, still dangling, glances up at the SEKOWSKY interview
     and nods.

 BRUCE                Yeah...lot of crazy people in this world.

     BRUCE rocks back and forth to build up momentum.  He kicks off
     on the nearest stone outcropping, lands gracefully on the
     Batcave floor, and unbuckles his belt.  Preoccupied, he drops
     his mysterious bundle on the lab table: a roll of black
     fabric, and a cluster of lightweight, hollow ALUMINUM RODS,
     connected by what appears to be SURGICAL TUBING.

 ALFRED                I should inform you...Christmas is
               approaching, and we've received our annual
               solicitation from the Fireman's Toy Fund.
                    (eyeing the equipment)
               If I may inquire...?

 BRUCE                Oh, yeah.  Watch this.

     BRUCE hits a trigger on a tiny gas canister attached to the
     tubing.  The tubing inflates and the rods spring erect --
     stiffening, wing-like, into something which looks remarkably
     like the skeleton of an umbrella.

 ALFRED                Most ingenious, sir.  What exactly it? BRUCE What does it look like? ALFRED To the untrained eye, sir, it looks remarkably like...the skeleton of an umbrella. Sounds good. BRUCE eyes his new invention, thinks it over, smiles slyly. BRUCE Good guess, Alfred. That's exactly right. BRUCE hits the trigger, and the rods WILT with a hiss. He sits at his lab table; ALFRED unfolds a napkin on his lap, pours a cup of tea. ALFRED Splendid, sir, and if I may say, I'm glad you're putting your time to such productive use. (beat) Now -- the Toy Fund. Our contribution last year was a half-million dollars... BRUCE We can do better than that. ALFRED Then there's the foster-parents program... the Gotham homeless crusade... BRUCE nods abstractedly and tucks into his sandwich. He seems oddly preoccupied -- not exactly melancholy, but his thoughts are obviously a million miles away. ALFRED looks on, concerned: ALFRED (cont.) Is something troubling you, sir? BRUCE Yeah...the holidays, I guess. Always gets me thinking about... (he changes the subject) And to tell you the truth, I'm a little -- concerned about Vicki. ALFRED (anxiously) Miss Vale, sir...? BRUCE Yeah. I've been thinking about it lately. Thinking about it a lot... (gravely; shaking his head) ...and I still can't figure out what to get her for Christmas. BRUCE shoots ALFRED a solemn, perplexed look -- and ALFRED heaves an audible sigh of relief as we CUT TO: INT. PRISON CELL - DAY TIGHT ON a stack of COOPS and CAGES, piled high against a bare concrete wall. Each cage -- and there are at least two dozen of them -- contains a twittering BIRD: starlings, pigeons, cardinals, titwillows... CAMERA PULLS BACK from the bars of the cages to reveal a VERY ODD FIGURE in prison greys. A CANARY, perched on his shoulder, SINGS HAPPILY as he stands in front of a grimy, cracked mirror, plastering back his hair, BUFFING HIS NAILS with quick, birdlike strokes. MR. BONIFACE is beak-nosed, epicene, and so fat that it seems his skin should burst; the adjective that comes to mind is "obscene." Despite his eccentric appearance, he comports himself with overblown, theatrical dignity. Fastidious and preening, he does not suffer insults lightly. CAMERA PULLS BACK FURTHER -- through another set of bars -- and we realize that MR. BONIFACE is himself caged. A PRISON GUARD arrives to slide back his cell door... GUARD Up and at 'em, Pengy. -- Pengy? MR. BONIFACE pointedly ignores the GUARD, refusing to acknowledge the odious (if wholly appropriate) nickname. GUARD (cont.) Boniface... MR. BONIFACE finally turns. With an expression of extreme distaste, he affixes a MONOCLE over one eye, returns the canary to its cage and allows himself to be ushered out. INT. WARDEN'S OFFICE - DAY MR. BONIFACE and his ATTORNEY sit at a long table across from the WARDEN and the members of the PAROLE BOARD. PAROLE OFFICER You want to return the money you stole. BONIFACE Intact. The map will show you where it's buried. The PAROLE OFFICER stares skeptically at a hand-scrawled MAP. PAROLE OFFICER All of it. Forty-two million dollars. MR. BONIFACE stares down humbly at the table -- as if he finds the mere mention of his transgression too embarrassing to bear. PAROLE OFFICER II Why this sudden change of heart? MR. BONIFACE Gentlemen, I want my debt to be repaid in full. I want to be a part of civilized society! (oozing sincerity) Prison life is not for me. The guilt, the fear, the constant shame...one meets a disturbingly low class of people. PAROLE OFFICER II Sure, but -- forty-two million dollars?? MR. BONIFACE nods plaintively. It's quite a perfomlance. He dabs at his face with a handkerchief; it's hot in here, and he's the delicate type... WARDEN His record's clean. Thirteen years without an incident. ATTORNEY I'd like to point out, my client's put his time to good use. A student of ornithology...articles published in several respected journals... The PAROLE OFFICER thumbs through a stack of magazines: Bird World, Ornithological Review, Beaks And Feathers, Nest Egg. MR. BONIFACE Birds, yes. My only source of solace. PAROLE OFFICER In light of this rather extraordinary gesture, I see no reason not to endorse your application for parole. BONIFACE Thank you, sir. You won't regret it. MR. BONIFACE shakes hands with the members of the PAROLE BOARD. As the GUARDS escort him out, a BLACK MYNAH BIRD SQUAWKS LOUDLY from its cage in the corner of the office: MYNAH CRIME DOES NOT PAY. AAWWK!! CRIME DOES NOT PAY. CHUCKLES all around. On his way out the ATTORNEY gestures toward the mynah -- and BEAMS at the parole board: ATTORNEY Personally trained by my client. INT. PRISON CELL - DAY Free time -- the cell doors are open and the convicts are milling around in the common area. T-BONE, 220 lbs. of dumb, hulking beef, saunters up to his cell and finds his bunkmate, MR. BONIFACE, staring at a stack of EMPTY CAGES. BONIFACE whirls on him suddenly, his face beet-red, APOPLECTIC WITH RAGE: MR. BONIFACE -- Where are my birds?!? T-BONE Shit, Pengy. I let 'em go. MR. BONIFACE Hermione. My canary. It's the dead of winter! T-BONE flops casually on his bunk, obviously enjoying MR. BONIFACE's profound distress. T-BONE They were all cooped up. With you leaving and all -- seemed like the humane thing to do. BONIFACE'S GAZE FALLS on a corner of the cell. He spots a scattering of YELLOW FEATHERS -- a patch of FRESH BLOOD. With a supreme effort of restraint, he turns and forces a smile... MR. BONIFACE I see. -- You might as well have this. I won't be needing it... He tosses a SONY WALKMAN to T-BONE, who flicks it on. The dim strains of CLASSICAL MUSIC are audible through the earphones... T-BONE Well, thanks, Pengy. No hard feelings. (chuckling to himself) Y'know, I'm gonna miss that pudgy little ass of yours. T-BONE tunes the Walkman to a rock station, slips the headset on, grins from his bunk. TWO GUARDS arrive. As they escort him out, MR. BONIFACE mutters: MR. BONIFACE You won't miss it long. EXT. PRISON - MAIN ENTRANCE - DAY It's fifteen degrees outside as MR. BONIFACE -- aka THE PENGUIN -- waddles forth from the prison gates, regally attired in cutaway and pin-stripes. He pauses to inhale a deep lungful of the icy air; then, with a smile of exhilaration, he removes his coat and STRETCHES -- spreading his wings, REVELING in the cold. A STRETCH LIMO pulls up. Two identically gaunt and vulture- like DANDIES, formally dressed, with bowler hats and umbrellas, step out to meet him. These two gentlemen -- FRICK and FRACK -- serve as the Penguin's general factoti and "business managers." FRICK Welcome back, Mr. Boniface. PENGUIN Mr. Frick. Mr. Frack. Our years of planning are about to pay off. INT. LIMO - MOVING - DAY Now that he's loose, the PENGUIN's rapacious side is beginning to show. His eyes twinkle with greed as he contemplates his own ingenuity. PENGUIN I take it they found the money all right? FRACK We buried it exactly as you specified. $42,271,009... PENGUIN How much have we got left? FRICK reaches into his coat for a BALANCE SHEET. FRICK Let's see -- an initial capitalization of 42 million and change, compounded over thirteen years, at an annual return of just under sixteen percent -- PENGUIN Fine, fine. How much? FRICK Seventy-nine million. -- Excluding the sum we buried. THE PENGUIN lets out a dry, heaving CHORTLE, midway between a normal laugh and a DUCK'S QUACK. He checks his watch and reaches into his pocket for a small ELECTRONIC DEVICE. PENGUIN Speaking of burials... EXT. PRISON YARD - DAY T-BONE on work detail. He's got the Walkman on and he's shoveling snow to the beat. He winces, and removes the headphones... The MUSIC he was listening to has been replaced by an eerie, high-pitched WHINE. He's twisting the knob, trying to find the station he was tuned to, when a PIGEON dives down STRAIGHT AT HIS HEAD. T-BONE HEY -- ! He drops the shovel as the bird STRIKES, glancing off his head. Before he can react, THREE MORE PIGEONS have swooped down at him, PECKING at his head and shoulders in a frenzy. He lets out a HOWL and staggers through the prison yard in a frenzy. DOZENS of PIGEONS are pouring over the prison walls, SHRIEKING HIDEOUSLY, descending on him. He falls to the ground screaming for help, but the other prisoners run like rabbits, terrified... By the time the GUARDS come racing across the courtyard, T-BONE's no longer even visible. There's just a swarming, man-shaped mass of PIGEONS, pecking away, flapping their wings insanely. Covering their faces as they move in, the GUARDS blow their whistles -- BEAT AT the pigeons with billy clubs. All at once, the PIGEONS take off en masse -- leaving T-BONE's mutilated corpse sprawled in the yard. A GUARD notices the Walkman, picks up the earphones to listen, and hears nothing but ROCK MUSIC -- "Surfin' Bird" by the Trashmen. Bird bird bird, bird is the word... EXT. ROAD - ON PENGUIN'S LIMO - MOVING An AERIAL VIEW of the LIMO as it cruises down the deserted road leading away from the prison. It disappears from view -- and all at once the frame is filled with PIGEONS, great squalling FLOCKS of them, dutifully following their master as he makes his way back to Gotham City. DISSOLVE TO: INT. WAYNE MANOR - ENTRYWAY - NIGHT ALFRED opens the front door and finds a bundled-up VICKI out on the portico, red-cheeked, flushed, and happy. She pulls him forward, gives him a quick peck on the cheek. VICKI Guess what, Alfred. I think I found a present for Bruce. She's got a long, skinny GIFT BOX propped up against the exterior wall. At first it doesn't want to fit through the door -- it must be eight feet long -- but with ALFRED's help she gets it inside. The faithful butler stares curiously at this odd-shaped gift... VICKI (cont.) Skis. -- Don't let on, okay? ALFRED He won't hear a word of it from me. VICKI He's such a nightmare to shop for. -- What do you get him year after year, Alfred? ALFRED (conspiratorially) I find you can't go wrong with surveillance equipment. Let me put this under the tree... VICKI Not so fast. She reaches into the pocket of her coat and pulls out another small gift. ALFRED stares at the tag -- "TO ALFRED, LOVE VICKI" -- and tries to suppress a HUGE GRIN. ALFRED Why, Miss Vale -- ! VOICE FROM BEHIND What's all this? ALFRED and VICKI turn. It's BRUCE, dressed for dinner, marching down the long stairway in the entry hall. VICKI waves frantically. VICKI Don't look. It's your present. VICKI rushes over to embrace him. He gapes at the long skinny box -- BRUCE What'd you get me? Kareem Abdul-Jabbar? VICKI frowns and gives him a kiss. She nestles up against him. WHISPERS in his ear: VICKI I'm going to give you the happiest Christmas you've ever had. Still in the clinch, BRUCE shoots a look at ALFRED. Taking the hint, ALFRED clears his throat and bends to pick up one end of the ski box. He backs out of the entry hall, dragging the box before him... CUT TO: EXT. GOTHAM PARK - NIGHT FIRES burn in garbage cans. TENTS and LEAN-TOS dot the snowy landscape. Men, women, and children wander aimlessly, huddling against the cold. An army of the HOMELESS has set up camp in Gotham Park. On the nearby periphery, PICKETERS -- half concerned citizens, half down-and-outers -- are marching the sidewalks, keeping a candlelight VIGIL. Hand-lettered placards read: "SAVE THE PARK." "PARKS ARE FOR PEOPLE." "THIS PARK IS OUR HOME." The source of the protest? A towering SIGN posted in a corner of the park, announcing the imminent consuuction of a new luxury highrise -- the GOTHAM PARK TOWERS -- a project of Shaw Construction, Inc. A LAMBORGHINI sits at a traffic light nearby... INT. LAMBORGHINI - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT BRUCE and VICKI, dressed for dinner, stare out at the demonstration. VICKI Homeless. (beat) I was just down here Tuesday. Seems like there's more every day. BRUCE starts to say something, but can't think of anything to say. VICKI (cont.) Christmas time. And they say there's over a thousand people living in the park already. BRUCE -- Yeah. The light changes. BRUCE throws the car into gear and -- at the next intersection -- turns the car right, into the park. EXT. PUB-IN-THE-PARK - NIGHT Despite the name, it's a tony little bistro catering to Gotham's elite. A PANHANDLER, underdressed for the cold, has been hustling the customers as they come out; a couple of PARKING ATTENDANTS are trying to drag him discreetly away as BRUCE'S CAR pulls up. A VALET opens the car for BRUCE and VICKI, who look on in concern as the PANHANDLER gets the bum's rush. The liveried DOORMAN shrugs apolagetically -- sorry for the inconvenience -- as they enter. INT. PUB-IN-THE-PARK - NIGHT Post-dinner. VICKI's got a sheaf of PHOTOS spread out on the table in front of BRUCE -- shots of Gotham's HOMELESS, being forcibly evicted from slum dwellings, erecting their SHANTYTOWNS in Gotham Park. VICKI They're already razing the tenements and SRO's downtown. These people don't have anyplace else to go. (beat) If the city starts selling off the park... BRUCE takes a good long look at his opulent surroundings. HUGE WINDOWS open on a serene and picturesque view of the park; CAMPFIRES flicker in the distance... BRUCE -- Yeah. I guess I'll pass on dessert. VICKI (taking his hand) Bruce, you do a lot more than most people even dream of. BRUCE Sure. Comes off the top of my taxes -- VICKI That's not what I meant. They exchange a long silent look. Of course she's referring to Batman. Still, the argument doesn't hold much water with BRUCE. BRUCE -- What I "do" doesn't come close to the root of the problem, Vicki. (long pause) I'm just a Band-Aid. VOICE FROM BEHIND Bruce! It's been ages! VICKI turns -- and rapidly closes her photo folder. Millionaire construction magnate RANDALL SHAW is in the restaurant table-hopping, and he's just glommed onto BRUCE. BRUCE Randall. You remember Vicki. -- How's the construction business? SHAW The park tower? All systems go. If we can get the junkies and winos cleared out... (a big grin) Not too late to get in on the deal. BRUCE I'll think about it. SHAW Say, Walter Barrett's due back from Europe. We should all get together at the club. (clapping him on the shoulder) Nice to see you again, Miss Veal. "Miss Veal" maintains a big phony smile as SHAW moves off to the next table. She murmurs to BRUCE through clenched teeth: VICKI What a pig. BRUCE I've known him since he was seven years old. He was a pig then too. VICKI Now he wants to gobble up the park... (shivering) Bruce -- isn't there something you can do about people like that? BRUCE What, tie him up with a bat-rope? VICKI No, you idiot. I meant you. Bruce. BRUCE nods -- oh, yeah. Subtle distinction. INT. PUB-IN-THE-PARK - NIGHT BRUCE and VICKI emerge from the restaurant. He hands his parking stub to a VALET. A crowd's beginning to form in the lot outside... The red-and-blue bubble of a POLICE CAR is flashing a short distance off, near the entrance to the park. TWO RED BERETS, in full Order-of-the-Bat regalia, look on as a recently-mugged WOMAN JOGGER gives her statement to the investigating COPS. BRUCE and VICKI, intrigued by the Batman-wannabes, move a little closer -- within eavesdropping range: RED BERET I We were on patrol. Saw the whole thing. JOGGER I was attacked. Three men in ski masks -- COP I (indicating the RED BERETS) And these two broke it up? JOGGER These two?? They ran like rabbits. I never saw anybody take off so -- RED BERET II Hey! Somebody had to go for the cops. COP II You. SHUT UP, all right?? (to the JOGGER) Lady, who was it that bailed you out?? JOGGER A kid. Thirteen or fourteen tops. He just came out of nowhere and -- tore into 'em. (shaking her head) It was so quick I didn't even see his face. Nearby, VICKI shoots a highly quizzical look at BRUCE, who responds with a mystified shrug. Her professional curiosity piqued, she wanders over to introduce herself to the JOGGER. An exasperated COP leads the RED BERETS away from the crime site: RED BERET I Dumb shit. Shouldn'ta been jogging in the park at night anyway. (sullenly) Look around you. It's fulla bums. BRUCE gestures at the RED BERET's Batman sweatshirt as he passes. BRUCE Nice outfit. RED BERET I Piss off, geek. DISSOLVE TO: EXT. WATERFRONT DISTRICT - NIGHT Snow blankets the abandoned warehouses rimming Gotham Harbor. FOGHORNS blare in the distance as a pair of STILETTO HEELS -- totally inappropriate for the weather -- click across the sidewalk and pause at mid-block, where a wide wooden plank leads down from street level to a seedy hole-in-the-wall bar: the WHARF RAT. INT. WHARF RAT - NIGHT A roughneck joint, about as trendy as the average bait shack. The clientele consists primarily of surly types who are saving up for their next tattoo. A TV over the bar is tuned to the late news: ANCHORWOMAN ...and tomorrow, the city's power elite will be turning out in force to greet millionaire industrialist Walter Barrett, who returns to Gotham after a five-year stay in Europe... The BARTENDER switches to a hockey game, because none of the rowdies at the bar give a shit about Walter Barrett. None, that is, except for a strapping young bruiser named RICKY, who gets up and makes his way to a pay phone in the corner. Moments later, the owner of the high heels enters; she opens her black fur coat and unwraps her muffler, revealing exotic, vaguely Eurasian features. She's dark and elegant, fine- boned, regal of bearing -- and her name, though we don't know it yet, is SELINA KYLE. She's not the kind of girl who typically frequents the Wharf Rat, and so her entrance creates quite a stir. A LONGSHOREMAN at the nearby pool table misses his shot and digs a rut in the felt. Two blowsy WHORES size her up territorially as she finds an open stool at the bar and settles in with serene indifference. The regulars, of course, are all but licking their chops. The only guy in the joint who hasn't noticed her yet is RICKY, who's still on the phone: RICKY Yo. Ricky here. What's the haps? In mid-conversation he notices SELINA. She smiles invitingly -- right at him. Mildly startled, he smiles back. RICKY (cont.) Midnight. No sweat. See you then. He hangs up eagerly. Then, with a deep breath, he hitches up his pants and swaggers over to SELINA's end of the bar. SELINA Well. "Ricky," is it? RICKY How'd you know that? SELINA I heard you on the phone. Talking to your girlfriend. RICKY Girlfriend? No, no. That was business. SELINA makes a big show of peeling off her gloves. SELINA If you've got time for a little pleasure ...maybe you'd like to buy me a drink. She clasps his hand. His EYES BUG OUT. Three enormous rings, a diamond bracelet -- there must be several thousand in rocks on her left hand alone. RICKY gapes at the sparklers, bedazzled. RICKY Jeez -- they look almost real. SELINA Why wouldn't they be? RICKY is not the smoothest guy around, and his line of thought is all too evident. He swallows hard and tries not to stare. RICKY You'd have to be crazy. Nobody'd wear the real thing to a dive like this. SELINA Oh, they're real, all right. So are these. She waves her FINGERNAILS -- long, polished, and talon-sharp -- in front of his eyes. With lightning speed, before he can react, she pins his wrist to the bar -- and with one quick stroke carves a THIN BLOODY STRIPE in the back of his hand. SELINA's eyes flash as he gasps in shock. He tries to jerk his hand away, but he can't break her grip. Then -- her dominance firmly established -- she releases his hand with a coy, Cheshire-cat smile. SELINA (cont.) Weren't we going to have a drink? He blinks, forces a chuckle, smiles unsteadily. She takes his wounded hand, lifts it slowly to her mouth, and LAPS GENTLY at the blood. RICKY is hypnotized. She's got an odd way of flirting, but RICKY finds it somehow -- intriguing. He dabs at his hand with a napkin and signals to the BARTENDER. CUT TO: EXT. WATERFRONT - PIER 31 - NIGHT Just after midnight; the snow's still failing, the waters are icy, and the wharfs are deserted -- almost. A small STEAMBOAT is docked at Pier 31, and the deck is lined with THUGS -- mean, ugly, and heavily armed. A similar contingent of gun-toting GOONS is waiting to greet them on the dock below. The boys on the dock hoist ASSAULT RIFLES as the BOAT THUGS extend a gangplank. Something major is about to happen... The CHIEF DOCK GOON gestures to his LIEUTENANT, who grabs a black MEDICAL BAG. Hands raised, the two of them start up the gangplank. Throughout all this, the DOCK GOONS keep their guns trained on the BOAT THUGS, covering their buddies. One of them turns to a colleague: DOCK GOON I Where's that goddam Ricky? DOCK GOON II Probably out gettin' laid. And here we are freezin' our balls off... EXT. STEAMBOAT - ON DECK - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT The LIEUTENANT unloads chemical testing gear from his doctor's bag. The lead BOAT THUG gestures to a stack of SHIPPING CRATES which rest atop a large NET spread out across the deck. BOAT THUG I You pick. The CHIEF GOON selects a crate at random. Two BOAT THUGS tip it on its side and, using a crowbar, pry off a FALSE BOTTOM -- revealing a dozen packets of WHITE POWDER. POV SHOT - HIGH ANGLE - THAT MOMENT We're now watching the scene from a vantage point atop a ramshackle boathouse at water's edge. Down on the deck of the steamboat, the LIEUTENANT goes to work testing the merchandise. LIEUTENANT It's pure. REVERSE ANGLE - THAT MOMENT A BLACK SILHOUETTE is peering down from the boathouse roof. The mysterious watcher ducks quickly out of sight; the only details that register are a pair of ominously familiar POINTY EARS... CHIEF GOON (O.S.) Let's do it. He gestures to his boys on the dock. A CRANE-AND-WINCH assembly rotates into place over the deck -- and the BOAT THUGS gather up the corners of the netting and attach them to the big hook. BOAT THUG I Hold it. Let's see the money. Down on the wharf, a DOCK GOON kneels beside a metal suitcase and opens it. Lots of long green inside. The BOAT THUG signals thumbs up, and the CRATES rise into the air as the goon with the suitcase starts up the gangplank. LOW ANGLE - ON GANGPLANK - THAT MOMENT The goon with the suitcase marches up. Beyond him, in the distance, a LITHE BLACK SHADOW vaults off the boathouse roof and makes a silent, graceful landing on the long shaft of the CRANE. ANOTHER ANGLE - THAT MOMENT The moment of maximum tension: grim faces all around, everyone holding a gun on someone else as the suitcase arrives on deck and crane swings over the pier. ANGLE ON CRANE - THAT MOMENT Razor-sharp, CHROME-STEEL TALONS slash suddenly through the air. ON DOCK - LOW ANGLE - THAT MOMENT The netting GIVES WAY, and TWO DOZEN SHIPPING CRATES rain down onto the pier, CRUSHING two DOCK GOONS underneath. The crates explode into splinters, littering the dock with drugs and random ART OBJECTS as the other DOCK GOONS scatter in panic. ON STEAMBOAT - THAT MOMENT Nobody knows quite what's going on. Panicking, the GOON with the suitcase full of money turns tail and dives for the gangplank. BOAT THUG I sees him and squeezes off a quick shot. Winged, the GOON topples off the gangplank and hits the drink, suitcase and all. Pandemonium. All at once, everyone's OPENING FIRE. Thinking he's been double-crossed, BOAT THUG I turns on the CHIEF GOON and SHOOTS HIM TWICE at point-blank range. BOAT THUG I YOU SON OF A BITCH! (to another BOAT THUG) Go after it. Get the money. GO!! He raises his gun, and the second BOAT THUG dutifully obeys -- diving off the deck into a hail of gunfire. Everyone's ducking for cover. BOAT THUG I barks orders at the pilothouse: BOAT THUG I Soltar las amarras! -- CAST OFF!! ANOTHER BOAT THUG LOOK! BOAT THUG I whirls, just in time to see a SHADOWY FIGURE landing cat-like on the deck mere yards away. Clad in inky black leather from head to toe, the intruder's face is concealed by what appears to be a BONDAGE MASK. Studded, with openings for the eyes and mouth, it spans one incongruous touch: a pair of POINTED CAT EARS. She bares her teeth and HISSES. It's a woman. BOAT THUG I is momentarily mesmerized. In the time it takes him to lift his gun, she's produced a CAT-O'-NINE-TAILS. She SNAPS it at him: REELS HIM IN; and with one lethal stroke, RAKES her steel talons across his face and throat. He slumps to the deck, lifeless. The other BOAT THUG rushes her; she catches him under the jaw with a sudden upthrust, LIFTS HIM INTO THE AIR, and sends him toppling into the water. The gangplank falls aside as the steamboat pulls away from the pier. She hoists an abandoned ASSAULT RIFLE, SCATTERS the DOCK GOONS with a round of automatic fire, and VAULTS off the boat -- landing in a graceful crouch on the edge of the pier. Most of the DOCK GOONS have taken flight, but a few unlucky specimens remain behind. She somersaults forward; takes one goon off his feet with a crack of the whip; knocks another off the dock with a twirling high-kick to the jaw; sends two more reeling with swift talon-slashes. The whole frenzied mop-up action takes just under ten seconds. Alone at last, she stands back to survey the scene. Counting the stiff's on the boat -- which is now receding in the harbor -- there must be well over a dozen dead. The snow is speckled with red. A half-dozen bodies lie sprawled in their own blood; one of them, the lone survivor, is face-down and softly MOANING. Retracting her steel claws, the MASKED WOMAN crouches amid the wreckage of the smashed shipping crates. BINDLES OF WHITE POWDER -- millions of dollars' worth -- are scattered all about the pier, but she couldn't seem less interested. Instead, she's checking the MANIFEST NUMBERS stamped on the sides of the crates. She finds crate #18396-BB and rummages among its contents until she comes up with a carefully-wrapped parcel. She opens it carefully and holds it up for inspection. The statuette of a RAVEN -- carved from solid onyx -- glistens in the moonlight. The WOMAN pauses long enough to slip a small CARD in the MOANING PUNK's back pocket. Then, cradling the raven under one arm, she dashes off on silent cat feet. A LANTERN approaches. It's an OLD SALT -- some kind of hapless night watchman -- and his face goes bone-white at the sight of the carnage on the docks. He kneels beside the moaning punk, turns the body over, and GASPS -- because the PUNK'S FACE has been CLAWED TO SHREDS. PUNK Murcielago. MURCIELAGO!! CUT TO: INT. PENGUIN'S LAIR - NIGHT The unique chamber in which we find ourselves is alive with the flutter and song of COLD-WEATHER BIRDS -- dozens of them, all chirping, flitting about in the rafters, alighting on special perches mounted in the walls. At the center of this penthouse room is a vast sunken POOL. ARCTIC TERNS loll on the surrounding rocks as a LACKEY with a wheelbarrow empties cracked ice into the already-frigid water. Carefully landscaped, it looks like the penguin exhibit at the Gotham Zoological Gardens. A MASSIVE, INDISTINCT SHAPE glides beneath the surface. It's not a whale; it's too pink. It is, instead, the PENGUIN -- and as he breaks the surface, sputtering, he sees FRICK standing in the open doorway. FRICK Mr. Boniface? Your...visitor has arrived. PENGUIN Thank you, Mr. Frick. Show her in. The PENGUIN moves to the edge of the sunken pool. Two of his LACKEYS swivel a CROSSBAR, which hangs from the ceiling by a long chain, into place over his head. He grasps it with both hands -- and the crossbar RISES, hoisting his formidable bulk out of the water. INT. HIGH-RISE - CORRIDOR - THAT MOMENT FRICK leads the VISITOR down a long corridor lined on either side with BIRD CAGES -- exotic songbirds with brilliantly-hued plumage. CAMERA TRACKS ALONG behind her, and although we can't see her face, there must be something distinctively feline about her -- because the BIRDS are shrieking and fluttering in their cages, RECOILING INSTINCTIVELY as she strolls past. FRICK opens a door and ushers her into... INT. PENGUIN'S LAIR - A MOMENT LATER - NIGHT Our visitor -- SELINA KYLE -- enters the penguin-pool room. Her teeth begin to chatter. The big bay windows have been thrown open, and SNOW is blowing in from outside. It's freezing in here. She sees the PENGUIN -- wearing a thin dressing gown and an APRON outfitted with SEED POUCHES -- scattering birdseed on the window ledge for the pigeons, totally oblivious to the cold. He turns, throws his arms wide in greeting, kisses the back of SELINA's hand. PENGUIN Ah, Miss Kyle! At last we meet. SELINA At last we meet. -- Pigeons? PENGUIN Yes, they're common birds -- dirty, stupid, unattractive -- but they're very obedient, and they do crap on people's heads. May I? She extends a SHOPPING BAG. The PENGUIN removes a parcel and unwraps it, revealing the RAVEN STATUETTE. He sets it on a nearby desk, fondles it reverently...and BEAMS at SELINA. PENGUIN (cont.) I see your reputation was not exaggerated. SELINA I've located the others. All but one. (shivering) I'm surprised you don't catch pneumonia -- ! With an apologetic smile, the PENGUIN pulls the windows shut. PENGUIN My normal body temperature is ninety-two degrees. Germs find me inhospitable. SELINA I see why they call you the Penguin. PENGUIN They may call me that...but rarely more than once. Champagne? She nods. He pours two glasses, hands one to SELINA, raises a toast. PENGUIN (cont.) My dear. Here's to the second biggest crime in the history of Gotham City. CUT TO: INT. POLICE OBSERVATION ROOM - NIGHT COMMISSIONER GORDON and another cop, LT. EDDIE BULLOCK, are in darkened antechamber adjacent to an interrogation room. BULLOCK It wasn't about the drugs. Whoever it was left thirty kilos sitting on the docks. They're watching, through a two-way glass panel, as a terrified man with a heavily-bandaged face tells his story. It's the lone survivor of the dock massacre, JULIO, and his voice is audible over a concealed intercom: JULIO (filter) Un silueta negra -- con colmillos, y garras -- el demonio. El murcielago. MURCIELAGO! GORDON What's that he keeps saying? BULLOCK "Murcielago." -- Bat. GORDON Nonsense. That dock looked like a slaughter-house. Batman's never committed murder. BULLOCK We did find this in his back pocket. BULLOCK hands GORDON a CARD. It reads: "THOSE WHO FEED ON THE SOUL OF GOTHAM WILL SUFFER MY WRATH" -- and in lieu of a signature, there's a little black BAT-EMBLEM in the bottom corner. While GORDON's staring at it, a POLICEMAN pokes his head in: POLICEMAN Commissioner? We've got Barrett. INT. POLICE INTERROGATION ROOM - THAT MOMENT A cubicle down the hall. The splenetic WALTER BARRETT, millionaire industrialist, is fidgeting in his chair as GORDON enters. BARRETT Fine welcome. These storm troopers of yours dragged me away from my coming-home party! (beat) I'd like to know the meaning of this -- GORDON I'd like to know how thirty kilos of pure cocaine wound up concealed in your personal effects. BARRETT Gordon -- I come from one of the oldest and most influential familles in Gotham. If you plan to accuse me of smuggling drugs, be my guest. (long, menacing pause) I'll have your badge before you leave this room. GORDON weighs the threat. He nods to the COPS in attendance... GORDON Book the son of a bitch. GORDON storms out. BARRETT jumps out of his chair, but the COPS restrain him. Outraged, he bats their hands away... BARRETT I believe I'm still entitled to a phone call. CUT TO: EXT. DOWNTOWN GOTHAM - DAY VICKI with her camera, squeezing off snaps. She's standing behind a SAWHORSE, part of a crowd of onlookers at a downtown DEMOLITION SITE. SURVEYORS and HARDHATS bustle about in a VACANT LOT, a full city block in size, fenced off and strewn with rubble. The only structure still standing is a lone, decrepit TENEMENT BUILDING; a WRECKING BALL is poised above it, ready to strike. A SIGN at one corner of the lot announces a forty-story OFFICE COMPLEX soon to be erected on this site by SHAW CONSTRUCTION, INC. Down below is RANDALL SHAW HIMSELF, in necktie and hardhat, speaking into a WALKIE-TALKIE: SHAW Come on! Let's move it! We're an hour behind as it is!! A few moments later, a CLUSTER OF PEOPLE emerge from the tenement building -- a mixed team of COPS and CONSTRUCTION GOONS who are forcibly removing a DESTITUTE FAMILY from the condenmed building. VICKI watches angrily... HER POV - TELEPHOTO LENS A quick series of shots: the SQUATTERS wailing and struggling, clinging to the doorways, unwilling to leave. Their few belongings are packed in a couple of CARDBOARD BOXES, which the cops heave rudely out onto the street. Finally, the handcuffs and nightsticks come out... ANGLE ON SHAW - THAT MOMENT - DAY A SURVEYOR grabs SHAW by the arm and points out the woman taking photos in the crowd. SHAW recognizes her instantly. His face turns into a mask of outrage -- as if he's been personally betrayed. SHAW Jesus Christ, that's Bruce Wayne's bimbo! He makes eye contact with her. VICKI stares back defiantly. He's about to stroll over and tell her off when a HARDHAT signals to him: HARDHAT Phone call, Mr. Shaw. Guy said it's urgent. SHAW (to tbe SURVEYOR) Hold the ball. I wanna hear it crash. He climbs into the cab of a nearby TRUCK, where he picks up a CELLULAR PHONE. INTERCUT - BARRETT AND SHAW BARRETT's still in custody at the police station -- using his one phone call to contact the construction magnate. BARRETT It's me, Randall -- Walter Barrett. I want you to call my attorney. That was my shipment they busted up last night. SHAW Jesus, Walter, I -- (suddenly puzzled) Why are you calling me?? BARRETT It's worse than that. Somebody took my raven. SHAW stares at the phone in horrified disbelief. ANGLE ON VICKI - THAT MOMENT SHE WATCHES as SHAW climbs out of the truck -- numb, in a daze. He signals to the WRECKING BALL OPERATOR; a WHISTLE blows, and the great iron ball knocks a MAMMOTH HOLE in the facade of the tenement. SHAW doesn't even stick around to watch it. He scurries off to his car at the end of the block. VICKI, highly intrigued, gets it all on film... INT. GOTHAM GLOBE - CITY ROOM - DAY VICKI's in a huddle with the Managing Editor, SCHULTZ, showing him her PHOTOS -- SHAW orchestrating the eviction of the SQUATTER FAMILY. SCHULTZ Great stuff, but we're looking at a shitfight with our beloved publisher. He and Shaw... (crossing his fingers) Old money sticks together. VICKI points to a photo of SHAW racing from the truck to his car. VICKI I'd sure like to know what shook him up so. He was out of there like a scared rabbit... Just then, a reporter -- WILK -- rushes up excitedly to SCHULTZ's desk. WILK Got a blind tip from downtown. You know that massacre on the docks? Batman. VICKI reacts in astonishment. SCHULTZ's jaw drops -- this is hot. EDITOR Whoa! Is this on the level? WILK Cops even got a note. "Those who feed on the soul of Gotham will suffer my wrath!" (grinning; to VICKI) Sounds like your pal's cranked it up a notch. VICKI starts to protest, but thinks better of it. INT. WAYNE MANOR - ENTRY HALL - EVENING ALFRED opens the door. A BANNER HEADLINE stares him in the face: BATMAN IMPLICATED IN DOCK MASSACRE Industrialist Linked to Drug Smuggling Ring VICKI, who's holding up the afternoon paper for ALFRED's inspection, peeks out glumly from behind the masthead. VICKI Seen the late edition? ALFRED I'm afraid so, Miss Vale. Master Bruce is sequestered in the cave. INT. BRUCE'S LIBRARY - A MOMENT LATER - EVENING On their way to the Batcave, ALFRED and VICKI pass through the library. They pause in front of the television -- which is tuned to a PANEL SHOW, with various experts discussing the hot issue of the day. ENVIRONMENTALIST (on TV) Walter Barrett's no saint. His factories have been dumping poison into the air and water for years. If he is mixed up with drugs... PUNDIT (on TV) That's not the issue. The issue is, do we entrust our public safety to some...masked vigilante. Does Batman have a license to kill? ALFRED (shaking his head) Ah, the public. Dishearteningly fickle. VICKI follows ALFRED out. We HOLD on the TV as the CAMERA PANS OVER to the third guest on the panel, loudly demanding air time. He's wearing a RED BERET and a BATMAN SWEATSHIRT: MIKE SEKOWSKY (on TV) Yo, here's the tip, man. Drug dealers are scum. If Batman did wax these punks...SO WHAT? They deserved it! End of discussion. INT. BATCAVE - A MOMENT LATER - EVENING ALFRED and VICKI arrive; BRUCE gestures for them to keep quiet. He's hunched over a TAPE RECORDER -- and COMMISSIONER GORDON'S VOICE is blaring from a nearby speaker... GORDON (O.S.; filter) Anyone could've written that note. INT. GORDON'S OFFICE - THAT MOMENT GORDON's in conference with a number of CITY OFFICIALS -- blissfully unaware that anyone might be eavesdropping. CITY OFFICIAL I And I suppose anyone could've taken out a boatload of armed thugs. A dozen men, Jim -- murdered in cold blood -- GORDON Before we forget, Batman's saved hundreds of lives! CITY OFFICIAL II He's still a vigilante. We don't know who he is, where he comes from, why he does it... CITY OFFICIAL I Street punks are one thing, Jim. This is Walter Barrett -- a personal friend of mine! As the conversation continues, CAMERA SLOWLY MOVES IN ON a COMPUTER TERMINAL in the corner. We see the tiny TRADEMARK embossed on the CPU -- "WAYNE TECHNOLOGIES." INT. BATCAVE - THAT MOMENT - ON BRUCE as he LISTENS through his concealed bug. CITY OFFCIAL II You've gotta bring him in, Jim -- at least for questioning. It would sure help if we could get that mask off... BRUCE shuts the recorder off. He turns to face ALFRED and VICKI -- BRUCE Ladies and gentlemen...I've been framed. CUT TO: EXT. GOTHAM CITY - NIGHT The BAT-SIGNAL blazing in the night sky. After a beat, the CAMERA TILTS DOWN to a cluster of EXCITED CITIZENS, who point and holler as the BATMOBILE streaks past. INT. SQUAD CAR - THAT MOMENT TWO COPS are parked in an alleyway, watching as the BATMOBILE whizzes past on the street. The DRIVER pulls out behind it as the second COP grabs his radio mike... COP One-delta-niner -- 10-80 on Riverview north-bound at 33rd -- 10-78, repeat 10-78. VOICE ON RADIO (filter) 10-4, one-delta-niner -- that's a 10-37, repeat 10-37. Backup on the way. EXT. STREET - ON BATMOBILE BARRELING TOWARD US on the street. The SQUAD CAR gains behind it. A SIREN HOWLS; a red-and-blue bubble begins to flash... The BATMOBILE makes a HAIRPIN TURN -- and ACCELERATES. OVERHEAD ANGLE - THE STREETS As the BATMOBILE rounds the corner and picks up speed, TWO MORE SQUAD CARS scream down the cross street, joining in the pursuit. All at once THICK BLACK SMOKE billows from the back of the Batmobile -- ENVELOPING the police cars, BLINDING THE DRIVERS... EXT. STREET - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT TWO SQUAD CARS parked in a V-formation -- a makeshift roadblock. ANXIOUS POLICEMEN mill about in front of them. They move into position as the BATMOBILE, still trailing smoke, rounds a corner and careens directly toward them... ANGLE ON BATMOBILE - THAT MOMENT The FRONT FENDER of the Batmobile detaches and EXTENDS itself from the body of the car. It BENDS in the middle; WING-PANELS flip into place, forming an arrowhead-shaped COW-CATCHER. EXT. STREET - ON ROADBLOCK A SHRIEKING HORN BLARES. The COPS see the Batmobile SPEEDING UP and dive for the sidewalk. The COW-CATCHER slams into the SOUAD CARS, pushes them effortlessly aside, and cruises through the gap. As the PURSUING CARS emerge from the smoke cloud and follow the Batmobile through, we TILT UP to the roof of a nearby building -- EXT. ROOFTOP - THAT MOMENT -- and realize that the Batmobile's on automatic pilot, because BATMAN's been on the roof all along -- watching the action with some dismay. His relationship with the Gotham PD appears to be on shaky ground. He speaks into his voice-activated REMOTE CONTROL UNIT: BATMAN Evasive. SIRENS HOWL below as he strolls across the rooftop, lost in thought. CUT TO: INT. PENTHOUSE APARTMENT - NIGHT At this height, the SIRENS are a distant insect drone. We're in the palatial digs of RANDALL SHAW, the construction magnate. There's obviously money to be made in real-estate development -- because the walls are lined with art, and the floor-to-ceiling windows open on the most spectacular view in Gotham. At the moment, SHAW's posing casually in front of his new Brancusi -- which rests on a pedestal near the windows. An UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN in a slinky black dress LOOKS ON, her back to the camera... WOMAN It's a fake. SHAW Hmm. It cost me a half a million dollars. You're sure? WOMAN Absolutely. You see, I...happen to know where the real one is stashed. The WOMAN wanders out of frame as SHAW smiles, impressed. He seems peculiarly nonchalant about the whole deal; at the moment, art is not the first thing on his mind. CAMERA STAYS ON HIM as he pours two glasses of red wine and circles in on his mysterious guest. SHAW I guess you'd know. I have some "friends" in the art world. They say that -- for certain hard-to-get items -- you're the one to call. WOMAN (O.S.) How flattering. SHAW They say for the right price...you could steal Michelangelo off the Sistine Chapel Wall. WOMAN (O.S.) Mr. Shaw. Do you believe everything you hear? SHAW Oh, I'm not one to judge. I admire people who take what they want. I'm just curious how you do it. SHAW hands her the wine, and for the first time we see her face. It's SELINA KYLE, perching seductively on the arm of the sofa... SELINA I find that the old methods work best. Setting her wine down, flashing her patented Cheshire-cat smile, SELINA moves in on him -- and they go into a deep, passionate kiss. Her long red nails dig into his back; SHAW drops his wine glass, which SHATTERS -- splashing red wine across the polished parquet floor. INT. PENTHOUSE - SHAW'S BEDROOM - NIGHT The action's gone horizontal. SELINA, peeled down to a sheer lace teddy, is on the bed atop SHAW -- tickling his throat with quick, lapping kisses. She rolls off suddenly; when he tries to sit up, she pushes him back down with a single finger. Sitting on the edge of the bed, she peels off her STOCKINGS, twisting them around into tight cords. With a coy smile she runs her finger in a circle around SHAW's hairy chest -- and then, abruptly, knots one stocking tightly about his wrist and ties it off on the bedpost. SHAW Hey, what are you doing -- ? He tries to break her grip. She BACKHANDS him sharply across the face. SELINA You're very inquisitive. You'll just have to be disciplined. An EDGY SMILE spreads across his face as she binds his other hand to the bedpost. None too quick, he's just caught on that all this is part of SELINA's kinky scene. She crosses quickly to the bathroom -- SHAW You know, I've...I've never really done this kind of thing before. -- and reemerges wearing her CATWOMAN mask...which seems perfectly appropriate in this context. SELINA I think people should indulge their fantasies. Don't you? Now that he's all trussed up, she crosses the room and reaches into an oversized bag. She withdraws an odd-looking chromium BRACE, slips it on over her wrist, and hits a trigger. SIX- INCH STEEL TALONS snick into place. SHAW's dopey smile fades... SHAW Hey, what are those -- what are you -- He lets out an awful, shrill SHRIEK as the camera WHIP PANS away from the bed to a Jackson Pollack on the wall nearby. A SPRAY OF BLOOD spatters across it -- in an aesthetically pleasing way -- and the SHRIEK ends in a LOW GURGLE as we CUT TO: INT. BUILDING LOBBY - A FEW MINUTES LATER - NIGHT A SECURITY GUARD is working a crossword at his booth near the entrance of the building. Behind him, a bank of MONITORS show various empty hallways throughout the building. He reaches for his coffee and sees a RED LIGHT flashing on a wall panel nearby. INT. SHAW'S PENTHOUSE - THAT MOMENT The penthouse is THROBBING with the clangorous sound of a BURGLAR ALARM. SELINA is standing by an OPEN WALL SAFE -- concealed behind a painting, which has been swung away on hinges -- and she's HOLDING HER EARS, wearing a look of complete exasperation: oh, shit. The GUARD'S VOICE crackles over a nearby intercom: GUARD (O.S.; filter) Mr. Shaw? What's going on up there? -- Mr. Shaw? Furious with herself, she reaches inside the safe and extracts a BLACK RAVEN statuette -- identical to the one she took on the docks. She slams the door shut and swings the picture back into place. EXT. STREETS - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT SIRENS echo in the streets. SQUAD CARS make sudden turns and streak off toward SHAW's building. EXT. ROOFTOP - HIGH ANGLE - NIGHT Watching the cars from his rooftop vantage, BATMAN raises an ANTENNA mounted on his utility belt and cups one hand to his head. An EARPIECE concealed inside his cowl gives him the police frequency: DISPATCHER (O.S.; filter) -- possible 15 in progress, 188 E. 69th at Gotham Park West. Move out. It's Randall Shaw. Repeat, all units -- BATMAN's eyes widen. He steps to the ledge and pulls a TINY METAL CYLINDER from his belt -- immediately recognizable as part of BRUCE's hydraulic umbrella-gizmo. But it's no umbrella. When BATMAN thumbs the switch, his BLACK CAPE begins to SPREAD and RISE -- stiffening, expanding -- INFLATING itself into a pair of RIGID BLACK BATWINGS. He steps OFF THE LEDGE, INTO MIDAIR -- SOARING SILENTLY ACROSS THE STREET LIKE A HUMAN HANG-GLIDER as the cop cars cruise past far below. INT. SHAW'S BEDROOM - NIGHT There's an awful BANGING at the front door. SHAW lies under the bloody sheets, hands folded, staring lifelessly up at the ceiling. SELINA, now dressed in full Catwoman regalia, slings a lightweight KNAPSACK over her shoulders. She picks up the nearest chair, RAMS IT through SHAW's plate-glass window, and clambers out onto the ledge outside. Ten seconds later the COPS burst in. They rush to the bedroom -- spot the shattered window, the inert gory mass on the bed -- -- but the real shock comes when they glance over at the wall. Painted there, in blood...is a big, red, dripping BAT. COP JESUS! EXT. ROOFTOP - SHAW'S BUILDING - NIGHT Forty stories up. The CATWOMAN, in a surefooted crouch, she scurries along the ledge -- SPRINGS at a cornice -- and in one lithe motion VAULTS UP onto the ROOF. She scampers across the rooftops, dropping from one to the next with rope and tackle, like a mountain climber -- -- until she reaches the building at the end of the block. Here she pauses to dig in her knapsack. She pulls out a retractable HOOK at the end of a rope, swings it around, HEAVES IT at the rooftop across the street... EXT. STREET BELOW - LOW ANGLE - THAT MOMENT POLICE pile out of cars and race for the entrance, totally oblivious to the odd scene taking place overhead -- where the small, barely-visible figure of a WOMAN, clad entirely in black leather, is doing a TIGHTROPE WALK across the intersection. EXT. ROOFTOP - A MINUTE LATER - NIGHT The CATWOMAN bounds across snowy rooftops until she decides she's out of danger. Then, weary and exhilarated, she drops to her knees; bathed in moonlight, she preens, stretches, emits eerie little purrs and hisses of pleasure. She's just made a kill and her blood is running high, so she's stopped for a moment of Quality Time. She hears an odd crunching noise two roofs over. Her whole body tenses and -- though her head doesn't move -- her eyes dart left. A CAPED SHADOW has just touched down at the end of a line. The gold BAT-EMBLEM on his chest is visible for the briefest of seconds before he steps back into the shadows. She acts like she hasn't noticed... ...but a little smile flickers across her lips just the same. TIGHT ON BATMAN - THAT MOMENT His eyes widen -- his LIPS PART as he watches her. If it's possible to see absolute consternation behind that mask, we're seeing it now. HIS POV - ON CATWOMAN - THAT MOMENT She still doesn't let on that she's seen him. Instead, she goes to the ledge of the roof and begins to STRUT, like a gymnast on the balance beam -- POSING for him in a little private show -- a strange, self-infatuated, AUTOEROTIC DANCE ROUTINE for BATMAN's benefit. EXT. ROOFTOP - THAT MOMENT His jaw is down around his knees. Whoa. He edges forward slightly, as if hypnotically drawn to her... She hears a noise. Stops. Makes a big show of looking left and right. Somehow afraid she'll see him watching, BATMAN jumps back into the shadows. She gathers her things; a small WHITE CARD flutters from her knapsack to the snowy roof, and she VANISHES over the edge. Snapping back to reality, he bolts across the roof just in time to see -- EXT. SIDE OF BUILDING - ON CATWOMAN - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT She's rapidly working her way down the side of the building, flipping down from one fire escape to tile next -- a master gymnast. Three stories up, she lands on a railing, then STOPS -- LAUNCHING HERSELF out over the street, making a perfect landing on the roof of a passing BUS. EXT. ROOFTOP - ON BATMAN - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT BATMAN turns -- and his eyes fall on the WHITE CARD. He kneels to pick it up; a brief three-word MESSAGE is scrawled upon it... LOOKING FOR LOVE? He goes goggle-eyed with astonishment. He rushes back to the edge of the roof and sees the BUS just turning toward the entrance to Gotham Park. He's reaching for his grappling-gun, figuring to follow, when a FLOODLIGHT catches him full in the face. EXT. STREETS BELOW - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT Down below, the cops are sweeping their beams across the rooftops. Two of them catch a quick glimpse of BATMAN just as he ducks back behind the cornice, out of view. COP Hey. You see what I saw...? This sends the astounded COPS rushing to their radios. Right on cue, COMMISSIONER GORDON's car pulls up. LT. BULLOCK, who's already on the scene, fills him in as he climbs out. BULLOCK It's Randall Shaw. Torn to ribbons. -- We just made Batman up on the roof. GORDON Oh God. EXT. GOTHAM PARK - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT The BUS rumbles deeper into the snowy park. A BLACK SILHOUETTE springs off the roof into the trees, disappearing among the branches... We TRACK WITH the bus as it moves through the park, arriving finally at: EXT. CLEARING IN PARK - SHANTYTOWN - NIGHT The little colony of HOMELESS PEOPLE in their cardboard shacks and lean-tos, still occupying the future site of the Park Towers. MARCHERS and PICKETERS are continuing their protest nearby, and some charitable organization's set up a makeshift soup kitchen on folding tables -- hot coffee and sandwiches. VICKI's on the periphery of the camp, camera in hand. She's trying to persuade a HOMELESS MAN to let his picture be taken. VICKI Please, just one. It's important for people to see what's happening. HOMELESS MAN They don't want to see us, lady. They just want us gone -- out of sight, and out of mind. (mumbling as he wanders off) Get worse before it gets better. It always does. VICKI TURNS. In the distance, the PICKETERS are shrieking and wailing. A VAN's just pulled up to the edge of the park, and a dozen HARDHATS are elbowing their way through the crowd. All at once they're swarming through shantytown with TIRE IRONS and BASEBALL BATS, overturning the sandwich tables, RIPPING DOWN the shabby tents and lean-tos. Some of the HOMELESS PEOPLE run. Those who resist meet with swift and sudden violence. A MARCHER jumps a hardhat, and gets a baseball bat in the gut for his trouble. VICKI waits for the police sirens, but they don't come. She backs off toward the trees, she begins SNAPPING PHOTOS FRANTICALLY, capturing the carnage on film. A HARDHAT is dismantling a lean-to with his tire iron -- sending the terrified family inside scurrying off into the snow -- when he glances up and sees VICKI taking his picture. He points her out to a colleague... ...and suddenly the two of them are RUSHING TOWARD HER with pure cold malice in their eyes. VICKI turns to run, but it's slow going in the snow. She SLIPS and FALLS; her attackers are almost upon her... ...when a SHADOWY FIGURE DIVES OUT OF THE TREES and TACKLES one of the HARDHATS. The FIGURE lands a powerhouse blow to the fallen HARDHATs jaw, knocking him out cold. The second HARDHAT turns and lifts his TIRE IRON. But the FIGURE, with surprising agility, is already rolling out of the way. As he rolls, he grabs the first guy's HARDHAT off his head and brings it up in front of him -- blocking the blow from the second guy's tire iron. In the same motion, he plants a FOOT in the second HARDHAT's belly and sends him REELING BACKWARD, HARDHAT II drops the tire iron, and the FIGURE snatches it out of midair as he gets to his feet. He moves in on the second HARDHAT, BRANDISHING the iron -- -- and while HARDHAT II is staring at it, the FIGURE HIGH- KICKS HIM in the face. HOP; KICK. HOP; KICK. The FIGURE has nailed him three times squarely on the jaw before he can hit the ground. The FIGURE turns toward VICKI. Her eyes go wide with astonishment. It's a KID, thirteen or fourteen at the outside, sunken-eyed, grimy-looking, in a torn-and-tattered RAINCOAT. She stares at him for the briefest of instants before he rushes off to the aid of his fellow homeless... She can't believe what she's seeing. The KID wades smack into the midst of the remaining HARDHATS, and kicks ass -- spinning, pirouetting, kicking, clawing in a furious display of pure athleticism. It seems like he's everywhere at once. There's only one other guy in Gotham City who can handle himself like this... Rallying behind him, the MARCHERS and HOMELESS PEOPLE snatch bats and tire irons from the fallen HARDHATS -- and the tide turns. The invasion is being repelled. Faced with renewed resistance, the few HARDHATS still left standing TURN TAIL and race off to their VAN. Triumph in shantytown. The MARCHERS and HOMELESS cluster together to lick their wounds -- and the KID, satisfied that everything is under control, turns and sprints off toward the trees. But one prostrate HARDHAT is only playing dead. As the KID runs past, the HARDHAT extends a TIRE IRON into his path -- TRIPPING HIM, sending him sprawling in the snow. The KID throws up his hands as the HARDHAT prepares to smash down at him... CLANG. The HARDHAT drops his tire iron and topples over, BOARDLIKE. The KID looks up and sees VICKI standing there with a baseball bat. He gives her a quick nod of acknowledgement as he gets to his feet -- thanks for returning the favor. He's about to light out again when -- VICKI WAIT! Don't be afraid. I wanted to thank you. I -- KID (cautiously) Twenty. VICKI What? KID Twenty bucks. VICKI's mildly taken aback, but she reaches for her purse just the same. She's barely gotten her wallet open when the KID snatches the bill out of her hands. They stare at each other for a long moment -- VICKI ...Who are you? KID Dick. -- and then he's bounding off like a shot. VAULTING up into a tree and vanishing amid the snowy branches. VICKI starts to follow, but there's no way she can keep up. Instead she digs into her CAMERA BAG... HER POV - THROUGH TELEPHOTO LENS Using the long lens, she tracks the KID's progress through the treetops. She can't actually see him, but occasional chunks of SNOW and ICE are falling to the ground as he jumps from limb to limb... For a moment it seems like she's lost him. As she sweeps the lens back and forth, scanning the trees, she catches sight of an EQUESTRIAN STATUE in the distance. She ups the magnification so she can see the plaque on the pedestal. The stone figure on the horse is Union war hero GEN. OLIVER WAYNE -- BRUCE's great-grandfather. As luck would have it, the KID drops to earth not ten feet from the statue -- VICKI's got him in her sights again. He looks around cautiously to make sure no one's following, then races toward a STONE BRIDGE which arches between two small hillocks, over a frozen creek. There's a DRAINAGE TUNNEL, four or five feet in diameter, mounted in the bridge abutment, the KID pries off a wire grate and clambers inside, then pulls the grate back into place behind him. Home sweet home. EXT. PARK - ON VICKI - NIGHT as she lowers the lens. Her face is full of conflicting emotions. She'd love to corner this boy vigilante and find out what his story is. But on the other hand -- even the homeless are entitled to their privacy... CUT TO: INT. PENGUIN'S AVIARY - NIGHT A CANARY sings in its cage as a BLACK CAT watches transfixed from a nearby chair. The cat arches its back -- waits -- and SPRINGS AT THE CAGE, BATTING at it in midair. The canary SHRIEKS; the cat YOWLS; a WOMAN snatches it up off the floor, cradles it in her arms... WOMAN'S VOICE Now Hecate. You don't want that scrawny little bird -- It's SELINA, looking ripe and slinky in a sheer black ensemble. At the desk behind her is the PENGUIN, in his customary cutaway and waist-coat, polishing his new RAVEN. He bares his teeth: PENGUIN Do you want me to wring that creature's neck? SELINA You try it, I'll do the same to you. (as he grumbles; bemused) I saw him, you know. PENGUIN Saw who? SELINA Batman. He was dreamy. She strokes the cat, in a reverie. The PENGUIN drops his polishing cloth, startled. PENGUIN Dreamy?!? Are you insane!? My God -- (sputtering wildly) Are you sure it was him? What did he do? SELINA He stood on a roof and watched me. He didn't realize I'd seen him. I don't think he knew quite what to make of me. (smiling) But he was definitely interested. This sends the PENGUIN into a frantic round of pacing. (Or waddling.) PENGUIN This scheme of yours is backfiring. We don't need him on our tails. Do you know how much money is at stake here? SELINA Money isn't everything. (casually) What's the point if we can't enjoy ourselves? She chuckles to herself. He stares at her in disbelief -- and SQUAWKS. CUT TO: EXT. GOTHAM SQUARE - MORNING The big SIGN over Gotham Square tells us there are only 9 shopping days left until Christmas. Down below, BRUCE is walking VICKI to work. VICKI Six-on-one, and he took 'em all out...then vanished into a drainage pipe -- right next to the statue of General Wayne. BRUCE My illustrious great-grandfather. Think it's the same kid we heard about? VICKI Must be. He reminded me of you. BRUCE chuckles. They pass a NEWSSTAND just outside the Globe building, pausing to stare at the headlines -- which SCREAM: NEW BAT-MURDER? Batman Suspect in Slaying of Millionaire Developer Commissioner Gordon Refuses Comment The accompanying photo is a full-color spread of the BLOODY RED BAT painted on SHAW's wall. BRUCE scowls at VICKI: BRUCE -- You work for this rag? (snatching up a paper) Your boss is calling for Gordon's resignation -- unless he brings Batman in for questioning... VICKI nudges BRUCE and points at a STOREFRONT across the street. THEIR POV - SOUVENIR SHOP The owner is in the store window, hastily removing all of his Batman merchandise and setting up new displays devoted to TEENAGE MUTANT NINJA TURTLES and THE SIMPSONS. A MOTHER drags her squirming TODDLER past the entrance -- the kid smells heavy markdowns on Bat-shit, but Mom clearly doesn't approve... BACK TO SCENE - ON BRUCE AND VICKI looking on in dismay. BRUCE crumples the paper in outrage: BRUCE I need a good PR man. NEWS VENDOR Hey, pal -- you buyin' or borrowin'? With a sullen look, BRUCE tosses the paper back on the rack. VICKI pulls him off toward the entrance of the Globe. VICKI That's what happens when you go after the rich and powerful. BRUCE Hey, it wasn't me, remember? I am rich and powerful -- As he's talking, BRUCE glances back at the newsstand. He sees an AD FLYER tacked up on one side -- "LOOKING FOR LOVE? Find it in the GOTHAM GLOBE PERSONALS." Looking for Love. Eyes widening, he digs in his pocket for a quarter and races back to the newsstand. VICKI keeps walking... VICKI Maybe it's almost...good. In a weird way. I mean, Shaw, and Barrett -- if people like that were really scared, maybe they'd -- She suddenly realizes she's talking to herself. She turns around and sees BRUCE back at the newsstand, hurriedly unfolding a copy of the Globe. She marches back and tugs at his sleeve. VICKI (cont.) Hey, I'm late for work. You can read that later. BRUCE Quiet. I'm looking for a personal ad. Her face screws up in confusion as BRUCE frantically scans the page. BRUCE (cont.) "Tall, Dark And Handsome -- You saw me on the roof 12/16. I was in black; you were too." VICKI Is this some kind of bad joke? BRUCE It's her. That cat woman, or whatever she is. (reading aloud) "I jumped a bus into Gotham Park hoping you'd follow, but you were too shy..." VICKI What does she want -- a date? BRUCE She's trying to contact me. Says she's gonna leave me another ad... The two of them exchange a look of utter perplexity. BRUCE's mind is racing; he seems bizarrely aroused -- in a way that makes VICKI just a trifle nervous... INT. GOTHAM GLOBE - CITY ROOM - DAY VICKI arrives at her desk and sets her portfolio down. She spots a message in the "in" file. She takes one look at it, and her eyes go wide with RAGE. She storms out in a fury... INT. PUBLISHER'S OFFICE - A MINUTE LATER - DAY Barging past a phalanx of SECRETARIES, VICKI bursts into the inner office of HARRISON J. PROVOST, publisher of the Globe. He's just opening his mail. He heaves a weary sigh as VICKI BARKS at him: VICKI WHY DID YOU KILL MY STORY? PROVOST Close the door. (waiting for her to calm down) Your story isn't news. With Shaw dead -- VICKI But the project's still going ahead! If attacking homeless people in the park isn't news, I'd like to know what is -- PROVOST There's a psycho out there in a mask and cape -- killing off Gotham's most prominent citizens! That's news. (beat) I've known Randall Shaw all my life. His family is in mourning. And it just so happens I don't believe in slandering the dead. VICKI FUMES. She turns and stares PROVOST straight in the eye. VICKI Mr. Provost -- how much money do you have tied up in the Park Tower project? PROVOST Vicki...I'm going to forget you made that remark. For the sake of your job, I suggest you do the same. VICKI stalks of -- and PROVOST goes back to his mail. He finds an envelope addressed in a shaky, psychotic scrawl, with the word "CONFIDENTIAL" underlined three times in ink. He tears it open -- -- and HIS FACE TURNS PALE as he stares down at the contents: a small business-sized card, signed with a BAT-EMBLEM... THOSE WHO FEED ON THE SOUL OF GOTHAM WILL SUFFER MY WRATH CUT TO: EXT. GOTHAM HALL OF JUSTICE - DAY WALTER BARRETT and his ATTORNEY emerge onto the front steps of the courthouse. BARRETT is instantly mobbed by REPORTERS. REPORTER I Mr. Barrett! Any comment on the arraignment? REPORTER II Is it true bail was set at two million dollars? ATTORNEY Stand back! My client has nothing to say at this time! The ATTORNEY clears a path for BARRETT, who climbs into a waiting CAR, shielding his face. REPORTERS cluster around it... As the car pulls out into traffic, we see a flock of PIGEONS taking wing from their perches on the statues outside the Hall of Justice. OVERHEAD SHOT - ON BARRETT'S CAR PIGEONS fill the frame, swooping down toward the CAR, which is idling at a traffic light far below. INT. BARRETT'S CAR - THAT MOMENT The liveried DRIVER drums his fingers as he waits for the light to change. BARRETT's in the back, speaking into his cellular phone. BARRETT It's time we called an emergency meeting of the Raven Society. Get back to me... Looking troubled, he hangs up. A fat white glob of PIGEON SHIT splatters across the windshield. Seconds later -- another SPLAT. BARRETT (cont.) Damn pigeons. DRIVER Just washed it, too. The DRIVER reaches for the wiper switch. They hear a tiny DINK as a SOLID PELLET bounces off the windshield. BARRETT and the DRIVER exchange a mystified look. A small, blinking CAPSULE has just lodged in the wiper-blade assembly... OVERHEAD SHOT - ON BARRETT'S CAR Just as the light changes, the CAR EXPLODES into a million fragments -- leaving a BLACKENED CRATER in the middle of the intersection. CUT TO: INT. BATCAVE - DAY TIGHT ON A VIDEO MONITOR -- showing FIRE TRUCKS in the intersection we've just left, hosing down the wreckage of BARRETT's car. BRUCE is watching intently when ALFRED appears behind him. ALFRED The Fluegelheim called again, sir. They want to know if you'll be attending the opening of the new Egyptian exhibit. BRUCE, still engrossed in his news broadcast, waves ALFRED off. BRUCE Cancel. ANCHORWOMAN (on TV) -- and, citing new evidence in the so- called string of "millionaire murders," Police Commissioner J.T. Gordon today swore out a warrant for the arrest of Batman. (beat) We go now live to Mike Sekowsky, spokesperson, Order of the Bat. SEKOWSKY Jeez! Talk about gratitude -- !! At the sight of SEKOWSKY's face, BRUCE kills the sound in disgust. ALFRED looks on helplessly as he paces the floor of the Batcave. BRUCE Well, Alfred, it's official. I'm a wanted man. (beat) "New evidence"...I've gotta find that woman. Did you check the personals? As ALFRED shakes his head no, a BUZZER sounds. They've got a visitor. BRUCE hits a switch on a monitor, and sees COMMISSIONER GORDON'S CAR sitting outside the wrought-iron gates of Wayne Manor. He throws a nervous look at ALFRED. ALFRED speaks into a microphone: ALFRED Who's there? GORDON Jim Gordon, Alfred. I've got to see Bruce. A spooky development. Does GORDON suspect? After a moment's hesitation, BRUCE nods to ALFRED -- let him in. ALFRED Mr. Wayne will see you, sir. INT. BRUCE'S LIBRARY - A MOMENT LATER A curious BRUCE ushers GORDON into the library, gestures toward the liquor cabinet. The Commissioner nods his head no. He's fidgety, ill at ease -- he obviously doesn't want to be here. GORDON Sorry to bother you. Bruce -- I'll get right down to it. You knew Shaw and Barrett -- BRUCE I saw them occasionally. We all sat on the board of the Fluegelheim... GORDON Did you have any...dealings with them, or -- BRUCE No. I never liked the way they did business. GORDON The thing is, Bruce, you're all lumped together in the public mind -- the Five Families of Gotham, that sort of thing -- and, uh... (taking a card from his pocket) Harrison Provost got this in the mail. BRUCE examines the card, -- "THOSE WHO FEED," etc. He stares at GORDON in mock-concern, playing it close to the vest... BRUCE Then Batman is behind all this. GORDON Batman or a damned good imitation. BRUCE Well. He's changed tactics, hasn't he. GORDON (shrugging; at a loss) Shaw, with his high-rises -- Barrett, a druglord, major polluter -- they weren't exactly model citizens. Who knows, it could be some crazy social-conscience kind of thing. BRUCE You mean he's going after...the root of the problem. GORDON shakes his head and gets up to go. BRUCE hands him the card. GORDON Let me know if you get one of these. We'll put all our resources at your disposal. BRUCE nods thoughtfully as ALFRED appears to see the Commissioner out. A moment later, the butler reappears. BRUCE Changed my mind, Alfred. I'll be dropping in on the Fluegelheim after all. CUT TO: INT. FLUEGELHEIM MUSEUM - NIGHT It's a party to celebrate the opening of the new Egyptian exhibit, and the Fluegelheim is hopping. BOARD MEMBERS, MUSEUM PATRONS, and SOCIALITES mill about in dinner jackets and evening gowns, making small talk. AN OPEN SARCOPHAGUS has been set up as a wet bar. On a raised concrete platform in the center of the hall, rimmed by a decorative moat, sits an ancient Egyptian SHRINE. The TEMPLE OF BASTET has been moved to Gotham and reconstructed in the Fluegelheim --sandstone walls, fountains, statuary and all. Guarding the entrance is a stately bronze statue of the goddess BASTET -- who has the body of a woman and the head of a pointy-eared CAT. She holds an aegis and a sistrum; four tiny KITTENS romp at her feet. BRUCE, who's just arrived, is taking an intense interest in the cat-goddess... VICKI What is it? BRUCE I just had a weird sense of deja vu. He glances over by the sarcophagus and sees PROVOST, the publisher, huddle with ELIOT TIPTREE III, transit magnate -- the remaining member of Gotham's "Five Families." The two of them are engaged in some urgent conversation which he can't quite make out... TIPTREE Harrison -- we really ought to warn Bruce. We owe him that much. BRUCE detaches himself from VICKI and strolls toward them. PROVOST and TIPTREE force smiles and wave, affecting an air of nonchalance. PROVOST (cont.) The man's a space cadet. Let him look out for himself. (as BRUCE arrives; cheerfully) Why, Bruce! What a delightful surprise. BRUCE Good to see you two. Looks like the Five Families are suddenly down to three. (looking around) In fact, if somebody dropped a bomb on this room right now -- TIPTREE chuckles nervously. PROVOST is even less amused. PROVOST Is that your idea of a joke, Bruce? BRUCE Not at all. Commissioner Gordon seems to think we should all be hiring bodyguards. TIPTREE PROVOST Oh, that's absurd. I already have. The two of them glower at each other. It's like an outtake from The Newlywed Game. BRUCE shrugs it off and makes a vacuous face: BRUCE Thing is, I can't imagine why Batman would be after us. Can you? PROVOST and TIPTREE are about to go into another round of hemming-and-hawing when a NEW FACE joins the party. It's SELINA KYLE -- stunning as ever in an extravagantly revealing dress slit up to the armpits. She's holding two glasses of CHAMPAGNE... SELINA You two look like you need a drink. -- And is this who I think it is? She flashes BRUCE her most winning, seductive, heavy-artillery SMILE. He BLINKS, temporarily speechless. PROVOST Selina Kyle -- Bruce Wayne. SELINA Our absentee board member! I've been wanting to meet you forever. TIPTREE Selina's the new Curator of Antiquities. She brought the Temple over block by block -- SELINA You two won't be terribly upset if I borrow Bruce for a moment, will you? Before he can protest, she's linked an arm around his and dragged him off. A nearby FAT MAN spots SELINA, wiggles his eyebrows and WAVES BRIGHTLY. His tongue is practically hanging out -- he's just dying to write her a check. SELINA SIGHS WEARILY to BRUCE: SELINA (cont.) Major contributor. -- I always seem to wind up in charge of fund-raising... BRUCE I can't imagine why. SELINA Tax year's almost over, you know. I hope we can count on your usual generous donation. (indicating PROVOST and TIPTREE) Someone's got to set an example for those two tightwads. BRUCE They're proccupied. This string of murders -- SELINA I asked them if they'd consider including us in their wills. (chuckling to herself) They didn't seem a bit amused... ANGLE ON VICKI - THAT MOMENT She's making small talk with a bunch of STUFFED SHIRTS and their overdressed WIVES. She glances across the room at the statue of Bastet, sees SELINA draped all over BRUCE. A frown crosses her face... ANGLE ON BRUCE AND SELINA - THAT MOMENT She's still clinging to his arm as they stare up at the statue. SELINA -- and this is my good friend Bastet, the Egyptian Cat Goddess. BRUCE I think we've already met. -- This is quite an expedition you've put together. SELINA I'm glad you think so. I have to say, Bruce -- you're not at all what I expected. BRUCE Sorry to disappoint you. SELINA Oh, it's not that. Not at all. It's just that I'd always heard you were... BRUCE What? SELINA (coyly) Oh...sort of a... BRUCE (smiling; fascinated) No. Come on. What? BRUCE's state of mounting infatuation is abruptly shattered when VICKI sidles up alongside him and -- territorially -- takes his other arm. The women exchange big, toothy, plastic smiles; stranded in the middle, BRUCE realizes they're waiting for him to introduce them. BRUCE Oh. Selina Kyle -- my friend Vicki Vale. SELINA The photographer. I've seen your pictures in the Gazette. VICKI The Globe. SELINA Oh, that's right. The tabloid one. -- What an original dress! VICKI, still smiling, cocks an eyebrow at BRUCE. He senses trouble coming and tries to head it off at the pass. BRUCE Selina supervised the reconstruction of the temple. Brought it back from Egypt... stone by stone. VICKI Really. She must be awfully tired. (to SELINA) How'd you get to be in charge of a huge project like this? SELINA It was easy. I slept with the Pharoah. She laughs at her own joke. VICKI responds with a dry little chuckle of her own. SELINA gives BRUCE a SHARP YANK on the sleeve. SELINA (cont.) Excuse us, won't you, sweetheart? We have some boring museum business to talk about. VICKI fumes. BRUCE shrugs apologetically as SELINA drags him off out of earshot. SELINA (cont.) I. Short leash. BRUCE Pull in the claws, okay? She's really terrific. SELINA I'm sorry, Bruce. Sometimes I get a little...aggressive, you know? (handing him a card) Look, I need to talk to you. Come by sometime. I'll give you the private tour. BRUCE Wait. Let me explain about Vicki -- SELINA (shushing him) I understand. Anyone who's that protective must have a pretty good reason for it. She shoots him one last smile -- sly, conspiratorial, unmistakably juicy. Then she's off in pursuit of another major funder. BRUCE is thoughtfully turning the card over in his hands when VICKI rejoins him. VICKI How's "business"? BRUCE Relax, okay? I like you better. He scans the room, trying to find PROVOST and TIPTREE. No luck. VICKI If you're looking for your fellow millionaires, they left some time back. CUT TO: INT. ROOFTOP - NIGHT The roof of the Gotham Globe. A STARLING circles overhead for a moment -- then DIVES down an exposed VENTILATION SHAFT. INT. GOTHAM GLOBE - THAT MOMENT TWO ARMED BODYGUARDS are standing watch outside an office. Brass letters on the door read "J. HARRISON PROVOST, PUBLISHER." INT. PROVOST'S OFFICE - THAT MOMENT PROVOST, agitated, working late. He speaks, sotto voce, into the phone: PROVOST Don't worry about that. I've had the office swept for bugs. No one's listening... INT. TIPTREE'S LIBRARY - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT TIPTREE in his paneled study at home. There's an open bottle on the table and he's been hitting the sauce -- hard. His VOICE QUAVERS: TIPTREE It's just so -- unfair. I mean...it was over a century ago. It's not like we're responsible. (hollow-eyed) How could he know? How could Batman know about the Raven Society?? INT. OFFICE - ON PROVOST - THAT MOMENT PROVOST Who knows and who cares. The point is, it's happened... He hears a CHIRP and looks up. It seems to be coming from a HEATING VENT on the wall. But then it stops, so he resumes his conversation -- PROVOST (cont.) I'm clearing out of the country, and I'm taking the raven with me. I suggest you do the same. INT. HEATING VENT - THAT MOMENT In the metal shaft on the other side of the grate is a tiny BIRD -- the same one we saw flying down the air shaft. Now that we've got a close-up view, we can see the thin BATTERY PACK wired to its underbelly...and the MINIATURE MICROPHONE taped to its leg. PROVOST (O.S.) I'll tell you how to reach me. And don't repeat this to anyone. CUT TO: INT. PENGUIN'S LAIR - DAY The PENGUIN stands over his indoor penguin pool. He's wearing rubber gloves, feeding LIVE FISH from an ice chest to his arctic birds. The vents in the windows are open, and the climate in the room is downright icy as SELINA's wrapped in fur, stroking her pet cat: SELINA He's just another rich idiot. (chuckling to herself) The odd thing is, he didn't seem a bit concerned. PENGUIN Then he is an idiot. SELINA He lives in some big sprawling manor. I'll have to get inside, scope it out... see where he's got the raven stashed. PENGUIN How do you plan to do that? SELINA How do you think! A feline smile from SELINA. The PENGUIN chuckles to himself, lobs a FISH out over the pool. A swooping GULL snatches it out of the air before it hits the water. FRICK arrives in the doorway. FRICK It's Mr. Provost, sir. He's planning to embark on an unscheduled Christmas vacation. PENGUIN Good! That should save us a trip to the bank. CUT TO: INT. FLUEGELHEIM - BACK ROOM - DAY A huge open room cluttered with all kinds of junk: archaeologist's tools, restoration equipment, etc., plus a healthy assortment of curios and oddities from all over. This is SELINA's private domain. CAMERA TRACKS past a glass case full of ugly, withered, turdlike specimens... BRUCE What have we got here? SELINA Mummified cats. Bastet's sacred animal. They were buried by the thousands at Bubastis. -- Oh, careful! BRUCE FREEZES with his hand poised over a set of four earthen JARS. Each has a lid carved in the shape of a HEAD: ape, jackal, man, falcon. SELINA (cont.) Canopic jars. In the process of mummification, the internal organs were buried separately. (pointing to each jar in turn) Lungs -- stomach -- liver -- intestine -- BRUCE withdraws his hand with a bemused shudder. BRUCE You're in a gruesome line of work. SELINA Keeps me interested. And that's not easy to do... BRUCE's attention turns to a crumbling statuette of an odd beast: a WINGED LION with the head of a FALCON. BRUCE This one I know. It's a gryphon, right? SELINA Very good. A mythical demon, half-bird, half-lion...sweeping down from the sky to deliver retribution and justice. BRUCE nods. He can dig it. He regards the gryphon for a long moment and CHUCKLES. BRUCE Poor guy. Birds and cats -- you wouldn't think the two halves would cooperate. SELINA Only under certain circumstances. (beat) I'm really glad you came, Bruce. I was afraid I'd given you the wrong impression. Or maybe it was the right impression. BRUCE What was it you wanted to talk to me about? SELINA Your collection. I'd love to see it. I mean, everyone says you've got a fabulous -- She breaks off in midstream and chuckles to herself. She toys demurely with her equipment. She looks up at BRUCE and switches tactics -- going for the direct approach. BRUCE braces himself... SELINA (cont.) Mainly I just wanted an excuse to see you again. Does she know you're here -- Vicki? BRUCE (shrugging) No. SELINA It must be strange. Having all that power, and money -- never really knowing if that's what people are attracted to. BRUCE What are you attracted to? SELINA I think you're a little bit nuts. (beat) I think you're a little -- bored with your life. Having everything you want. No variety, no...danger. And every once in a while you need to take a risk. Shake it all up. BRUCE How? SELINA Maybe by...coming here today. She leans back against a crate, moistens her lips. She's letting him have it with both barrels. SELINA (cont.) That's one thing I can give you, Bruce -- danger -- a little something you can't get at home. BRUCE hesitates -- but the lure is irresistible. He moves forward slowly; SELINA's eyes close; their lips draw slowly closer... ...and he SNEEZES IN HER FACE. She backs off in shock as he covers his face. His eyes are watering and he's WHEEZING. She rushes over -- SELINA Are you okay? BRUCE Is there a cat in here? Right on cue, SELINA's black cat HECATE lets out a loud MEOW -- and STRETCHES against BRUCE's pants leg. He brushes the animal aside and it LEAPS into SELINA's arms. BRUCE sniffles uncontrollably. BRUCE (cont.) Get it away! She drops the cat, which scampers off. BRUCE rubs his eyes. SELINA Poor thing. You're allergic! BRUCE Yeah, cats...ever since I was a kid... (snorting and weeping) Look, I'd better get some fresh air. Maybe another time, okay... He heads for the door before SELINA can stop him. He's gone, but she knows she's left a dent in his armor. She smiles in bemusement as HECATE jumps into her arms and PURRS. EXT. FLUEGELHEIM - A MOMENT LATER - DAY BRUCE stumbles out the museum feeling mildly discombobulated. He marches down the front steps past a NEWSSTAND -- where he stops to buy a copy of the afternoon GLOBE. He opens it to the PERSONAL ADS and finds what he's been waiting for: TALL, DARK, AND HANDSOME -- Christmas is coming. Why don't we trim the tree together? This puzzles him for a moment -- until he looks up the street. In the distance, at the very center of Gotham Square, WORKMEN are stringing lights around an enormous CHRISTMAS TREE, almost fifty feet tall. The LIGHTING CEREMONY is an annual event in Gotham. BRUCE smiles slightly, tucks the paper under one arm and walks to his car. DISSOLVE TO: EXT. GOTHAM SQUARE - NIGHT SNOW falls on a huge CROWD gathered around the big tree. The tree won't be lit for another twenty minutes or so, and so the ONLOOKERS are singing CHRISTMAS CAROLS from printed lyric sheets. A BAND is playing on a makeshift ORCHESTRA PLATFORM erected in front of the tree, leading the crowd in a spirited rendition of "God Rest Ye Merry, Gentlemen." The Square is rocking with good will toward men. When they get to the part about saving us all from Satan's power -- EXT. ROOFTOP OVERLOOKING SQUARE - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT -- the CAMERA TILTS UPWARD to BATMAN, watching the action from his usual gargoyle's perch. He's scanning the streets and the rooftops, waiting tor the CATWOMAN to make her move -- whatever it is. He glances at the building directly across the square from him. On the roof is a neon sign reading Gotham City Globe in ornate old-English letters -- and above that, a ROTATING METAL SCULPTURE of the world turning. His eyes rove downward along the facade of the building... EXT. GOTHAM GLOBE - THAT MOMENT At street level, an ARMORED CAR has pulled up in front of the Globe offices. THREE SECURITY GUARDS with rifles climb out of the ARMORED CAR, followed by a FOURTH -- who has an OBLONG BOX handcuffed to his wrist. Of course, we can't see what's inside, but to those of us in the know the box looks just about the right size for a RAVEN STATUETTE. The GUARDS scan the street and enter the building without incident. As they do, a NEWSPAPER DELIVERY VAN crosses the frame; mounted on its side is an ADVERTISING PLACARD which reads: BATMAN: HERO OR MENACE? Read All About It in the GOTHAM GLOBE! EXT. ROOFTOP - ON BATMAN He watches with some curiosity. An armored car: is this some part of the CATWOMAN's scheme? But no...the GUARDS are safely inside the building, and the CAR is leaving. He settles back to wait. INT. NEWSPAPER DELIVERY VAN - THAT MOMENT The innocuous-looking VAN rounds the corner of the Globe building. FRICK is at the wheel, FRACK is riding shotgun, and the PENGUIN is between them, peering out eagerly through the windshield. They turn into the Globe's BASEMENT GARAGE -- where dozens of similar vans are parked at the LOADING BAYS. Just part of the fleet... INT. PROVOST'S OFFICE - A MOMENT LATER The quartet of SECURITY GUARDS arrive at PROVOST's office. The publisher has already packed his suitcases for a speedy getaway. The LEAD GUARD -- the one cuffed to the RAVEN BOX -- sets his precious cargo on a desk and stands discreetly at arm's length while PROVOST unlocks it and checks its contents. Satisfied, he slams it shut. He reaches into his top drawer for an ENVELOPE, which he hands to his PERSONAL SECRETARY. PROVOST Open this in an hour. Phone my wife and tell her where to meet me. (to the GUARDS; edgily) No trouble on the way, I take it? LEAD GUARD No sir, Mr. Provost. We came straight from the bank vault. GUARD II 'Copter should be just touching down. We'll have you safely out of here in no time. EXT. ROOFTOP - ON BATMAN "Here Comes Santa Claus" echoes up from the streets. BATMAN watches as a COPTER descends toward the HELIPAD on the roof of the Globe... INT. CORRIDOR OUTSIDE OFFICE - A MOMENT LATER PROVOST and the LEAD GUARD with the raven box are at an elevator bank. The other GUARDS head for a stairwell. GUARD II We'll check the stairs. See you on the roof. The LEAD GUARD starts to press the UP button, but PROVOST pulls a key from his pocket instead: PROVOST No -- my private elevator. It's safer. INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT - THAT MOMENT shooting DOWN on the car as it rises. The shaft above it is filled with BIRDS -- starlings, crows, pigeons and the like, swooping and gliding among the gears and cables... EXT. ROOF OF GLOBE BUILDING - THAT MOMENT In BG, the helicopter on its pad, idling noisily, the rotors still spinning. In FG, the small dormer-like structure that houses the STAIRWAY. The metal access door opens, and the first of the GUARDS steps warily out, rifle at the ready. He smiles back at his pal. GUARD No way. They don't pay us enough to tangle with Batm-- A black-gloved, CHROME-TALONED HAND snakes around the edge of the dormer and RAKES ACROSS HIS THROAT... INT. ELEVATOR CAR - THAT MOMENT SWEAT beads up on PROVOST's lip as the GUARD hits the up button and the car begins to rise. Suddenly, the LIGHTS GO OUT. The car stops with a lurch. PROVOST What is it?? What's happening?? Suddenly, there in the darkness, they hear a series of loud POPPING SOUNDS...which could be gunfire... EXT. GOTHAM SQUARE - THAT MOMENT - ON CROWD singing "Here Comes Santa Claus" at the top of their lungs. Happy faces beam. No one hears anything unusual over the music... EXT. ROOFTOP - ACROSS STREET - ON BATMAN BATMAN straining to listen. We get another faint series of POPS -- barely audible over the CAROLING from below, and the loud PUTT-PUTT-PUTT of the helicopter blades. He can't really be sure he's heard anything at all. He scans the roof of the Globe building, but he can't see what's happening beyond the big steel globe sculpture and the neon sign... EXT. GLOBE BUILDING - ROOFTOP - THAT MOMENT The CATWOMAN lets fly with another burst of automatic fire from the dead GUARD's rifle. The helicopter is still idling, but no one's left to fly it -- the rooftop is littered with stiffs... INT. ELEVATOR CAR - THAT MOMENT PITCH BLACK. Pre-verbal GROANS and MURMURINGS OF FEAR issue from the darkness. An EERIE RED LIGHT kicks on -- the emergency generators -- and we see PROVOST backed up in a corner of the car, twitching and jumping like a crazed spastic. The GUARD, in a futile effort to placate him, points up at the LIGHT: GUARD There. Mr. Provost. See? The generator's kicked in. It's just an electrical problem. PROVOST is only marginally consoled. They hear a strange TWITTERING NOISE in the shaft above them... PROVOST starts babbling again. The GUARD slaps him across the face. But the TWITTERING has him a bit concerned as well. He stares up at the ceiling of the car as he PUNCHES BUTTONS on the panel; with another LURCH, the car begins to move. GUARD There. See? It's moving. We're fine. PROVOST It's going down. We're going DOWN!!! INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT - THAT MOMENT The BIRDS in the shaft have all ROOSTED on the TOP OF THE CAR. They're patiently riding it down as it descends... INT. ELEVATOR CAR - THAT MOMENT The car stops again. PROVOST is totally losing it. The exasperated GUARD grabs him and SHAKES HIM. GUARD Okay, Mr. Provost -- I'm gonna have a look through the trap door. But I need you to help me. Okay? You have to help. PROVOST nods and tries to get a grip on himself. The GUARD looks up at the trap door in the ceiling of the car. He can't reach it... He uncuffs the BOX containing PROVOST'S RAVEN from his wrist -- and STANDS on it. Still short. Unholstering his gun and using it as a prod, he can almost reach the trap door. He JUMPS UP and, poking with the gun, manages to dislodge the panel slightly. More TWITTERING. PROVOST and the guard look up through the tiny crack in the ceiling and see nothing but darkness. GUARD Probably just some bird that's gotten in the shaft. Now calm down. You'll have to give me a boost. The GUARD climbs back atop the raven box. PROVOST gives him a boost and he manages to catch hold of the lip of the trap door. GUARD (cont.) Okay, help me out...steady... PROVOST wraps both arms around the GUARD's wriggling LEGS and tries to hoist him upward. INT. SHAFT - ON ROOF OF CAR - THAT MOMENT From a vantage level with the roof of the car, we see the GUARD'S FINGERS, clinging to the lip of the trap door. Now his HEAD rises into view, pushing the panel aside as he pulls himself upward. He peers around. His BROW wrinkles as he sees a bizarre sight -- PASSELS of SQUAWKING BIRDS, walking back and forth in front of him, STRUTTING and PREENING mere inches from his face... INT. ELEVATOR CAR - THAT MOMENT The bottom half of the GUARD dangles from the ceiling. PROVOST still has his arms wrapped around the GUARD's knees. All at once, the GUARD begins to SCREAM -- his body JERKS and his legs KICK WILDLY. Still PROVOST struggles to hang on -- even as BLOOD spatters across the top of his bald dome... Finally, the GUARD's violent spasms are too much. PROVOST trips over the raven box, stumbles backward and lands on his ass in a corner of the car. The GUARD tumbles in a heap to the elevator floor, his face PECKED and CLAWED beyond recognition, his eyes gone altogether. PROVOST lets out a series of SHRIEKS. He peers at the open trap door, sees the BIRDS staring curiously down at him, and SHRIEKS AGAIN. The EMERGENCY TELEPHONE rings. He stares at it. It rings again. Shielding his eyes and screwing up his courage, PROVOST crawls across the floor and reaches for the receiver. PENGUIN (V.O.; filter) Sixteenth floor. Linens, housewares, ladies' lingerie! PROVOST W-who is this?? INT. GLOBE - BASEMENT LOADING BAY - THAT MOMENT NEWSPAPER DELIVERY VANS are parked in neat rows -- all driverless. FRICK is sitting with a boxful of electrical equipment next to a bank of ELEVATORS; all the cars have been LOCKED OPEN here in the basement, except for ONE -- PROVOST's private elevator, the doors to which are still closed. The PENGUIN stands beside it, speaking into a RED PHONE. PENGUIN Mr. Provost? If you want to get out of that car alive, I suggest you follow my instructions to the letter. As he talks, we see various NEWSPAPER EMPLOYEES sprawled on the concrete nearby, DEAD. A CORRUGATED METAL DOOR has been lowered over the LOADING BAY, separating the newspaper production staff from the VAN POOL. They're trapped on the other side. BANGING AWAY LOUDLY on the door... PENGUIN (cont.) SHUT UP IN THERE. (calmly; into phone) You should see a cord hanging just behind you. INT. ELEVATOR CAR - THAT MOMENT PROVOST looks over his shoulder and sees the aforementioned CORD descending through the trap door. PROVOST Yes -- yes, I see it -- PENGUIN (V.O; filter) Tie the cord to the handle of your box. PROVOST lets the phone drop. He grits his teeth, but hastens to obey. As he's knotting the cord around the handle of the box, a DINKY BIRD flutters down through the trap and sends him into a panic. Practically weeping, he reaches for the phone. PENGUIN (V.O.; filter) When you're done, I want you to give two sharp yanks on the cord. Cowering in terror, PROVOST reaches for the cord and yanks it twice. PROVOST Who are you?? Why are you doing this?? INT. LOADING BAY - ON PENGUIN Behind him, FRICK and FRACK are pulling on RED BERETS and BATMAN SWEATSHIRTS -- Order of the Bat gear. FRICK climbs into a NEWSPAPER DELIVERY VAN and starts the engine. PENGUIN Well, Mr. Provost, I guess you could call me an irate reader. And to be perfectly frank -- I'm doing this because I hate Garfield. Chuckling, the PENGUIN holds a SONIC DEVICE up to the mouthpiece of the phone. INT. ELEVATOR CAR - THAT MOMENT A SHRILL WHINE emanates from the receiver. All at once, the elevator car is FULL OF BIRDS -- squawking wildly, flinging themselves against the wall, going insane in the tiny confined space. PROVOST is screaming like a madman. The birds are in his hair, his face -- everywhere. He fights his way over to the panel and begins punching buttons in a frenzy... All at once the car PLUNGES DOWNWARD. It's as if the floor has DROPS AWAY beneath PROVOST's feet -- he's in FREE-FALL. INT. LOADING BAY - ON PENGUIN PENGUIN Going down! He hangs up the phone and steps a discreet distance back from the ELEVATOR DOORS. INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT - THAT MOMENT The RAVEN BOX dangles from its cord in FG as the CAR rockets uncontrollably downward. A steady stream ot BIRDS are making a quick exit from the trap door in the roof... INT. TOP-FLOOR LANDING - THAT MOMENT The CATWOMAN's on a landing near the stairwell, just below the dormer that leads to the roof. She pries open a pair of ELEVATOR DOORS... ...and a FLOCK of BIRDS pours out of the empty shaft, making for the open ACCESS DOOR a half-story above. She reaches inside, finds the cord attached to the RAVEN BOX, and reels it in. She rips off the lock and opens the box for a quick look at her trophy. It's there, all right -- another RAVEN just like the first two. An awful CRASH, from twenty-five stories down, RATTLES THE SHAFT... She makes a disgusted face, grabs the RAVEN, and bolts for the roof. EXT. ROOFTOP ACROSS STREET - ON BATMAN He watches in puzzlement as a VAST FLOCK OF BIRDS takes flight from the Globe roof across the square. Something weird is definitely going on. He's about to abandon his post -- -- but down below, the CAROLERS have stopped CAROLING. The big tree's about to be lit, and they're counting off the seconds: CROWD Ten! Nine!... EXT. GOTHAM SQUARE - CORNER NEWSTAND A ramshackle kiosk at street level. The NEWS VENDOR has stepped out onto the sidewalk to watch the tree festivities. A GLOBE DELIVERY VAN, its side bearing the "BATMAN -- HERO OR MENACE?" advertisement, cruises past and dumps a bundle of papers on the curb. EXT. GOTHAM SQUARE - ON CROWD AT TREE EXCITEMENT is BUILDING as the seconds tick off: CROWD ...Three! Two! One! The CHRISTMAS LIGHTS come on, and the CROWD breaks into CHEERS. The ORCHESTRA strikes up a sprightly version of "JINGLE BELLS." EXT. GOTHAM SQUARE - ON NEWSTAND The NEWS VENDOR is applauding and singing along like everyone else when a second newspaper van rumbles past... NEWS VENDOR Hey! No! I aleady got a -- He spots TWO MASKED MEN in the doorway of the van -- wearing RED BERETS and BAT-SHIRTS. They shove a BODY out the door -- The mutilated corpse of HARRISON PROVOST lands on the sidewalk with a THUD -- right beside a bundle of NEWSPAPERS which read "BATMAN MURDER SPREE BAFFLES POLICE." EXT. GOTHAM SQUARE - ON VAN - MOVING The NEWS VENDOR chases after the VAN, but it's already rounded a corner and is cruising along the periphery of Gotham Square. The CROWD is still singing merrily, unaware of its presence -- -- until the BACK DOORS fly open -- and a swarm of RABID, CHITTERING BATS screech out into the midst of the crowd!! EXT. GOTHAM SQUARE - ON CROWD AT TREE The CAROLERS break into MASS HYSTERIA as HIDEOUS BATS swoop down from above, CLAWING at their heads and shoulders. ORCHESTRA MEMBERS drop their instruments and stagger off the BAND PLATFORM, falling into the branches of the giant Christmas tree. EXT. GOTHAM SQUARE - ON SIDEWALKS CHRISTMAS SHOPPERS are teeming in and out of nearby STORES. They drop their SHOPPING BAGS and race about in utter CHAOS as the bats attack. WOMEN SCREAM. CHILDREN SCREAM. MEN SCREAM TOO. A MAN staggers backward through a GLASS STOREFRONT and lands on his butt in a WINDOW DISPLAY -- a big mechanical SANTA CLAUS on his North-Pole throne, chuckling merrily in a prerecorded voice: "HO HO HO." The MAN STRUGGLES WILDLY as the BATS converge on him. INT. DEPARTMENT STORE - THAT MOMENT HORRIFIED SHOPPERS scatter through the aisles as the BATS pour in through the broken window. WOMEN lined up for a FREE MAKEOVER squeal in panic as BATS arrive to rearrange their hairdos. EXT. ROOFTOP - ON BATMAN He stares down stunned at the PANDEMONIUM raging below. He glances across the street...and sees the TINY SILHOUETTE of a WOMAN standing atop the cast-iron GLOBE SCULPTURE, LAUGHING at the chaos, TAUNTING him. EXT. STREETS - OVERHEAD ANGLE - THAT MOMENT A few blocks away from Gotham Square. SIRENS HOWL. There's a steady stream of COP CARS speeding toward the site of the disturbance. One vehicle is moving in the opposite direction, against traffic -- a NEWSPAPER DELIVERY VAN. EXT. GLOBE BUILDING - ROOFTOP - A MOMENT LATER BATMAN touches down on the roof and stares in horror at the CORPSES strewn across the helipad. A dying GUARD raises a shaky hand... BATMAN crouches beside him. A GURGLE comes up from his throat and a bubble of BLOOD swells on his lips. All at once he hears a WOMAN'S VOICE from the shadows of the GLOBE SCULPTURE... CATWOMAN (O.S.) Some people just can't take discipline. (beat) Go ahead. Finish 'em off... His head jerks up. He can't see anything. A sudden WHOOSHING noise, and now the voice is coming from the other side of the roof. CATWOMAN (O.S.) You might as well. You're going to get blamed for it anyway. He stands. He gets a quick glimpse of a FELINE SHADOW springing past a skylight; she's jumping all around the roof, clinging to exposed pipes and fixtures. He reaches for a Batarang. CATWOMAN (O.S.) Oh, come on, angel. You know you want to. (purring loudly) Besides -- I want to see how you do it! BATMAN Who are you? He's barely gotten it out when she SLAMS INTO HIM from behind, feet first, knocking him to the rooftop. He tries to get up, but she comes at him with a couple of CARTWHEELING KICKS, knocking him back into a cornice. He ducks right just as a SHARP SPIKED HEEL strikes the exposed brick a mere three inches from his throat. He catches her leg, upends her -- but she somersaults away and lands on her feet. Cats always do... CATWOMAN My, aren't we frisky tonight. He flings the BATARANG. It CLANGS into the big NEON SIGN as she SPRINGS up into the darkness, out of reach. GLASS TUBING shatters and SPARKS FLY as she calls down from the shadows -- CATWOMAN I should tell you -- I've got nine lives to play with -- and you've only got one... He turns -- she drops DIRECTLY ONTO HIM -- and locked in a death grip, they STAGGER BACKWARDS across the roof, directly toward the HELICOPTER. The huge ROTOR BLADES are still turning... BATMAN ducks instinctively and the CATWOMAN breaks free -- FALLING BACKWARD onto the roof. It's a strategic move: when he rushes at her, she BRACES HERSELF against the ground and KICKS UPWARD with startling force. This time the spiked heel connects -- LIFTING BATMAN off his feet, KNOCKING HIM BACKWARD into the TAIL of the HELICOPTER. He slumps there, stunned -- and before he knows it, she's on him. She grabs his THROAT with one hand and clamps the other around his CROTCH. He tries to break her grip, but she's just as strong as he is. And she's LIFTING him -- forcing him upward, toward the REAR STABILIZING ROTOR on the tail of the helicopter! The rear ROTOR BLADES WHINE LIKE A BUZZSAW as his head rises perilously closer. At the last possible instant, he grabs a handful of her HAIR -- YANKS IT as hard as he can -- With a YOWL, she releases him. They tumble to the roof and she DIVES ATOP HIM. Her TALONS click into place -- he sees them poised directly above his EYES -- -- but manages to slam an ELBOW under her chin before she can strike. Now they're disentangled; they get up groggily and circle each other... SOMEONE IS BANGING on the metal door that leads up to the roof, trying to break it down. BATMAN turns for an instant -- a sudden CRACK -- -- and he finds himself all wrapped up in the CATWOMAN's CAT- O'-NINE-TAILS...which is also outfitted with a TASER. She sends a PARALYZING ELECTRIC CHARGE through his body and he collapses to the roof in a jittering heap. The BANGING on the door is louder... CATWOMAN Did I tell you I invited company? -- Keep 'em busy, angel, I've gotta scat. She kneels down and plants a BIG WET KISS on his twitching face. Then she scurries to the edge of the roof, DISAPPEARING -- -- just as the DOOR gives way -- and an ARMED SWAT TEAM comes crashing out onto the roof! Just coming around, BATMAN tries to roll out of sight -- but the COPS are swarming the place. They spot the BODIES on the tar and gravel, see BATMAN scuttling for cover, and draw the obvious conclusion. Pulling guns, they OPEN FIRE. BULLETS RICOCHET off the big metal GLOBE. BATMAN, as is customary in these situations, shoots a GRAPPLING HOOK at the roof of the next building over -- which is a couple of stories taller than the Globe -- and REELS HIMSELF UPWARD along the side wall. The SWAT COPS score a couple of dead hits which set him swinging like a pendulum, but his body armor holds and he clings to the line long enough to reach the roof. CUT TO: INT. NEWSPAPER VAN - MOVING - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT FRlCK and FRACK, still in their Order-of-the-Bat garb, are in the front seats; the PENGUIN is leaning out the side door. Someone's obviously tipped the COPS about the source of all the ruckus -- -- because a pair of POLICE CARS are on their tail and gaining fast. Still hanging in the doorway, the PENGUIN raises his UMBRELLA, peers down its length like a RIFLE SIGHT, and PULLS A TRIGGER. ANGLE ON SQUAD CAR - MOVING - THAT MOMENT A SONIC DART -- one of the PENGUIN'S BIRD MAGNETS -- lodges itself in the GRILLE of the foremost POLICE CAR. INT. SQUAD CAR - MOVING - THAT MOMENT The COPS in the car react in astonishment as PIGEONS begin HURLING THEMSELVES at the WINDSHIELDS. A DOZEN KAMIKAZE BIRDS bounce off in rapid succession. CRACKS begin to spread across the glass. The COPS can't see where they're driving. The car SWERVES WILDLY. And still the PIGEONS KEEP COMING -- COVERING THE WINDSHIELD -- TOTALLY OBSCURING THE STREETS FROM VIEW... EXT. STREETS - ON SQUAD CARS - THAT MOMENT The first car, COMPLETELY COVERED WITH BIRDS, smacks into a LAMPPOST and SKIDS. The second car CRASHES INTO IT. And the pigeons continue to pour down from the heavens, SWARMING onto the immobilized squad cars. INT. NEWSPAPER VAN - MOVING - THAT MOMENT The PENGUIN grins with delight as the van speeds off unmolested. PENGUIN Look at that, boys -- they do flock together!! CUT TO: EXT. GOTHAM SQUARE - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT AMBULANCES are pouring into the square as the BAT ATTACK continues. COPS are firing their guns blindly into the skies as they try to evacuate the citizenry. PARAMEDICS drop the stretcher they're carrying when BATS swoop down at their heads... EXT. ROOFTOPS - NIGHT BATMAN is still pursuing the CATWOMAN, who's perched one roof over, in a squat, wiggling a finger for him to follow. The roofs are icy and treacherous, but he matches her step for step, leap for leap, as she vaults from one building to the next, leading him on. Finally she reaches the edge of a building on the corner of the block; there's no place to go but down. She squats on the ledge and smiles, beckoning to him -- CATWOMAN Ooh. Where have you been all my life? He edges closer. Suddenly, she does a BACKFLIP -- DIRECTLY OFF THE EDGE OF THE ROOF. BATMAN hears GLASS SHATTERING. He hesitates a second -- moves closer to the edge of the roof -- PEERS OVER THE ICY CORNICE. BATMAN'S POV - THAT MOMENT Staring down, he sees a narrow LEDGE running around the facade of the building some ten or twelve feet below. The window of a corner apartment has been smashed; the curtains are flapping in the chill wind. EXT. ROOF - ON BATMAN - A MOMENT LATER - NIGHT She's obviously making her getaway through the apartment. BATMAN climbs up on the slippery cornice and prepares to drop to the ledge below -- cautiously, because it's a long way down. A sudden CRACK -- The CATWOMAN hasn't entered the apartment. Instead, she's followed the ledge around the corner of the building, silently doubling back onto the roof behind BATMAN. He TURNS just as her WHIP wraps itself around his left leg. She gives it a sharp tug -- his feet SKID on the ice -- and HE TOPPLES OVER THE EDGE OF THE ROOF. EXT. FACADE OF BUILDING - ON BATMAN He plunges downward for the briefest of seconds -- then JERKS UP SHORT, SLAMMING INTO THE WALL OF THE BUILDING. The WHIP has coiled itself around his leg, and for now it's holding tight. He's dangling upside down, bat-like; he bounces away from the wall; he SPINS in midair as one loop of the whip UNRAVELS, dropping him another foot or so. He manages to brace his left foot against the wall. It's a massive strain, but he's momentarily safe if he can keep from moving. The alternative is a twelve-story drop, straight down to the pavement... EXT. ROOF - ON CATWOMAN - THAT MOMENT She's wrapped the handle-end of the whip around an exposed pipe on the roof, anchoring BATMAN in place. With a cheshire- cat grin, she removes the RAVEN from her knapsack and holds it on the edge of the cornice. EXT. FACADE - THAT MOMENT BATMAN hanging immobile. Craning his neck, he can just see the RAVEN STATUETTE on the ledge above him -- bouncing slightly, and apparently talking to him... CATWOMAN (O.S.) Nevermore. Nevermore! Now the CATWOMAN appears beside it -- elbows on the cornice, chin propped up on her folded hands, like a chatty girl at a fern bar. CATWOMAN Cute, huh! I think it'll look nice over the fireplace. Maybe you can drop by and see it sometime. (demurely) I hope you won't think I'm too... aggressive or anything, but I find you very attractive. She toys aimlessly with the whipcord, batting at it like a cat with a piece of yarn. BATMAN grimaces. She speaks in a low, soothing, seductive tone -- almost a purr. Behind the bondage mask she bats her eyelashes. CATWOMAN (cont.) It's just so hard to meet interesting men these days. Don't you think so? (sighing) I have trouble with relationships. Men find me intimidating...kind of predatory, you know? Really I'm not. Really I'm just playful... BATMAN huffs and puffs, trying to bend at the waist so he can grab hold of the whip. She frowns and YANKS on it. His foot flies free of the wall, and another loop of the whip uncoils before he can stabilize himself. CATWOMAN (cont.) Don't laugh! I'm trying to open up to you! Angrily, she holds a STEEL CLAW to the whip -- ready to cut him loose. ANGLE ON BATMAN He's palmed the GRAPPLING-HOOK LAUNCHER from his belt. Holding it close to his body, out of view, he works it around into firing position. He'll shoot it right through her if he has to... CATWOMAN (cont.) I always seem to fall for the wrong guys. You know...most men are rats. ANGLE ON CATWOMAN She withdraws her hand from the whip, reverts to her philosphical mode. CATWOMAN Mice, really. It's disgusting -- they beg you to walk all over them and then they whine when you do it. Once you've had your fun there's not much you can do but kill them. (beat) But you seem different. I mean, you obviously understand about dressing up... that saves a lot of explaining. I think people should indulge their fantasies, don't you? BATMAN is sweating profusely. He can't hold his position much longer. And the CATWOMAN is dragging this insane flirtation out endlessly... CATWOMAN So I think I'll let you live. Cute boys like you are hard to find... (standing up) 'Bye, angel. I'll be thinking about you. And just like that, she VANISHES -- moving silently off with her raven, leaving BATMAN to dangle. He hangs there a moment, tries to twist himself around without moving his foot. He braces one hand against the wall; with the other, he lifts his grappling gun and FIRES. The HOOK SNAGS somewhere on the roof. BATMAN yanks the line taut and is laboriously trying to pull himself erect when -- -- the CATWOMAN reappears over the edge of the cornice! CATWOMAN Gee...I'm so fickle. A QUICK SWIPE of her STEEL TALONS, and the whipcord is neatly SEVERED. BATMAN'S FOOT slips out from under him -- but he's still got hold of the GRAPPLING GUN. He DROPS eight or ten feet... EXT. ROOF - ON CATWOMAN watching with amusement as BATMAN's weight causes the hook to DISLODGE. It skitters across the gravel surface of the roof and CATCHES, at the last instant, on the edge of the CORNICE -- -- which promptly CRUMBLES and GIVES WAY. Fascinated, the CATWOMAN leans over the edge of the roof and peers down... ANGLE ON BATMAN - AS HE FALLS He flails wildly, tangled in his cape, as the ground rushes up toward him. He gets a last-ditch inspiration -- finds the GAS CYLINDER on his belt and hits the switch. The rods in his cape begin to INFLATE... Six stories up, his BATWINGS spring erect, slowing his plunge. Five stories up, an UPDRAFT hits him and he suddenly INVERTS. Four stories up, he rights himself. Three stories up, he goes into a downward spiral, out of control, gliding in great wide arcs over the street... ...and a moment later there are no stories left. With an ugly crunch, he smacks into the slush-covered pavement and BOUNCES. Face down, he skids some twenty feet to a halt -- right in the middle of a BUSY INTERSECTION. EXT. INTERSECTION - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT A DELIVERY TRUCK hits the brakes and screeches to a stop, two feet away from BATMAN'S HEAD. He doesn't move. PEDESTRIANS are already gawking and pointing as the DRIVER climbs out and peers down at the inert caped figure lying face-down in the street: DRIVER What the hell is this? CARS are backed up, due to the panic in Gotham Square a few blocks over. HORNS are honking. A TRAFFIC COP marches over -- TRAFFIC COP Awright, what's the problem here? (spotting BATMAN) Jesus. He tries to clear the crowd away. A full-fledged GRIDLOCK is forming around the prostrate BATMAN. The COP blows his whistle, tries to maintain order as two unifonned PATROLMEN rush up to join him. They manage to roll the unconscious BATMAN over on his back. The assembled COPS stare down at the mask, the scuffed body armor. Still waxy, they finger the GUNS in their holsters... PATROLMAN Good God. Cowan -- get to the car -- radio the commissioner!! By now there must be two hundred people in the intersection, all surging forward to get a look. More COPS are arriving to beat them back. TRAFFIC COP Is he dead? What do we do? PATROLMAN The mask. Get the mask off. They hunker down over BATMAN. One of them tugs at his mask -- but the helmet-like cowl doesn't want to give way. He feels around -- TRAFFIC COP Some kinda seam here on the neck... The PATROLMAN nods okay, and the COP tugs at a Velcro-like fastening under BATMAN's chin. The instant it comes open -- -- a BURST of FINE GREEN MIST spews forth from concealed JETS in the gold-and-black BAT-EMBLEM, and the COPS reel backward, shrieking, gasping for breath and clewing at their eyes. Booby-trap -- they've just been Maced. One of the ONLOOKING COPS steps back in horror and confusion. On impulse, he draws his gun and FIRES TWICE at BATMAN. The body JERKS and the bullets RICOCHET OFF -- TRAFFIC COP DON'T SHOOT, you idiot. The crowd -- Before he can finish, a BLACK BOOT kicks the gun out of the ONLOOKING COP's hand. BATMAN is back among the living. SIRENS BLARE as he spins and rolls into a crouch -- lashing out with elbows and knees -- driving the cops back -- Fuck the crowd. TWO MORE COPS pull their guns and open fire in absolute panic. BATMAN slams backward into the delivery truck and crumples to the ground. As he falls, he grabs a couple of SMOKE CAPSULES from his belt and flings them to the pavement. Seconds later, a THICK CLOUD OF BLACK SMOKE is spreading through the intersection. BATMAN emerges into the midst of the crowd -- weaving in and out among the stalled vehicles -- EXT. INTERSECTION - ANOTHER ANGLE - NIGHT A MOUNTED COP rides up to the outer fringe of the traffic jam, drawn by all the confusion. He rears the horse back, turns it in a circle; blows his piercing whistle as he tries to reroute the incoming cars... Suddenly a WIRE wraps itself around his chest and arms. He looks down. He sees a BATARANG in the instant before a sudden JERK pulls him cleanly off his mount. BATMAN climbs up on the hood of the nearest car -- vaults over to the next -- and the next -- then hops into the saddle of the MOUNTED COP's waiting HORSE. He digs in his heels, maneuvering through traffic... EXT. POLICE CAR - A MOMENT LATER - NIGHT LT. EDDIE BULLOCK and another plainclothesman are a few blocks off trying to get through the jam. Their siren is on, but the cars blocking their path have no room to pull over. BULLOCK grabs the radio mike: BULLOCK Hell of a mess up here, Commissioner. We'll have to go in on foot... As they wait for a response, they see a HORSE charging past in the opposite direction. On the back of the horse...is BATMAN. Gaping, BULLOCK nudges his partner -- who throws the car immediately into REVERSE. As they watch, BATMAN kicks the horse's flanks and turns right -- toward Gotham Park. INT. GOTHAM PARK - A MOMENT LATER - NIGHT Two RED BERETS, members of the Order of the Bat, are on night patrol, strolling down a rambling path near the entrance to the park. RED BERET I This is wack, man. Nothing ever happens around here anymore. The other RED BERET lets out a WHOOP OF FEAR and yanks his partner out of the way. They tumble into a snowdrift as BATMAN'S HORSE vaults over the stone wall of the park and gallops past, nearly trampling them in the process. By now, SQUAD CARS are roaring into the park... INT. PARK - ANOTHER SECTION - A MOMENT LATER SIRENS BLARE and RED LIGHTS FLASH in the distance as the COP CARS spread out along the winding roads that run through the park. BATMAN reins the horse in suddenly as a black-and-white whips past on an access road just ahead of him, no more than twenty yards away. He turns the horse in a circle. MORE RED LIGHTS appear in the distance; another contingent of SQUAD CARS has just entered from the opposite side of the park. It's going to be tough getting out of here... Then: his eyes fall on the statue of his great-grandfather, GENERAL WAYNE -- two Waynes on horseback, not twenty feet apart. He thinks back to his earlier conversation with VICKI and gets an inspiration. He rides past General Wayne to the STONE BRIDGE which spans the little frozen creek. There he finds the DRAINAGE TUNNEL VICKI described, obscured by the wire-mesh grate. This must be where the boy vigilante holes up... He dismounts, ties his CAPE to the pommel of the horse's saddle and sends it off with a slap. He pries the grate loose and crawls inside. INT. DRAINAGE TUNNEL - THAT MOMENT A dank, but cozy, hideout; WARM STEAM hisses from a grate in the floor. RUMBLING SOUNDS fill the little chamber as a SUBWAY TRAIN passes directly underneath. A little farther back there's an ACCESS SHAFT, with a Jacob's ladder, leading to the train tracks below. Poking around, he finds a couple of cardboard BOXES -- the boy vigilante's stash. The first contains tins of food, plus various odds and ends. The second's more in line with what he needs -- it's full of OLD CLOTHING. A TRAIN rumbles past underneath. BRUCE removes his COWL and sets about putting together a civilian disguise that'll get him out of the park. A wool hat and a long, moth-eaten topcoat: perfect. As he's pulling them out of the box, he spies something extremely odd -- It's a COSTUME -- a spangled red-and-green GYMNASTS OUTFIT with a little yellow CAPE -- neatly folded and in pristine condition. He removes it carefully from the box and holds it up in front of him. Stitched on the vest is a single initial, "R," in a black circle. He stares at the whole mystifying ensemble in complete befuddlement... The roar of the train subsides, and he hears a SCUFFLING NOISE. Someone's in the tunnel with him. He lowers the costume abruptly -- -- revealing DICK, the boy vigilante, who's crouched in front of him not three feet away. The kid's just crawled up through the ACCESS SHAFT, and he's not at all happy to see an intruder messing with his stuff: DICK It's MINE! He lunges furiously at BRUCE. The two of them tumble back into the grate at the tunnel entrance, KNOCKING IT LOOSE -- EXT. PARK - MOUTH OF TUNNEL - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT A POLICE CAR streaks past on the bridge overhead mere seconds before BRUCE and DICK roll out into the snow, still grappling. BRUCE flings the kid into the bridge abutment. DICK lands hard; when he looks up, his EYES WIDEN, and a weird crooked smile comes to his face... Out here in the moonlight he can see his opponent. The body armor -- the gold-and-black emblem on the breastplate -- and above it all, the face of BRUCE WAYNE, exposed to view... As a siren howls nearby, BRUCE flattens himself against the bridge. Like it or not, his fate rests entirely in a strange little boy's hands. The kid sizes up the situation immediately. He nods his head up and down. Then he takes off his own ratty coat and throws it to BRUCE. BRUCE is in no position to look a gift horse in the mouth. He pulls on the coat, gives DICK a nod of acknowledgement, and starts to move off. DICK NO. WAIT! BRUCE turns, uncertainly. DICK throws him his woolen SKI CAP. The KID GIGGLES -- oddly, uncontrollably. Then he sprints off into the woods, dancing, leaping. As he disappears from view, he lets out a shrill, piercing, almost FERAL SHRIEK -- -- which is obviously intended to divert the cops. BRUCE makes haste in the opposite direction. EXT. PARK - ANOTHER SECTION - A MOMENT LATER BRUCE'S HORSE gallops through the trees, the black bat-cape still attached to its saddle and BILLOWING behind it. INT. SQUAD CAR - MOVING - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT TWO COPS scanning the park. The CAPED HORSE charges past in front of them and is momentarily silhouetted in the headlights. From a distance, it looks like BATMAN is still in the saddle. The COP at the wheel makes a sudden turn. A moment later, he SLAMS ON THE BRAKES. A MAN has just stepped out onto the road, directly in the squad car's path -- a hunched figure in an old coat and woolen ski cap, obviously one of the homeless. A COP leans on the horn and shouts out the window: COP Dumb son of a bitch!! The MAN -- BRUCE -- steps back out of the squad car's path. The COPS take off -- in hot pursuit of a riderless horse. CUT TO: INT. WAYNE MANOR - KITCHEN - PRE-DAWN A DOCTOR'S BAG rests on the kitchen table. ALFRED, in robe and slippers, rummages inside it and comes up with an ACE BANDAGE. ALFRED Commissioner Gordon called. He wants to install a full contingent of police guards here at the manor -- in round-the-clock shifts -- to protect you from Batman. BRUCE is sitting erect in a straightbacked chair. His shirt is open and he's holding his arms aloft while ALFRED wraps a full roll of adhesive tape around his battered RIBS. BRUCE Great. What'd you tell him? ALFRED I told him that since you were Batman, you'd require no protection from Batman. BRUCE makes a face: how droll. ALFRED tears off the tape with a brisk YANK -- and BRUCE lets out an involuntary YELP OF PAIN. BRUCE Jesus, Alfred -- !! ALFRED In future, sir...I strongly advise against trying to fly off twenty-story buildings. BRUCE It's just a few bruises. ALFRED One bruise, sir. Which covers your entire body. BRUCE gets up -- stiffly -- and buttons his shirt in gingerly fashion while ALFRED packs his first-aid gear in the doctor's bag. BRUCE I'm getting too old for this line of work. (beat) Cops placed me at the scene of the crime -- that weird kid of Vicki's saw my face -- ALFRED I shouldn't worry overmuch. I doubt the two of you move in the same circles. BRUCE -- and I got the living shit knocked out of me by a woman. ALFRED Sir -- such outmoded sexist attitudes are quite unbecoming. INT. UPSTAIRS BEDROOM - DAY In a lavishly-appointed guest room on Gotham's Upper East Side (or equivalent thereof), we find a pair of PLAINCLOTHES COPS settled in for a stakeout: rumpled topcoats thrown across antique chairs, french-fry bags and GREASY BURGER WRAPPINGS littering the carpet. HIGH-POWERED RIFLES propped against one wall. They peer through venetian blinds at an ELEGANT OLD BROWNSTONE across the street... HIS POV - ROOF OF BROWNSTONE - THAT MOMENT A UNIFORMED COP, also carrying a walkie-talkie, is keeping watch on the roof of the brownstone. He signals "all clear" to his counterpart watching from the house opposite. INT. UNMARKED CAR - THAT MOMENT TWO MORE PLAINCLOTHESMEN are parked at the end of the block, munching on donuts and watching the same brownstone. They spot a POSTMAN lugging his sack up the tree-lined street on his way to the brownstone. One of the PLAINCLOTHESMEN picks up his RADIO MIKE: PLAINCLOTHESMAN Mailman's coming. EXT. BROWNSTONE - A MINUTE LATER The POSTMAN marches up the front steps of the brownstone, sorting through letters and packages. He hasn't even rung the bell when the door is opened by ANOTHER COP -- who snatches the mail delivery from his hands and SLAMS THE DOOR IN HIS FACE. INT. BROWNSTONE - THAT MOMENT MORE COPS, at least half a dozen, are milling about inside -- unshaven, ties loosened, shirtsleeves rolled up. They're in for the long haul. The first COP gives a handful of letters to a couple of COLLEAGUES -- then hands over a PARCEL, wrapped in brown paper, to a pair of BOMB-DISPOSAL EXPERTS. They carry it gingerly into the kitchen. Into the midst of all this bustling activity strides COMMISSIONER GORDON: GORDON Anything suspicious! In the parlor, where all the shades are drawn, TWO COPS are examining each letter in turn, holding them up to a light bulb, CREASING THEM carefully before slitting them open. COP Nothing yet. Christmas cards and bills. He anxiously watches their progress. A VOICE calls from the kitchen. BOMB-DISPOSAL EXPERT (V.O.) Commissioner -- ? INT. KITCHEN - A MOMENT LATER GORDON enters. The bomb-disposal boys have their equipment scattered all over the kitchen table. They've slit the brown- paper wrapping of the PACKAGE, exposing a ROUND DECORATIVE TIN. BOMB-DISPOSAL EXPERT It's a fruitcake. He lifts the lid for GORDON to have a look. GORDON ...Have it analyzed. INT. BROWNSTONE - ENTRY HALL - THAT MOMENT A bleary-eyed ELLIOTT TIPTREE marches down the stairs carrying a pair of OVERSIZED SUITCASES. His WIFE and TWO KIDS are behind him -- all bundled up, preparing to embark on an extended vacation. POLICEMAN Mrs. Tiptree? The car's here. TIPTREE, fighting back tears, embraces his wife for a long wordless moment. Their LITTLE GIRL, aged six, tugs at Mommy's sleeve. LITTLE GIRL I don't wanna go to Grandma's. I wanna stay here with Daddy. MRS. TIPTREE She's got a nice tree just like ours, honey. Daddy'll be up as soon as he can. LITTLE GIRL She's old. She doesn't even have cable. LITTLE BOY What about our presents? He gestures toward the GIFTS piled high around the tree in the parlor. TIPTREE Don't worry. I'll bring 'em up with me. We'll open 'em when I get there. TIPTREE forces a smile for the kids. He CLUTCHES his wife's hand. GORDON Sorry, folks, but we'd better move along. MRS. TIPTREE Kids? Tell your Daddy goodbye... Tearful hugs all around; then a cadre of UNIFORMED COPS escort MRS. TIPTREE and the KIDS to the door. TIPTREE pulls GORDON aside. TIPTREE They'll be safe, won't they? GORDON As safe as we can make 'em. (beat; sternly) It would help if you could give us some small hint what this is all about. TIPTREE I told you. I... TIPTREE shrugs helplessly and stares at his shoes. GORDON is convinced he's holding something back. GORDON You have no idea what was in that box that Provost had delivered from the bank. TIPTREE shakes his head wearily. GORDON glowers as he turns to go. GORDON (cont.) All right, Mr. Tiptree. Merry Christmas. GORDON exits. TIPTREE wanders listlessly into the living room, pulls back the drapes, and WATCHES as his wife and kids ride off in a convoy of POLICE CARS. One of the COPS tries to pull him away from the window, but he refuses to move... ...until a PHONE RINGS. Everyone jumps at once. A TECHNICIAN hits a switch on a loudspeaker-and-tape-recorder assembly, then gestures for TIPTREE to pick up the receiver... TIPTREE Hello...? VOICE ON LOUDSPEAKER Mr. Tiptree? Andy here. Listen -- we've got a chance to grab a good-sized block of Atlantic Teledyne at twenty-six and an eighth -- The COPS heave sighs and turn off their tracing equipment. TIPTREE Not today, Andy. Let's talk after New Year's. TIPTREE hangs up and starts to BAWL right there in the middle of the room. The COPS turn away in sympathetic embarrassment as he goes to a corner wet bar and pours himself a good stiff jolt. INT. TIPTREE'S BEDROOM - DAY Wallowing in despair, TIPTREE sits at an antique secretary composing a LETTER. He takes a long pull on a glass of Scotch, signs his name, and inserts the letter into an envelope. He opens the desk drawer -- takes a long look at a .38 automatic stashed inside -- then finds a stamp and affixes it to the envelope. He addresses it to BRUCE WAYNE. A moment later he hears a noise at the window: TINK TINK TINK. He peers through the blinds and sees a CARRIER PIGEON on the ledge outside -- pecking at the glass, asking to come in. He raises the window and the PIGEON hops fearlessly inside, onto the sill. The bird, well-trained, struggles only slightly as he unties a tiny CAPSULE from its leg and removes a FOLDED NOTE. Scrawled across it is a handwritten message: IF POLICE SEE THIS YOUR FAMILY IS DEAD He opens the note and begins to read as the PIGEON takes wing. CUT TO: INT. BRUCE'S LIBRARY - DAY BRUCE is at his desk examining the morning editions. A BANNER HEAD-LINE shrieks: BATMAN SOUGHT IN PUBLISHER'S MURDER Bat Attack Panics Gotham Square J. Harrison Provost, 41, Leaves Distinguished Legacy He hears a VISITOR arriving in the entry hall. He gets up... INT. ENTRY HALL - THAT MOMENT - DAY BRUCE ambles out and sees SELINA, who's just arrived, doing her patetented thing on ALFRED. SELINA English accents are so stimulating. (beat) You have the most beautiful silver hair! ALFRED stammers as she reaches up to STROKE HIS HAIR. He's about to break into a sweat. He's eminently relieved when she turns and sees -- SELINA (cont.) Bruce! BRUCE Selina. What are you doing here? ALFRED affects a look of grandmotherly outrage as SELINA slinks over and takes BRUCE by the arm. She's on him like a barnacle. SELINA I wanted to see your things, remember? And I got tired of waiting for you to call me back. (gesturing toward ALFRED) He's adorable. How long have you had him? INT. HALLWAY - A MOMENT LATER - DAY BRUCE leads SELINA down a hallway to the armory. He glances back over his shoulder and sees ALFRED peering snoopily around the corner. BRUCE You heard about Harry Provost. SELINA It's incredibly awful. It got me a little worried. (sidling up closer) I hate to think of something happening to you. BRUCE Same here. SELINA It's odd, though. Danger, the thought of suddenly dying -- in a weird way it gets you sort of...aroused. Don't you think? BRUCE cocks an eyebrow at her. Everything gets her sort of aroused. INT. ARMORY - A MOMENT LATER SELINA BEAMS at the fantastic collection of armored gear and exotic weapons. She's like a kid in a toy shop. SELINA Bruce, this is incredible. (indicating a suit of armor) Malaysian -- ? BRUCE Not bad. Sarawak warrior caste. SELINA It's like -- everything in here is another little piece of your mind. I was right about you. (turning to face him) Promise, okay? Promise you'll show me every inch of this place. PAGE 87 MISSING FROM HARD COPY INT. BATCAVE - FIFTEEN MINUTES LATER ALFRED is at a PRINTER, scanning page after page of computer printout. He delivers his findings to BRUCE, who's seated at a nearby terminal, scanning data and tapping away at the keyboard. ALFRED The police have no files whatsoever on Selina Kyle. BRUCE (abstractedly) London...Cairo...Belgium... ALFRED What exactly are you -- BRUCE Her credit card records. (looking up) Every major art theft in the last five years -- she's been on the scene or close to it. ALFRED You mean she's some sort of -- collector? A...cat burglar, or -- BRUCE Could be. Museum curator, authenticator -- she's got the perfect cover for it. (beat) What would she want with that stupid raven? ALFRED Raven, sir? BRUCE That's what the Catwoman took from Provost. A little raven statuette, about so big... (shaking his head) But it couldn't have been that valuable. He continues to scan the screen. ALFRED is suddenly lost in thought. ALFRED How very odd. (long pause) I'm sure it's nothing, but -- BRUCE What, Alfred? ALFRED Your father had a raven, sir. A small statue of the very sort you describe. It used to sit on his desk. This piques BRUCE's interest. He swivels around in his chair and stares directly up at ALFRED. BRUCE What happened to it? ALFRED After your father's...demise, Mr. Tiptree came to the house and asked if he could have it. As a keepsake. I saw no harm... (shrugging) That was thirty years ago. BRUCE Wait a minute. Mr. Tiptree? ALFRED George Tiptree. Your friend Elliott's father. CUT TO: INT. TIPTREE'S BEDROOM - AFTERNOON TIPTREE has an oversized suitcase open on the bed. It's empty -- except for the BALLED-UP WADS of NEWSPAPER which he's stuffing inside it. His head turns suddenly at the sound of the doorbell... INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - A MOMENT LATER TIPTREE emerges from his bedroom and peers over a bannister into the ENTRYWAY below. Standing there is an unexpected visitor -- BRUCE WAYNE -- holding his arms aloft while a battery of COPS pat him down. BRUCE What are you looking for -- Batarangs? TIPTREE Bruce! Come on up. (to the COPS) I want to talk to Mr. Wayne alone. The COPS look on suspiciously as BRUCE ascends the stairs. INT. TIPTREE'S LIBRARY - A MOMENT LATER TIPTREE lets BRUCE inside and shuts the door behind him. BRUCE hands him a GIFT BOX. BRUCE I brought you a Christmas present. Sorry about the wrapping -- the police made me open it. TIPTREE opens the box and pulls out a diamond-studded TIE CLASP. He looks up at BRUCE with an odd mixture of bewilderment and gratitude. BRUCE nods for him to try it on, and he obliges... TIPTREE ...I'm afraid I don't have anything for you. BRUCE I think you may have something that belonged to my father. TIPTREE -- You know? He stares at BRUCE, astonished. His head sinks into his hands. TIPTREE (cont.) It'll all be over tomorrow. One way or another, it'll all be over. (looking up; despondent) I've decided, Bruce. I'm gonna give him the last two ravens. He's already got the others. BRUCE What are you talking about? Who? TIPTREE Batman. I don't know how he found out, but -- TIPTREE reaches for the bottle on his desk to pour himself a drink, but BRUCE angrily knocks the glass out of his hands. BRUCE It's time you told me what's going on here. TIPTREE Didn't you ever wonder where it came from, Bruce? All the privilege, all the power ...all the money? (beat) The ravens are a...a kind of map, Bruce. The key to an incredibly vast fortune. BRUCE Whose fortune? TIPTREE Gotham City's. FLASHBACK - PROCESSED FOOTAGE (MOS) The cobblestone streets of 19th-Century Gotham. A massive EXPLOSION blows open one wall of a municipal building, and total CHAOS erupts: fires starting, BYSTANDERS screaming, POLICE rushing to the scene... TIPTREE In 1880 the Gotham City Treasury was looted. It was a fantastic operation -- perfect military precision. The robbers made off with milllons in gold and silver bullion... A HORSE-DRAWN CART weighted down with gold bricks careens around a corner. Atop it are two men in MASKS, firing a GATLING GUN into the crowd. POLICE and ONLOOKERS tumble to the pavement, shot dead, as ANOTHER CART emerges from the wreckage of the treasury and takes off in the opposite direction. FLASHBACK - PROCESSED FOOTAGE (MOS) CITY OFFICIALS in a boardroom trading papers back and forth, arguing furiously with five calm, distinguished-looking GENTS -- one of whom is the bushy-bearded Civil War hero GEN. OLIVER WAYNE. TIPTREE (V.O.) The city was going under. Bankrupt... until five rich men stepped in to bail it out. In exchange they took the land rights, the mineral rights, the service contracts -- BACK TO SCENE - ON BRUCE AND TIPTREE BRUCE The Five Families. TIPTREE Our ancestors. They bought Gotham City -- carved it up and ran it into the ground. In five years they were rich beyond imagining. (pause) We've just been following in their footsteps. And in all this time no one's ever suspected -- BRUCE -- that they were the ones behind the robbery? FLASHBACK - PROCESSED FOOTAGE (MOS) The FIVE PATRIARCHS in front of a roaring fireplace at Wayne Manor, raising a celebratory toast. CAMERA PANS OVER to a nearby table; on it rest FIVE RAVEN STATUETTES. TIPTREE (O.S.) They had five ravens made. Five ravens which -- combined -- would reveal the location of the treasure they'd stolen. (beat) But they never touched it. They never needed to. It's still there to this day. BACK TO SCENE - ON BRUCE AND TIPTREE TIPTREE The ravens, and the secret -- have been passed down through generations. Father to son... (shaking his head) Your father -- died before he could tell you. BRUCE So they stole his piece of the puzzle. TIPTREE Yeah. I've got it, Bruce, and I'm going to hand it over. He's right, you know. We've all been feeding -- feeding on the soul of Gotham... BRUCE stares at him, stony-faced. There's one part of the story that doesn't quite add up. BRUCE (cont.) I don't believe you, Elliott. My father was a decent man -- an honorable man. He would never have taken part in a scheme like this. TIPTREE It wasn't his doing, Bruce. It was -- BRUCE That doesn't matter. If he knew that his fortune was based on a crime -- a crime against the city... (violently) Reputation or not, he would've tried to -- TIPTREE Christ, Bruce! Do you want me to spell it out for you?!? BRUCE backs off. An awful shiver of anticipation runs down his spine. TIPTREE (cont.) He was a decent man. He was an honorable man. That's why they had him killed. CAMERA ZEROES IN ON BRUCE'S HORRIFIED FACE as we get a SERIES OF SHOTS Quick, almost subliminal glimpses of BRUCE's primal trauma: a MUGGER snatching at his mother's necklace. THOMAS WAYNE lunging at him. The young JACK NAPIER firing at THOMAS. PEARLS showering down on the rain-drenched sidewalk. A second bullet felling his MOTHER -- -- and finally, young BRUCE himself, face wracked with PAIN and GRIEF -- BACK TO SCENE - ON BRUCE -- an expression which perfectly matches the one which the adult BRUCE is wearing as he relives it all thirty years later. Staggered and glassy-eyed, he stares off into space as TIPTREE finishes his tale. TIPTREE They killed him...to protect their secret ...and now the bill's come due. Now the bill's come due. CUT TO: EXT. WAYNE MANOR - ESTABLISHING - TOWARD DUSK The wrought-iron gate outside BRUCE's vast estate -- and beyond it, Wayne Manor itself, rising bold and stately against the setting sun. A COUNTY SHERIFF'S CAR cruises past... INT. WAYNE MANOR - BRUCE'S BEDROOM - THAT MOMENT BRUCE lies motionless on his bed. Scattered about him are SCRAPBOOKS, FAMILY PHOTOS and yellowed NEWSPAPER CLIPPINGS which describe the murder of his parents. Disoriented, he gazes about aimlessly at his familiar surroundings -- which no longer seem quite so familiar... He folds his arms formally across his chest and stares up at the ceiling, inert, as if the very weight of his heritage is crushing him down. Somewhere, a PHONE RINGS. He makes no move to answer it. INT. WAYNE MANOR - KITCHEN - DUSK VICKI's at the kitchen table drinking coffee. ALFRED, who's in his apron preparing dinner, picks up the ringing phone. ALFRED Thank you, yes, everything's fine. I'll expect your next call in an hour. (hanging up; to VICKI) The police are becoming an awful nuisance. VICKI I feel so awful for him, Alfred. There must be something we can do. ALFRED I realized long ago -- that there are places in Mr. Wayne's heart which no one will ever penetrate -- or share. (pause) He loves you, Miss Vale. But in certain ways he will always be alone. BRUCE (O.S.) ...Thanks for the testimonial. ALFRED turns and sees BRUCE standing in the doorway, staring at him. He starts to say something, but thinks better of it. He returns to his dinner preparations as BRUCE sits down across from VICKI. She extends a hand and he takes it -- making a visible effort to hold himself together. BRUCE Tiptree's planning some kind of rendezvous with 'Batman.' I think Batman ought to be there when it happens. ALFRED I see, sir. When shall we expect you back? BRUCE Get your cap. You're driving. INT. TIPTREE'S BROWNSTONE - NIGHT It's late, and the house is dark as TIPTREE treeds silently downstairs carrying an OVERSIZED SUITCASE. The lights are on in the kitchen, where the COPS are playing poker and watching TV. INT. PARLOR - A MOMENT LATER - NIGHT CHRISTMAS TREE LIGHTS twinkle in the darkness. TIPTREE kneels beside the tree and digs around among the packages. He pulls out an OBLONG GIFT BOX with a tag addressed "TO DADDY -- FROM SANTA." With a glance back at the kitchen, he soundlessly unwraps the package -- and opens it to reveal a matched set of RAVEN STATUETTES. He transfers them to the big suitcase -- then slinks into the hallway... INT. BEDROOM ACROSS STREET - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT The two STAKEOUT COPS are chuckling at a Charlie Brown Christmas special on a portable TV. One of them glances out the window and sees a man in a topcoat emerging from the brownstone, SUITCASE in hand... STAKEOUT COP I Shit -- that's Tiptree!! The COP grabs for his WALKIE-TALKIE. EXT. STREET OUTSIDE BROWNSTONE - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT TIPTREE is halfway down the block when two COPS burst out of the brownstone. COP Mr. Tiptree! What the hell are you -- HEADLIGHTS FLASH ON as the SURVEILLANCE CAR revs its engine. TIPTREE breaks into a RUN -- and the COPS from the brownstone follow suit. At the end of the block he vanishes down a SUBWAY ENTRANCE. INT. SUBWAY STATION - THAT MOMENT A VIOLINIST is panhandling outside the token booth as the COPS come racing down the stairs. The COPS trip over his open violin case, scattering small change across the conrete floor. They flash their badges at the booth and VAULT OVER THE TURNSTILE -- -- just in time to see TIPTREE, with his SUITCASE, scuttling down a stairway which leads to the train platform below. INT. SUBWAY PLATFORM - A MOMENT LATER TIPTREE steps onto an EXPRESS TRAIN. The doors slide shut behind him -- and the hapless COPS curse under their breath as he rolls off. COP We've gotta get back to the radio. INT. SUBWAY CAR - A MOMENT LATER - MOVING TIPTREE takes an open seat and looks around apprehensively. Being fabulously rich, be's probably ridden the subway twice in his life -- and at this time of night, EVERY FACE in the sparsely-populated car looks vaguely menacing. Derelicts, prostitutes, teen-gang members -- ALL OF THEM eye this well- heeled stranger with intense curiosity as he clutches his suitcase and stares anxiously at the floor... An ODD, GAUNT FIGURE enters at the end of the car. It's a DEAFMUTE. He shambles down the aisle passing out little white CARDS. One side is a guide to International Sign Language. The other reads: DEAF AND DUMB PLEASE HELP -- $1.00 TWO YOUNG TOUGHS take a card and tear it in half, chuckling, shining the DEAFMUTE on. A HOOKER, the heart-of-gold type, stuffs a buck in his tin cup. He reaches TIPTREE and extends a card; TIPTREE ignores him, refusing to make eye contact -- -- but the DEAFMUTE shoves the card insistently into his face. Now TIPTREE looks up. THIS CARD bears a personalized message: GOTHAM CENTRAL STATION B-TRAIN WEST TO RIVERVIEW TIPTREE's eyes widen. The DEAFMUTE -- who is in fact FRICK -- glowers down and holds out his cup. TIPTREE digs in his pocket; the smallest bill he's got is a twenty, but he hands it over anyway. Smiling at this act of generosity, FRICK moves on to the next car. TIPTREE stares down tremulously at the card. He fidgets with his TIE CLASP -- the one BRUCE gave him earlier... INT. LIMO - MOVING - NIGHT TIGHT on a hand-held ELECTRONIC TRACING DEVICE. A small BLIP moves across a shifting GRID not unlike a radar screen. BRUCE is in the back of the limo, eyeing the tracer intently. ALFRED's up front, at the wheel. BRUCE According to this, he's directly below us. ALFRED The subway, sir? BRUCE Yeah. Take a right. INT. GOTHAM CENTRAL STATION - THAT MOMENT It's slightly more crowded here in the hub of Gotham. TIPTREE emerges onto the platform and spies a squad of TRANSIT COPS thirty or forty feet away -- speaking into WALKIE-TALKIES as they scan the crowd. Sticking close to the tracks, he turns swiftly toward the nearest stairway -- blending in with the crowd, trying to hold the SUITCASE out of view. INT. LOWER PLATFORM - A MINUTE LATER TIPTREE IS RUNNING for the B-train just as the doors begin to close. He manages to thrust the suitcase inside -- but the doors SLIDE SHUT on his hand, and he DROPS IT. He stands there on the platform, his face turning BONE WHITE as the train lurches forward... False alarm. The train stops, and the doors hiss open again. INT. SUBWAY CAR - MOVING - A MOMENT LATER TIPTREE clambers aboard with a severe case of palpitations. As the train pulls out, a couple of rough-looking but helpful STREET TYPES show him to a seat and hand him his precious suitcase. He sits there panting... Moments later, a DEAFMUTE enters the car. TIPTREE does a take: it's the exact same guy who was riding the other line! Of course, he doesn't know about Frick's malignant twin -- FRACK... WIPE TO: INT. LOCAL STOP - TEN MINUTES LATER - NIGHT Having changed trains twice more since we left him, TIPTREE debarks at a deserted local stop. The station is EMPTY except for one other passenger, who's gotten off here as well -- a WOMAN in a long fur coat. TIPTREE WATCHES as she approaches on her way to the stairwell, STILLETO HEELS clicking across the floor. There's something familiar about her -- but she's wearing a big, broad-brimmed hat, and she TILTS IT DOWN as she passes, obscuring her face. It is, of course, SELINA... TIPTREE stands there expectantly with his suitcase, awaiting further instructions. They aren't long in coming. A BLACK MYNAH BIRD swoops out of the tunnel, lands on the platform, and STRUTS in front of him. MYNAH FOLLOW ME. AWWWKK! FOLLOW ME. The bird flutters its wings and takes off again -- INTO THE TUNNEL. TIPTREE stares after it in disbelief. Then the bird CAWS AGAIN -- its shrill voice echoing from the darkness of the tunnel: MYNAH (O.S.) FOLLOW ME. AWWWKK! TIPTREE clambers over the edge of the platform, dropping awkwardly to the tracks below. Suitcase in hand, he begins to walk... INT. LIMO - MOVING - NIGHT ALFRED tearing up the streets as BRUCE consults his tracer. BRUCE He's slowed down. Looks like he's under the park. ALFRED How do you propose to get down there, sir? We can't have Batman strolling up to buy a token. BRUCE I know another way in. (beat) Step on it. They're down there waiting for him. ALFRED turns the limo hard right -- into GOTHAM PARK -- past the statue of GENERAL WAYNE atop his horse... INT. SUBWAY TUNNEL - THAT MOMENT A LOCAL TRAIN roars by, filling the screen. When it passes, we see TIPTREE with his suitcase, walking along the express tracks at the far wall of the tunnel -- more frightened with each step. It's dark and eerie down here in the tunnels; the only illumination comes from dim LANTERNS spaced at fifty-foot intervals. He sees the lights of an EXPRESS TRAIN behind him, and quickly switches to the local tracks. The train rumbles past with a deafening blare, and the car lights briefly illuminate his surroundings. TIPTREE glances over at the inside wall of the tunnel... ...where he sees, huddled in an ALCOVE just off the tracks, a small gathering of HOMELESS PEOPLE. They've set up camp down here in the tunnels, away from the elements. Surrounded by bags full of old clothes, DINING on canned food and cheap wine, they stare curiously at the well-heeled stranger with the suitcase who's invaded their domain. TIPTREE eyes them fearfully and picks up his pace, hastening down the tunnel. The HOMELESS make no move to follow -- with one exception. A KID, thirteen or fourteen, in a ratty topcoat, climbs down onto the tracks and watches inquisitively as TIPTREE vanishes into the shadows. His face is familiar. It's DICK -- the boy vigilante from the park. INT. TUNNEL - FARTHER DOWN TRACKS - A MOMENT LATER In this stretch of the tunnel the LANTERNS don't seem to be working -- and the MYNAH is completely invisible. When he comes to a fork in the tracks, he has to wait for the sound of the bird's shrill voice to guide him: MYNAH AWWRRK! FOLLOW ME. TIPTREE stumbles ahead blindly in the darkness. He trips on the tracks and drops the suitcase. As he's getting to his feet, a FLASHLIGHT shines DIRECTLY IN HIS FACE... VOICE STOP THERE. The MYNAH BIRD flutters through the beam of light and perches on the shoulder of an UNSEEN FIGURE. TIPTREE COWERS and SQUINTS, trying to make him out, but the figure who stands before him is shielding his face with an open UMBRELLA. TIPTREE I've cooperated. I've done everything you said. PENGUIN Open the case. TIPTREE lifts the lid, revealirig TWO RAVENS in the suitcase. A CACKLING LAUGH echoes in the darkness. PENGUIN (cont.) ...Two ravens? TIPTREE The other one is Bruce Wayne's. (trembling) He doesn't know anything about this. You've got what you want. There's no need to -- PENGUIN Thank you, Mr. Tiptree. You may go. TIPTREE stands. He backs away from the suitcase warily. TIPTREE My family. You won't -- PENGUIN We'll certainly take your unexpected generosity into consideration. TIPTREE We -- ?!? (shielding his eyes) You're not Batman. PENGUIN No. I'm his brother-in-law -- Birdman. Now move out. INT. TUNNEL - HIGH ANGLE - THAT MOMENT TIPTREE marches slowly down the tracks, TOWARD CAMERA, silhouetted in the flashlight beam. The beam SHIFTS SLIGHTLY as the Penguin moves toward the suitcase and sets the light down -- -- and we catch sight of the CATWOMAN perched on a steel cross-girder above the rails, her CHROME-STEEL TALONS GLINTING as she waits for TIPTREE to pass underneath. INT. TUNNEL - ON TIPTREE looking increasingly twitchy as he approaches the cross- girder. He slips a hand into the pocket of his topcoat, WHIRLS SUDDENLY -- -- and brings up his .38 AUTOMATIC, firing THREE QUICK SHOTS at the PENGUIN. The shots RICOCHET LOUDLY off the umbrella -- which happens to be a bulletproof job. The PENGUIN lifts his brolly; FIRE SPITS out of the shaft -- -- and TIPTREE staggers backward. SHOT IN THE CHEST. He spins into a steel upright and topples, face-forward, onto the ELECTRIFIED THIRD RAIL -- FRYING HIMSELF in a shower of sparks. The smoke is still clearing when the CATWOMAN drops to the tracks. The PENGUIN rushes to her side to check TIPTREE for signs of life. CATWOMAN That idiot. Another six feet -- PENGUIN So sorry to spoil your fun. -- He brought two ravens. We've got a complete set! CATWOMAN What?? PENGUIN Yeah! They're in the suitcase -- An AWFUL RUMBLING fills the tunnel. They see the lights of a TRAIN approaching on the center track -- the same one they're standing on, the one TIPTREE's body is slumped across. The PENGUIN's first impulse is to run back toward the inner track, where the ravens lie, but the CATWOMAN is trying to drag TIPTREE out of the train's path... CATWOMAN GIVE ME A HAND! They pull the corpse onto the outer express track just as the train arrives. They stand against the outer wall, waiting for the train to pass... ...and when it does, they see DICK -- the boy vigilante -- standing on the inner track directly across from them. HOLDING THE SUITCASE. The kid takes off like a shot. The CATWOMAN and the PENGUIN exchange quick looks of utter disbelief -- and BOLT AFTER DICK. INT. TUNNEL - ON DICK The bulky suitcase is slowing his progress. He looks back over his shoulder; although the stubby-legged PENGUIN has fallen well behind, the CATWOMAN is gaining fast. PAGE 101 MISSING FROM HARD COPY INT. TUNNEL - ON DICK watching in the light from the train as the two costumed figures grapple in the distance. He races back toward the scene of the melee... INT. TUNNEL - OUTTER EXPRESS TRACK - THAT MOMENT ...where BATMAN and the CATWOMAN are trading punches, blow for blow. He knocks her off her feet with a vicious right hook, and she sprawls on the track, dazed and bleeding. She lifts a hand: no mas... He looks back toward the suitcase on the center track. Before he can make a move toward it, he spots ANOTHER TRAIN approaching on the outer tracks -- right on the heels of the last one. He crouches to pull the CATWOMAN's limp frame out of its path... ...but as he does so, a HORN BLARES -- and a SECOND TRAIN comes barrelling down the center track from the opposite direction! Now he's got trains approaching on either side, and there's no place to go -- The CATWOMAN is groggily getting to her feet. He LUNGES at her -- THRUSTS HER BACKWARD, toward an ALCOVE in the outer tunnel wall. INT. TUNNEL - ON DICK - THAT MOMENT The OUTER train is already speeding past, obscuring BATMAN and the CATWOMAN from view. The CENTER train is bearing down fast. A split-second before it arrives, DICK'S HAND snatches the suitcase out of its path -- and he TUMBLES TO SAFETY on the innermost LOCAL TRACK. He stands and watches as the two trains pass in opposite directions. He doesn't know if BATMAN is alive or dead... INT. ALCOVE - THAT MOMENT BATMAN and CATWOMAN are flattened in the tiny alcove -- there's not two inches of breathing space between them and the passing TRAIN. She's come around now, and she's FLAILING and CLAWING at him, trying to PUSH HIM OUT. HER HAND closes around his UTILITY BELT. As they struggle, she hits the trigger of a SMALL GAS CYLINDER... It's BRUCE's hydraulic BATWING DEVICE -- the one that saved him when he fell off the roof. But this time the results are altogether different. He GASPS IN HORROR as the WINGS OF HIS CAPE stiffen and inflate -- FORCING HIM AWAY FROM THE WALL OF THE TUNNEL. His OUTER WING strikes the TRAIN -- FLAPPING WILDLY against the passing CARS -- SNAGGING FINALLY on the ralling of the rearmost car -- -- and BATMAN is suddenly RIPPED OUT OF THE ALCOVE -- DRAGGED OFF DOWN THE TRACKS by the passing train! INT. TUNNEL - INNERMOST TRACK - ON DICK He's still there with the suitcase -- waiting apprehensively to see what's become of BATMAN. Finally the center train passes -- -- and he sees CATWOMAN standing ALONE IN THE ALCOVE -- smiling at him -- advancing menacingly. DICK TURNS TO RUN... A GUNSHOT rings out -- and the last thing he sees as he slumps to the tracks is a whiff of SMOKE pluming from the shaft of the PENGUIN'S UMBRELLA. The PENGUIN's panting -- soaked with sweat. The CATWOMAN snatches up the suitcase and rushes over to join him. She peers off into the tunnels after BATMAN, exhilarated... CATWOMAN God. Did you see him? Isn't he hot? PENGUIN Haven't you got anything else to think about? (mopping sweat from his brow) I'm hot. That was exhausting. CATWOMAN No pain, no gain! -- Suck it up. We're not out of here yet. She sprints off down the tracks. SQUAWKING, he waddles along behind her, as fast as his fat little legs will carry him... As they vanish into the darkness, the CAMERA TRACKS back -- past DICK, who lies unconscious on the tracks, bleeding heavily from his shoulder wound -- DEEPER INTO THE MAZE OF TUNNELS -- -- arriving finally on the ragged black figure of BATMAN as he staggers forth from the shadows, dazed and bloody. He scans the tunnel, finding no trace of his enemies -- and then his gaze falls on DICK. He limps over and KNEELS at the boy's side -- cradling his head protectively, staring helplessly into the blackness all around him... DISSOLVE TO: EXT. GOTHAM CITY SKYLINE - NIGHT The stark outlines of the city, BATHED IN MOONLIGHT. CAMERA ZEROES IN on the glowing, ornamental DOME of CITY HALL... INT. CITY HALL - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT A PENTAGONAL BALCONY girds the interior of the dome. We TILT DOWN to ground level -- where TWO AGED SECURITY GUARDS lie sprawled at odd angles on the marble floor, FATALLY SHOT. The PENGUIN closes his gun-umbrella and waddles across the atrium of City Hall, past a statue of blind Justice, to a point directly under the dome. There, encased in a plexiglass case, is a SCALE MODEL of GOTHAM CITY -- circa 1885, when City Hall was erected. He shouts up: PENGUIN LETS DO IT! INT. CITY HALL - BALCONY UNDER DOME - THAT MOMENT The CATWOMAN, FRICK, and FRACK are already up on the balcony. Lining its periphery are various DISPLAY CASES of historical interest; and positioned along the wall at each point of the pentagon are FIVE ARCHED NICHES -- each one containing a bronze bust. The patriarchs of Gotham's Five Families... The CATWOMAN and co. go to work quickly. She removes the FIVE RAVENS from a gunny sack as FRICK and FRACK work their way around the balcony, YANKING the busts from their recessed bases. She follows along behind them, replacing each bust with a RAVEN. When they're done, the PENGUIN yells up: PENGUIN Now. Give each raven a quarter-turn. His pals in the dome oblige -- TWISTING each raven in its recessed socket, in quick succession... INT. CITY HALL - ATRIUM - ON PENGUIN The moment of maximum tension. He stands there frothing at the mouth with anticipation. SECONDS TICK OFF, and nothing happens. CATWOMAN What happens now? PENGUIN I don't know. That's all...! He looks around expectantly as the others peer down at him from above. He really doesn't know what's supposed to happen next. Suspecting the worst, he throws his umbrella to the floor and begins STAMPING ABOUT IN A RAGE, SPUTTERING, flapping his arms like wings. PENGUIN (cont.) We've been TRICKED! It's a HOAX! It's a -- He SHUTS UP suddenly at the sound of a loud CHUNK. Somewhere behind him, ANCIENT GEARS are beginning to grind. He spins and stares at the SCALE MODEL of GOTHAM in its plexiglass case... The city model is TREMBLING slightly. As he watches, the DOME of the miniature CITY HALL -- in the dead center of the model city -- POPS OFF on a hinge. A METAL STRONGBOX rises into view... INT. DOME - ON BALCONY - THAT MOMENT The CATWOMAN, FRICK and FRACK stare down at the little metal box. The PENGUIN is already clambering atop the plexiglass case of the model, SMASHING AT IT with his umbrella, trying to get at the box. FRICK That's the treasure? CATWOMAN No. It's a map... She affixes a ROPE to the balcony railing and CLIMBS OVER. INT. CITY HALL - ATRIUM - ON PENGUIN The plexiglass case finally SHATTERS -- and the PENGUIN falls through, landing atop Gotham City. He snatches at the strongbox and gets to his feet, bestriding the city like a colossus. He's climbing down off the tabletop when the CATWOMAN, on her rope, touches down behind him. He hunkers down on the floor and knocks the rusted padlock off the box. He opens it and stares greedily at the contents -- a MAP and a bunch of old, crumbling PHOTOS. The CATWOMAN creeps over to his side: PENGUIN Bruce Wayne. So he doesn't know a thing about the treasure, eh...? (handing her the map) Look at this. It's right under Wayne Manor. It's been there all along! Now the CATWOMAN snatches at the PHOTOS. They show progressively closer views of ANCIENT GNARLED STALACTITES -- an odd, distinctive SUBTERRANEAN ROCK FORMATION... PENGUIN (cont.) Looks like some kind of cave. FADE THROUGH TO: INT. WAYNE MANOR - GUEST BEDROOM - DAY TIGHT ON THE FACE of DICK. He lies unconscious in a big soft frilly bed A WOMAN'S HAND wipes his feverish brow with a damp cloth; he moans slightly... His eyes snap open suddenly. He sits BOLT UPRIGHT with a yelp. VICKI No, no -- don't try to get up -- you're hurt. He pushes her aside and climbs out of bed anyway. His shoulder is bandaged, his arm in a sling. The pajamas he's wearing are three sizes too large. He paces about, staring at his unfamiliar surroundings. VICKI (cont.) It's all right. You're safe. You can stay here as long as you need to. DICK I don't belong here. You can't keep me here. Vaguely unnerved, he goes to a window, pulls back the shades, looks out at the grounds. VICKI It's "Dick", isn't it? Or do you prefer "Richard"? He stares at her as if she's nuts. VICKI opens a closet door: all of his ratty belongings are hanging inside -- including the red-and-green GYMNAST'S SUIT with the "R" insigne on the breast. VICKI "R" -- for Richard, right? See, all your things are here... (staring at the costume) What is it, some kind of gymnast's outfit? DICK It's none of your business. What is this, some kind of home? VICKI No, not that kind. There's a swimming pool -- tennis court -- you can have anything you want. DICK Tennis court?! -- Lady, you're rich. How the hell would you know what I want? VICKI tries to lay a soothing arm on his shoulder. He bats it away, pushes her aside and turns toward the door in agitation -- DICK I'm not staying. You can't make me -- -- and sees BRUCE standing in the doorway looking at him. BRUCE I can make you. DICK freezes -- as if BRUCE's mere presence has mesmerized him. The hint of a smile plays across his face: ohhhhh. I'm in Batman's house. BRUCE (cont.) Come on. Wanna go at it? (no response) Look, kid -- like it or not, you're my guest -- and long as you're here you might as well enjoy it. ALFRED appears with a tray of hot food and sets it down on a bedside table. DICK edges toward it and sits down. He waits for ALFRED to leave and then TUCKS IN HUNGRILY -- eyeing BRUCE all the while. BRUCE (cont.) Will you two be okay in here? VICKI nods yes. BRUCE backs out of the room. INT. WAYNE MANOR - OUTSIDE GUEST ROOM - DAY BRUCE pulls the door shut. ALFRED follows him down the hall. ALFRED What do you propose to do with him, sir? Keep him in the room for the rest of his life? BRUCE I don't know, Alfred. I've got other stuff to worry about. ALFRED The child is hurt, sir. At the very least we should attempt to locate his parents. BRUCE He hasn't got any parents. ALFRED How do you know that, sir? BRUCE turns and fixes ALFRED with a steely gaze. BRUCE ...I know. The PHONE RINGS as BRUCE starts down the long stairway. ALFRED picks up a hallway extension. He covers the mouthpiece: ALFRED Sir -- it's Miss Kyle. BRUCE rushes back upstairs to take the call. INT. PENGUIN'S LAIR - THAT MOMENT - DAY ARCTIC BIRDS chirping all around in the penguin-pool room. A SNOW OWL struts across the PENGUIN's desk as SELINA makes a phone call -- with the PENGUIN, FRICK, and FRACK hovering over her. SELINA Well! Tall, dark and handsome. Are we still on for tonight? INT. WAYNE MANOR - ON BRUCE He covers the receiver and stares intensely at ALFRED. On his look we DISSOLVE TO: INT. WAYNE MANOR - FRONT PARLOR - NIGHT Christmas carols playing. VICKI's got DICK helping her trim the tree. INT. BRUCE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT BRUCE is getting dressed for his date with SELINA. ALFRED Is this necessary, sir? After all...it is Christmas eve. BRUCE reaches for his UTILITY BELT. He empties the contents of one packet onto a dresser: a dozen tiny, red GLASSINE CAPSULES. He scoops up a handful of the CAPSULES and deposits them in his jacket pocket. BRUCE Stuff'll knock out a moose, much less a cat. ALFRED I don't like to see you going out on a date...unprotected, sir. BRUCE She'll be ready for Batman -- but not for me. (turning to go) It's the only way, Alfred. I've got to take her out tonight. INT. ENTRY HALL - FIVE MINUTES LATER (DICK'S POV) DICK watches from the front parlor as VICKI meets BRUCE at the bottom of the stairs. The two of them exchange a few brief words; he embraces her, strokes her hair gently -- then glumly sets his jaw and moves off toward the front door. VICKI reenters the parlor, trying to force an expression of cheer as DICK turns discreetly away. This is one weird household he's landed in... INT. SELINA'S LOFT - NIGHT SOFT MUSIC plays in the background as SELINA preens in front of a vanity, doing her eye makeup, taking great pleasure in her own reflection. She's looking especially sultry tonight in a glittering low-cut gown. She lowers one shoulder strap and strikes a pose in the mirror: better. She runs a hand through her hair, TOUSLING IT for that recently-ravished look. The DOORBELL rings, and by the time SELINA crosses over to answer it, she's lowered the other strap as well -- which means she has to hold up the top of her dress with one hand. BRUCE finds himsell dumbstruck as she lets him in. She pulls up both straps as she greets him nonchalantly: SELINA You're early. I'm afraid I'm not quite dressed. BRUCE enters and takes a long look around. It's a big open loft, only partly finished, filled with Egyptian artifacts. The walls feature modern paintings with CAT MOTIFS. The finished section is dominated by a huge BED on a raised platform -- three or four CATS are walking around on it, yowling at BRUCE. SELINA CHUCKLES as he scopes it all out. SELINA (cont.) If you're looking for my bondage gear, it's at the cleaners. BRUCE Christmas eve. No tree? SELINA No presents. I've been a bad girl this year. BRUCE takes a seat on the sofa while SELINA goes to a nearby wet bar. BRUCE I'm surprised you kept this date. I thought you would've lost interest by now. SELINA What makes you say that? BRUCE You've got what you want, don't you? SELINA I do now. (smiling) We've had this date for a long, long time. With that, she sets the drinks down on the table and moves in to KISS him -- a long, slow, wet kiss. But BRUCE seems strangely unresponsive. She breaks free and gives him a funny look. BRUCE How much is it going to cost me? SELINA What? BRUCE ...To get the ravens back. He watches her closely for a reaction. SELINA's shocked, but she conceals it well -- chuckling in apparent confusion. SELINA You're the oddest man I've ever met. (moving in on him) Let's talk later, Bruce. I've got kind of a short fuse... BRUCE tenses slightly as she KISSES him again -- leaving a crimson LIPSTICK SMEAR on his cheek. She works her way downward, kissing him around his neck and throat... HIS HAND reaches into his jacket pocket. He withdraws a tiny GLASSINE CAPSULE. But before he can use it -- He JERKS BACK suddenly -- pushes her away. His free hand goes to his neck, where a thin trickle of BLOOD is oozing from between two bright red LIPSTICK LIPS. She's bitten him... Now she SHUSHES him -- reaches over to the tiny wound and massages it gently with one hand. SELINA Did I hurt you? Just relax -- you'll start to enjoy it. BRUCE pulls away again. His eyes are strangely glazed. He tries to speak, but his tongue feels thick and swollen. SELINA (cont.) Bruce, you look faint. It must be the cats. BRUCE stands suddenly. It's as if he's mired in a slo-mo nightmare. His legs give way beneath him and he topples to the floor, INERT. His fingers go slack and the capsule rolls out; he tries to reach into his pocket, but his arm won't seem to work. SELINA's cat, HECATE, strolls across his prostrate form -- purring and stretching... BRUCE'S POV A worm's-eye view -- SELINA looms over him with a predatory smile on her face, shifting in and out of focus. BRUCE What di-- what did you d-- She runs a finger across her lips and holds it up -- bright red. SELINA I guess I've...gotten under your skin. BACK TO SCENE - ON BRUCE His hand goes to the BITE on his neck -- and he realizes SELINA's lipstick is spiked with a fast-acting PARALYTIC DRUG. He writhes helplessly on the carpet, his whole body gradually going slack. The PENGUIN, FRICK and FRACK stroll through the doorway and stand over him -- ALL LAUGHING... DISSOLVE TO: EXT. WAYNE MANOR - NIGHT A COUNTY SHERIFF'S CAR cruises past the manor, right on schedule. INT. WAYNE MANOR - PARLOR - NIGHT ALFRED on the telephone, checking in with the County Sheriff's boys. ALFRED Everything's fine, thank you. We'll talk in an hour. Behind him, VICKI is waiting up for BRUCE. She's curled up on the sofa, reading a book, throwing the occasional anxious glance at a big grandfather clock -- which strikes eleven o'clock. INT. WAYNE MANOR - GUEST BEDROOM - NIGHT DICK opens the bedroom door and peeks down the hall. He's got all his belongings tied up in a bundle on the bed; he opens a window and throws the bundle outside. There's a nice strong TREE BRANCH some ten or twelve feet from the window -- just close enough that he should be able to make it. He climbs up onto the windowsill, crouches, and SPRINGS. INT. CAR - OUTSIDE - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT A car full of trouble: SELINA, wearing a fur coat over her Catwoman garb, at the wheel; the PENGUIN riding shotgun; and FRICK in the back seat -- next to BRUCE, who's semi-conscious and stone limp. The car idles outside the wrought-iron gates of Wayne Manor. PENGUIN Try his mag card. FRICK digs in BRUCE's pockets and finds a bunch of RED CAPSULES. FRICK Look at this. He's a pillhead. Now FRICK finds a mag-striped card and INSERTS IT into an electronic device at the edge of the drive. The gates magically part. There's a large VAN just behind the car -- driven by FRACK, and carrying two random GOONS. Both vehicles pull in before the gates slide shut. INT. WAYNE MANOR - A MOMENT LATER VICKI hears a signal from the security panel in the kitchen announcing what should be BRUCE's arrival. She heaves a huge sigh of relief -- then rushes to the door and flings it open. She sees BRUCE standing there and her face lights up. VICKI Ohh. Am I glad to -- To her horror, BRUCE topples forward -- and lands on the floor, flat as a board. VICKI SHRIEKS as the PENGUIN enters, throwing his arms wide. PENGUIN MER-R-R-RY CHRISTMAS!! EXT. WAYNE MANOR - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT DICK has shimmied down to a lower branch. He lets go and drops to the snow, WINCING; his shoulder wound is bleeding again. As he grabs his bundle, he hears RAUCOUS LAUGHTER coming from around the house. He races over to peer around the corner. He sees the two cars out front. He sees the last of the goon squad barging in through the front door. His face full of confusion and conflict, he moves to a window. In the entry hall he sees BRUCE on the floor -- and VICKI surrounded by gun-toting intruders. One of them grabs her and twists her arm behind her back. INT. WAYNE MANOR - ENTRY - THAT MOMENT VICKI shrieking and struggling as she stares down at BRUCE. VICKI What did you do to him?? SELINA gives her a catty little smile. SELINA First-time jitters, I guess. Everything was going great, and then...he just went limp as a noodle. INT. WAYNE MANOR - ON STAIRWAY Drawn by the commotion, ALFRED rushes down the stairs to the entry hall, pulling a robe around him. He freezes in his tracks when he sees FRICK dragging VICKI into the front parlor, holding a gun to her head. PENGUIN You'd be the butler. Why don't you come on down and attend to your guests? ALFRED hesitates, until the PENGUIN pulls a gun on him. He marches down the stairs slowly, pausing by BRUCE's prostrate form. ALFRED Mr. Wayne. Is he -- ? PENGUIN You know how it is. Some guys just can't hold their egg nog. INT. FRONT PARLOR - A MOMENT LATER The PENGUIN marches ALFRED in where the rest of the gang's already assembled. FRICK throws VICKI down roughly on a sofa just next to the Christmas tree while the GOONS drag BRUCE inside. PENGUIN I should explain the occasion of our visit. There's a treasure underneath this house -- and I don't plan to leave until you tell me how to find it. Now who's going to talk -- Miss Vale? VICKI I don't know what you're talking about. PENGUIN The cave. Under the house. How do I get there? The PENGUIN gestures. FRICK holds the gun to her head. VICKI (cont.) I don't know! I swear, I would tell you -- PENGUIN (turning to ALFRED) Then maybe you'd like to tell me. ALFRED You're no more than a common thief. PENGUIN Wrong, you old idiot. I happen to be a very uncommon thief. (beat) Are you going to tell me, or does Miss Vale get an early present this year? FRICK cocks the gun. VICKI stares aghast at ALFRED, who scans the room, weighing his options. Trembling, he shuts his eyes -- ALFRED I...don't...know... PENGUIN Then go ahead, Mr. Frick...decorate the tree. FRICK's finger tightens on the trigger. VICKI winces. ALFRED starts to blurt something out. But a split-second before he can speak -- SELINA Wait! (crossing over to VICKI) We don't know how to get down there yet. We may need her when Bruce wakes up. The PENGUIN sighs and waves FRICK off. ALFRED and VICKI heave simultaneous sighs of relief. He throws her a shamefaced look -- but she gives him a tiny nod of acknowledgement: you made the right play. SELINA (cont.) Besides -- I want this one for myself. So pretty...I'm going to give her a brand new face for Christmas. The PENGUIN throws a look at BRUCE, who's still out cold on the floor. He turns to FRICK and FRACK. PENGUIN Why don't you two tie up our host? ALFRED sits beside VICKI while SELINA wanders off to tour the premises. FRICK and FRACK, meanwhile, drag BRUCE into a back parlor which opens off the room they're in. INT. BACK PARLOR - THAT MOMENT They dump BRUCE face down on a sofa -- then rip the telephone cords from around the baseboard and use them to bind his hands and feet. INT. FRONT PARLOR - ON MR. BONIFACE Still holding his gun on VICKI and ALFRED, he wanders about the room, admiring the various furnishings and expensive objects. PENGUIN It's all so plush and tasteful, isn't it? Just the sort of setting in which I've always imagined myself. ALFRED, on the sofa, can't resist letting out a snort of disgust. PENGUIN (cont.) I see. You think I'm vulgar. You think I'm...nouveau. ALFRED I think you're a dirty little man with a -- The PENGUIN silences him by sweeping one arm across a tabletop, sending a bunch of PRICELESS CHINA FIGURINES crashing to the floor. He points to ALFRED as FRICK and FRACK reappear. PENGUIN See, boys, that's old money talking. After a while, they actually start to believe they've earned all this. (smirking) I don't mind. Someday I'll be old money too -- when the statute of limitations runs out. SELINA (O.S.) Hey! -- Guess what I just found. Face full of anticipation, he TURNS -- just in time to see SELINA returning from the kitchen with a big silver tray of... SELINA (cont.) Christmas cookies! The PENGUIN is crestfallen, but that doesn't stop him from cramming a handful of cookies down his gullet. SELINA graciously serves VICKI and ALFRED, who munch away with limited enthusiasm. PENGUIN Let's spread out and see what we can find. (to FRICK and FRACK) You two -- keep an eye on our friends here. Give me a yell the minute Wayne comes to. FRICK and FRACK post themselves at the doors to the front parlor as SELINA, the PENGUIN and the GOONS fan out through the house. CAMERA TRACKS WITH THEM as they move past BRUCE -- -- and in a quick CLOSEUP we see his EYES OPEN -- his hands STRUGGLING against his bonds. SERIES OF SHOTS QUICK GLIMPSES of the intruders enacting their depredations as they search for the entrance to the cave. SELINA and the PENGUIN are flinging open doors, moving clocks, looking for secret panels; as they go, they systematically TEAR THE HOUSE APART -- smashing BRUCE's possessions, ripping paintings out of frames, etc. Meanwhile, the TWO GOONS are outside prowling around the grounds, looking for an exterior entrance -- and back in the parlor, FRICK and FRACK are keeping their guns trained on ALFRED and VICKI. INT. WAYNE MANOR - CORRIDOR OFF KITCHEN - NIGHT CAMERA TRACKS down a long, empty hallway -- arriving at a LOCKED DOOR with curtained-off glass panels. Suddenly, an ELBOW smashes through the glass -- a hand reaches inside and fumbles for the lock -- INT. FRONT PARLOR - THAT MOMENT FRICK and FRACK start at the sound of a SECURITY ALARM blaring from the kitchen. VICKI looks at ALFRED... FRICK Better check it out. FRICK stays behind as FRACK rushes out into the entryway and down a long hall to the kitchen. He tosses a glance back at VICKI and ALFRED, then steps out into the entryway himself. FRICK (cont.) What is it? What's going on?? VICKI and ALFRED look into the back parlor. DICK GRAYSON has sneaked in behind the sofa -- and he's busy sawing away at BRUCE's bonds with a letter opener. Both of them stiffen simultaneously -- if FRICK steps back inside, he'll have a clear view of DICK and BRUCE. INT. KITCHEN - THAT MOMENT FRACK has opened a panel on the kitchen wall, revealing the SECURITY SYSTEM from which the alarm emanates. A RED LIGHT is blinking, indicating DICK's break-in. FRACK throws switches frantically, trying to kill the sound. Finally he succeeds -- and SHOUTS: FRACK Some kind of security system -- INT. BACK PARLOR - THAT MOMENT DICK's gotten BRUCE free -- but BRUCE, still under the effects of the drug, isn't much use. He tries to get off the sofa and crumples in a heap. DICK Can you move, man? BRUCE Library -- got to get me to the library -- DICK slings an arm around BRUCE and drags him to a door opening onto the hallway. They're just about to step outside when FRACK comes marching back on his way from the kitchen. INT. FRONT PARLOR - ON VICKI AND ALFRED -- faces wracked with utter, desperate tension as they watch the situation develop. INT. ENTRY HALL - THAT MOMENT FRICK and FRACK conferring, ignoring VICKI and ALFRED for the moment. By now the PENGUIN is waddling in from a hallway: PENGUIN What is that ungodly racket? FRACK A security alarm. It went off in the kitchen. PENGUIN My God! Is someone in here? He struts over to huddle with his cronies. BRUCE and DICK are still poised in the doorway. It looks bad... INT. FRONT PARLOR - THAT MOMENT ALFRED looks at BRUCE and DICK -- then at FRICK and FRACK bickering with the PENGUIN in the entryway. He pats VICKI's knee -- gestures for her to keep her seat -- -- and LUNGES at FRICK, making a play for his gun. A moment of confusion ensues -- giving DICK and BRUCE just enough time to dart out into the hallway, duck around a corner, and vanish -- -- but ALFRED is a frail old gent, and he can't keep it up for long; a blow to the face sends him sprawling to the floor. FRICK instinctively pulls the trigger and SHOOTS HIM at point- blank range. VICKI rushes into the hallway -- screaming, crying. INT. LIBRARY - THAT MOMENT The room's a mess, books all over the floor. The groggy BRUCE props himself up against his desk. He manages to pull the bottom drawer open -- gropes frantically for the secret switch. He's CRYING. BRUCE Alfred... DICK I'll go back. BRUCE I can't...get down there...without you. DICK turns. To his amazement, the sectional bookcase is swinging open -- revealing the secret passage to the BATCAVE. INT. ENTRY HALL/FRONT PARLOR - THAT MOMENT We will all be pleased to know that ALFRED has only suffered a superficial wound to the arm. VICKI is on her knees beside him; the PENGUIN is watching them with utter contempt. PENGUIN What an extraordinarily stupid thing to do. VICKI SHUT UP. Help me with him. The PENGUIN rolls his eyes and orders FRICK and FRACK to give VICKI a hand without him. They carry him into the parlor, lay him out on the sofa. VICKI reaches into her purse for a handkerchief and begins binding his wound as the PENGUIN pulls FRACK aside. PENGUIN You and I had better check the ground floor and see what's going on. Mr. Frick -- do you think you'll be able to manage this pair? FRICK Yes sir. PENGUIN Oh, good. That does relieve my mind -- He turns, glances into the back parlor, and sees a pile of CUT CORDS on the love seat. The blood drains out of his face. PENGUIN (cont.) Where's Wayne??? INT. BATCAVE - THAT MOMENT DICK has just entered another world -- and he's looking around him in pure, unalloyed amazement. BRUCE is fumbling with a packet on a spare UTILITY BELT; he shakes out a fistful of pills and swallows them dry. Then he goes to his bank of monitors and begins flipping switches. They blink on one by one; DICK moves up behind BRUCE and looks on, dazzled. INSERT - MONITOR The screen shows The PENGUIN in a sun room, shouting to his two armed GOONS through a pair of French doors. PENGUIN Check the grounds! The shape he's in, he can't have gotten far. BACK TO SCENE - ON BRUCE He turns to his main control panel, reaches for a switch, and waits. EXT. WAYNE MANOR - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT The two GOONS outside, with guns and flashlights, roaming cautiously around the grounds. They turn suddenly -- -- as CORRUGATED-STEEL SECURITY PANELS slam into place over every ground-floor door and window in Wayne Manor! INT. SUN ROOM - THAT MOMENT The PENGUIN sees the same thing happening, only from inside. He listens helplessly as his GOONS pound on the steel panels from outside. It's just occurred to him that he's trapped in here... INT. BATCAVE - A MOMENT LATER DICK is up on a catwalk leading back to the library of Wayne Manor. BRUCE shouts up to him from the control console down below. BRUCE -- as soon as he gets to the East wing. Wait for my signal. You know what to do. DICK nods yes and bolts off. INT. FRONT PARLOR - A MOMENT LATER VICKI and ALFRED are still sitting at gunpoint. With the commotion going on all around them, FRICK is getting itchy- fingered. Suddenly the STEREO begins blaring at top volwne -- "SANTA BRING MY BABY BACK TO ME." FRICK turns and stares at it in confusion -- goes over to fiddle with the controls -- -- and suddenly BRUCE'S VOICE is coming through the loudspeakers. BRUCE (O.S.; filter) VICKI! RUN! NOW! She's off the sofa like a shot, DIVING for the entry hall. FRICK turns and takes aim -- -- but before he can squeeze the trigger, DICK's come out of nowhere to HIGH-KICK him in the face! The shot goes wild and the two of them tumble into the Christmas tree, knocking it over... INT. ENTRY HALL - THAT MOMENT VICKI hits the floor of the entry hall. HUGE OAKEN SLIDING DOORS are already slamming shut behind her. The same thing is happening all down the hall -- the East wing of the house is sealing itself off! INT. FRONT PARLOR - THAT MOMENT DICK CARTWHEELS across the carpet -- catching FRICK high on the chest and RAMMING him backward, into the hearth. Before FRICK can regain his balance, DICK's BEANED HIM across the back of the skull with a fireplace poker. He bends and picks up FRICK's gun -- which he tosses to ALFRED, who's been watching all this with some fascination from the sofa. DICK Here. You might need it. ALFRED Thank you, Master Dick. And...bravo. INT. KITCHEN - THAT MOMENT VICKI has made it to the wall phone. She can't seem to get a dial tone -- VOICE FROM BEHIND Do you really think we're that stupid? VICKI turns, and realizes to her horror that the VOICE is SELINA's. SELINA (cont.) I tawt I taw a puddy tat...!! With that she raises a hand -- and her CLAWS pop out. VICKI turns, grabs a carving knife from a wooden block -- but before she can do anything with it, a WHIP cracks and wraps around her wrist, jerking the knife loose. SELINA tugs on the other end, reeling her closer. SELINA You know, I've got a great recipe for Sliced Bitch -- VICKI lunges forward suddenly, causing the whip to slacken and throwing SELINA off-balance into the center island. While they're tangled up, VICKI grabs a MEAT CLEAVER and tries to bring it down on SELINA, but SELINA rolls effortlessly out of the way and returns the favor, SWIPING at VICKI with her claws. VICKI brings a Calphalon skillet up just in time to block the blow: CLANG. VICKI sweeps her arm across the countertop, showering SELINA with knives and appliances. It buys her enough time to make for the door -- but SELINA comes flying after her. Another downswipe with the claws -- but VICKI shoves a BUTCHER'S BLOCK into SELINA's path, and her TALONS wedge a half-inch deep in the wood. VICKI rushes out while she's trying to pry herself loose. INT. DINING HALL - A MOMENT LATER SELINA enters but finds no trace of VICKI. SELINA I love a good old-fashioned catfight -- but this is pissing me off. VICKI charges out from behind a sideboard, pushing a WHEELED COCKTAIL CART before her. It SLAMS full-force into SELINA, who lands on her back on the great long dining table. VICKI is in the doorway to the entry hall by the time she gets up. INT. ENTRY HALL - STAIRWAY - A MOMENT LATER VICKI races up the stairs. She has a good lead, but SELINA makes up the difference in a hurry. She takes the stairway in three giant bounds -- reaches the landing just as VICKI ducks down the hall and into a bedroom, slamming the door behind her and LOCKING IT. SELINA HERE, kitty kitty kitty...HERE, kitty kitty... She KICKS THE DOOR OPEN. INT. BEDROOM - THAT MOMENT SELINA enters and strikes a coy pose as she shuts the door behind her. VICKI has opened a pair of French doors leading to a balcony, but it's too long a drop. She stands there paralyzed as SELINA advances. SELINA So this is where you earn your keep. She GRABS VICKI -- holds her out at arm's length and shoves her roughly back onto the bed. VICKI flails wildly as SELINA kneels atop her... SELINA's CLAWS shred VICKI's blouse, revealing a frilly section of bra -- SELINA Mmm! Frederick's of Gotham? She plants a talon against VICKI's sternum and RAKES IT DOWNWARD, drawing a RED STRIPE on the exposed flesh of VICKI's belly. Now VICKI just loses it. She begins to SHRIEK uncontrollably. SELINA Not so loud, honey! The neighbors'll get the wrong idea. (laughing) Santa's coming. Time for all good girls to go to sleep... She raises her claw-hand and prepares to slash down at VICKI's neck. But an instant before she can strike -- VICKI goes wide-eyed and shuts up. A BLACK SHADOW falls across the moonlit bed. SELINA tenses -- -- as a BLACK-GLOVED HAND grabs a fistful of her hair -- BATMAN Miss me, "Angel"? He yanks her bodily off the bed. Before she knows what's happening, he delivers a POWERHOUSE UPPERCUT. She flies into the door and knocks it cleanly off its hinges. INT. HALLWAY/STAIRCASE - A MOMENT LATER BATMAN steps out after SELINA, who's only now picking herself up. SELINA Okay -- let's do it, huh? You and me... all the way this time. She HISSES and jumps him. They grapple -- a quick flurry of fists -- and he knocks her ass-over-teakettle down the long stairway. She gets to her feet, limping, and darts around a corner. BATMAN marches implacably down the stairs, taking his time... INT. HALLWAY - A MOMENT LATER VICKI rushes out of the bedroom. She looks down the hall and sees FRACK flying out of the guest room, UPSIDE DOWN -- slamming into the wall opposite. He slumps to the carpet, out cold. A moment later DICK strolls out. VICKI rushes to his side -- VICKI Come on. We'll be safe in the cave. INT. DOWNSTAIRS HALLWAY/ARMORY - A MOMENT LATER BATMAN PAUSES outside the door to the armory, which is slightly ajar. He pushes it in cautiously... ...and a HALBERD smashes through the wood frame -- slicing down mere inches from his face. It's the PENGUIN wielding the ax; he backs off in seeming terror as BATMAN advances on him. But then -- -- SELINA springs down from a perch above the doors -- landing on his back -- and the two of them are going at it again. It's a room full of exotic weaponry, and most of it gets a good workout in the next thirty seconds. BATMAN dodges a LANCE -- which embeds itself into the wall behind him, QUIVERING -- and swings a MACE squarely into SELINA's ribs. It's a crippling blow; she flies backward, knocking over a suit of exotic armor -- which TOPPLES, knocking over another -- and another -- -- until the various suits of armor have all fallen over, domino-style -- the last of them landing squarely atop the cowering PENGUIN. SELINA is badly hurt now. She makes it out of a rear door to the armory. BATMAN pauses to check on the PENGUIN -- he seems to be out for the count -- and sets off in pursuit of SELINA. SEVERAL MOMENTS PASS before the groaning PENGUIN comes around enough to dig himself out. INT. HALLWAY - A MOMENT LATER As the PENGUIN stumbles around a corner, he peers into the LIBRARY. VICKI is crouched by BRUCE's desk, reaching into a bottom drawer. A hidden panel in the bookcase pops open... INT. LIBRARY - THAT MOMENT As she helps ALFRED into the secret passageway, VICKI turns to DICK: VICKI Come on. Come with us. DICK No. I can still help... INT. HALLWAY - A MOMENT LATER The PENGUIN flattens against the wall as DICK sprints out of the library and heads off in the opposite direction. There's a flabbergasted look on his face -- he recognizes this kid. WIPE TO: INT. BATCAVE - A MINUTE LATER At the monitor bank, watching BATMAN's pursuit of SELINA, are VICKI and ALFRED. They pivot suddenly at the sound of a VOICE: PENGUIN Such primitive entertainment. He's holding a gun on the two of them. He stares about delightedly, taking in the prehistoric splendor of the cave. His eyes light up at the sight of the BATMOBILE, parked on its little plateau. PENGUIN (cont.) So Bruce equals Batman. It seems I've discovered two treasures! (an evil smile) Don't move. I'd be only too happy to shoot you both. He pulls out his packet of photos and begins to scan the cave. He spots the distinctive ROCK FORMATION in an upper vault of the cavern. It's a couple of plateaus over; a long narrow CATWALK runs past it, some ten or twelve feet below. PENGUIN The Gotham City Treasury. It's about to be stolen twice. ALFRED Don't be absurd. You'll never be able to get it out of here. PENGUIN Oh, I'll manage somehow. You two are my guarantee of that. (nudging VICKI with the gun) Let's have a look, shall we? You go first. He shoves her. She starts across the catwalk, his gun at her head. INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - THAT MOMENT SELINA's made it back upstairs, but she's moving at quarter- speed, favoring one leg and clutching her ribs as she lopes down the hallway. She's just passed the balcony overlooking the entry hall when BATMAN appears dead ahead in her path. He's ready to rumble -- but instead of responding, she packs it in. She stops, slumps against a wall and begins to laugh. SELINA It could've been so nice -- you and me -- if only you weren't so screwed up. BATMAN It's over. I don't want to hurt you any more. SELINA Tell me something -- one thing. If you don't enjoy all this...why do you do it? He just looks at her. He doesn't have an especially good answer. She sighs. SELINA (cont.) I'll never understand men. She SPINS SUDDENLY, delivering a high-kick to BATMAN's throat. As he reels backward, into a wall, she leaps up onto the narrow BANNISTER RAILING some thirty feet above the entry hall floor and goes into a CROUCH -- preparing to SPRING at the enormous crystal CHANDELIER mounted to the ceiling -- -- but just as she launches off, BATMAN rolls -- and brings up a GUN from his belt. He fires a RAZOR-SHARP DISK which sails past her head, cleanly SLICING THROUGH the chain which suspends the chandelier. The chandelier FALLS just as CATWOMAN catches hold of it -- and she finds herself PLUMMETING to the floor of the entry hall. On impact, the chandelier EXPLODES into a thousand fragments; the CATWOMAN lands hard on her back and lies sprawled in the midst of the wreckage, unmoving. BATMAN advances slowly down the stairs. Her arms and legs jut out at unnatural angles; she lets out an eerie, whimpering YOWL OF PAIN -- a cri du chat. He stands over her; she glares up at him. BATMAN Nine lives. CATWOMAN I can't move. I can't move. Her face is cut and bleeding. She tries to lift an arm and can't quite manage it. He crouches down beside her, still cautious... CATWOMAN (cont.) DON'T LOOK AT ME!! (pleading) Do me, baby...do me now...that's what I want. Please? BATMAN looks up. DICK is standing on the balcony overlooking them, highly curious as to what he'll do. BATMAN No. BATMAN slowly rises to his feet. She lets out another gruesome WHINE. CATWOMAN COME ON. Don't stop now. FINISH ME OFF. (almost weeping with pain) Son of a bitch. You're all alike... Her STEEL CLAWS snick into place. With an agonizing effort she lifts her forearm -- bends her wrist. She's trying to slit her own throat. He reaches for his belt, extracts a GLASSINE CAPSULE, and breaks it open with his thumb. He drops it amid the shattered glass around her face. A tiny cloud of GREEN GAS plumes out, and her hand falls limply at her side as she lapses into unconsciousness. BATMAN stands over her for a minute as DICK marches down to join him. DICK You should've done it, man. You should've killed her. BATMAN gives him a long, hard look -- but says nothing. BATMAN There's a radio in the cave. We'll send for help. INT. BATCAVE - A MOMENT LATER The PENGUIN and VICKI are on a catwalk just below the ROCK FORMATION. A STONE OUTCROPPING extends toward the catwalk, and he forces her to JUMP FOR IT. Now he has to follow; the prospect makes him nervous, but it's a short hop, and he clears it okay -- finding his footing on the rocky slope. They're cautiously making their way up toward the ROCK FORMATION when BATMAN appears suddenly at the far end of the catwalk -- sizes up the situation and FREEZES IN HIS TRACKS. PENGUIN Ah, the illustrious Mr. Wayne. Look at you now. Whatever would your friends say? (smiling) You've been an exceptionally congenial host -- but I must ask you to back off. The PENGUIN grabs hold of VICKI and HOLDS HER CLOSE as they climb the last few feet toward the grotto. BATMAN swings his cape around, concealing his hands from view. He takes a cautious step backward. CLOSEUP - BATMAN'S HAND His free hand closes around a BATARANG -- flicks it open. ANGLE ON ROCKS - PENGUIN AND VICKI They've pulled almost even with the rock formation. A LARGE DANK GROTTO is visible through a small gap in the rocks. PENGUIN No sudden moves. It's a long way down. Gun at her head, he peers into the grotto... HIS POV - INSIDE THE GROTTO A VAST FORTUNE in GOLD and SILVER BULLION, undisturbed in all these years. GLINTING in the darkness. Hanging upside-down, above it, like silent guardians, are BATS -- DOZENS of them -- their tiny wet red eyes GLIMMERING at the PENGUIN... He dislodges a rock. It tumbles into the grotto... ...and a startled BAT comes screeching out of the gap in the rocks -- FLYING DIRECTLY AT HIS FACE. ANGLE ON ROCKS - PENGUIN AND VICKI He BACKS AWAY IN HORROR as the bat streaks past him. He FIRES HIS GUN wildly. The SOUND OF IT rouses MORE BATS, and they come flying out of the hole -- a VAST, CHITTERING SWARM. VICKI SHRIEKS; the PENGUIN STUMBLES -- and the two of them FALL BACK ONTO THE ROCKS, hanging on for dear life. BATMAN VICKI! An instant later BATMAN lets fly with the BATARANG. Clean hit; the PENGUIN staggers back, and his GUN skitters down across the rocks. With BATS screaming all around her, VICKI takes a deep breath and VAULTS toward the CATWALK. She's a foot short; she grabs hold of the railing and HANGS THERE, over the ABYSS, trying to pull herself up. BATMAN races toward her -- -- but the PENGUIN, clambering down across the rocky outcropping, has managed to grab hold of his GUN. The BATS have begun to swirl up toward the higher recesses of the cavern, and he's able to draw a clean bead on BATMAN. THUNDEROUS ECHOES reverberate through the cave as the first shot strikes BATMAN and knocks him backward. As the second spins him around. As the third sends him TOPPLING OVER THE RAILING. VICKI screams. BATMAN manages to grab the rail with one hand. Now two of them are hanging from the catwalk -- sitting ducks -- and the PENGUIN is determined to empty the clip. The ECHOES are cacophanous. ANCIENT STALACTITES drop from the vaulted roof of the cavern, PLUMMETING DOWNWARD like deadly projectiles, shattering agaist the cave floor. And then -- BATMAN pulls a tiny DEVICE from his utility belt and FLINGS IT. It lands in the rocks at the PENGUIN's feet. He stares down at it, and two beats later -- -- it begins to emit an EERIE ELECTRONIC WHINE. Within moments, EVERY BAT IN THE CAVE is in a FRENZY -- HOMING IN ON THE SIGNAL. The PENGUIN looks up sees them coming. A CHOKED WAIL emits from his throat as he drops the gun and stands there, PARALYZED. He's just been beaten at his own game. He lets out a last awful HOWL as HUNDREDS OF BATS ENGULF HIM -- -- and he PLUNGES DOWN INTO THE PIT -- his hideous scream dwindling to a faint echo, then vanishing altogether... BATMAN manages to drag himself up onto the catwalk. He rushes over to VICKI, pulls her up, drapes his cape around her protectively. Gradually, as the BATS recede to their distant perches, he stands and helps VICKI to her feet. They embrace on the edge of the abyss. On the far plateau, DICK has hooked up with ALFRED. The butler is slumped against a lab table, weary and exhausted, clutching his wounded arm. DICK slings an arm around him and helps him to the stairway. CUT TO: EXT. WAYNE MANOR - NIGHT SQUAD CARS everywhere. FRICK and FRACK emerge in handcuffs, flanked by COPS. PARAMEDICS carry the still-unconscious SELINA past on a stretcher and load her into the back of an ambulance. INT. WAYNE MANOR - ENTRY HALL - NIGHT The place is an utter mess. Amid the carnage we find BRUCE conferring with COMMISSIONER GORDON and LT. BULLOCK. In b.g., a POLICE DOCTOR is dressing ALFRED's gunshot wound. GORDON ...and then Batman showed up? BRUCE He saved all our lives, Jim. I can't say for sure, but I'd bet she's the one behind the murders. GORDON God -- I pray you're right. (beat) One thing before we go, Bruce. Who's the kid? BRUCE looks into the front parlor, where VICKI and DICK are righting the fallen Christmas tree. BRUCE Oh, that's Vicki's little cousin. He's in town for the holidays. GORDON Well, he picked a hell of a time to visit. (turning to go) Merry Christmas, Bruce. Good luck cleaning this place up. GORDON and BULLOCK file out, followed by the POLICE DOCTOR. BRUCE smiles wearily to himself and strolls into the front parlor. INT. FRONT PARLOR - NIGHT ALFRED loads 'SILENT NIGHT' on the CD. VICKI ambles up to BRUCE: VICKI What are you going to do with all that gold? BRUCE I dunno. Might be a good start on a place to live -- for some people who don't have one. She hugs him. DICK plugs in the Christmas-tree lights; they blink to life just as the GRANDFATHER CLOCK strikes twelve. VICKI It's Christmas. BRUCE Yeah. Maybe you should -- open your present. She runs a hand along his cheek and laughs softly. VICKI Oh, Bruce, presents doesn't matter. None of it matters. We're all safe. We're together. BRUCE ...You might as well. He digs around in his jacket pocket and produces a tiny GIFT BOX, which he hands to VICKI. She unwraps it, opens it slowly -- and sees a DIAMOND RING inside. She gazes up at him, speechless. He gazes back. CAMERA PULLS UP and away until we can see the whole of the devastated room, and all the people in it -- VICKI, falling into BRUCE's arms; DICK, off to one side, watching them; ALFRED, tossing broken furniture into a roaring fireplace. And on the image of this decidedly eccentric family unit, we FADE OUT. THE END
THE BIG WHITE

      FADE IN:

      EXT. ROAD - WINTER DAY

      A police car, nothing more than a speck on the landscape, is intermittently
      visible through the blowing snow.

      INT. POLICE CAR - SAME

      A CORPORAL (20s), behind the wheel, with a bored DETECTIVE BOYLE (60s)
      at his side.

                                  CORPORAL
              So his hand is like, off, right.  So he puts on a
              tourniquet, puts the hand in his pocket, walks five
              miles through the bush til he gets to the highway,
              where he passes out, on the road, right.  Then this
              logging truck comes along...

                                  DETECTIVE BOYLE
                        (looking ahead)
              Hey.

      The Corporal looks forward.

      CAR'S POV: Through the windshield of a WOMAN (40s), dressed in her
      pajamas and a parka, skipping down the middle of the road.

      EXT. ROAD

      The police car pulls to a stop, just as the woman does a pirouette and falls
      over backwards.

      Detective Boyle and the other Cop get out and walk over.

                                  CORPORAL
                        (into his radio)
              Dispatch, this is unit 611, we need a first
              responsder --

                                  DETECTIVE BOYLE
              Cancel that.

      The Woman kicks up a leg, wiggles her foot.

                                  DETECTIVE BOYLE (cont'd)
              I know where she belongs.

      As they lift her up...

1     INT. INSIDE A TRASH DUMPSTER - LATE AFTERNOON                                  1

      The dumpster lid opens on a bitterly cold, gray winter's day in an Alaskan city.  A
      chunky, shivering HAIR STYLIST with jet black bangs shakes out a box of
      conditioning samples.

                                  HAIR STYLIST
                        (to someone O.S.)
              She says "I haven't eaten all day," then, right there on
              the bus she pulls out this, like, salmon steak and
              I'm...

2     INT. INSIDE A TRASH DUMPSTER - LATE AFTERNOON                                  2

      The dumpster lid BANGS shut, reopens a beat later. A moment of calm until
      two garbage bags SLAM against the inside of the lid. It falls shut with a CLANG.

3     EXT. TRASH DUMPSTER - NIGHT                                                    3

      The lid reopens. Night time now, as a street lamp BUZZES to life. A middle
      aged MAN in work clothes checks to make sure he's alone. He gently lowers
      the lid, opens it again a moment later, this time balancing a mini-bar fridge on
      his shoulder.  He dumps the appliance into the bin and runs off.

4     INT. INSIDE A TRASH DUMPSTER - NIGHT                                           4

      The lid reopens.  SIRENS off in the distance...

                                  MEN'S VOICES (O.S.)
              One, two, three... up.

      The lifeless body of a fair-sized man comes CRASHING into the garbage.
      SIRENS closer.  A man seen only in silhouette leans in to pull some garbage
      over the corpse.  A second man looks in, then pulls the first man away.

                                  MAN'S VOICE
              We'll get him later.  C'mon.

      The lid drops.

5     EXT. TRASH DUMPSTER - MORNING                                                  5

      Black.  The dumpster reopens. Morning now. A Korean-American  TEENAGER
      wearing an apron and headphones sings along to an  old KISS tune as he
      deposits two large orange garbage bags.

                                  TEENAGER
              "...Get up, everybody's gonna move their feet, get
              down, everybody's gonna leave their seat...gonna
              lose your mind in..."

      He shuts the lid with care.  Black.

6     EXT. CITY STREET - DAY                                                         6

      A cookie-cutter subdivision.  Old pine trees poke through the snow cover that
      blankets the neighborhood.  HOWARD (30s), a burly outdoors type, is trying to
      unload a new snowmobile from the back of his pickup.  TED WATTERS (late
      20s) half hidden under a heavy dress coat, walks down the street. He stops by
      Howard's driveway.

                                  TED
              Need a hand?

                                  HOWARD
                        (turning)
              Yeah.  Could ya grab me those two by eights?

      Ted walks up the driveway, grabs the wood slats, makes a ramp by leaning
      them against the rear bumper.

                                  HOWARD (cont'd)
              Thanks.

      Howard maneuvers the snowmobile down the ramp, his back turned toward
      Ted -- who has taken out a small cam-corder and is taping Howard.

                                  HOWARD (cont'd)
              I tell ya, it may look fast but it sure ain't light.  You the
              guy who just moved in to the Stevens old house?

                                  TED
              No.  Name's Ted.

                                  HOWARD
              Hey Ted, I'm Howard.

                                  TED
              Hey Howard.  What is that, an Arctic Cat? What do
              those go for?

7     P.O.V. CAMCORDER VIEW FINDER                                                   7

      Howard finally has the snowmobile on the ground.  He's breathing heavy as he
      pulls off his mitt to shake hands.

                                  HOWARD
              More than I could normally afford, I'll tell ya.
                        (seeing the camera)
              Hey!  What do you think you're you doing?

      As Ted and Howard continue to talk, we PULL BACK to reveal we are watching
      Ted's video playing on a VCR that is --

8     INT. INSURANCE OFFICE / COMMON AREA - DAY                                      8

      A group of office WORKERS look on, very much impressed, as a stunned
      Howard stares at the camera.

                                  TED (O.S.)
              Howard, you seem like a reasonable kind of guy.
              Lets you and me talk.

      TIGHT ON: WATTERS at his nearby cubicle, typing frenetically on his computer.

      At first, he appears to be working, until we realize that on his computer screen
      pixilated Zombies die in silent anguish beneath an unholy hail of bullets.  A
      Miami Dolphins sticker is the sole cubicle decoration.

      As the tape finishes, a smattering of APPLAUSE from his colleagues.  Ted
      gives a small wave over the cubicle wall.

                                  TED (cont'd)
              Thank you.  Just happy to give something back to

                        (to himself - bitter)
              After all they've done for me.

9     INT. INSURANCE OFFICE / COMMON AREA - DAY                                      9

      CAM (30s), Native-American Alaskan walks over. Ted immediately hits a key
      that turns the screen to a spread-sheet.

                                  CAM
              That was really cool.  It was like... watching "Cops".

                                  TED
              He was pretty spry for a man with a herniated disc.

                                  CAM
              You know, I don't want to bitch or anything, but you
              were supposed to take me along on that one.

                                  TED
              Couldn't find you.

                                  CAM
              I know you know this, but the sooner they think I can
              handle calls on my own, the sooner they'll kick you
              back down south.

                                  TED
              I've been hearing that for 13 months and six days,
              Cam.  After a while, it gets a little old.
                        (off Cam's look)
              Next time, okay.

      Good enough.  Cam moves off.  Back to the zombie blood bath.  The phone
      RINGS.  Ted picks up, his eyes never wavering from the gore intensive
      computer game.

                                  TED (cont'd)
              Claims, Ted Watters.  Sure.

      A final key stroke separates one last zombie from its entrails.

10    INT. INSURANCE OFFICE / BRANCH'S OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER                       10

      TIGHT ON: A MOUNTED SALMON

      We PULL BACK to see the walls lined with souvenirs of a life spent on the
      edge of the wilderness; citations from the Rotarians, pictures of sponsored
      hockey teams... We are --

      FRANK BRANCH (50s), a mid-level management type sits across from PAUL
      BARNELL (40s), a mild-mannered everyman wrapped in a cheap suit.  Paul
      takes in the display.  The two men sit in silence, smiling politely at one another.

                                  PAUL
              That's... quite the fish.

      Branch is about to answer when Ted enters with a slim file.

                                  BRANCH
              Paul Barnell, Ted Watters.

      Handshakes.  Paul makes steady eye contact.  Ted notices.

                                  BRANCH (cont'd)
              Mr. Barnell wants to talk to us about his brother's life
              insurance policy.

      Ted sits and flips open the file.

                                  TED
              Raymond, isn't it?

                                  PAUL
              Yes, Raymond.  You see, as I've already explained to
              Mr. Branch, he's been gone for five years now, and I
              thought it might be time to... move on.

                                  TED
              By move on you mean...?

                                  BRANCH
              ...cash in Raymond's policy.

      Ted smiles to himself.

                                  PAUL
              I just thought, well, it's pretty unlikely he's still alive.
              My Dad always wanted us to be able to look after
              each other if anything should ever happen.  And to
              be frank, money's a little --

                                  TED
              I understand Mr. Barnell, but here's the thing. With no
              actual body, under Alaskan statutes a person must
              be missing for seven years before he or she can be
              legally declared dead and that's not withstanding an
              investigation period where concerned parties can
              take up to another year to file interventions
              concerning the motion.  So, even though your
              brother's status is undetermined at this point, there's
              really very little we can do for you.

      Ted flips the file shut.  Case closed.  Branch, not entirely happy with Ted's
      demeanor, forces a smile.

                                  BRANCH
              Of course we are extremely sorry for your loss.

      Branch looks at Ted.  Ted turns to Paul.

                                  TED
              Oh, absolutely.

11    EXT.  STRIP MALL - NIGHT                                                      11

      The city skyline rises in the distance as heat vents belch steam against the
      rapidly setting sun.  But that's miles away.  Here on the outskirts is a rapidly
      failing five store strip mall; a "Porn-a-copia" XXX Video store, hair stylist,
      small engine repair shop, fish and chips joint and the "Barnell Great Escapes" 
      travel agency.  We might notice a big trash dumpster in the corner.  Paul's car,
      a Ford Taurus, pulls onto the parking pad.

12    INT. PAUL'S CAR - CONTINUOUS                                                  12

      Paul driving, talking on his cell phone and balancing a big non-spill metallic
      travel coffee mug at the same time.

                                  PAUL
              Hang on, hang on.  First off, how did you get my cell
              number?  (Beat)  Because it's for mechanical and
              medical emergencies only.

      Paul, wound up, taps his brakes too hard.  His mug falls, the lid pops and the
      coffee proceeds to soak a stack of papers.

                                  PAUL (cont'd)
              Great.
                        (back into phone)
              No, I'm not...  I just... give me a second here.

      Paul parks his car, gathers the soggy papers and gets out.

13    EXT. STRIP MALL                                                               13

      Paul, still on the phone, carries the papers to the dumpster.

                                  PAUL
              Yes, and that check went out a week ago.  I watched
              my secretary write it up.

14    EXT. INSIDE THE DUMPSTER                                                      14

      Black.  Paul opens the lid.  The phone is cradled in his neck, he checks each
      soggy page to make sure he's not tossing anything important.

                                  PAUL
              Well I don't know.  I, I, I have no clue.  Could it
              possibly be a problem on your end?  So the electric
              company never makes a...  Look, I pay my bills.  I'm a
              Rotarian for goodness --

      Paul looks over to see some MEN from Rodney's Repo Ranch walking up to
      the front door of his office.  Distracted for a moment, the phone slips and falls
      into the trash.

      Paul, muttering, leans in to get it.  He pushes aside an orange garbage bag,
      guided by the faint sound of the other person STILL TALKING. And then--

      PAUL'S POV: of THE BODY-- a 40-ish White (well, a little blue) male dressed in
      a cheap suit.  Paul's phone lies across the corpse's mouth, like the dead guy is
      talking.

                                  THE CELL PHONE
              Mr. Barnell?  Mr. Barnell?

15    EXT. PARKING AREA / STRIP MALL                                                15

      A SHOUT as Paul jumps back from the dumpster. The lid CRASHES down as
      he scrambles/slides away.  He takes a moment to compose himself, then
      realizes his phone is still in there.

      He opens the dumpster lid and very quickly reaches in, grabs his cell and
      hurries off.  The lid CRASHES shut.

                                  PAUL
                        (into the phone)
              Hello?

      Hung up.  Paul dials 911, looks back at the dumpster, thinks for a second, then
      hits END.  He stands there, thinking.

A15   INT. "BARNELL GREAT ESCAPES TRAVEL" - LATER                                  A15

      Paul back in his office, staring out the window with a perfect view of the
      dumpster.  He can't take his eyes off it.

      Behind him, the Repo-Men are picking up a newish computer monitor and
      walking toward the door.  He's oblivious.

      At the sound of a TRUCK, his head snaps around.  It's a garbage truck, but
      instead of heading to the dumpster, it rumbles past on the road.  That's all it
      takes.

B15   EXT. PARKING AREA / STRIP MALL - MOMENTS LATER                               B15

      Paul backs his Ford Taurus up to the dumpster, pops the trunk, checks to
      make sure he's alone then steps up on the rear bumper, opens the lid and
      clambers inside.

16    INT. INSIDE A FRIDGE - LATER                                                  16

      Black.  The fridge door opens, the light revealing several cans of pop and beer
      in the foreground.  Behind the

      beverages, a garage where Paul struggles with the lifeless body.  He props the
      man against the hood of his car, gives him a quick once over, pockets, obvious
      wounds.  Nothing.

      Paul moves to the fridge, starts to pull things out.

17    INT. ATTACHED SUBURBAN GARAGE - CONTINUOUS                                    17

      Jodie, an annoyingly small dog, enters the garage from the house and starts
      sniffing around the body.  A new chew toy!

                                  PAUL
                        (at the sound)
              Jodie, no!  Not for dogs!

      He SHOOS the dog back into the house.  Paul moves back to the fridge, opens
      the door and, with great effort picks up the dead man and tries to stuff him
      inside.  Only problem...

      The man's legs don't want to fit.  Paul leans down and grabs an uncooperative
      appendage.  He grits his teeth, looks away as he kicks at the knee.  It SNAPS
      sideways.

      Paul fights nausea.  But with the leg now out of joint, the man fits.  Paul,
      breathing heavy, leans against the door.

                                  PAUL (cont'd)
              OK then.  OK.

      He packs in the remaining space with beer and pop bottles.  Then, just before
      he shuts the door, Paul reaches in and sets the fridge temperature from 1 to 9
      (the coldest setting).

      A padlock and chain come from the base of a propane BBQ.  It goes around the
      fridge, the lock SNAPS it in place.  Paul spots some leftover drink cans.  He
      kicks them to the corner and walks into the house, trying to sound casual.

                                  PAUL (cont'd)
              Hey Honey.  Any mail?

18    EXT. CITY ROADWAY - EVENING                                                   18

      Ted drives home through a wooded section of town.

A18   INT. TED'S CAR - CONTINUOUS                                                  A18

      Ted checks out various radio stations, hating everything.  He lands on one
      playing "Escape (The piña Colada Song)" when he looks up and suddenly
      jams on the brakes.

B18   EXT. ROADWAY                                                                 B18

      Ted car slides toward a moose that has wandered into the middle of the road.
      The car stops about five feet away.

      The moose looks at Ted.  Ted looks back, wondering what he ever did to
      deserve the life he's stuck with.  After a moment, the moose lumbers off.  Ted
      drives on.

                                                                               CUT TO:

C18   INT TED'S APARTMENT - NIGHT                                                  C18

      TIGHT ON: A COMPUTER SCREEN where swirling signs of the Zodiac act as a
      screen saver.  PULL BACK TO REVEAL we are --

      A telephone cord runs from the computer to the headset of TIFFANY (20s), pert,
      smart and dressed in a tight University of Alaska T-shirt.  Tiffany sits with her
      feet up on the desk as she flips through a copy of "Cosmo".

      It's a medium sized apartment, littered with guy stuff although bowing to
      advancing signs of feminine influence.

      The phone RINGS.  Tiffany hits the space bar.  The caller's number flashes on
      screen.  By the second ring, an electronic timer kicks in and a complete file on
      the caller appears with name, address, background, pets...  She smiles, hits
      "enter."

                                  TIFFANY
                        (into her headset)
              Psychic Pals.  How are you today... Mr. Williams?
                        (pause - she listens)
              Well, we are all registered psychics here.  I just had
              a feeling you'd be calling.  What's up?

      A KEY IN THE DOOR.  A tired Ted walks inside.

                                  TED
              Hey Tiff.

      Tiffany looks up, then holds up a file folder with the words "WORKING -
      SHHHHHH!" in big black letters.

                                  TIFFANY
                        (to caller)
              Your TV remote control?  Okay.

      Ted SIGHS, gives her a quick peck on the cheek as he wrestles off his winter
      gear and heads to the kitchen.

                                  TIFFANY (cont'd)
              I need you to clear your mind...

      Ted looks into the fridge, making up new words to the song "Escape."

                                  TED
              "If you like frozen enchiladas, getting caught in the
              rain.  If you're not into...something brownish."

      Ted pulls out some Tupperware, tries to figure out what's in it.  Tiffany, still
      wearing her headset, appears behind him, grabs a Diet Coke from the fridge
      and kisses him on the cheek.

                                  TIFFANY
              It's stew.  I'm not sure it's still good.

                                  TED
              Aren't you with a customer?

                                  TIFFANY
              They're concentrating.

      Ted grabs a fork, takes the pot and sits at the table.  Tiffany goes back to her
      desk and flips through her magazine.

                                  TED
                        (through a mouthful of food)
              So?  How's the tea leaf business today?

                                  TIFFANY
              I've decided from now on to ignore you when you're
              ignorant about my work.  And it's going very well
              thank you.
                        (reconnecting to the caller)
              Mr. Williams, I'm seeing sofa cushions.  Do you have
              a sofa?  Good.  Glad I could help.

                                  TED
              You here from that software distributor guy?

                                  TIFFANY
              No, but I did crack that code problem.  You know how
              sometimes when you're running Beta versions you --

                                  TED
              English, please.

                                  TIFFANY
              There was a boo-boo, but I fixed it.
                        (another call comes in)
              Psychic Pals, how are you today, Carol?  Now I
              thought we'd agreed God is everywhere, but not
              specifically in your coffee pot.

                                  TED
              Jeez, Tiff.

                                  TIFFANY
              Jeez, Ted.  Do I tell you how to do your job?

                                  TED
                        (kidding... kind of)
              No, but then again I'm not a computer aided pseudo
              psychic, so if you're looking for moral equivalence...

                                  TIFFANY
              Before you say anything else that may keep us from
              having sex ever again, let me ask you something...

      She picks up her magazine.

                                  TED
              Tiff, please.  I always get these wrong.

                                  TIFFANY
              That's why we keep trying.  Now, Love is Sacrifice
              test.
                        (reading)
              If you were in a life raft with me and there was only
              enough water --

              Don't you have a customer?

                                  TIFFANY
                        (to the caller)
              Carol?  God says he's busy with a famine right now,
              but you should keep praying.  Cool.

      She hangs up.  Turns back to Ted, about to pick up where she left off...

                                  TED
              No.  I'm not doing it.

                                  TIFFANY
              It's just a stupid quiz.

                                  TED
              Exactly.

      The PHONE RINGS.  Tiffany bolts to her desk, sits, spins in her chair as she
      answers the call.

                                  TIFFANY
              Psychic Pals.  Is this the first time you've called us
              Mrs...?

      Tiffany at her computer, enters the name "Margaret Barnell" into her database.
      Tiffany works a "mute" button as she points back to the magazine.

                                  TIFFANY (cont'd)
              But stupid quizzes can be illustrative of potential
              relationship problems.
                        (to her caller)
              Margaret, I'm getting the feeling this is an anxious
              day for you.

      Ted, cooking pot in hand, walks over to her desk.

                                  TED
              Our only relationship problem is you're running a
              $1.99 a minute carny scam out of my living room.

                                  TIFFANY
              Don't call it a scam.
                        (to the caller - startled)
              Excuse me?

                                  TED
              What?

                                  TIFFANY
              You've got to learn to channel that rage, Margaret.
                        (to Ted - playful)
              You didn't just call this your living room, did you?

                                  TED
              I meant ours.  Ours, ours, ours.

      Tiffany returns to her call, but keeps looking at Ted.

                                  TIFFANY
              I feel someone you really care about, maybe even
              the love of your life, is being a real pain.  Now I need
              you to concentrate...

      Ted pretends to do just that, drawing a giggle from Tiffany before he walks off.

22    INT. "BARNELL GREAT ESCAPES TRAVEL" - MORNING                                 22

      Paul tries to open the front door, but finds it blocked by a small pile of snow.
      Three good yanks and it finally opens. He enters the shop.

      Faded travel posters cover the walls.  AVIS (40s), a career office gal, smiles at
      her boss as she assembles a life-size stand-up cardboard display for Aloha
      Airlines.  It features a

      dark Hawaiian beauty holding a softball sized sea shell.  The shell juts out of
      the display giving it a 3-D quality.

                                  AVIS
              Morning Mr. Barnell.  Coffee?

                                  PAUL
              Thanks Avis.  Looks good.

      Paul, shivering, hangs up his coat as Avis picks up a promotional Aloha Air
      surfboard (the old display) and walks it to the back.

                                  PAUL (cont'd)
              Was November this bad last year?

                                  AVIS (O.S.)
              Well if we didn't have the weather what would we talk
              about?  Did you send the computer back?

      Paul moves to his desk.

                                  PAUL
              Yeah, it was not working.  Any calls?

                                  AVIS (O.S.)
              Just that fellow from Municipal Power and Electric.  I
              told him you sent the check in weeks ago, but some
              people don't like to listen.

      Paul turns to look at the snow covered empty parking lot, then at a photo of his
      wife Margaret on his desk.  He mentally gathers himself.

                                  PAUL
              Something... strange happened last night Avis.

                                  AVIS (O.S.)
              What was that?

                                  PAUL
              Did... you ever meet my brother Raymond?

                                  AVIS (O.S.)
              The one who went missing?

                                  PAUL
              Uh huh.  Well anyway last night there's a knock on
              the door and there's Raymond, just... standing there
              on the doorstep.

      Avis arrives with the coffee and the mail.

                                  AVIS
              Didn't you have him declared...?

                                  PAUL
              Dead?  No.  I mean, they said he hadn't been gone
              long enough.

                                  AVIS
                        (smiling warmly)
              Good thing in hindsight.

      Paul puts the mail down on the desk and start to flip through it.  Lots of bills,
      most marked past due.  He finds a "pre- approved" credit card application, sets
      it to one side.

                                  AVIS (cont'd)
              So where was he all these years?

                                  PAUL
              Lower 48.  Said he wanted to get away from the cold.

                                  AVIS
              Where 'bouts?

                                  PAUL
                        (looking up)
              Sorry, what was that?

                                  AVIS
              Where was he living?

      Paul, a flash of panic, looks over at the Hawaii display.  He keys on the shell.

                                  PAUL
              Florida.

                                  AVIS
              I've got an aunt down there.  Where 'bouts?

                                  PAUL
                        (blanking)
              A uh... small place.  By the beach.

                                  AVIS
              Well that's great.  You and Mrs. Barnell will have
              some company for a bit I guess.  How is she?

                                  PAUL
              Better, a little better.  Some days are better than
              others.

23    INT. BARNELL HOME - DAY                                                       23

      MARGARET BARNELL (early 40s) stands in a plush bathrobe and slippers.
      Despite her casual attire she is immaculately made up as she walks to the
      front door, opening it on -- a young wholesome PAPERBOY smiling through the
      cold.

                                  PAPERBOY
              Collecting, Mrs. Barnell.

                                  MARGARET
              Daniel, you pussy little cocksucker.  I'll get my purse.

      The paperboy, unfazed, smiles as Margaret walks off.

                                  PAPERBOY
              It's 12 dollars.  I missed you last time.

                                  MARGARET (O.S.)
              Jerk off... OK, jerk off, uhhuh...

      Margaret gives the paperboy his money, the stamp card plus a dollar tip, then
      tweaks his nose.  Twice.

                                  MARGARET (cont'd)
              You say hi to your slut Mom for me?

                                  PAPERBOY
              Sure will.  Thanks.

      He trots down the walk as Margaret shuts the door.

24    EXT. INSIDE A TRASH DUMPSTER - NIGHT                                          24

      The lid opens.  GARY and JIMBO (30s), check to insure they're not being
      watched.  Gary, slightly effeminate, leans into the bin and BURROWS through
      the garbage.  Jimbo, a bear of man, keeps watch.  He's nervous, a little out of
      sorts.

                                  GARY
              I thought stuff didn't smell when it was frozen?  I
              don't know why we have to--

                                  JIMBO
              Dave wants visual confirmation, he gets visual
              confirmation.  We have a chance to move up here,
              so let's just--

                                  GARY
              Like the guy's not gonna end up in a land- fill,
              anyway.  You ever ask Dave what he did?

                                  JIMBO
              Whatever it was, he told him if he did it again, he'd
              snap his neck.

                                  GARY
                        (smiling)
              Whoops, he did it again.
                        (off Jimbo not getting it)
              The song?  From that girl?

      No response.  Gary, HUMMING now, keeps digging, finding nothing.

                                  GARY (cont'd)
              So how'd it feel?  I mean, not when you did it, but,
              like now?

                                  JIMBO
              I don't want to talk about it.

      Gary hops inside as his actions become more frantic.  Still no luck.  He stands.

                                  GARY
              Not here.

      Jimbo glares at his partner.

                                  GARY (cont'd)
              Serious.  He's gone.  Maybe he wasn't...

                                  JIMBO
              Don't even joke.  Maybe the trash was emptied.

                                  GARY
              Looks pretty full.  Hey...
                        (ducking down)
              There's a little fridge down here.
                        (standing)
              If we would have shot him at least we'd know for
              sure.

                                  JIMBO
              I was following orders.  And if you hadn't started a
              screaming match, no one would have called the
              cops and we wouldn't have had to dump his --

                                  GARY
              Fine.  Sorry.

                                  JIMBO
              Fine.

                                  GARY
              I'm just saying... maybe you didn't break it all the way.

                                  JIMBO
                        (walking away)
              It was broken.

                                  GARY
              I'm just saying... maybe it was like hypothermia and
              he just looked dead.

                                  JIMBO
              It - was - BROKEN!

      Gary, embarrassed, digs in the trash with his feet.

25    INT. GARAGE - CONTINUOUS                                                      25 

      Margaret, still in her bathrobe, walks to the fridge.  As she puts her hand on the
      latch, she notices the pile of pop cans on the floor.

      She tugs on the door.  It opens just a crack before the chain stops it.  The
      frozen head peeks through the slight gap.

      Margaret SIGHS, tries to push the fridge door closed, but the body is in the way.
      She gives the door a hip check.  The door latches shut while something frozen
      and brittle inside CRACKS.  Margaret, oblivious, walks away.

26    INT. KITCHEN OVEN                                                             26

      A chicken sits in a pan, the rest of the room visible behind it through the oven
      door window.

                                  MARGARET (O.S.)
              Paul?  Why is the fridge in the garage chained shut?

                                  PAUL
              How's my Angel tonight?

                                  MARGARET
              Blow me.  Dinner's almost ready.  You feel like some
              wine?  I feel like some wine.

      Paul walks to the oven, opens the door and pats the chicken.  Stone cold.

                                  PAUL
              Sweetie, here's a crazy thought... I don't feel like
              chicken tonight, why don't we order in?

                                  MARGARET
              Fuck it, okay.

                                  PAUL
              There's actually something we need to talk about.
              It's about Raymond.  He's back.

      Paul smiles bravely as he shuts the oven door.  Behind the chicken, Margaret
      doesn't look happy as Paul starts to explain.  She rushes from the room.

27/28 TIGHT ON: TV SCREEN                                                        27/28

      Home video of RAYMOND (then early 30s), fat, physically imposing and the only
      person not in festive tropical gear, standing in a VFW hall decorated in a
      Caribbean theme. (He is definitely not the same person Paul has cooling in the
      fridge.)  A large banner behind him proclaims "HAPPY 10TH ANNIVERSARY -
      BON VOYAGE."

                                  RAYMOND
                        (a little drunk)
              Okay, I never thought it would last this long, but
              seeing as how it has... There ya go.  Let me just say
              that my brother, old "Puddles McBarnesy" did better
              than he should have.

      A younger, somewhat tipsy Paul comes into frame, puts an arm around his
      brother and smiles.

                                  PAUL
              What'cha saying there Raymond?  Wha'cha saying
              'bout me?

      Raymond shakes his brother's arm off his shoulder.

                                  RAYMOND
              Enough, OK?

                                  PAUL
                        (sing-songy)
              Ray's a little jeallllllllous.  This is the one that got
              away, right Ray?

      The crowd LAUGHS as Paul reaches over and musses up his brother's hair.
      Raymond, furious, grabs his brother by the lapels and throws him roughly to
      the floor.  The laughter stops.

                                  MARGARET (O.S.)
              Leave him alone, ball licker!

                                  RAYMOND
              And shut that thing --

      The screen turns to snow.  We are...

      Paul at his desk, watching the video on a small TV in the wall unit.  He turns his
      attention to a large cardboard box filled with documents, souvenirs, old report
      cards...

      On the TV playing behind him (the second part of the tape), Margaret is pictured
      on a cruise ship, sunning herself.  Paul, obviously behind the camera, watches
      as Margaret takes a tropical drink from a WAITER'S tray, who promptly dumps it
      all over her.  But instead of the expected burst of profanity, Margaret just
      LAUGHS.

                                  MARGARET
              That's okay, don't worry about it.
                        (as the waiter walks off)
              I'd like the next one in a cup, please.

      Paul puts aside a faded hotel postcard from Hawaii and digs out an insurance
      policy out of the box.  On the last page is a list of the payouts.  Loss of a limb:
      $100,000.  Loss of thumb: $5,000. Accidental death: $1,000,000.

      And, as an extra bonus, Raymond's birth certificate.  Perfect. Paul takes out the
      credit card application from work, and starts to write...

                                  PAUL
                        (to himself)
              Raymond... Barnell.

29    EXT. TOBOGGANING HILL - LATE AFTERNOON                                        29

      LAUGHING children on toboggans, inner tubes and discarded cardboard
      boxes slide down a snow covered hill against a slate gray sky.  It's an isolated
      area on the outskirts of the city.

30    INT. GARY AND JIMBO'S CAR - CONTINUOUS                                        30

      Gary and Jimbo sit in their car in the parking area.

                                  JIMBO
              Which one's your sister's kid?

                                  GARY
              See the one on the little bike-thing?  Him.

                                  JIMBO
                        (hesitant)
              You been alright with this?

                                  GARY
              The thing with the guy?  Ya know, I thought it might
              kinda mess me up...

                                  JIMBO
              First time for both of us.

                                  GARY
              ...but I've been sleeping really well.

                                  JIMBO
              Yeah.  'Course, you didn't actually...

      Jimbo mimics snapping someone's neck.  It's clearly not a gesture he enjoys.
      As Gary looks at him, a Cadillac pulls up beside them.  Behind the wheel is
      DAVE (50s) well dressed, in a thuggish kinda way.  Jimbo and Gary share a
      nervous look.

31    EXT. TOP OF THE HILL - CONTINUOUS                                             31

      About 50 yards away from the two cars, Gary's NEPHEW is having his
      Snowrider (a tricycle with skis instead of wheels) hijacked by a playground
      BULLY in a red parka.  A tug o' war for the toy ensues as Gary and Jimbo get
      out of their car.

                                  NEPHEW
              Leggo... it's mine.  Uncle Gary!

32    EXT. PARKING AREA                                                             32

      Gary and Jimbo are leaning close to the Cadillac's open window. Dave does
      not look happy.

                                  DAVE
                        (to Jimbo)
              Wait a minute.  He's disappeared?

      Gary waves to his nephew.

                                  GARY
                        (shouting)
              You just... hang in there, Billy!

                                  JIMBO
              Yeah.  But he's dead.  I mean, that part, no question.

                                  DAVE
              Yeah?  Take off your coat.  And your shirt, too.


      Jimbo knows better than to argue.  He strips down, exposing his corpulent
      middle-aged belly to the chilly winter winds.

                                  JIMBO
              I'm not wearing a wire, Dave, if that's what this is
              about.

                                  GARY
              It was our first time.  No one gets it perfect their first
              time.

                                  DAVE
              You too, Sweetie.

      Gary is about to comply when the sound of a FIGHT on the tobogganing hill
      causes them all to look over, just in time to see GARY'S NEPHEW shoved to
      ground.  The Bully LAUGHS as he slides away.

                                  GARY
              Excuse me for a second.

      Gary trots toward the hill.  Jimbo can't believe it.

                                  JIMBO
              Gary!  We're in the middle of something.

                                  GARY
                        (calling back)
              Hey, I'm supposed to be looking after him.

      Jimbo turns back to Dave, shrugging sheepishly.

                                  DAVE
              Is he...?

                                  JIMBO
              He's fine.  Look, we can take you there right now.
              We'll show you.

      Behind them on the hill, Gary tries to retrieve his nephew's Snowrider from the
      Bully.  He is failing.

                                  DAVE
              Show me what?  An empty trash dumpster?  It was
              supposed to look like an accident.  I was hoping to
              see it in the paper.  So help me, if this guy pops up
              somewhere...

      While Jimbo does his best to stay warm, behind him on the hill, Gary can only
      watch as the Bully slides away.

                                  BULLY
                        (echoing in the cold)
              Fag!  Big homo!

                                  JIMBO
              He won't.  He can't.  He's --

                                  DAVE
              Proof, Jimbo.  I like to know my money's well spent.
              You got a week.

      Dave drives off as Gary walks over with his SNIFFLING nephew.

                                  GARY
              Slippery little sucker.  You mind if we stop at a toy
              store on the way back?

A 33  INT. BARNELL HOME / BEDROOM - NIGHT                                         A 33

      HIGH ANGLE ON:  Paul and Margaret in bed.  Margaret takes up more than her
      share of the bed, her arm tossed over her husband.  Paul, on his third of the
      bed, looks as if he's lying in state. But Paul's not sleeping.

34    EXT.  BARNELL HOME - MORNING                                                  34

      A newspaper clears the "For Sale - price reduced!" sign on the front lawn and
      lands with a THUD on the steps.

35    INT.  GARAGE - CONTINUOUS                                                     35

      Paul has the "Morning News" on the hood of his car.  He looks over at the
      fridge, still padlocked.

                                  PAUL
                        (to himself)
              Let's see if anyone's missing you.

      He flips through each section.  There's nothing.  Paul walks to the fridge.

                                  PAUL (cont'd)
                        (to the corpse)
              I don't know what kind of man let's himself just
              freeze to death in the trash, but I was never one to
              preach.  Way I see it, you've probably got family
              somewhere and they'd probably appreciate seeing
              you get a decent funeral, even if it's not really... yours.

      Paul, somewhat befuddled, gently pats the fridge door.

      Margaret pushes the vacuum across the floor, humming to herself.  Paul walks
      by slipping into his coat.  He notices that the vacuum isn't plugged in.  Without
      missing a beat, he walks over and plugs it into the outlet.  The VACUUM
      ROARS TO LIFE.  Margaret doesn't flinch.  Paul heads out the door.

      A ways out in the forest.  Only two houses on this turn-out; a cozy looking lived
      in cabin sits up the road from a seemingly deserted rundown mobile home.  A
      car pulls up.

A40   INT. PAUL'S CAR - CONTINUOUS                                                 A40

      Paul adjusts a pillow he has taped to his stomach, then pulls on a blue ski
      mask.

41    EXT. BARNELL MOBILE HOME - MOMENTS LATER                                      41

      Paul undoes the bungee cord and drags his snowblower out of the trunk.  He
      fires up the snowblower and starts to plow the drive way of both houses.

      MRS. WHERRY (80s), in her bathrobe, looks out the window of the cozy cabin.
      A tad confused, she waves to the man in the blue parka.  The blue parka waves
      back.

42    INT.  PAUL'S KITCHEN - NIGHT                                                  42

      Paul walks in from the garage, pulling off his blue parka.  Margaret enters from
      the living room.  (Paul still has the pillow taped to his front, which Margaret
      happily pokes with a finger but never mentions.)

                                  MARGARET
                        (nervous)
              He's not here, is he?

                                  PAUL
              Sweetie, don't you worry about Raymond.

                                  MARGARET
              When he's around, it just brings back... Fuck.

                                  PAUL
              I know.  He, he said he's probably gonna head back
              down South soon.

      Margaret smiles, relieved.  The phone RINGS.  Paul picks up.

43    INT. MRS. WHERRY'S HOME - CONTINUOUS                                          43

      Mrs. Wherry talks on the phone in her kitchen.  The head of a large antelope is
      mounted on the wall behind her.

                                  MRS. WHERRY
              Paul?  Thank you so much for clearing the drive way.
              That was most considerate.

                                  PAUL
              I'm afraid I don't understand Mrs. Wherry.

                                  MRS. WHERRY
              You were out at the cabin this morning.  Nice to see
              you getting some use out of that thing.

      Paul shakes off his boots.

                                  PAUL
              Oh I see.  No, you see that must have been
              Raymond.  (beat) Very much so.  No, no one was
              more surprised than we were. (beat)  No, he's...
              indisposed right now, but I'm sure you'll see him
              again.  He's going to stay at the cabin for a while
              until he... leaves.  And bless you too.

      A "Moose Xing" sign is briefly illuminated by Paul's car's headlights as it heads
      up a snow packed mountain road.  The distant lights of the city are swallowed
      by the thick forests of fir trees that line the road.

48    INT. PAUL'S CAR - CONTINUOUS                                                  48

      Paul, nervous, sings along to "Escape" on the radio.

                                  PAUL
              "...It was my own lovely lady, and she said, oh it's

      The corpse, now in Raymond's clothing and the blue parka, lies face up on the
      Aloha Airlines promotional surfboard being lurched forward by Paul, who wears
      a pair of snowshoes.  On the body's chest lies a second pair of snowshoes.
      Somewhere, a WOLF HOWLS.

      Paul at the top of a 25 foot drop.  He rolls the corpse, now wearing the other set
      of snowshoes, over the side.  It BOUNCES down, landing in the snow with a
      soft WHUMPH!

      Paul sits in a seeming stupor at the kitchen table.  A DING from the microwave
      snaps him out of his catatonic state.  He walks to the appliance, takes out his
      now re-heated coffee, checks his watch and heads out.

      Paul, wearing snowshoes and carrying the surfboard, peeks over the edge.

      PAUL'S POV: down at the corpse, exactly as it was last night.

                                  PAUL
              Well come on!  How much easier do I have to make
              this?

      His words echo in the cold wilderness.

      Jodie the dog is in a complete frenzy, jumping up and down at the feet of Paul
      who stands over a SIZZLING frying pan full of bacon.  He checks the bacon's
      consistency with a fork.  Still pretty raw.  He takes the bacon and lays it on a
      plate.

      Beside the pan on the counter sit a baseball cap and a stapler.  Paul carefully
      takes each strip of bacon and staples it to the peak of the ball cap.  He holds it
      up.  The bacon hangs down like fringe.

      Margaret appears in the doorway.

                                  MARGARET
              Paul?

              Holy-- Margaret, you scared the wits out of me.

      Margaret lifts up Jodie, who's desperately trying to get at the hat.

                                  MARGARET
              She just wants that bacon.

                                  PAUL
              Such a little puppy.  How late is "Rudys" open?

55    EXT. SHOPPING CENTER / RUDYS MARKET  - LATE AFTERNOON                         55

      A large sign outside advertises "Fresh Moose Meat". Paul runs out with a
      shopping bag, jumps in his car and drives off.

      Paul, carrying the shopping bag, he painfully picks his way down the rock face
      toward the corpse.

                                  PAUL
                        (really bad British accent)
              You may want to take a gander.  You may want to
              take a gander...

      THE BACON HAT -- as Paul pulls it snug on the corpse's head.  He pulls the
      bloody steaks from the shopping bag and starts to smear them on the corpse's
      parka.  Drops of blood hit the snow at the body's feet and disappear.

      Paul drapes the steaks on the body, tucking one under an arm, the other
      hanging from a pocket. He pauses for moment, then pulls out a container of
      lard and, fighting his own revulsion, smears it across the dead man's face.

                                  PAUL
              Sorry about this part.

      Paul pats the body on the shoulder, then looks up at the ridge and the long
      journey ahead.

      Snowmobiles SCREAM to the site as people tramp through the thick snow,
      covering all of Paul's hard work.  An ambulance and State Conservation
      vehicles pack the area where Paul first pulled off.  Yellow police tape is strung
      between fir trees marking a path toward the ridge.

      The corpse is covered with a tarp.  The area is littered with blood, animal tracks
      and bits of blue parka.  POLICE OFFICERS and tough looking LOCAL
      SNOWMOBILERS mill about the corpse, taking turns lifting the tarp that covers
      the body.  A few yards away, DETECTIVE BOYLE (60s) talks to a seemingly
      distraught Paul.

                                  DETECTIVE BOYLE
                        (looking at the ridge)
              If it's any comfort to you, he likely wasn't eaten while
              conscious.  Did he say where he'd been living,
              before he came home?

                                  PAUL
              Florida.  He didn't really talk about it much.  He
              brought us this shell.

      Paul holds up a sea shell, obviously from the display at his office.  Tears well
      up in his eyes.

                                  PAUL (cont'd)
              It's really all we have left.  He'd been gone for five
              years.  We'd given him up--

                                  DETECTIVE BOYLE
              --for dead, yes sir.

                                  PAUL
              How did you...?

                                  DETECTIVE BOYLE
              Anonymous phone tip from some Jamaican guy.
                        (Paul shows no reaction)
              Said he saw what looked like a body.  We tracked
              you through his ID.

                                  PAUL
              Just like on TV.

      Boyle nods sympathetically

                                  PAUL (cont'd)
              I've got to see him.  Please.

      Paul starts to make his way to the body.  Boyle stops him.

                                  DETECTIVE BOYLE
              Mr. Barnell,  I should warn you, an animal  attack isn't
              pretty.  There's not much left.

      Paul nods.  They make their way over to the tarp.  Boyle pulls it back.

                                  DETECTIVE BOYLE (cont'd)
              Is that your brother, sir?

      Paul leans in-- the man's face is hamburger.  Paul nods.

                                  PAUL
              They chewed his ears off.  What kind of animal does
              something like that?

                                  DETECTIVE BOYLE
              Normally I'd say bear, but these tracks and the
              feeding pattern indicate wolf.  It's rare, but it can
              happen.

      Boyle pulls the cover back over the body. Boyle hands Barnell a clear baggie
      with the dead man's wallet inside.

                                  DETECTIVE BOYLE (cont'd)
              Your brother's personal effects.  We've got some
              people with the victim's assistance program who
              can help you through this.  Marcie?

      Marcie, a female police officer, walks a distraught Paul away.  As they go,
      another FEMALE COP approaches.

                                  FEMALE COP
              Coroner found some smaller bite marks on the
              ankle.

                                  DETECTIVE BOYLE
              Pups.  Must have been the whole freakin' pack.

                                  FEMALE COP
              You want an autopsy?

                                  DETECTIVE BOYLE
              On what?

                                  FEMALE COP
              Derek found this.

      She holds up a clear evidence bag with the remnants of a strip of bacon on the
      inside.

                                  DETECTIVE BOYLE
              Not the smartest snack for a hiker.

                                  FEMALE COP
              Messy animals aren't they?

                                  DETECTIVE BOYLE
              Messy.  Messy messy messy messy.

61    INT. INFLATABLE GOLF DOME - LATE AFTERNOON                                    61

      The second level of a large indoor driving range/mini golf course.  The sound of
      clubs SMACKING golf balls echo as an intense Ted "waggles" before his shot.
      On his back-swing, Tiffany throws her arms around him from behind.

                                  TED
              I take it you're done?

                                  TIFFANY
              Yup.

                                  TED
              Wanna hit some of mine?

                                  TIFFANY
                        (hugging him harder)
              Nope.

      He turns, LAUGHING.  They kiss as she playfully starts to grope him.

                                  TED
              Now this is definitely a violation of Golf Dome policy.

                                  TIFFANY
              Must be all this talk about using your wood.

                                  TED
              Woods.  So maybe later I can... check your grip?

                                  TIFFANY
              Secret?

                                  TED
              My dirty talk sucks?

                                  TIFFANY
              I like it when you try, though.

      Tiffany gives him a peck and flits back to a nearby chair.  He hits one, skying it
      into a low hanging light.

                                  TED
              You know in some states they actually do this
              outside?

      Tiffany looks over at one of the tacky tropically-theme'd mini-golf holes.

                                  TIFFANY
              So how many insurance companies are there in the
              United States?  Like, a billion.

                                  TED
              That's not the point, Tiff.  I've busted my ass for
              Liberty Capital.  I don't want to quit.  I deserve to be
              promoted out of this ice bound backwater.

                                  TIFFANY
              And when it happens, I guess I'll just be another
              notch on your briefcase.

                                  TED
              I can't believe you said that.  You know you are...

      He looks around.  Embarrassed, he lowers his voice.

                                  TED (cont'd)
              ...the most important thing in my life.

                                  TIFFANY
                        (smiling/shouting)
              Sorry, what was that!  You want to take me right
              here?

      As other GOLFERS look over, Tiffany and Ted share a warm smile, the moment
      only broken by the ringing of a CELL PHONE.  She SIGHS, unzips Ted's gym
      bag and answers his phone.

                                  TIFFANY (cont'd)
              Psychic... Uhm, sorry, hello?  Yeah.  Look, is this a
              matter of life and death, because right now he's...

      Suddenly concerned, she hands the phone to Ted.

                                  TED
              Hello? (beat)  You're kidding me.
                        (almost stunned)
              Yeah, I'll hold.

                                  TIFFANY
              Your Mom?

                                  TED
              Million dollar life policy just checked.

                                  TIFFANY
              On a Saturday?  What about the first annual golf, sex
              and pizza triathlon?

                                  TED
              Look, if this is... who I think it is, I may have found us
              a ticket out of here.

                                  TIFFANY
              We don't need a ticket.

      Tiffany stands, knowing it's no use arguing, she pulls on her coat.  Ted tries to
      give her a hug.  She falls into his embrace, but doesn't hug him back.

                                  TIFFANY (cont'd)
              Don't be late, OK?

                                  TED

      CORPSE'S POV:  Black.  The drawer is pulled open.  We are...

62    INT. CITY MORGUE (BODY TRAY)                                                  62

      Ted, Cam and Detective Boyle stand at the end near the feet.  A white sheet
      covers most of the deceased.

                                  DETECTIVE BOYLE
              That's him.  Raymond Barnell.

                                  TED
              Could you?

      Boyle moves toward the head and pulls back the covering.  Ted recoils.  Cam
      leans in for a closer look.

                                  CAM
              Ouch.  That's gotta hurt.

                                  TED
              So what's your line on this?

                                  DETECTIVE BOYLE
              Just what it looks like.  Wolves got him. Maybe a
              grizzly with insomnia, but we didn't find any tracks.

                                  TED
              Would it surprise you to learn his brother tried to
              cash in his policy two weeks ago?

                                  DETECTIVE BOYLE
              You trying to tell me Mr. Barnell chewed off his
              brother's leg?

                                  TED
              Doesn't that make you the least bit suspicious?

                                  DETECTIVE BOYLE
              Mr. Watters, this is a nice simple ending.  We like
              nice simple endings.

                                  TED
              But shouldn't you--

                                  DETECTIVE BOYLE
              Ya know, I don't know thing one about insurance, but
              I'm guessing it's your job
              to find a way not to pay these poor people.

                                  CAM
              Hey now, we're just like you guys, gotta run down
              whatever leads we can find.

      Ted walks down to the head of the victim, pulls out a camcorder and starts to
      tape the body.

                                  TED
              Detective, we're an insurance company, not the
              Salvation Army.

                                  DETECTIVE BOYLE
              Mind telling me what you're doing?

                                  CAM
              They gave every claims team a video camera last
              quarter... you'd be amazed at how it cuts down on
              litigation.  We had this case two months ago where
              this mother of six was claiming...

                                  DETECTIVE BOYLE
              I've got my own war stories, thanks.  You mind
              stopping that?

                                  TED
              Just doing --

                                  DETECTIVE BOYLE
              Your job?  Yes, I caught that.

      As Ted gets his last shot, Boyle covers the body back up and slides the drawer
      shut with a loud CLANG.  Black.

63    EXT. PAUL'S HOUSE - SUNSET                                                    63

      TV NEWS CAMERA POV: Of Paul, standing on his stoop, as he's interviewed by
      a well made-up female TV REPORTER (20s) dressed for the cold.

                                  TV REPORTER
              You ready Mr. Barnell?

                                  PAUL
              Yes.

      The camera man flicks on his light as Paul squints.

                                  TV REPORTER
              The police told us what happened, how are you folks
              holding up?

                                  MARGARET (O.S.)
              Paul?  Who's out there?

      Paul reaches back, and, as discretely as possible, grabs the door handle to
      keep Margaret from opening it.

                                  PAUL
              Obviously, my wife's very upset...

                                  MARGARET (O.S.)
              Paul, the door's stuck!

      Margaret starts to HAMMER rhythmically on the door.

                                  PAUL
                        (ignoring her)
              It's been a tough, you know, when something like
              this happens you just have to ask yourself...

                                  MARGARET (O.S.)
              Who fucked with the fucking door!

                                  PAUL
              You can see how stressful it's been, I should really
              go now.  We have to plan a service.

      And with that, Paul opens his front door and ducks inside, quickly shutting it
      behind him.

      Branch, very unhappy, flips through some papers then looks up at Ted and
      Cam.

                                  TED
              This isn't a standard case.  You were there when
              this guy came in looking to cash in.  C'mon, it stinks.

                                  BRANCH
              Secondly, if the police say this guy was...

                                  CAM
              Eaten by wolves.  Sir.

                                  BRANCH
                        (incredulous)
              Eaten by wolves, then we've got no case.  Did you
              see Mr. Barnell on the news last
              night?  Last thing we need is bad P.R.  I don't want
              this thing Valdeez-ing on us.

                                  TED
              Mr. Branch, I'm sure head office would take a rather
              dim view of our --

                                  BRANCH
              Corporate's view will be whatever I tell them.

      Cam, seeing his partner is about to get himself into a heap of trouble, hustles
      him toward the door.

                                  CAM
              Yes Sir.  Color us called off, as of now.

                                  TED
              Stop looking at me right now.

              Look, I'm gonna start on the Johnasen file.  You want
              to do up the paper work on Barnell?

      Ted grabs his coat.

              Where ya going?

      Ted sits across the desk from Paul.  As per usual, the place is a tomb.

                                  TED
              The police say they found Raymond's wallet, that's
              how they tracked you down?

                                  PAUL
              That's right, yes.

                                  TED
              Any idea what he was doing out there?

                                  PAUL
              He'd go for walks.  Hikes, I mean.  Hiking.

                                  TED
              How sporty.  Was he a big hiker?

                                  PAUL
              Not sure I follow.

                                  TED
              Did he hike more than once a week?  Or was this a...
              one time thing?

                                  PAUL
              Can I ask why you need to know all this?

                                  TED
              Just trying to tie up a few loose ends.

                                  PAUL
              You know the police... they say Raymond died in the
              attack.  You do cover that sort of thing don't you?

                                  TED
                        (forced smile)
              Yes sir.  It shouldn't take more than a few days.
              Now, tell me a little more about your brother.  The
              hiker.

67    EXT. STRIP MALL PARKING LOT - MOMENTS LATER                                   67

      Gary and Jimbo's car parked in the lot.  Gary is just returning to the vehicle with
      a brown paper bag.  Jimbo has the look of man who hasn't slept in days.

      Gary and Jimbo are eating fish and chips.  The name on the bag is "Ye' Olde
      Fish Shoppe."

                                  JIMBO
              Cod or Halibut?

                                  GARY
              Didn't ask.

                                  JIMBO
                        (digging in)
              So we got six different stores here. We got your
              "Great Escapes" travel agency, your Ye Old Fish and
              Chips place, Porn-a-Copia videos, a hair place, one
              for lease and one... what is that?

                                  GARY
              Small engine repair.  See all the snow blowers out
              front.

      There is indeed a row of snowblowers lined up outside.  Jimbo takes another
      bite of his fish.

                                  GARY (cont'd)
              Should move the blowers over to the triple X store.

      Gary LAUGHS.  Jimbo is in no mood.

                                  JIMBO
              So, which one you figure would want to take our
              friend?

                                  GARY
              I guess maybe the porn palace.  Ya know for some
              weird sex film.

                                  JIMBO
              Yeah, this place is just a hotbed of adult cinema
              production.  Fish shop look clean?

                                  GARY
              Very nice Korean family.  You figure maybe they
              battered him up?

      Gary LAUGHS again, then shoves Jimbo's shoulder.

                                  GARY (cont'd)
              Maybe we're eatin' him right now.  Huh?

                                  JIMBO
              Gary, this isn't a joke.  You ever known Dave to joke?

      Gary, embarrassed, takes another bite of his fish.  Jimbo turns up the radio.  A
      local call-in show comes on.

                                  WOMAN CALLER (O.S.)
              ...it could never happen.  There's never been a
              documented case--

                                  GARY
              Sorry.

                                  JIMBO
              Yeah, "Sorry."  I get strip searched and you go off
              playing snow angels...

                                  RADIO HOST (O.S.)
              Well, we've got one now, don't we!?

                                  WOMAN CALLER (O.S.)
              That was different. From what I read in the paper he
              was unconscious. And now people are going to use
              this as an excuse to--

                                  RADIO HOST (O.S.)
              Hey lady, why don't you tell Raymond Barnell how
              wolves have gotten a bad rap.

                                  WOMAN CALLER (O.S.)
              I can tell you from years of experience that wolves do
              not operate--

                                  JIMBO
              Wait a minute.

                                  RADIO HOST (O.S.)
              You can tell me all you want, lady, but it is an
              undeniable, indisputable fact.  This Barnell guy got
              turned into a Scooby Snack by a pack of wild
              animals...

      JIM'S POV: Through the windshield, looking at the sign for "Barnell Great
      Escapes Travel."  Jimbo and Gary look at each other. Maybe...

68    INT. INSURANCE OFFICE - DAY                                                   68

      Ted at his cubicle on his phone.

                                  TED
              Yeah, hi, it's Ted Watters from Fidelity Mutual. (beat)
              I need a complete credit work up on a Raymond
              Barnell... and Paul, a Paul Barnell too... sure, I'll hold.

      Cam walks by, leans his head over the top of the cubicle.

                                  CAM
              You start the month ends yet?

                                  TED
              Can you take care of it?  I'm kinda... working on
              something.

                                  CAM
              Oh God, you're not still on the Barnell thing are you--

      Ted pulls Cam down into his cubicle, talks in a harsh whisper.

                                  TED
              I went to see him.

                                  CAM
              And?  Then?  So?

                                  TED
              Trust me. Something's not right.  I can smell it.  Help
              me buy a week.

                                  CAM
              We're gonna get in such trouble.

                                  TED
              I promise from now on you can come along on
              everything.

                                  CAM
              No more Cam goes to the coffee room and Ted
              disappears for three hours?

                                  TED
              I'll try.

                                  CAM
              And you'll work on your interpersonal skills?

                                  TED
                        (a long beat)
              Yes.

                                  CAM
              Good.  Now if you'll excuse me, I'll go start covering
              your ass.

69    INT. BARNELL HOME / STUDY - EVENING                                           69

      Paul sits beside his desk, flipping through travel brochures. Margaret enters,
      teetering in the doorway.  Paul looks up.

                                  PAUL
              Hey.  How's my Princess?

                                  MARGARET
              OK.  I took some Adavan.  And called my psychic.

                                  PAUL
                        (picks up the phone bill)
              Honey, you know how expensive that is.  I thought we
              agreed that...

      She moves to him, runs her hand through his hair.

                                  MARGARET
              Don't be mad.  It's just... this week has been so...
              well with Raymond getting eaten by animals and
              someone trying to steal the fridge.

                                  PAUL
              I know.  Why don't you --

                                  MARGARET
              We got another letter from the HMO today.

                                  PAUL
              Have you opened it yet?

      Margaret starts to CRY, holding the letter up to her face the SOBS building to a
      full blown breakdown.

                                  PAUL (cont'd)
              Oh hey honey, come on now.

                                  MARGARET
              I'm sorry.  It's just, fucking cocksuckers.

      Paul takes the letter, unfolds it and reads...

                                  PAUL
              "As we have stated previously... usual onset before
              the age of 18... coupled with no genetic history..."

                                  MARGARET
              I'm sick!  I'm really, really sick!

                                  PAUL
              Shush, now.  (reading again) "We hasten to add,
              Tourette Syndrome is not..."

                                  MARGARET
              Fuck them.

      Paul is about to say something, but returns to the letter.

                                  PAUL
              "As well, please reference our previous decisions
              regarding your claims for ADD, ODO, OCD,
              ADHOPHI...
                        (treading lightly)
              Honey.  I know you don't like to talk about it, but
              maybe it's not... what we might think it is but... maybe
              it's just stress?  Remember that cruise?  I saw you.
              You were happy.

      Margaret looks at him, crestfallen.

                                  PAUL (cont'd)
              I'm sorry.  I'm just really tired.

                                  MARGARET
              They say you can't get it all of a sudden but I did.  I
              really, really did.

                                  PAUL
              I know.  They just don't --

                                  MARGARET
              I'll kill myself.  Then they'll see.

                                  PAUL
              That is nonsense talk.

                                  MARGARET
              Then you can go off and...
                        (sobbing again)
              ...marry someone normal.

                                  PAUL
              You're the most normal girl I know.

                                  MARGARET
              I'm not crazy, Paul.  Something's really wrong with
              me.

      He takes her to a small sofa, cradles her in his arms.

                                  PAUL
              I know, Sweetie.  I know.  And we're gonna find you
              the best specialists in...
                        (a second, then confident)
              ...what you have that we can.

                                  MARGARET
              Promise?

                                  PAUL
              I really think things are going to turn around.  Call me
              cr... I just have a feeling.  You just leave everything to
              me, OK?  Is that OK?  Leave everything to me?  I
              promise.

                                  MARGARET
                        (gently)
              Shit bag.

                                  PAUL
              That's my girl.
 
                                                                               CUT TO:

      TIGHT ON : TV SCREEN

70/71 INT. TED'S APARTMENT - NIGHT                                               70/71

      Where Edward G. Robinson (as the character Keyes in "Double Indemnity")
      grills a man about a fake insurance claim.

                                  EDWARD G. ROBINSON
              "Every time one of these phonies comes along it ties
              knots in my stomach... I can't eat.  That's how I knew
              your claim was crooked..."

      At the sound of DOORBELL, the whole scene freezes.  We are --

      Tiffany at her desk, working on the computer.  Ted has paused the DVD, puts
      down the Barnell file and opens the door on a snow covered PIZZA GUY, soggy
      pizza box in hand.

                                  TED
              Hey.

                                  PIZZA GUY
              Hi there.  That'll be $12.97.

      Ted looks at his watch.

                                  TED
              What about thirty minutes or free?

                                  PIZZA GUY
              Doesn't apply when it's snowing.

                                  TED
                        (digging out his wallet)
              So nine months of the year your guarantee is
              worthless?

                                  PIZZA GUY
              It doesn't snow every day.

                                  TED
              They should really tell people when they order.

                                  TIFFANY
              Would you just give him the money already?

                                  PIZZA GUY
              It's not my decision.

                                  TED
              I know that.  I'm just saying.

                                  PIZZA GUY
              Sure.

                                  TED
              You understand though?

                                  PIZZA GUY
              Absolutely.

                                  TED
              It wouldn't take much.

                                  PIZZA GUY
              Full disclosure to the pizza consumer. I'll be sure to
              pass that along.

      The delivery guy leaves.

      Ted walks back into the living room.  Tiffany comes over, grabs a slice.

                                  TIFFANY
              Why you gotta argue with the service industry?

                                  TED
              The problem with people today is they don't expect
              anyone to tell the truth.
              We've just come to accept lying as acceptable.

              Want to know what's "with" me?  I'm on the verge of
              cracking the biggest case of my career, one that
              corporate has to notice, and nobody gives a crap.
              Not my boss, and not even my girlfriend.

              So this is my fault?

                                  TED
              No, it's not your fault. I just want to live somewhere
              where road hazards don't have antlers and the pizza
              doesn't have to be delivered by dogsled.

      Tiffany storms off as Ted flops onto the couch, swipes the snow from the top of
      the pizza box and hits play on the DVD.

      Tiffany turns from the bedroom door, almost in tears.

72    INT. MRS. WHERRY'S HOUSE / LIVING ROOM - DAY                                  72

      Ted and Mrs. Wherry sit on plastic covered furniture.  The mounted heads of
      several dozen dead animals, foxes, wolves, elk, surround them.  Ted takes
      notes.

                                  MRS. WHERRY
              It was terrible.  Just terrible. Raymond should have
              known better.

                                  TED
              I'm fine.  Did you talk to Raymond at all when he
              came home?  Was he getting along with his
              brother?

                                  MRS. WHERRY
              No.  Only saw him the once.  Never spoke.  Waved to
              him.

                                  TED
              Waved?

                                  MRS. WHERRY
              He was clearing my driveway.  Raymond was a real
              hellcat when he was younger.  But like they say, time
              mellows even the hardest soul.

              I thought it was Paul at first.  Have you met Paul's
              wife?  Now there's a story.  Not that I'm much for
              gossip, but I think Raymond used to have a --

              Mrs. Wherry, I'm sorry, but --

                                  MRS. WHERRY
              Sorry.  Did Raymond like the outdoors.  Not so
              much, no.  Liked living out here at the cabin, though.
              I think he had some friends on the police force.
              Have you talked to them?  They'd pull up here day
              and night, always looking for --

                                  TED
              I'm sorry, did you say you thought it was Paul who
              did your driveway?

                                  MRS. WHERRY
              Well in a ski mask you can hardly tell who's who.
              Now, how 'bout some jerky?  I've got it drying out
              back.

      Ted at his cubicle, thinking hard as he chews on some jerky as he works the
      phone.  Snow whips by outside the window.

      Ted sees Cam reflected in his dark computer screen.  Annoyed, he puts his
      hand over the receiver.

              Turns out our Mr. Barnell is mortgaged to the nuts.
              His business is about one step
              away from chapter 11.  Plus it's like his brother
              Raymond never existed.  He's got no credit history,
              no nothing for the last five years.

                                  CAM
              Ya know, not having a credit history isn't actually a
              crime.  People around here have been known to
              swap a snow mobile for 500 pounds of venison.

                                  TED
              Yes, but he was in Florida, someplace.  Plus, the
              only thing he did after his recent "reappearance" was
              get some new ID and a new credit card.  Didn't
              charge anything.

                                  CAM
              Wow.  Less than nothing.

                                  TED
              It's something.

                                  CAM
              No it's not... in my humble, junior investigator's
              opinion.

      The phone RINGS.  Ted picks up.

                                  TED
              Watters, claims.  Yeah, hang on...
                        (to Cam)
              It's personal.  I promise.

      Cam shrugs, walks off.  Ted waits 'til he's gone...

                                  TED (cont'd)
              Mr. Barnell... Your ears must have been burning, I

      Ted is scribbling down something on a pad of paper.

74    EXT. GRAVEYARD - DAY (FULL ON BLIZZARD)                                       74

      Tombstones, barely visible through the blowing snow, dot the top of a small hill
      on the outskirts of town.  A small group of mourners try to keep warm.  Paul and
      Margaret, Avis, two other FRIENDS and the MINISTER huddle against the cold.

                                  MINISTER
              When someone is taken from us at such a young
              age we often ask ourselves, why?  What possible
              purpose could this serve?

      The Minister is temporarily lost from view.

                                  MINISTER (cont'd)
                        (just a voice in the white)
              Why is God, who is a loving God, capable of such
              things...

      The snow clears.  Paul, a pillar of strength, discreetly checks his watch then
      sneaks a concerned look at Margaret who busily grins at everyone in sight.
      Ted's car pulls into the parking area.

75    INT. JIMBO'S CAR / GRAVEYARD PARKING LOT - CONTINUOUS                         75

      Gary and Jimbo sit in their vehicle, watching as Ted gets out of his car and is
      swallowed in a white out.  He reappears a moment later farther up the hill.

                                  GARY
              We should have checked the funeral
              announcements right away.

                                  JIMBO
              Shoot.

76    EXT. GRAVEYARD                                                                76

      A wind GUST rocks the casket just as it's lowered into the frozen earth.  The
      funeral breaks up quickly as Paul and his wife shake hands with the minister.

                                  PAUL
              That was lovely, thank you so much.

                                  MINISTER
              Margaret, Paul, you two get some sleep.

      Paul looks nervously at Margaret, who is about to reply.  As her mouth
      engages, a gust of wind obliterates most of her words, except for...

                                  MARGARET
              ...nun banger.

      The Minister smiles, he must have misunderstood.

                                  MINISTER
              Absolutely.

      Paul turns to see Ted approaching.  A blast of snow obscures his view.  When
      Ted reappears, he's just a few steps away.

                                  TED
              Mr. Barnell.  There was no hurry on this, we could
              wait until--

                                  PAUL
              It's OK.  We just wrapped up.  This is my wife,
              Margaret.

      As they shake hands, and Margaret opens her mouth to speak...

                                  PAUL (cont'd)
              Why don't you wait in the car, sweetheart?

                                  MARGARET
              Okee dokee, smokee.

      Margaret smiles and totters off.

                                  PAUL
              She's under a little strain right now.

      Ted looks down the hill at a small group of TV news vans, the REPORTERS
      just now venturing out into the cold.

                                  TED
              I see the media's here.  They don't give people a
              moment's peace, do they?

                                  PAUL
              I called them.

                                  TED
                        (surprised)
              Really?

                                  PAUL
              Well, they've been asking me to talk some more
              about Raymond.  I thought now might be an
              appropriate time.

                                  TED
              And you'll just happen to mention your heartless
              insurance company that hasn't paid off your policy
              yet.

                                  PAUL
              I had to borrow money for the casket, Mr. Ted.

                                  TED
              You are breaking my heart.

                                  PAUL
              No, I doubt that.  They asked me to bring some
              photos of Raymond.  Guess it's gonna be a pretty
              big story.

      He pulls out some shots of his brother.  They whip around in the wind and
      blowing snow.

                                  PAUL (cont'd)
              Of course, we could walk over there together.  You
              could tell them how deeply moved you were by this
              tragedy and how... the check is on its way?

      Ted thinks, grudgingly impressed with Paul's ploy.

                                  TED
              Enjoy your press conference, Mr. Barnell.

      Paul stuffs the photos back in his pocket and walks down the hill.  Ted watches
      him go, is about to leave when a gust of wind forces him to avert his eyes.
      Looking down he sees a photo of Raymond Barnell, on the beach in swim
      trunks.  Must have fallen.  Ted pockets it and moves on.

              You ever try digging through six feet of half frozen
              sod?  We'd need a back hoe.  Can you operate a
              back hoe?  Do you know where we'd get a back
              hoe?  We don't even know for sure...

                                  GARY
              Oh please.  Don't you think it's a pretty neat
              coincidence?

                                  JIMBO
              Maybe we just go explain it to Dave.

                                  GARY
              He won't take it well.

                                  JIMBO
              Then I'm all for new options, here, Gary. (beat)  If we
              give the money back--

              deserve the--

                                  JIMBO
              I did the job, Gary.  I know, because I haven't been
              sleeping for the last week.

                                  GARY
              I don't know why you're letting it get to you like this.
              Look, let's just not rush into anything.  It's my turn to
              step up.  I know that.  I'm on it.

      They look on as Paul is interviewed by the reporters.

      Margaret washes down some pills with her morning coffee as she looks at a
      fawn in the backyard, nibbling on a bush.

                                  MARGARET
              Hey little, Bambi.  Where's your Mommy?  Gettin' it
              from some ten point buck.  Yes she is.  Yes she is.

      Just then, a THUMPING sound from the garage causes the fawn to bolt.
      Margaret turns, suspicious.  She picks up the portable phone as she moves
      toward the door.

79    INT. GARAGE                                                                   79

      Gary sticks his head inside the now unchained fridge, grabs a can of soda
      from the door rack and closes the door.  A moment later, he reopens the door...

      There, hanging off the frosty inside, is a chunk of the dead man's hair and
      scalp.  Gary pulls it off, not sure what it means, but sure it means something.

      Unseen behind him, Margaret steps into the garage.  She quickly assesses
      the situation.

                                  MARGARET
              Stay away from our fucking appliances.

      Gary spins, shocked to see Margaret.

                                  GARY
              Lady, just calm down.

      Margaret, eyes wide with fear, unleashes a hailstorm of soda cans,

      on.

      He tries to close in on her, but the torrent of stuff (a rake, a Whipper-Snipper,
      an old pair of skates...) keeps him pinned down.  Finally, he manages to grab his
      gun from his pocket.  But even as he raises it...

      A Bissel Handvac catches him flush in the face.

                                  GARY (cont'd)
              Sud of a bit!

      He drops to his knees, grabbing his nose, which is now gushing blood.
      Margaret reaches for her portable phone and starts punching numbers.

                                  MARGARET
              You are in so much trouble.

      Gary stands, pissed off, gun aimed at Margaret's head.

                                  GARY
              Lady, so help me I --

      Gary ducks as the phone whizzes over his head and smashes against the
      garage wall.  He stares at her.  Game over.

      A standard corrugated metal storage facility.  Snow falls in from a large hole
      that's been cut in the roof.  Cam and Ted, clipboard in hand, stand by the
      owner, MR. SPELLMAN (50s).

              For the cruise ship trade, mostly.  Usual stuff, stuffed
              animals, your huskies, your moose, your baby seals,
              your whales, your walrus --

              They came in through there?

                                  SPELLMAN
                        (looking up/duh!)
              Yeah.  Through that... big hole in the roof.  I got a list
              of all the things that are missing.

      Ted stares up at the sky through the ceiling.

                                  TED
              How much?

                                  SPELLMAN
              Uh, we figure about 200,000, plus fixing the roof.

              Ted.  Maybe we should take a look at their inventory

              This is a simple case, Cam.  Bad guys, through roof,
              stole stuff.  Let's clear it and get going.

                                  SPELLMAN
              I should tell you... we also had some VCRs we were
              holding for another company.  That could run
              another couple of...

                        (off his look)
              Gotta go primary some time.

      Cam shrugs-- "sure."  Ted hands him his clipboard and walks out, the door
      closes behind him with a loud BANG.

                                  CAM
              Mr. Spellman?  Now I noticed a nice looking
              computer in your office.  Why do you think they left
              that?

81    INT. BARNELL HOME / LIVING ROOM - LATER                                       81

      Margaret sits taped to a Lazy-Boy recliner.  Gary, who's still bleeding from the
      nose, sits across from her.

                                  MARGARET
              You try and rape me, I swear to Christ I'll bite it off.

      Gary looks confused.  The doorbell CHIMES, playing "Tiny Bubbles."  (We stay
      in the living room as Gary answers it.)

                                  JIMBO (O.S.)
              What's going on?

                                  GARY (O.S.)
              Okay, now here's the thing, just keep an open mind.

      They both enter the room.  Jimbo looks at Gary, is about to smack him when...

                                  MARGARET
              So what now, you gonna get me smokin' from both
              ends?

      Gary and Jimbo have no idea how to react.  Margaret senses their discomfort,
      starts to relax.

                                  GARY
              I just came to look around, but she started yelling
              and hitting me...

                                  MARGARET
              Oh please.

                                  JIMBO
              How the hell is this solving our problem?  How is
              this stepping up?

                                  GARY
              Just listen, okay.

                                  MARGARET
              Yeah, listen, if the fat from your neck hasn't stopped
              up your ears.

      Jimbo looks confused.  Gary ushers him into the other room.

      Gary and Jimbo sit at the table, talking.  Jimbo's not happy.

                                  JIMBO
              This is not what we do.

                                  GARY
              It is now.

                                  JIMBO
              Where would we stash her?  Your place?

                                  GARY
              Too small, plus we'd have to get her in and out
              without anyone seeing.  And I've seen that sty you
              call an apartment.

                                  JIMBO
              See, it's just a bad idea.

                                  GARY
              Yeah.  Maybe.
                        (a possible idea)
              You see the whirlpool tub?

                                  JIMBO
              You can't be serious.

                                  GARY
              It could be like a little getaway.

      Off Jimbo, considering this.

      Paul walks in from the garage, pulls off his jacket.

                                  PAUL
              Hey Maggie-magster.  How ya --

      Paul stops short as he sees Margaret, Gary and Jimbo sitting around the table.
      Margaret's mouth is taped shut.

      Paul is about to lunge at the men when Gary slides his gun into view.  He
      stops.

                                  PAUL (cont'd)
              What are you people doing in my house?

                                  GARY
              Mr. Barnell.  You have something that belongs to us.

                                  PAUL
              I, I don't know what you're talking about.

                                  JIMBO
              Do you remember a dead man you found in the
              dumpster behind your office?

      Paul, shocked, tries to hold it together.

                                  PAUL
              No, I can't say that... I mean that would probably stick
              in my mind a... dead body.

                                  GARY
              Think hard Mr. Barnell.

      He tosses the frozen lock of hair onto the table.

                                  GARY (cont'd)
              Think hard.

      Paul realizes he's screwed, gestures to the living room.

      Gary sits on the sofa as Paul paces.

                                  GARY
              I thought it might be some weirdo sex thing, ya
              know?  But you look like a pretty straight arrow.  So
              then I'm thinking, maybe it's a scam.  Maybe
              somehow our friend is worth some money to you.

      Paul face lets Gary know he's dead on.

              So what'd you collect?

                                  PAUL
              We, we had a life insurance policy
              on my brother.  It was for... 100,000 dollars.

                                  GARY
              You know, it's always you quiet guys.  Here's how it's
              going to work.  We stay here with your wife, you go
              get our guy.

                                  PAUL
              Here?

                                  GARY
              We even see you or a cop even roll past, she's dead.
              Plus you'll have to explain
              how you scammed the insurance people out of their
              hard earned money.  We'll call you in three days.
              Have the body and, let's say 50,000 dollars for our
              trouble.  Screw with us, we start mailing your wife
              back to you.

      Gary pauses for dramatic effect.

                                  GARY (cont'd)
              Starting with her feet.

      Gary walks in on Jimbo and Margaret, still gagged.

                                  JIMBO
              He gone?

      Gary nods, well pleased with himself.

                                  GARY
              He was scared.  Really scared.

                                  JIMBO
              You used the feet thing, didn't you?

      Tiffany comes through the door carrying a sack of groceries.

                                  TIFFANY
              Hey, little help here.  I got Pop Tarts.

      She sees the living room wall -- it's covered with charts, diagrams and
      theories.  Ted on the floor, remote control in hand, replaying the shots of the
      body over and over...

                                  TIFFANY (cont'd)

              Shhhh.  This is the important part.

      Ted rewinds the tape, hits play, rewinds it again as -- Tiffany watches, quietly at
      first, then with growing frustration.  Finally, she walks over and grabs the
      remote control.

                                  TED (cont'd)
              I was watching that.

                                  TIFFANY
              This stops now.  This case is making me and you
              crazy, especially you.

      No response.  Tiffany plops on the sofa and starts leafing through Ted's files.

                                  TIFFANY (cont'd)
              Ya know, I am trying to be supportive.  Leading
              experts agree that's the number one complaint men
              have about their mates.

                                  TED
              I don't have any complaints about my... you.

              Yeah. He beat the hell out of some guy in bar fight.
              Broke the guy's eye socket.

      Tiffany scans the file, then looks up at the screen.

                                  TIFFANY
              Honey?

      Margaret, still taped to a chair, sits at the kitchen table.  By the stove, Gary is
      cooking, an apron tied like a bath towel around his waist.

                                  MARGARET
              We don't have any money, you know.

                                  GARY
              Lady.  Please.

                                  MARGARET
              If you want Raymond's fucking insurance money...
              we don't have that either.

                                  GARY
              It's none of your business what we want.

      Gary goes back to his cooking.  Then...

                                  GARY (cont'd)
              So how come you talk like you do?  I mean, cursing
              all the time.

                                  MARGARET
              It's a disease.  It's called Tourette Syndrome.  I can't
              control what I say.  Turnip.

                                  GARY
              Really?

                                  MARGARET
              You've taken a handicapped person hostage.  I hope
              you're proud of yourself.

                                  GARY
              I saw this thing on TV where they said people with
              that don't usually curse.

                                  MARGARET
              They must have got it wrong.

                                  GARY
              I don't think so.  It was a movie of the week based on
              real events.  Don't most of Tourette's people twitch
              and stuff?

      Margaret just glares.

                        (knowingly)
              Oh, I get it.  You got a spice rack?

                                  GARY
              Nothing.  Cumin?

              On the left. (beat)  And I'm not... crazy, it's a physical
              disease.  Sometimes I can control it, and

              You can completely abdicate your societal
              responsibilities, say whatever you want whenever
              you want, and slough it off on a illness.  Maybe I
              should catch this thing. "Gee, sorry Your Honor, I
              have a disease that makes me rob 7-11s."  It's
              called really need a Slurpee disease.

                                  MARGARET
              You've never robbed a 7-11 in your life you shit
              eating fuck-weasel.  What kind of man threatens a
              woman with a gun, anyway?

                                  GARY
              You are so faking it.

                                  MARGARET
              Oh, I'm faking it?  Is this how you get your kicks, you
              over-compensating pussy little fart sack?

      Gary, suddenly tense, puts down his spoon and picks up his gun.

                                  GARY
              Hey!  Keep your voice down or the gag goes back.

                                  MARGARET
              You don't scare me.  If something bad was going to
              happen, my psychic would have told me.

      Gary awkwardly chambers a round, starts gesturing with the gun, trying to look
      tough.

                                  MARGARET (cont'd)
              You put that down now you little bitch, or so help me,
              I'll start yelling so loud you'll have to shoot me.

      Gary, confused and embarrassed, doesn't know what to do.

89    EXT. BARNELL MOBILE HOME - NIGHT                                              89

      Paul gets out of his car carrying a K-Mart bag.  He looks like he's been
      CRYING.  Mrs. Wherry waves from her deck.

                                  MRS. WHERRY
              Paul, sorry to hear about your brother.
                        (Paul gives a sad smile)
              You moving in?

                                  PAUL
              Just for a bit.

                                  MRS. WHERRY
              She'll come to her senses.  They always do.  Oh, the
              septic lines are frozen, so you'll have to use the
              outdoor commode.

      Paul waves as he enters the mobile home, closing the door behind him.  A
      light goes on.  It starts to snow.

90    INT. BARNELL MOBILE HOME - NIGHT                                              90

      Paul walks in, survey's the interior of the mobile home.

      PAUL'S POV:  A 7 year old time capsule of a party that was never cleaned up;
      beer bottles, ashtrays and general garbage.

                                  PAUL
                        (to himself)
              Would it have killed you to clean up before you left,
              Raymond?

      Paul picks up a small box from the floor, looks at the label.  Edible Panties.  He
      puts them on top of a stack of porno mags, neatens the pile, then heads out.

      INT. BEDROOM - LATER

      HIGH ANGLE ON: Paul lying in bed, wide awake, but in the same position
      we've seen him in when he sleeps with Margaret.  An electric heater glows
      beside him.

91    EXT. BARNELL MOBILE HOME - CONTINUOUS                                         91

      TIGHT ON: Car tires as they pull to a stop on the main road.  A pair of heavy
      men's boots get out, start to make their way toward the mobile home.

92    INT. MOBILE HOME - LATE NIGHT                                                 92

      There's a KNOCK on the door.  Paul heads to the door.

                                  PAUL
              Who is it?

                                  MAN'S VOICE (O.S.)
              State Police.  Is there a Mr. Barnell here?

                                  PAUL
                        (as he unlocks it)
              Yes, is there something wrong--

      As he opens the door a crack, a gloved hand shoves it open.  The force of the
      blow sends Paul staggering backward, landing in a heap against the wall
      where a picture of his family tumbles over and shatters on his head.
      RAYMOND BARNELL (40s), a bear of man, enters, picks up Paul and throws
      him through the serving kitchen serving hatch.  Raymond leans through the
      hole.

                                  RAYMOND
              Hello brother.

      He walks around, takes a copy of "USA Today" and throws it at Paul.

                                  PAUL
              Raymond?  Is that...

                                  RAYMOND
              Page 16, Paul. That's why I love "USA Today", news
              from every fuckin' state.  Don't you want to read it?  I
              was eaten by wild fuckin' animals.  But ya know,
              despite that, I'm feeling pretty God-damned chipper.

      Paul beats a hasty retreat, stumbling through the mobile home with Raymond
      right on his heels.

                                  PAUL
              Raymond, let me tell you what happened here.  We
              all thought you were...

                                  RAYMOND
              Dead?  Yeah, I got that impression.

                                  PAUL
              But you had dropped off the face of the earth.

                                  RAYMOND
              And you just decide to make it permanent?

                                  PAUL
              But there were no records of you anywhere.  I
              checked.

      With that, Raymond kicks his brother hard in the ribs.  Paul doubles over,
      gasping for breath.

                                  RAYMOND
              In certain lines of quasi-legal employment, using
              your actual ID can be a hinderance.  But despite the
              reliance on aliases, it's nice to have your actual birth
              certificate to fall back on.  Gotta tell ya, Paul, I was
              pretty pissed.

      Raymond is about to kick him once more, but Paul puts up a hand, begging
      him to stop.  Raymond, relents, then bends over and helps his brother to a
      sitting position.

                                  RAYMOND (cont'd)
              But then I start to think, Paul's no idiot.  He woulda
              told 'em it's not me.  Unless...

      Paul can only sit there and WHEEZE.  Raymond sits beside him on the floor,
      pulls out a cigarette and lights it.

                                  RAYMOND (cont'd)
              So what is it?  Frame job, lawsuit...

                                  PAUL
              Life insurance.

                                  RAYMOND
              Figured.  So where's my money?

                                  PAUL
              Your money?
                        (a beat)
              They're still... investigating.

                                  RAYMOND
              What you get?

      Paul considers whether or not Raymond would even remember.

                                  PAUL
              Fifty thousand.

                                  RAYMOND
                        (with a shrug)
              Almost worth coming back for.  What's the split?  I
              get half?

                                  PAUL
                        (not quite trusting him)
              Okay.  Sure.
                        (changing the subject)
              You look good.  Lost some weight?

                                  RAYMOND
              Gave up carbs.  So what are you doing out here?
              She not go along with it?

                                  PAUL
              Who?  Margaret?

                                  RAYMOND
              How she hold up, anyway?

                                  PAUL
              She's fine.  Actually, we're not doing so good right
              now.

                                  RAYMOND
              Any kids?
                        (off his look)
              Still can't get one by the goalie, huh.

93    INT. BARNELL HOME / KITCHEN - LATER                                           93

      Gary and Margaret sit in silence, Gary taking Margaret's pulse.  Jimbo walks in,
      grocery bag in hand.

                                  JIMBO
              Hey.

                                  GARY
                        (snarky)
              Hey.

                                  JIMBO
              Talked to our friend.  We're okay for now.  How's
              everything here?

                                  GARY
              Oh, just great.
                        (to Margaret)
              Seventy six, perfectly normal.  What a shock.

      Gary jumps up and storms into the bathroom just off the kitchen.

                                  MARGARET
              He's a little over tired.

                                  JIMBO
              It's been a rough week.

                                  MARGARET
                        (for Gary's benefit)
              Really?  Why?  You and your life partner in the shitter
              having trouble picking a China pattern?

                                  JIMBO
                        (shocked)
              Um, um... Gary?

                                  GARY (O.S.)
              Your turn to deal with it.  If I come out of this
              bathroom I'll put a bullet in her head, swear to God.

                                  MARGARET
              I have a psychiatric disorder.
                        (to Gary, in the bathroom)
              And so do you!

94    EXT. BARNELL MOBILE HOME / DRIVEWAY - MORNING                                 94

      Paul, looking like a man who recently took a beating, shovels the light snow
      cover that blankets the drive.  He looks as Ted's car pulls up.  As Ted walks
      toward him...

                                  PAUL
              Mr. Watters.  You said on the phone something
              about a resolution in our claim?

                                  TED
              Mr. Barnell.  Why are you staying out here?

      Paul thinks about this for a long time.  Then, finally...

                                  PAUL
              My wife and I, we're having some problems.

                                  TED
              Kind of understandable I guess.  Seeing as how you
              killed that man and dumped his body out in the
              woods.

                                  PAUL
              You mean Raymond?

                                  TED
              No.  Not Raymond.  Definitely not Raymond.  I
              thought it was at first, but that's what was throwing
              me...

                                  PAUL
              I'm not sure I appreciate your tone.

                                  TED
              My tone, Mr. Barnell?  You are going to jail.  I will
              personally see to that.

                                  PAUL
              I really think you should go now.

                                  TED
              You are a liar and thief.

      Paul stabs his shovel into a snow bank, then walks to Ted.

                                  PAUL
              You know Mr. Watters, I've had a pretty rough night,
              so if you wouldn't mind just leaving.

      Paul tries to guide Ted away, but slips and falls on the snow.  Ted, rolling his
      eyes, reaches down to help him up.

                                  TED
                        (noticing the bruises)
              Hey.  How'd you get all cut up?

                                  MRS. WHERRY (O.S.)
              What's say you just move away from him.

      Ted, with his hands still on Paul, turns to see -- Mrs. Wherry, from her porch, a
      compound bow aimed at his forehead.

                                  MRS. WHERRY (cont'd)
              You all right there, Paul?

                                  PAUL
              I'm fine, Mrs. Wherry.  Just go back inside.

                                  MRS. WHERRY
              I can drop him if you want.

                                  PAUL
              I'm fine.  Really.
                        (turning to Watters)
              I think you'd better go.

      Ted backs to his car, gets in and drives off.  Paul brushes the snow from his
      jacket, reaches up, touches his bleeding forehead (the fall having reopened the
      wound).

                                  MRS. WHERRY
              I've got some fishing line if you want me to stitch that.

      Paul waves her off, then stares at the blood on his fingertips.  An idea slowly
      takes hold.

95    INT. BARNELL MOBILE HOME - MOMENTS LATER                                      95

      Raymond pours whiskey into a 7-11 specialty cup as Paul  pulls off his coat.

                                  RAYMOND
              He give you the check?

                                  PAUL
              No.  He thinks I...  It'll be fine.

                                  RAYMOND
              Maybe I'll pay him a little visit.  See if we can speed
              up the process.

                                  PAUL
              You don't have to... I figured out a way to take care of
              things.

                                  RAYMOND
              Yeah, I was watching from the window.

      Paul, agitated, pulls the blinds shut.

                                  PAUL
              You can't do that, Raymond.  If someone sees you...

                                  RAYMOND
              Ya know, I been thinking there, Paulie.

                                  PAUL
              About what?

      Raymond walks over to Paul.  Paul tenses, expecting to be hit.  Raymond
      moves right by to refill his drink.

                                  RAYMOND
              After we get her back from these guys who grabbed
              her, you think your wife'll be able to keep her mouth
              shut?

                                  PAUL
              I don't think I...

                                  RAYMOND
              Crazy people talk a lot.  And I think if you tell your
              therapist something, they can use it in court.

                                  PAUL
              She's not...  she doesn't have a therapist.

                                  RAYMOND
                        (taking a slug)
              Still, might wanna think about it.

                                  PAUL
              Think about what?

                                  RAYMOND
              You crossed over into the bigs now, Paulie.  Fraud.
              Consorting with felons.  Got to "cowboy up."

                                  PAUL
              Cowboy up?

                                  RAYMOND
              Get tough, ya suck-hole.  I'm just saying sometimes
              a man has to make problematic decisions.  Cull the
              heard, so to speak.
                        (off his look)
              Paul, come on, just kiddin' around, here.  Don't be
              such a fuckin' stick.

      Raymond, an enigma, looks at Paul, then grins -- just kidding.  Paul relaxes.
      Raymond tenses -- not really.  Paul's not sure how to read his brother as they
      shoot looks at one another -- sibling rivalry ad absurdum.

96    EXT. CITY SKYLINE - MORNING                                                   96

      The sky moves from dark grey to light grey, then stops.  A thermometer outside
      on an office tower shows a brisk minus 20.  Workers bundle themselves
      against the cold, hurry to work past the drifts piled alongside the road.

97    INT. INSURANCE OFFICE - MORNING                                               97

      Ted walks in, throwing his coat over the wall of his cubicle and is about to sit
      down when he notices Paul in his boss' office.  Ted moves closer.

                                  PAUL (MUFFLED)
              I haven't called the police yet, but I'll tell you it was
              certainly tempting.

      Ted opens the door to his boss' office.  Paul doesn't notice.

                                  PAUL (cont'd)
              I've had some dealings with, diseases of the mind,
              and I can tell you he is not well.

      Branch, obviously worried, stands.

                                  BRANCH
              Watters.  Glad you're... Mr. Barnell was just telling
              me about the... meeting you two had.

                                  TED
              I caught that, yes.

                                  BRANCH
              As you can see... well, Mr. Barnell has some...
              concerns.

      Paul turns to look at Ted.  He has a large band-aid on his forehead, scratches
      and bruises on his face.  It takes a second for the dime to drop.

                                  TED
              You don't think I did this?

      Paul gets up and moves to the other side of the office.

                                  TED (cont'd)
              Oh come on.  I never laid a hand on him.

                                  BRANCH
              Ted, his neighbor says... otherwise.

                                  TED
              Now just hang on here.  Let me show you
              something...

      Ted digs into his briefcase.  He takes out a video tape, the police file on
      Raymond and the photo of Raymond Paul dropped in the snow.

98/99 INT. OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER                                                98/99

      Paul and Branch listen intently as Ted paces, the TV/VCR plays shots of the
      dead body in the background.

                                  TED
              See?  Where's the birthmark?  Your brother's police
              report listed it...
                        (reading from the report)
              "...large purple birthmark, upper left thigh..."
                        (leaning into the screen)
              But I don't see it.  Not on this body.  You can see it in
              the picture.  See?

      Ted points to the photo;  Raymond, in the summer, wearing shorts with a
      blotchy purple spot clearly visible on his leg.

                                  TED (cont'd)
              So what, Mr. Barnell?  Did it just disappear?  Did it
              just... get better.

      Ted grins.  His moment.  Finally.  Seconds feel like minutes.

                                  PAUL
              It... did get better.

                                  TED
              Did it now.  Well how in the world did that happen?

                                  PAUL
              Raymond was always... bothered by it. When he
              came back from... Florida, he'd
              had it fixed.  Laser surgery... like removing a tattoo.

      Paul looks at Branch.  It's an excuse Ted hadn't thought of before.

                                  TED
              He did not.

                                  PAUL
              You taped my brother's body, in the morgue?

      Paul stands and grabs the photo from off the desk.

                                  PAUL (cont'd)
              And this?  You stole pictures of my family?  And
              taped his naked body?  What kind of sick company
              are you running here?

                                  TED
              Oh for... he's lying.  It's obvious he...

      Paul, feigning fear, shrinks back into the corner.

                                  TED (cont'd)
              This is crazy.  All we have to do is dig up the body...
              check the leg for scars...
                        (bingo)
              Dental records!

      Paul goes white.  He hadn't thought about this.

                                  BRANCH
              That will be just about enough of that. Mr. Barnell, I'm
              sorry it's all come to this.  We'll have a check brought
              over to you tomorrow morning.

      Paul nods, stressed and strung out, he hugs the wall as he walks out.  After a
      moment...

                                  TED
              Sir, with all due respect, he's --

                                  BRANCH
              Jesus, we're lucky he's not suing.  Now tomorrow,
              you deliver the check to Mr. Barnell with a complete
              apology.

                                  TED
              Fine, I understand how this looks --

                                  BRANCH
              It looks like you beat the hell out of one of our policy
              holders.  Now send Cam in here.

                                  TED
              Why?

                                  BRANCH
              Well, while you were off on your little Easter Egg
              hunt, your junior found us an out on that warehouse
              robbery.  Head office is bumping him a level.

                                  TED
                        (fuck me naked)
              I'll go get him.

                                  BRANCH
              They're very keen on him.  They want me to feel him
              out on a transfer --

      Ted has left the office, SLAMMING the door behind him.

100   INT. INSURANCE OFFICE STAIRWELL - MOMENTS LATER                              100

      The door CLANGS shut behind Paul as he dials his cell phone.

                                  PAUL
              Hello... yes, I'm wondering what city department
              would be in charge of... sure, I can hold.
                        (to himself)
              Hang on Mag Pie, just hang on.

      Paul puts a hand to his chest.  Suddenly dizzy, he drops to his knees and starts
      to RETCH.  Tears well up in his eyes.  After a few moments, the storm passes.
      Still on his knees, the person on the line comes back.

                                  PAUL (cont'd)
              Yeah, hi.   I was wondering if you could.... but I was...
              sure.

      He sits there, on hold again, waiting...

101   INT. UNDERGROUND PARKING AREA - EVENING                                      101

      Ted walks to his car.  As he opens the door -- WHAM!  A fist to his face drops
      Ted.  Raymond in a ski mask, picks him up, opens the car door and lays Ted's
      head on the door jamb.

                                  RAYMOND
              Listen you little prick, we've had just about enough of
              this.  You get me?

      Raymond leans onto the door, Ted SCREAMING as his head is squashed in
      the vice.

                                  RAYMOND (cont'd)
              So let's just settle this right now, OK?  We want
              what's coming to us.

      Ted tries to say "yes."  Raymond releases his grip on the door, leans down and
      grabs Ted's wallet and walks off.

      Paul walks in on A LOUD PARTY.  Raymond, drunk out of his head, has his
      arms around two marginal looking HOOKERS.

                                  PAUL
              Ray -

      Not wanting to use his brother's real name.

                                  PAUL (cont'd)
              Richard!  What in the blazes are you doing?

                                  RAYMOND
              Hey Paul.  Took care of our little problem today.  We
              should see some serious money any time, soon.

                                  PAUL
              Could... I have a word with you?

104   INT. BARNELL MOBILE HOME / KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS                              104

      Paul pulls the sliding door closed behind Raymond.

                                  PAUL
                        (whisper)
              Are those...?

                                  RAYMOND
                        (serious)
              Prostitutes?

              I sure as hell hope so, cause Jehovah's Witnesses
              won't lick your lolly no matter how much you pay
              them.

                                  PAUL
              How did you get them here?

      Raymond pulls out the credit card Paul got for him.

                                  RAYMOND
              Put it on my plastic.  See, got my name on it and
              everything.  It's every where I want to be.

                                  PAUL
              You can't use that.  You're supposed to be dead!
              They'll track us down.

                                  RAYMOND
              You think they give a shit who pays the bill?  Think for
              a minute, will ya?

      Paul turns, trying to compose himself, when he notices  a handgun sitting out
      on the counter.

                                  PAUL
              What... Raymond, what is... this?

      Paul pokes at the gun, sending the barrel spinning around to face him.
      Raymond grabs it and stuffs it into his pants.

                                  RAYMOND
              That's "muh gun," Paul.

      Paul's cell phone RINGS.

                                  RAYMOND (cont'd)
              Don't be long.  The little spinner's yours.

      Paul picks up the phone as the party revs back up.

                                  PAUL
              Yes, hello.  Sorry, what?

105/106 INTERCUT:  BARNELL HOME / KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS                         105/106

      Jimbo is on the wall mounted phone.

                                  JIMBO
              You having a party, Mr. Barnell?
                        (embarrassed for Margaret)
              That's... that's not right.

      Margaret, now gagged, sits where we last saw her.  She tries to talk through
      the gag.

      Gary's staring at his watch, calling out seconds.

                                  GARY
              Thirty, sorry, startinnng... Now!

      Paul pulls the kitchen door closed with his free hand.

                                  PAUL
              There's no party...let me talk to my wife.

                                  JIMBO
              Hang on.

      He hands the phone to Margaret.  Gary leaps up and stops him.

                                  GARY
              Twenty-five!

      Jimbo pushes past him, pulls down Margaret's gag and holds the phone to
      her.

                                  PAUL
              Why are you counting?

                                  MARGARET
              Paul?  Are you entertaining?

                        (a wave of relief)
              Oh God, oh Jesus... Margaret, are you okay?

                                  RAYMOND (O.S.)
              Paul, we got any more chips?

              Fifteen!
                        (grabs the phone)
              The body. Have you -- (beat) No, I'm the other guy.
              Have you got the body?

              Paul, the carrot little weasly one wants to carrot
              screw me with his sick carrot little cock.  And he's
              messing up my kitchen.  Carrotcarrocarrot...

      Jimbo, annoyed, puts the gag back in Margaret's mouth.

                                  PAUL
              You sick... Don't you hurt her!!

                                  GARY

                        (looks at his watch in panic)
              Yes or no.  Ten seconds.

                                  PAUL
              Yes! It'll... it'll happen tomorrow.  Put Margaret back
              on!

                                  RAYMOND (O.S.)

                                  PAUL
              Hello?

      Gary lunges for the phone cradle like it's the finish line in the 100 meter dash,
      slamming the phone down.  A beat.

                                  GARY
              I think I managed to avoid a trace.

      Paul goes to the cupboard and pulls out a box of potato chips.  As he turns, he
      sees one of the HOOKERS (30s) standing in the doorway.  She gives Paul a
      come hither look.

      A bruised Ted enters, once again the only person in the shop.  He keeps his
      parka on.  Avis stands to greet him.

              Mr. Watters?

      Paul comes around the corner.  He extends his hand, shocked to see the
      bruises on Ted's face but knowing exactly where they came from.

                                  TED
              Mr. Barnell.  I have your check.

                                  PAUL
              Thank you, I appreciate that.
                        (an awkward pause)
              Please, sit.

      Ted sits at Paul desk, reaches into his brief case and pulls out an envelope
      and several forms.

                                  PAUL (cont'd)
              Have a little accident, there?

                                  TED
              I was mugged.  The cops say it was just a random
              act of violence.  But who knows, right?
                        (re: documents)
              You'll have to sign.

      Ted slides the papers across to Paul, then gets up and moves around over
      Paul's shoulder.

                                  TED (cont'd)
              Where I've marked it with an X.  And... I'd also like to
              apologize for my --

                                  PAUL
              No, please.  You don't have to...

      Paul, at a loss, starts to read the paperwork. He pulls open his desk drawer to
      grab a pen.  Ted looks down, sees the Sea Shell in the drawer.

                                  TED
              That's quite the shell.

                                  PAUL
                        (picking it up)
              It was a gift from Raymond.  He bought it for me from
              Florida.  It's all we have to remember him by.

      Paul puts the shell down on the desk.

                                  TED
              That and a million dollars.  Things really worked out
              for you, didn't they? lots of cash, newly single guy...

                                  PAUL
              I'm not single.

                                  TED
              ...so you gonna head down to Club Med?  See how
              much fun a big bank roll can buy?

                                  PAUL
              Mr. Watters, I love my wife.  Very much.

      Ted can't help but look confused by this simple, yet sincere declaration.

                                  TED
              Can we level with each other for a moment?
                        (Paul nods)
              Did you --

      Before he can finish his question, a DELIVERY DRIVER entering the office with
      a large box.

                                  PAUL
              Avis!  Avis?

      There's no answer.  She's in the back.

                                  PAUL (cont'd)
              Will you excuse me?

      Paul gets up to deal with the delivery.  Ted, sullen, picks up the shell and turns
      it over in his hands.  Avis enter from the back.  She smiles at Ted, then sees
      the shell.

                                  AVIS
              Oh, that's where you went.

      She takes the shell and reattaches it to the display for Aloha Air.  Ted,
      confused, walks over as Avis snaps the shell back into place.

                                  TED
              That's quite the display.

                                  AVIS
              They do some very nice in store promotions.

      Paul walks back, shocked to see the shell now back on the display.  Ted just
      stares at him.

                                  AVIS (cont'd)
              Here it is Mr. Barnell.
                        (to Ted)
              I thought someone might have walked out with it.  It's
              not the best neighborhood.

      Avis walks back to her desk.  Ted and Paul hold their look.  Finally, Paul walks
      back to his desk and the paperwork.

                                  PAUL
              So, right here, by the X.

      Ted nods.  Paul signs.  Ted takes the envelope with the check, hands it to Paul
      but doesn't let go.  Paul tries to pull it free.  He looks at Ted who looks right
      through him.  Just then, the lights go out.  They're all in the dark.

                                  PAUL (cont'd)
              We, uh... Avis?  Call Municipal Light and Power and
              let them know I'll... stop by in a bit.

      Paul looks at Ted, embarrassed.  Ted finally lets go of the check.

                                  PAUL (cont'd)
              Thank you.

      Ted shakes his head, gets up and walks out.

A109  EXT. "BARNELL GREAT ESCAPES TRAVEL" - NIGHT                                 A109

      Paul, seen through the window, sits alone in the dark.  His face lit only by a
      small flashlight, he is completely still.

110   INT. TED'S APARTMENT - NIGHT                                                 110

      Tiffany on her headset with a customer.  Ted on the sofa, lost in thought and
      whatever's on the TV.

                                  TIFFANY
              There's nothing to be embarrassed about.
                        (a snide glance at Ted)
              A lot of people find talking to a psychic very
              therapeutic.  So what's on your mind, Carlos?

111   INTERCUT WITH: "BARNELL GREAT ESCAPES TRAVEL" - CONT.                        111

      An overwrought Paul is on the phone with Tiffany, sitting in the dark.  He's got
      his home phone bill in front of him.

                                  PAUL
              I have a situation.  My wife...  do you think it's okay to
              do something kinda bad to someone if you think
              they're gonna do something really bad to someone
              else?

                                  TIFFANY
              Sure.

                                  PAUL
              What if it's a really bad thing?

                                  TIFFANY
              Well, you probably shouldn't break the law if you can
              help it.  Are you really sure they're going to do this
              other thing?

                                  PAUL
              I'm... I... I don't know.  He said some things.  He said
              he was joking, but I... I think he might.

                                  TIFFANY
              Don't think, know.  How close are you to the other
              someone else, the one you're trying to protect?

                                  PAUL
                        (crying)
              I just, I just...  Have you ever felt like that?  Like your
              own life didn't even matter, as long as...

                                  TIFFANY
                        (touched)
              Listen to me, Carlos.  Your wife is an incredibly lucky
              woman.  I know, relationships are tough, but you do
              what you gotta do to keep it together, okay?
              Remember, love is sacrifice.

      Ted can't help but SNORT at the mention of this familiar phrase as he looks at
      Tiffany.  Tiffany glares back at him.

                                  PAUL
                        (sniffling)
              I guess you're right.

                                  TIFFANY
              Now you get tough.  And remember, this call is for
              entertainment purposes only.  Call me back and let
              me know how it goes.

      Tiffany hangs up and walks out.  Ted tries to catch her eye and let her know he
      was just kidding.  He can't.  She goes.

112   INT. PAUL'S CAR - LATER                                                      112

      Paul behind the wheel, a strange determined look on his face.  He appears be
      steeling himself for something.

113   INT. BARNELL MOBILE HOME / MAIN AREA - LATER                                 113

      Paul enters, SLAMMING the door behind him as Raymond looks up from his
      porno magazine.

                                  PAUL
                        (blowing by)
              She's having sex with them.

      And with that, Paul disappears into the back bedroom.

114   INT. BARNELL MOBILE HOME / BACK BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER                      114

      Paul sits, waiting.  After what seems like forever, Raymond walks in.

                                  RAYMOND
              Who's doing what?

                                  PAUL
              Margaret.  You know that Stockholm Syndrome
              thing?

                                  RAYMOND
              The movie?

                                  PAUL
              When you fall in love with your kidnappers.

                                  RAYMOND
              Get the fuck out of here.

                                  PAUL
              I went by there.  She was in the bedroom with the big
              one.
                        (quietly)
              Not the first time, either.
                        (a flash of panic)
              With other men, not kidnappers.

                                  RAYMOND
              For real?

                                  PAUL
              Her therapist.  And some guy she... hardly knew.

                                  RAYMOND
              Wow.  Sucks to be you.

                                  PAUL
              Shut up.

      Raymond, a momentary flash of anger, sits on the bed beside his brother.
      Paul does his best not to flinch.

                                  RAYMOND
              I always knew she was a fucking tease.

                                  PAUL
              Yeah.  Guess you were right.

                                  RAYMOND
              Well, you want my opinion...
                        (Paul nods)
              I don't trust her, Paul.  Never did.

                                  PAUL
              You think she'd... really mess things up?

                                  RAYMOND
              Only one way to make sure she doesn't.

                                  PAUL
              Not sure what you're saying?

                                  RAYMOND
              You remember that pooch Mom had?  Crazy little
              Jack Russel with the bladder infection?

                                  PAUL
              Whole basement stank.

                                  RAYMOND
              Nothing you can do but put the thing out of it's
              misery.  And yours.

                                  PAUL
              You... You sure, Ray?

                                  RAYMOND
              Trust me, Bro'.  Leaky dogs, crazy women.  Two
              things no man should have to live with.

      As Ray stands to go, Paul nods, his heart ripped apart for any number of
      reasons.

115   INT. BANK OFFICE - MORNING                                                   115

      Paul sits in the manager's office, signing forms.  A large BANK GUARD stands
      nearby.  The reason? One million dollars in hundred dollar bills neatly stacked
      on the desk.

116   INT. OUTDOOR CLOTHING STORE - DAY                                            116

      Paul, with his sack of one million dollars at his feet, is calmly trying on new
      winter coats with a CLERK.  He feels each one, checking the amount of
      padding.  He finally settles on a red full-length down parka.

117   INT. "BARNELL GREAT ESCAPES TRAVEL" - LATER                                  117

      The lights are back on as Paul, wearing his oversized red parka comes
      through the front door carrying his sack of cash.  Avis looks up.

                                  AVIS
              Mr. Barnell?  I didn't expect you back today.  Nice
              jacket.

                                  PAUL
              Well... I am.  And Avis?

                                  AVIS
              Yes?

                                  PAUL
              You've been with me for five years?  Paul?  Can we
              make it Paul?

      Paul enters the back room, closes the door.  Avis walks over.

                                  AVIS
              Sure.  I just thought it was more professional when
              people were around to call you Mr. Barnell.

                                  PAUL (O.S.)
              Avis.  There haven't been any people in here for
              months.  No one comes in here, unless they're
              looking for pornographic movies or deep fried fish,
              neither of which we carry.  So you can call me pretty
              much anything you want and it won't impress the
              customers at all because we don't have any.

                                  AVIS
              Are you OK, Paul?

      Paul opens the door.  Avis is surprised to see billowing clouds of down floating
      in the air behind him.

                                  PAUL
              No Avis, to be frank I'm a little frazzled right now.
              Now could you get me some tape, my passport out
              of the safe and two open-ended tickets to Paraguay.

      Paul shuts the door.  Avis gets to work.

118   INT.  COFFEE ROOM - DAY                                                      118

      ARNITH and BILL, two city workers, sit sipping coffee at a cafeteria table.  The
      room is white, very clean and fairly new.  The men wear large orange overalls,
      their white construction safety helmets sit on the table beside them.

                                  ARNITH
              Trouble is the city keeps cutting us back and cutting
              us back.

      Raymond and Paul, wearing his big red parka, enter.

                                  PAUL
              Excuse me, are you Arnith?

      ARNITH sips his coffee, points to his name patch but doesn't look up.

                                  PAUL (cont'd)
              Great.  I was told to give you this.

      Paul hands Arnith a folded form.  Arnith puts his hand out, forcing Paul to move
      the form to him.  As Arnith looks at it.

                                  PAUL (cont'd)
              Disinterment order.  Got it from the coroner's office.
              My brother didn't want to be buried.

                                  ARNITH
              How'd you know?

                                  PAUL
              Know what?

                                  ARNITH
              That he didn't want to be buried.

                                  RAYMOND
              He left it in a letter.

                                  ARNITH
              And you just got it now?

                                  PAUL
              Ya know, I don't mean to be rude here, but I'm not
              sure this is any of your business.

                                  ARNITH
              That's entirely possible.

      Bill stifles a LAUGH.  Raymond is about to tear out Arnith's spine.  Paul holds
      his brother back.

                                  PAUL
              I, I don't think this is anything to be flippant about.

                                  ARNITH
              I appreciate that, Sir.  But I'm on a union specified
              break right now, which means you are talking to me
              as a private citizen. Now as a private citizen I can
              pretty much say whatever I want to. If
               you talk to me in 15 minutes I can assure you, you
              will be afforded every courtesy as specified in the
              workers policy guide and recently ratified in our
              latest collective agreement dated --

                                  PAUL
              Sorry.  I'm just --

                                  ARNITH
              Trying to get your brother out of the ground. We
              couldn't be more pleased.  You've arranged for
              transportation of the remains?

                                  RAYMOND
              We're gonna take him to go.

                                  BILL
              See, now that's a problem.  We can't release the
              body into your custody unless you are licensed by
              the state to convey deceased persons.

                                  ARNITH
              Good point Bill.  Bill knows exhumation policy.  You
              can look it up but I'm betting he's right.  You come
              back with a bonded agent and we'll get right on this.

      Paul thinks for a moment, digs into his pocket pulls out five crisp, new hundred
      dollar bills and SLAMS them on the table.

                                  PAUL
              I'll give you five hundred dollars to go get him now.

      A large back hoe TURNS OVER.  The muffler BELCHES a cloud of black
      smoke into the air.  Arnith is at the controls, expertly maneuvering the shovel
      end towards the unmarked grave.

      Black.  The trunk lid opens as Bill and Arnith dump a well-wrapped body
      unceremoniously into the trunk.  Arnith and Bill look at each other.  Bill closes
      the lid.  Black.

                                  ARNITH (O.S.)
              There ya go Mr. Barnell.  Snug as a bug in a rug.

      Ted sits at the bar beside Cam.  Ted, close to being drunk, plays with a book of
      matches as a STRIPPER struts to Tennessee Ernie Ford's version of "16
      Tons."

                                  CAM
              So... Miami, huh?  Can you believe that?  One little
              case and "boom", you're the flavor of the month.

                                  TED
                        (without a trace of sincerity)
              Congratulations.  Why are you here?

                                  CAM
              Say thanks.  I really owe you.  If you hadn't given me
              a shot on that--

                                  TED
              Forget it.  I'm trying to.

                                  CAM
              So we were all kinda wondering... what did happen
              to your face?

                                  TED
                        (beat)
              Car trouble.

      Ted gets up, a little shaky on his feet.

                                  CAM
              Should you be driving?

                                  TED
              Absolutely not.

      Ted gets up and walks to the door.

      Ted exits, a BLAST of Arctic wind and snow hits him in the face.  He closes his
      eyes, letting the cold run over him.

      Margaret sits at the dinner table, as Gary puts down an overly large serving
      plate of tuna casserole.  Jimbo walks in, takes a seat and a scoop full of food.

                                  GARY
              We set?

                                  JIMBO
              Yeah.  How you feel about the turnout by Summit Hill
              where the snowmobilers park?

                                  GARY
              Fine.

      They all dig in.  Gary looks expectantly.  Just the sound of chewing.  Finally, he
      can't wait.

                                  GARY (cont'd)
                        (to Jimbo)
              You like it?

                                  MARGARET
              Tastes like a rectal polyp.

      A long, protracted silence.  Then...

                                  JIMBO
                        (to Gary)
              How would she know.

      Gary CHUCKLES as he gets up for some ketchup.  Margaret stares at Jimbo,
      who gives her a "I'll-say-what-I-need-to-have-peace-in-this-house."  Margaret
      smiles, then discretely slides him the salt.  Jimbo quickly douses his food.

123   EXT.  PAUL'S HOUSE - LATE AT NIGHT                                           123

      Ted pulls up in front of Paul's home.  He stares at something that looks like a
      tree on the front lawn.  He looks closer -- it's a "For Sale" sign.

                                  TED
              Blowing town, are we, Mr. Barnell?  I don't think so.

      Ted staggers through the snow to the sign and drunkenly pushes it down into
      the snow.

                                  TED (cont'd)
              I'm not done yet "travel man!"  You hear me?!

      LAUGHING, he takes some matches from his pocket and tries to light the "For
      Sale" sign on fire.  It's no use.  He quits.  He's cold now.  He gets up and
      staggers back to his car.

      Raymond, half in the bag, sits on the sofa.

                                  RAYMOND
              See, I could have had her.  We both know that, but I
              figured, she was such a... I mean, I don't know why...
              You know why?

                                  PAUL (O.S.)
              No.  You want a refill?

                                  RAYMOND
              Does a duck shit under water?

      Paul walks in with two glasses.  He hands Raymond the larger.

                                  RAYMOND (cont'd)
              Any trouble getting the bank to handle that much
              cash?

                                  PAUL
              They said it'd be in tomorrow by --

                                  RAYMOND
              Right, right, you told me.  Then all we have to do is
              get her and the thing... Hey, remember that time in
              school, when I jumped out and scared you, and you
              fucking pee'd all over yourself?

                                  PAUL
              Was pretty funny.
                        (raises his mug)
              Bottoms up.

                                  RAYMOND
              Okay, "Puddles."  Remember how they called you
              that?  Huh, "Puddles?"
                        (about to drink - then)
              Christ, what time is it?

      A beautiful winter's night, the soft snowy silence broken only by Raymond's
      drunken shot of...

                                  RAYMOND (O.S.)
              Pussy!!!

      A startled rabbit scurries across the snow.

      Raymond is passed out on the sofa.  Paul sits, gun in hand, the barrel pointed
      at Raymond's forehead.  His finger grazes the trigger...  but it's suddenly all too
      real.  Paul lowers the gun, takes a deep breath and tries again.  Not wanting to
      be sprayed by Raymond's gray matter, he half turns his head...  Another idea
      comes to him.  Paul picks up a plastic picnic plate to use as a shield from the
      blow back.

      He gets ready to fire again, then makes the mistake of looking at Raymond.
      Maybe it's the light... maybe it's the small puddle of drool on the cushion, but he
      looks almost angelic.  Paul stares at his brother.

      In the kitchen, Paul fills a glass with water, empties the pistol's bullets into
      The cup and hides it on the top shelf.

      Paul puts the gun back.  Not sure of his next move, he spots the beat up clock
      radio lying next to his brother.

      Margaret, still tied up, lays on top of the bed covers.

      Gary walks past, looks in, checks his watch, then heads to the bathroom.

      Margaret listens as Gary turns on the jacuzzi tub jets.  As he starts singing,
      Margaret sits up and scooches over to the phone on the end table.  Her hands
      tied loosely to her chest, she manages to dial by placing the phone receiver flat
      on the bed.

              Gary!  You seen my shirt?

      Margaret looks over to see Jimbo, wearing Paul's pajamas, walking past while
      shaving with a portable razor.  As the line rings.

                                  JIMBO (O.S.) (cont'd)
              Aw jeez, again?

                                  GARY (O.S.)
              It relaxes me.  You know it has twelve different
              settings?

                                  JIMBO (O.S.)
              No Gary, I don't know that because every time I
              thought about using it someone was in it.

                                  GARY (O.S.)

      Paul, quiet as a mouse and dressed in his money-lined parka, picks up his
      cell and his car keys, drops them quietly into his pocket.  Just as he finishes...

      A woozy Ted is trying to keep Tiffany's phone from RINGING.

      Finally, he puts on the headset and hits a computer key.  It connects.

              Yeah?  Hello?  (coughs)  Hello?

      He hits a few keys on the computer keyboard.  The screen pops to life.  The line
      connects.

      He pulls off a yellow Post It note stuck to the computer.  It reads:  "Coffee made.
      Don't touch my computer.  Back in 10."

      Unseen on the computer screen beside him, the name "Margaret Barnell"
      pops up, along with all her pertinent information like pet's name, husband,
      delusions...

              man with a gun in my shower, right now?

      Tiffany shoves Ted, who loses his balance and stumbles backward.  She puts
      on the headset.

                        (listening to a profane ramble)
              Well then it's a good thing you called.  Nope, not
              seeing any problems, but hang on, let me really
              concentrate.

      Margaret hears the shower stop running.

                                  MARGARET
              Shit on toast.

      She hangs up, places the gag back in her mouth and hustles back into place.

      Ted, pulls on his boots and his jacket.  In his hand, an address scribbled down
      on a piece of note paper.  Tiffany watches, not happy.

                                  TED
              You're sure this is it?

                                  TIFFANY
              She specifically mentioned the cock-sucking turnout
              up the highway where the snowmobilers hang out.

                                  TED
              I'll call later.

                                  TIFFANY
              I won't be here.

                                  TED
              Excuse me?

      The phone RINGS.  Tiffany lets it.

                                  TIFFANY
              I know relationships aren't all sunshine and roses,
              but I'm really not having fun anymore, and I don't
              think you are either.

                                  TED
              God, now's so not the time, Tiff.

                                  TIFFANY
              Maybe you have to be like this right now, and I'm just
              not in a good space to deal with it.  But...

                                  TED
              But what?

                                  TIFFANY
              Maybe we shouldn't be like this together.

      Tiffany gives him that look every man who's ever crossed the line for the last
      time is all too familiar with.

      Ted stares.  Words fail him.  Finally, his only recourse is to hurry out the door
      which shuts with a BANG.  Tiffany lets the phone continue to RING as she
      stares at the door.  Sadly, she hits the computer key that picks it up.

                                  TIFFANY (cont'd)
              Psychic Buddies.  How are you Mr. Bennett?  I think
              she'd be fine with you remarrying, but hang on, let
              me concentrate.

      Ted opens the door, steps back inside.

                                  TED
              OK.  Come on.

                                  TIFFANY
                        (to Ted)
              Really?

                                  TED
              I've been cutting you out of my life and as a result our
              normal communication channels have been
              blocked.  I think you coming with me would... would...

      He's reaching, but Tiffany looks cautiously hopeful.

              interpersonalism.

                                  TIFFANY
              If you're going to be sarcastic.

                                  TED
              I'm not being anything.  Swear to God.

                                  TIFFANY
              Okay.  Why do you want me to come?

                                  TED
                        (total sincerity)
              Cause if you don't, then I'll have to stay, and I'll be
              mad at you and eventually we'll break up over it, and
              as bad as my life is right now, that would make it a
              million times worse.

      Tiffany smiles, genuinely touched.

      Paul drives, smiling for the first time in a long time.  He listens to the
      beautifully wrenching Iz-Kamakawiwo'Ole's version of "Somewhere Over the Rainbow"
      on the radio.  (The music continues over the next two scenes.)

141   EXT. TED'S APARTMENT BUILDING - LATER                                        141

      Ted and Tiffany walk out to their car.  They sneak looks at each other, not
      entirely sure what emotional sign-post they just passed.

      Gary and Jimbo, with Margaret, hands bound, walk into the garage.  Jodie (the
      dog) runs out after them.  Margaret looks at Jimbo, who takes the dog and
      gently puts him back inside.

                                  TIFFANY
              Okay, it's called the listening game.  You talk, I listen,
              and I can't interrupt.  Then we switch.

                                  TED
              Doesn't sound like much of a game, but...  I can talk
              about anything?

                                  TIFFANY
              Yes.

      Ted smiles, and launches in...

144   INT. JIMBO'S CAR / CITY STREETS - LATER                                      144

      Gary leans into the backseat and holds a magazine in front of Margaret's face.

                                  GARY
              See the little box down there?  Lists all the
              symptoms of that Tourette's thing, and you don't
              have half of them.

              And?  And you're faking it.

                                  MARGARET
              Magazines don't prove anything.

                                  JIMBO

              That little prick!!!

      As the camera rushes the mobile home, from inside comes the sounds of a
      very angry man.  Then, just as we're at the door, it SLAMS OPEN.  Raymond
      stands in the doorway, a mountain of anger in a hastily pulled on parka.

      He's holding the clock radio by the cord.  He checks his wristwatch, then
      smashes the clock radio against the trailer.

      Stalking toward his car, he checks the pistol in his side pocket, then, almost as
      an afterthought, opens the clip.  No bullets.  He smiles.

      A not-well-frequented tourist spot, featuring an expansive, far-as-the-eye-can
      see carpet of white.  The road from the turnoff is about 200 yards long, leading
      to a plowed out parking area.  The road is the only way in or out.  Paul's car
      takes the corner and heads toward the parking area.

              It's a thought, okay.  With hard work, you can live okay
              as a civilian.

              Don't you go soft on me, Jimbo.

      Margaret LAUGHS through  her gag in the backseat.  Gary and Jimbo pretend
      not to hear her.  They drive on in silence.

      Tiffany and Ted drive.  Ted has just finished.  Tiffany has been paying rapt
      attention.

                                  TIFFANY
              So this is kind of like a really weird "Law and Order"
              episode?

              Sure.  I guess.

      go off.  She looks up to see Raymond walking in, gun in hand.  Raymond lays it

      Ted's car pulls up at the far end of the lot, about 200 yards from where Paul,
      Gary and Jimbo are parked.  Paul's car is in between Ted's car and Jimbo's.

      Paul gets out of his car, as do Jimbo and Gary.  Paul looks for Margaret in the
      back of Jimbo's car, but she remains lying down on the backseat.

                                  JIMBO
              Mr. Barnell.  I'll assume you've got our friend back

      Tiffany gives him a quick kiss.

                                  TIFFANY
              That's a very good plan.

      Ted's about to jump out of the car, but has to pull back his door as another
      vehicle slides in beside them, the driver locking his brakes and sliding into the
      snow embankment.

      Black.  The lid opens.  Jimbo, Gary and Paul look in at the frozen body.  Jimbo
      recoils at the mangled mess before him.  Gary reaches down and touches the

              Go away, now.

      Raymond walks on.  Ted, realizing he has no choice, runs and jumps in front of
      Raymond, blocking his way.

      drops to his knees, but even as Raymond tries to walk off, Ted manages to
      grab his ankle.

157   INT. TED'S CAR                                                               157

      Tiffany is busy fiddling with the radio, missing the fight just outside her window
      as she tunes in the Beach Boys "Wouldn't It Be Nice."

158   EXT. PARKING AREA / BY PAUL'S CAR                                            158

      At Jimbo's car, Gary is folding the corpse into the trunk as Jimbo pulls Margaret
      upright from the backseat and tugs down her gag.  She smiles at him as, with
      great care, he helps her out of the car and presents her to her husband.

                                  PAUL
              It's all over honey.  It's all over.  Did they hurt you?

                                  MARGARET
                        (smiling/whisper)
              Does food poisoning count?  Have you been eating?

                                  PAUL
              You know me when I get busy.

      She touches the bruise under his eye.

                                  MARGARET
              Did you fall?

                                  PAUL
              Just a little.
                        (to Jimbo)
              Hey, we're gonna get...

      That's when Paul sees what Jimbo and Gary are watching.

      Raymond kicks Ted in the head, turns, spots Paul and breaks into a run.

      Paul seems frozen, but just for a moment.

                                  JIMBO
              Who the hell is that?

                                  MARGARET
              Paul?

      Paul discretely takes off his red parka and drapes it over Margaret's shoulders.

                                  PAUL
                        (quietly)
              Honey, I need you to start walking to that hill over
              there, alright?

                                  MARGARET
              Why?

                                  PAUL
              I'll catch up in a bit.  Now, no matter what you hear,
              just keep going, alright.  And if I'm... late or
              something, just look in the coat, alright?

      Margaret nods, kisses her husband quickly on the cheek, then starts to walk
      off.

      Paul, Gary and Jimbo watch, transfixed at the down-parka'd shit-storm that is
      headed their way.

                                  GARY
                        (nervous)
              Jimbo?

                                  RAYMOND
                        (yelling)
              A million dollars, Paul!?  You really think you could
              take me?  Again!

                                  JIMBO
              What million dollars?

      Gary and Jimbo look over at Paul, somewhat confused. Raymond's ten yards
      out, and they can now see he's taken out his gun.  He's aiming it at Paul.

      Paul looks over his shoulder at Margaret, who's having some trouble making it
      up a snow covered hill.

      Gary's hand slips into his pocket, grabbing hold of his gun.  Raymond,
      oblivious, moves right past.

159   INT. TED'S CAR                                                               159

      Tiffany finally looks over at Ted, who's just getting to his feet.  She bursts out 
      of the car...

160   EXT. PARKING AREA / BY PAUL'S CAR                                            160

      Raymond reaches Paul, takes the gun and points it at the top of his head.
      Paul's eyes shut tight, expecting the worst.

                                  PAUL
              Raymond... please.

      But shooting your brother is tougher than it looks. Paul opens his eyes.
      Raymond tries to pull the trigger again, but can't. He moves the barrel six
      inches to the right and shoots Margaret in the back.  She drops face first into
      the snow.

      Paul's world ends.

      Ears RINGING, he rushes toward his wife.

      Jimbo can't believe it as Gary holds him back.

                                  JIMBO
              Hey!  What the fuck!!

      Raymond, a look of relief on his face, turns to Jimbo.

                                  JIMBO (cont'd)
              She had nothing to do with this!

                                  RAYMOND
              And you do?

      But even before Raymond can raise his weapon, Gary pulls his gun and gets it
      pointed (shakily) at Raymond.

                                  RAYMOND (cont'd)
              Oh put it down, Nancy.

                                  GARY
              You first.

                                  JIMBO
              Gary!  Just --

      Raymond drops his gun to his side.  Gary smiles, too happy he won the face
      off.

                                  RAYMOND
              You win, tough guy.

      Gary, trying to be cool, flips the gun to his other hand.  As he does-- BANG!  The
      bullet rips into the snow about six feet from Raymond's feet.

      Raymond glares at Gary.  So does Jimbo.

                                  GARY
                        (meek, apologetic)
              Sorry.

      Jimbo lunges for cover as Raymond FIRES back.  Gary, truly terrified, closes
      his eyes as he squeezes off shots on the run -- BANGBANGBANGBANG.

      One bullet bounces off Paul's car.  One hits Raymond.  With a quizzical look on
      his face, he drops to his knees.  A large crimson stain forms on his jacket.
      Everything goes quiet, except for the sounds coming from...

      Paul, almost crazed with grief, cradles his wife's body.

                                  PAUL
              Oh God... Oh Jesus...

                                  MARGARET
                        (muffled)
              Oh fucking hell... I can't... breath.

      Paul gently turns her over.  Margaret, alive, unharmed but winded, tries to catch
      her breath.

                                  MARGARET (cont'd)
              Paul...  Someone kicked me.

      Paul feels around the bullet hole and pulls out a stack of money, now
      embedded with the slug from the Raymond's gun.  He starts to weep tears of
      relief.

                                  PAUL
              Can you stand.

                                  MARGARET
              Is... The Pope... a...

                                  PAUL
              Okay, easy...

      Gary is behind the other car with Jimbo.

                                  GARY
                        (starting to lose it)
              He just, fell... Oh Jesus, oh God.

      Jimbo gently takes Gary's gun.

                                  JIMBO
              I know.

      As Jimbo puts an arm around Gary and helps him to the car, he sees Paul,
      arm around Margaret, coming their way.  Everyone stops.  A look passes, then
      both couples move off.

161   EXT. PARKING AREA - CONTINUOUS                                               161

      As Jimbo and Gary drive away, Paul brings Margaret to his vehicle.  Spotting
      Raymond, he walks over, kicks the gun away, then leans down.  Raymond's not
      dead, but he's close.

      Paul has to turn away.

                                  RAYMOND
                        (laboured)
              Look at me, you little...

      Paul turns back, not angry, not frightened, just a little sad.  Raymond, taken
      aback for a moment, tries for one last verbal shot, but all he can manage is...

                                  RAYMOND (cont'd)
              Puddles.

      And Raymond dies.

162   EXT. PARKING AREA - CONTINUOUS                                               162

      Paul turns back to his car when he spots a delirious, damaged Ted stumbling
      toward him with Tiffany desperate to drag him the other way.

                                  TED
              Where do think you're going?

                                  TIFFANY
              Ted, leave him alone.

                                  TED
              No, no, no.  I have been beaten, humiliated, had my
              head squeezed by a guy... and I am getting some
              answers, right now.

      Ted, barely able to stay on his feet (concussion) gets in front of Paul, and just
      stands there and waits.  Paul can't help but feel bad for the guy.

                                  PAUL
              Okay.

                                  TED
              Well go ahead.
                        (re: his left ear)
              I can still kind of hear out of this one.

                                  PAUL
                        (a long pause)
              I love my wife, Mr. Watters.  And when you love
              someone, I mean, really love someone...

      The punch hits Paul on the top of his head.  He stumbles back, but Ted is on
      him before he can move out of range.  It's a strange looking fight between the
      younger (physically spent) and older (emotionally drained).

                                  TED
                        (between punches)
              I want a fucking Hallmark card or the lyrics to a
              Foreigner rock ballad, I'll go to the mall, Mr. Barnell.

      Margaret and Tiffany jump in, trying to pull the two men apart.

163   INT. PAUL'S CAR - LATER                                                      163

      The car is still in the parking area.  Paul and a bloody, beaten Ted sit up front
      with Margaret and Tiffany in the back.  No one speaks, until...

                                  TIFFANY
              They call this the listening game.  Mr. Barnell, you
              get to go first.

      Ted glares at Tiffany, but her look instantly softens him.  Ted looks at Margaret,
      who looks expectantly at Paul.  Ted shrugs.

                                  TED
              Knock yourself out.

      Paul starts to talk, and Ted starts to listen...

      Arnith (the grave digger) walks to the side of a casket.  He hits the switch and it
      starts to drop.  Arnith watches impassively, taking brief note of two people up
      the hill before returning to his work.

165   EXT. GRAVEYARD HILL - CONTINUOUS                                             165

      It's Gary and Jimbo, dressed in black.  They watch silently as Raymond is laid
      to rest.

      The sun beats down on a white sand tropical paradise.  The wind is calm, the
      water azure blue.  Perfection, except for the -- SNOW.  Big pure white flakes,
      cutting across this idyllic --

      Poster that hangs in a BOOK STORE window.  We are...

167   EXT. STREET / LIBERTY CAPITAL TOWERS - DAY                                   167

      Tiffany stares at her reflection in the window, her face transported to an island
      paradise.  Ted walks out.

                                  TIFFANY
              Hey.

                                  TED
              Hey yourself.

                                  TIFFANY
              So where you want to go?

                                  TED
              Somewhere close.  My three o'clock's been moved
              up.

                                  TIFFANY
              Cool.  You alright about everything?

                                  TED
              Yeah.  The life policy was written on his brother, and
              he did, you know, die.  I may be rationalizing a bit, but
              ethically I think I'm okay.

                                  TIFFANY
              Good.  I like it when you're okay.

      The two walk down the street.  Snow keeps falling.  Tiffany shuts her eyes,
      looks straight up as the gossamer snowflakes land and melt on her face.
      She's never looked more beautiful.

                                  TIFFANY (cont'd)
              Don't ya just love this weather?

      Ted stares at her.

                                  TED
              Learning to.

      Tiffany grabs his hand and pulls him away, disappearing into the whiteness.

      Paul, sitting alone, reads a postcard from Margaret.

                                  MARGARET (V.O.)
              Pauly, know it sounds corny but I miss you so much!
              Wish you could have come.  Saw some dolphins
              today.  Frisky little buggers.  They were even playing
              our song in the bar.  Have been pondering about
              your question, and I think my answer is "yes."  After
              all, it's no fun in the sun without...

                                  MARGARET (O.S.) (cont'd)
              Paul, you ready?

      Paul looks up to see Margaret.  Dressed in a coat, she is standing in the
      middle of the living room, now empty save for a few boxes and a very ugly floor
      lamp.

      Paul flips Margaret's letter over, and we now see it is the faded Hawaiian Hilton
      postcard from the box in his den.

      Paul puts the postcard in a shoe box full of keepsakes, and tucks it under his
      arm.  Margaret picks up Jodie, whose in his carrying case, and walks over.

      A CAR HORN sounds from outside.  It's their cab.  As they walk to the door...

                                  PAUL
              How you feeling?

                                  MARGARET
              Pretty damn good.

                                  PAUL
              I can tell.

                                  MARGARET
              Can you?

      Paul takes her hand and gives it a squeeze.  They head out.

      Snowing now, as various PEOPLE walk toward the aircraft and the portable
      stairs rolled to the door.

      Paul and Margaret among the crowd, exchange nervous but hopeful smiles,
      then they are lost along with the other pilgrims in the swirling white.

                                                                        FADE TO BLACK.

      Dave and his WIFE (50s) walk out of their house toward their  car.  They get in,
      Dave behind the wheel.

171   INT. DAVE'S CAR - CONTINUOUS                                                 171

      As they pull down the driveway.

                                  DAVE
              Why don't we go there after?
                        (off her look)
              Fine.  We'll do it now.

                                  DAVE'S WIFE
              Watch the curb.

      Dave keeps backing up.  As he takes the corner and bumps over the curb, the
      momentum sends the half-eaten body (that Gary and Jimbo stuffed into the
      backseat) to an upright position.

      They drive on, oblivious.

                                  DAVE
              Looks like weather.

               In a Russian summer meadow, a young girl spins around and 
               around. A simple guitar theme plays as the low sun catches 
               her hair. Around her neck is a pair of field binoculars, and 
               she runs through the meadow with them pressed to her face, 
               spying butterflies, birds, rabbits. She reaches the top of a 
               hillock, and jumps into the air, and flies up into the sky. 
               We float up and up with her as she aims the binoculars up, 
               up, into the sun.

                                                       FADE THROUGH SUN TO:

               An aerial shot of the rolling English countryside. Nothing 
               but fields and trees for miles. The shot describes a panorama 
               before looking directly down, at the earth, and we begin to 
               move.

               We fly low over a field, a ditch and straight out over six 
               lanes of motorway. Cars and lorries tear below at a hundred 
               miles an hour. We fly over the hard shoulder to another field 
               beyond.

               We descend on two young boys in the field. A pornographic 
               magazine is spread out of the flattened grass. One of the 
               boys puts a match to the centre page and as the flames lick 
               up, we begin to move again, across the field, over a path 
               and into a suburban garden.

               We fly over five or six gardens, over a barbecue, over 
               children splashing in a pool, over a woman sunbathing, a man 
               mowing his lawn, a young boy bouncing up and down on a garden 
               trampoline, to arrive on the patio of John Buckingham. He 
               walks out onto the patio, where he sits in a chair, facing 
               his house, setting down a mug of tea.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               A blurred face sharpening into focus, John Buckingham, about 
               thirty-two, sitting on his patio, his garden behind, fields 
               beyond.

                                     JOHN
                         Hello.

               His hand adjusts a microphone on his lapel.

                                     JOHN
                         Hello, hello. Hello...

               He shifts in his chair. Coughs. He looks straight at us.

                                     JOHN
                         I don't believe in perfect love. You 
                         know, love that comes out of the sky 
                         like a thunderbolt and uh... This is 
                         ridiculous.

               He removes the microphone. He sits there, thinking very hard.

                                     JOHN
                         No. No no no. Nope.

               He stands, turns and stretches.

                                                                  BLACKOUT:

               FADE UP:

               He is sitting as before, looking at us.

                                     JOHN
                         Running. Reading. Going out. Staying 
                         in. The countryside. Films, if they're 
                         good.

                                                                  BLACKOUT:

               FADE UP:

                                     JOHN
                         Thoughtful. Outgoing. Ambitious. 
                         Well-read. Reasonably popular. 
                         Balanced. Trusting. Quite attractive. 
                         Outgoing.

                                                                  BLACKOUT:

               FADE UP:

                                     JOHN
                         Someone intelligent, of course. Kind. 
                         Pretty I suppose. But its not 
                         critical.

               EXT. JOHN'S STREET - DAY

               John watches while two removal men lift a new double bed 
               from the back of a van.

                                     JOHN (V.O.)
                         Someone with a sense of humour. 
                         Someone you can communicate with on 
                         the same level. Someone you can really 
                         talk to. I think communication is 
                         key.

               INT. BEDROOM - DAY

               John's hands smooth a crisp white sheet over the double 
               mattress. An ant runs across the sheet. John squashes it and 
               picks it carefully off.

                                     JOHN (V.O.)
                         I think that by the time most people 
                         turn thirty they know where they're 
                         going.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. GARDEN - DAY

               John encircles his house, leaving a thick trail of yellow 
               powder behind him.

                                     JOHN (V.O.)
                         And where they've been. I suppose 
                         they have some baggage stroke history.

               EXT. THE GARDEN RECORDING - DAY

               We see that John is talking to his PC. It has a small digital 
               camera on the side.

                                     JOHN
                         We all have someone in our past who 
                         uh... one skeleton, if you like. 
                         We've all got at least one person, 
                         as it were, under the patio. Not 
                         literally of course. I suppose I 
                         only say this because I always thought 
                         people who did this sort of thing 
                         were... I had an image that they 
                         were losers. Not losers. A bit sad. 
                         But I think this is the modern world. 
                         And I think really it's quite a brave 
                         move. Quite a brave, reasonable thing 
                         to do.

               He smiles.

                                     JOHN
                         Sorry can we start again?

               SINGLE CARD ON BLACK:

                                      BIRTHDAY GIRL

               John's fingers in close-up, type JOHN BUCKINGHAM, and his 
               AMEX number into his PC. Finished, he stops, and rests his 
               face on his hands.

               He hits SEND. That instant, a worry of black crows bursts up 
               in the field behind him and takes to the swirling air.

               Blackout. Music. Titles.

               The titles pop and slide over footage of Russian women, on 
               computer video, advertising themselves. They mostly speak in 
               Russian, some of which is subtitled, some speak in English. 
               The women slide on and off the screen, overlap and collide, 
               as the titles appear. Close-ups on mouths and eyes, tight 
               and pixellated. It becomes a wall of image and sound.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. SKY - DAY

               The GIGANTIC UNDERSIDE of a Boeing 747 TEARS down the screen.

               INT. AIRPORT TRAVELATOR - DAY

               John slides across the screen, motionless, towards Arrivals.

               INT. AIRPORT - DAY.

               Last calls for flights leaving for the other side of the 
               world.

               Travellers criss-cross and swirl.

               INT. AIRPORT MAIN ARRIVALS BOARD - DAY

               BA 1880 MOSCOW On time.

               INT. AIRPORT RESTROOM - DAY

               He dries his face with a paper towel, then checks himself in 
               the mirror. He looks okay, a little white.

               INT. ARRIVALS GATE - DAY

               The Arrivals gate slides open and passengers flood through. 
               John stands among the chauffeurs and cab drivers, as the 
               passengers trundle by.

               We follow one young woman long enough to think this must be 
               her, but it's a false alarm, she's lifted up and spun around 
               by someone else.

               They've all passed. That's that. She wasn't on the flight.

               John wanders away from the gate. He stands about in the swirl 
               in the middle of the airport. People bustle by. Everyone 
               going somewhere.

               Gradually, we get the sense we are being watched. A woman 
               stands nearby. She is about twenty, very beautiful, tired 
               and laden with luggage.

                                     JOHN
                         Nadia?

               She nods.

                                     JOHN
                         I'm John.

               They shake hands.

                                     JOHN
                         Welcome.
                              (pause)
                         Well. Look I didn't have a speech 
                         but...

               A distorted passenger announcement breaks above us. It's too 
               loud to talk. It ends and they stand there in silence. He 
               points to her luggage.

                                     JOHN
                         Is that everything?

                                     NADIA
                         Yes.

                                     JOHN
                         Right. Okay. Good.

               They stand there.

               INT. AIRPORT LIFT - DAY

               Nadia and John stand side by side in a huge lift.

                                     JOHN
                         We can talk in the car.

               A deafening roll of thunder.

               EXT. AIRPORT CAR PARK - DAY

               It's pouring with rain as they cross the car park towards a 
               patched up yellow Rover. John stows the suitcase in the boot 
               and opens the passenger door for her.

               INT. / EXT. JOHN'S CAR (MOVING) - DAY

               John turns the key in the ignition. The MG wheezes and coughs. 
               He tries again. Nothing. The third time it just catches and 
               he coaxes it to life. The colour's drained from his cheeks.

               They head for the motorway. The silence in the car lasts 
               just long enough for John to feel he is breaking it.

                                     JOHN
                         It's about forty miles from here. I 
                         don't know if you've looked at a 
                         map, it's close to London but it's a 
                         city in itself. A Roman city. It's a 
                         nice house. I'm having a problem 
                         with ants. I uh... It's the warmer 
                         weather. I can't seem to find the 
                         nest. Sorry, do you understand "ants"?

                                     NADIA
                         Yes.

                                     JOHN
                         I just can't find a nest. The root 
                         of the problem. I've looked 
                         everywhere. What's the Russian for 
                         ant? Sorry that's a stupid... Sorry. 
                         This is strange isn't it.

                                     NADIA
                         Yes.

                                     JOHN
                         I'm pretty nervous. Are you?

                                     NADIA
                         Yes.

                                     JOHN
                         I mean... "Ants." "I've got a problem 
                         with ants."

               He shakes his head.

                                     JOHN
                         I had this...

               He pulls a sign from his jacket which says "Nadia!"

                                     JOHN
                         As a joke but uh...

               He tosses it onto the back seat.

               They drive. He sees Nadia looking at England.

                                     JOHN
                         So. Is it different to how you 
                         imagined it?

                                     NADIA
                         Yes.

                                     JOHN
                         I bet.
                              (pause)
                         What about me? Am I how you imagined?

                                     NADIA
                         Yes.

               He double-takes, changes lanes.

                                     JOHN
                         And how was the flight. Sorry, am I 
                         speaking too fast for you?

                                     NADIA
                         Yes.

               John looks across.

                                     JOHN
                         Do uh... Sorry. Can you follow me? 
                         Do you understand what I'm saying?

                                     NADIA
                         Yes.

                                     JOHN
                         Good. Or should I speak slower?

                                     NADIA
                         Yes.

                                     JOHN
                         Do you follow or should I speak 
                         slower?

                                     NADIA
                         Yes.

               He looks across. Back at the road. He changes gear.

                                     JOHN
                         Uh... Are you a giraffe?

                                     NADIA
                         Yes.

               John turns to face the road ahead.

                                     JOHN
                              (to himself)
                         Oh Jesus.

               He drives in silence.

                                     JOHN
                         Oh Jesus.

               Suddenly she winds the window down and vomits out of the 
               speeding car. John panics and swerves onto the hard shoulder 
               amidst loud horn blasts.

               EXT. HARD SHOULDER - DAY

               John navigates his way round the Rover in the rain to find 
               her kneeling on the verge, throwing up. He puts a hand on 
               her shoulder, but she stands up quickly, maintaining an icy 
               dignity considering what has just happened.

               EXT. JOHN'S CLOSE - DAY

               It has stopped raining and a group of young boys are playing 
               cricket in the road. They clear as a Yellow Rover pulls into 
               the Close, and into the drive of the little house at the 
               end.

               As John climbs out of his car he eyes the boys. The boys eye 
               him, and his new friend.

               INT. JOHN'S HOUSE - DAY

               The front door closes behind them. John and Nadia stand in 
               the silence of his hallway. There is a small banner hanging 
               there: "Welcome Nadia". They study the banner together, 
               gravely.

               Eventually he opens a door.

                                     JOHN
                              (quietly)
                         Lounge.

               She peers round him and looks inside. He leads her down 
               towards the kitchen.

                                     JOHN
                         Kitchen.

               She glances around it. Then back at John. He nods to himself, 
               looking tense and pale.

               INT. JOHN'S UPSTAIRS LANDING - DAY

               He puts her suitcase down on the landing, and opens a door. 
               Without looking inside:

                                     JOHN
                         Bathroom.

               He closes it.

               INT. MAIN BEDROOM - DAY

               Standing in the doorway of John's bedroom.

                                     JOHN
                         Bedroom.

               There it is. The Double Bed. John frowns gravely.

               Without warning, he marches out. She comes out onto the 
               landing to catch John plus suitcase kicking open another 
               door and vanishing inside.

               INT. SPARE BEDROOM - DAY

               Nadia peers around the door to find John standing next to a 
               narrow monk-like single bed.

                                     JOHN
                         The uh... the other bedroom...

               She looks at it, then up at John. She turns and walks out.

               Now she's back, with her camouflaged hold-all, dumps it onto 
               the floor, heaves the suitcase onto the bed and smoking no-
               hands, starts unpacking. John plugs in the lamp by the bed. 
               To show Nadia how it works he switches it on, off, on, off, 
               and then feels stupid.

                                     JOHN
                         I'll get an ashtray.

               With John gone, Nadia stops unpacking. She walks to the window 
               and stares out over the rooftops of the estate.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. LOUNGE - DAY

               John on the phone.

                                     ANSWER MACHINE
                         You have reached From Russia with 
                         Love. Our office reopens on Monday. 
                         If you are interested in our 
                         services...
                              (etc. etc.)
                         Thank You.

                                     JOHN
                         This is John Buckingham from St 
                         Albans. I need to speak to you 
                         urgently. There's a critical problem. 
                         It's... Call me back as soon as 
                         possible. It's critical.

               INT. STAIRS / LANDING - DAY

               John climbs the stairs holding a saucer for an ashtray. He 
               knocks lightly on the spare room door.

               INT. SPARE ROOM / LANDING - DAY

               Nadia is lying asleep on the bed in only her black underwear. 
               We duck straight back out.

               John composes himself. He puts his head back round the door 
               as if there's a real chance it will be shot off. She's facing 
               away, arms folded, still holding the cigarette. It has burnt 
               out, leaving a long curl of ash on her bare hip.

               He approaches the bed with immense trepidation, eases the 
               cigarette from between her fingers and drops it in the bin. 
               He stares at her bare hip, with the ash on it. Holding the 
               saucer under the ash, he blows on it gently. It takes three 
               careful breaths before it drops in the saucer. Unseen by 
               John, her eyes are wide open as he steals out onto the 
               landing. We stay with her a moment.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               A pot of stew, bubbling on the hob.

               INT. KITCHEN - DAY

               John is stirring a pot on the hob. By his expression he might 
               be defusing a bomb.

               His head cocks, he stiffens. Nadia walks right into the 
               kitchen. She's changed, jeans and a tee shirt. Nadia takes 
               the spoon from him, says something in Russian, gestures for 
               him to sit.

               She tastes the stew. Now she stirs the pot. He watches her.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. KITCHEN - DAY

               John and Nadia sit opposite each other. She takes a mouthful. 
               They catch one another's eye. And again.

               On the wall across, six ants careen in crazy circles. John 
               can see them, but doesn't move.

               He puts his fork down.

                                     JOHN
                         I don't know what to say. Your letters 
                         were in English. Good English. You 
                         said you'd studied English.

               Nadia reaches down into her bag and pulls out a small box 
               wrapped in brown paper. She places it in front of him.

               He warily unwraps a little wooden box. He opens the lid and 
               fishes out a simple gold ring. He holds it in his palm.

                                     JOHN
                         I can't take this.

               He puts it back in the box, hoping it will disappear.

               She fishes it out again and holds it on her palm for him to 
               take.

                                     JOHN
                         I can't take it. I'm not really a 
                         ring guy.

               She takes his hand. He automatically yanks it away like he's 
               been burned. She takes his hand again and to stop it becoming 
               unbearable, he allows Nadia to push the ring onto his ring 
               finger. It goes on easily.

                                     JOHN
                         Okay. No big deal. Thank you. Yes 
                         thanks. Thank you.

               INT. LOUNGE - NIGHT

               John and Nadia sit next to each other on the couch watching 
               T.V. John's gaze seems to go through the T.V. and a thousand 
               yards beyond. Nadia is knitting a half-finished jumper, blood 
               red.

               John stands and disappears out of shot.

                                     JOHN (O.S.)
                         If anyone gets this message please 
                         call as soon as possible. It's an 
                         emergency.

               John sits back down. He steals side-glances at her. Her mouth. 
               Her red-painted fingers knitting fast.

               John flips through the channels --

               The Money Programme. 
               Antique's Roadshow. 
               Cup Rugby.

               Eventually he offers Nadia the remote control. She takes, 
               aims it at the T.V. but doesn't press it. Just as it seems 
               she won't, she does: University Challenge.

               They watch University Challenge with Nadia still aiming the 
               control and smoking. After another long pause she flips the 
               button --

               The Money Programme. 
               Antiques Roadshow. 
               Rugby.

               She flips again then hands the controls back to John and 
               they watch University Challenge.

               Nadia puts down her knitting, stretches and yawns.

               INT. LOUNGE / STAIRS - NIGHT

               Nadia climbs the stairs. John watches her, hovering in the 
               doorway of the darkened lounge.

               He hears the bathroom door close before venturing up.

               INT. BEDROOM - DAY

               John sits on the edge of his bed. He cocks his head:

               Door opening and shutting; feet padding along landing; door 
               closing. Silence. He squeezes his door open and peers down 
               the dark landing. The coast is clear.

               INT. BATHROOM - DAY

               Brushing his teeth, staring accusingly at his reflection. 
               Spits. Finished, he takes a deep breath and opens the door, 
               and gives a small shout.

               Nadia is standing right outside the door; Nightshirt, damp 
               hair, toothbrush in her mouth.

                                     JOHN
                         Good night.

               He squeezes past and quick-steps down the landing.

               INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

               He climbs into the big bed, fully clothed, turns off the 
               light and lies there in the moonlight.

               After twenty seconds, the bedroom door clicks open. John 
               climbs out of bed as casually as possible and stands around.

                                     JOHN
                         You should go now. We'll talk in the 
                         morning.

               His eyes widen but he can't speak. He wants to but she's 
               placed her hand across his mouth. She reaches down and takes 
               his hand, and draws it towards her, slowly tracing his fingers 
               across her breasts. She unbuttons her shirt and pulls his 
               hand inside.

               He's breathing hard, her right hand still clasped over his 
               mouth. Her free hand lowers to press against him, and unzip 
               his fly. He lets out a moan.

               We concentrate on their faces. Above the silence all we can 
               hear is John's breathing -- Before long Nadia looks down -- 
               He's come.

               Nadia turns and walks out, leaving John marooned, gasping in 
               and blowing out, angry almost, buttoning his trousers.

               EXT. JOHN'S CLOSE - NIGHT

               Exterior view of John's darkened house. A fox trots across 
               the Cul-De-Sac and sits under John's car, where it curls up.

               INT. JOHN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

               John lying in bed staring out at a streetlight.

               INT. NADIA'S ROOM - DAY

               The morning. Nadia opens her eyes in the sun-filled room.

               INT. LANDING - DAY

               She pads down the hall in her nightshirt and opens the door 
               to the bathroom. There on the toilet, naked, is John. He 
               gives another short shout. Nadia holds his eye for a couple 
               of seconds too long, before shutting us inside with him.

               EXT. JOHN'S GARDEN - DAY

               John sprints down his lawn, scattering the big black crows 
               eating his garden. He jumps the fence, and across the fields.

               EXT. COUNTRYSIDE - DAY

               John jogs along by a river in the countryside behind his 
               house, wearing shorts and a tee shirt. His breath billows 
               around him in the sharp morning air.

               He stops running by a gate overlooking a small hill. He 
               doubles up to recover, panting hard.

               INT. JOHN'S GARDEN - DAY

               Two wild rabbits are nibbling the remains of a big breakfast 
               left on the lawn. John climbs heavily back over his fence.

               There's a deck chair out there, surrounded by the remains of 
               breakfast. Some glossy Russian magazines, a full ashtray, 
               Nadia's knitting.

               The patio door is ajar, the net curtain billowing. He scans 
               the garden jumpily. The boy next door is on his trampoline, 
               bouncing up and down, watching John at the top of each bounce.

               INT. JOHN'S HOUSE - DAY

               Sweating from the run, John peers up the stairs. The house 
               is silent. In the lounge he picks up the phone and dials a 
               number.

                                     ANSWER MACHINE
                         You have reached From Russia With 
                         Love. If you are interested...

               He hangs up.

               INT. LANDING - DAY

               John stands with his ear to the bathroom door. The shower's 
               on.

               INT. NADIA'S BEDROOM - DAY

               It's empty. He slips inside.

               Stuff everywhere. Cigarette cartons, several lighters, spare 
               wool, suitcase, rucksack. Huge poster of Bruce Springsteen 
               on wall.

               Warily, he opens the bedside drawer: Different coloured bras 
               and knickers.

               In her open suitcase lies a small wooden chest. He lifts it 
               out and puts it on the bed, hesitates, then opens it.

               A pair of Russian Army field binoculars. He puts them on the 
               bed beside him. A small silver pistol, the size of a 
               Derringer. He studies it, and pulls the trigger. It's a 
               cigarette lighter.

               A brochure of prospective husbands provided by the marriage 
               agency. After a dozen or so photos he comes across his page 
               but the photo has been cut out. He sees his name in the 
               strange lettering, under the hole.

               INT. BATHROOM - DAY

               Nadia in the shower, eyes shut, water pouring over her face.

               INT. NADIA'S ROOM - DAY

               John flicks through a stack of photographs. One of Nadia as 
               a young girl in a meadow, with binoculars around her neck -- 
               John looks at the same binoculars on the bed next to him. He 
               turns them over in his hands.

               He looks through them. He slowly lowers them. He's seen 
               something. He stands and crosses the room.

               On the mantelpiece, in a silver frame, is his picture, cut 
               from the brochure. He holds it in his hands.

               The shower has stopped. In a panic he replaces the picture, 
               the photographs, the gun lighter, the brochure, and the 
               binoculars.

               INT. LANDING - DAY

               Nadia leaves the bathroom, hair wrapped in a towel, and heads 
               straight towards us.

               INT. NADIA'S BEDROOM - DAY

               John shuts the chest, drops it back into the suitcase.

               The photo of the binoculars girl is on the pillow. He whips 
               it under the bed just as Nadia enters.

               She doesn't seem surprised to see him standing there, in her 
               room, in his tee shirt and running shorts.

                                     JOHN
                         Nadia. This isn't going to work. I'm 
                         sorry. It's been a terrible mistake. 
                         You must go.

               He takes the ring off and holds it out to her. She doesn't 
               take it. He puts it on the bed.

                                     JOHN
                         I'm booking a flight for tomorrow. 
                         I'm sorry.

               John and Nadia on her bed, Nadia tearing off his tee shirt. 
               She gets on top.

               EXT. JOHN'S CLOSE - DAY

               The milkman hops a low fence between two houses. He waves to 
               a man watering his rose trees.

               INT. NADIA'S ROOM - DAY

               John and Nadia having sex. They don't take their eyes off 
               each other.

               EXT. JOHN'S CLOSE - DAY

               A mother corrals her school children into a Volvo. They don't 
               want to go.

               INT. NADIA'S ROOM - DAY

               John sits on the edge of the bed, holding his head in his 
               hands. The door has just shut behind him. He looks at his 
               left hand. He has the ring on.

               John's skilled hands loading a stack of banknotes into a

               INT. BRANCH MANAGER'S OFFICE - DAY

               John sits in front of a large desk, hands on knees.

                                     BRANCH MANAGER (O.S.)
                         When communicating he is good at

                         and displays effective verbal 
                         communication skills...

               Across the desk the Branch Manager reads a report out loud 
               in an impersonal, flat manner.

               INT. JOHN'S KITCHEN - DAY

               Nadia opens a kitchen cupboard and stares inside at John's 
               groceries.

                         for it himself...

               She opens some pickled onions and pops one in her mouth.

               Cradling the jar of onions, she scans his bookshelf.

               She opens the wardrobe. In a shoebox she finds some photos.

               One of John as a little boy, holding a football, flanked by 
               his parents. On the back someone has written "Summer 1973".

                         John still has some reluctance to / 
                         or has problems in, carving out new 
                         relationships face to face.

               There is a photo of John, about three years ago, arm in arm 
               with a plain, thin-looking girl, with small eyes. Another of 
               him kissing her on the cheek.

               INT. JOHN'S BEDROOM - DAY

               Nadia sees something at the bottom of the cupboard. She bends 
               down to retrieve a black dustbin liner. She reaches in and 
               pulls out a small stack of hardcore pornographic magazines.

                                     BRANCH MANAGER (V.O.)

                         conscientiously and responds well to 
                         personal directions.

               She upends the bag and a half dozen videos fall out. She 
               picks up a magazine and begins flicking through it 
               impassively.

               INT. LOUNGE - DAY

               Nadia downstairs kneels in front of the T.V. and slips a 
               video into the machine. Nadia's face is lit up by the screen. 
               The sound of sex.

                                     BRANCH MANAGER (V.O.)
                         John is normally very punctual and 
                         in most situations assumes 
                         responsibility for his own actions 
                         and outcomes.

               She pops a pickled onion in her mouth, and watches. We see 
               the images close and pixellated, as we did the marriage videos 
               in the titles. It's a bondage scene, the woman wears a gag.

               INT. BRANCH MANAGER'S OFFICE - DAY

               John back in the room. The report has finished and the manager 
               is scrutinising him in silence.

                                     JOHN
                         Thank you -- I think that's very 
                         fair.

               INT. / EXT. JOHN'S CAR (MOVING) - DAY

               John drives his Rover through the centre of town, the low 
               orange sun on his face.

               EXT. JOHN'S CLOSE - DAY

               The Rover pulls into the driveway. John opens the glove 
               compartment and removes the ring Nadia gave him, and puts it 
               back on. He collects a brown paper package from the passenger 
               seat.

               INT. JOHN'S KITCHEN - NIGHT

               John and Nadia at the supper table. She is knitting the 
               jumper. Despite the silence, John seems more relaxed, in 
               shirtsleeves and loosened tie. He puts his fork down, and 
               places the brown bag on the table, pushing it across to Nadia. 
               She opens it and removes a big hardback Russian - English 
               dictionary. John smiles and nods "open it". She flicks through 
               it.

               She turns it over in her hands, nods, puts the book down, 
               reaches under the table and surfaces with the stack of porn 
               magazines. She puts them on the table next to the dictionary.

               John beholds the pile. "Wet N' Wild" is on top.

               He rises slowly from the table and sleepwalks from the 
               kitchen.

               INT. JOHN'S HALL / STAIRS / LANDING / BATHROOM - DAY

               John, frozen-headed, floats down the hall, up the stairs 
               into the bathroom, locks the door, sits on the toilet.

               INT. JOHN'S KITCHEN - DAY

               Downstairs Nadia clears, the dishes. The porn stack still 
               sits on the table, beside the dictionary.

               INT. BATHROOM - DAY

               Still on the toilet. He hasn't moved. He closes his eyes.

               INT. LANDING - NIGHT

               It's dark. The bathroom door opens a crack. The coast clear, 
               he dashes for the cover of his bedroom.

               INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

               John rests his head against the doorframe and heaves a sigh 
               of relief. He turns and freezes. Nadia is there next to him.

               She slowly loosens his tie. Holding it in her hands she 
               examines the strange little bank logo on it, before 
               deliberately tying the tie over her mouth like a gag.

               A second tie is pulled from a hanger in the cupboard. Quickly 
               and skillfully she ties her hands together, pulling it tight 
               with her teeth. Finished, she flicks her hair back, and gives 
               him a long, level look.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. ROOM IN THE BANK - DAY

               A close up of John's face. He closes his eyes, falls 
               backwards, and is caught in the arms of a colleague.

                                     TRAINER
                         Good. Again.

               John stands again and closes his eyes. After a short wait he 
               falls back and again his colleague catches him just before 
               he hits the ground.

                                     TRAINER
                         Very good. How does that feel John?

                                     JOHN
                         It feels good. Weird.

                                     TRAINER
                         It's called Trust and Letting Go.

               John nods.

                                     TRAINER
                         Trust and Letting Go.

               A simple guitar theme begins, and plays over the following 
               sequence:

               Kids playing cricket in John's Close. A boy hits the ball 
               and others chase it as it bounces off cars.

               John at dusk tied to the bed with his two bank ties. Nadia 
               is on top. They are having sex.

               Hands stacking bank notes into the back of a cash machine. 
               Fast, mechanical.

               At the bank, John walks to his desk. His phone rings. He 
               answers it.

               Silence. Then soft breathing. John listens intently and looks 
               around.

               "Nadia...?" -- John sits there, surrounded by his colleagues, 
               listening to Nadia breathe.

               Close up on a man's hands tying a tie tight a-round a woman's 
               wrist. Pull back to a close up of Nadia's face, her eyes 
               fixed on John.

               John running by the river.

               John watches Nadia rise from his bed after sex and leave the 
               room. He stares out the window.

               Nadia's fingers, knitting skillfully.

               Nadia sits on her bed alone, pulling on black stockings and 
               attaching them to suspenders.

               The street cricketers run for cover as a thunder storm breaks 
               over the close.

               Rain coming down in John's garden. The pair sit under the 
               shelter of the back porch. John has his hands out as Nadia 
               is winding red wool it into a ball. The jumper is half 
               finished.

               The rabbits shelter from the rain under broad leaves.

               John in a pub with a four colleagues from the bank. He sips 
               his half, half listening to the conversation. It all seems 
               so dull. He finishes his drink and looks at his watch. They 
               ask him if he's staying for another.

               A knitting needle is drawn from a row of red stitches on the 
               nearly-finished jumper.

               Nadia kneels over John holding the knitting needles. She 
               presses one to his skin and we watch it drawn across his 
               chest in close up, up to his neck.

               His eyes are fixed on hers.

               Close up on Nadia's face. Her mouth is gagged and she's lying 
               on her front, head half-buried in a pillow. We can just make 
               out John behind, on top of her. Both are lying still and 
               breathing hard, covered in sweat. Catching her breath Nadia 
               yanks the gag off and wriggles out from underneath him. She 
               snatches up a towel and covering herself hurries to the 
               bathroom.

               The guitar theme ends.

               INT. LANDING - NIGHT

               John presses his ear to the bathroom door. The sound of 
               retching.

               The toilet flushes. John pads back to his bedroom. Through 
               the gap in the door he sees Nadia coming out, go to her room, 
               and shut the door. He rests his head against the door frame.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               A beautiful morning. Through the patio window, John watches 
               Nadia in the garden, sitting on the lawn reading her 
               dictionary in the sunlight. In dungarees with her hair up, 
               she looks very young.

               EXT. GARDEN - DAY

               He walks warily out into the sunlight. She looks up, then 
               back to the big book in her lap. He places the tea next to 
               her on the grass.

                                     JOHN
                         Are you O.K.?

               She looks at him, then down at her tome. She speaks slowly, 
               in a heavy accent:

                                     NADIA
                         Today is bath day.

                                     JOHN
                         Sorry?

               She studies her book. Looks up.

                                     NADIA
                         Today is bath day.

               He shakes his head.

                                     JOHN
                         Bath day?

               She nods.

                                     JOHN
                         I don't understand.

                                     NADIA
                         Happy bath day.

               The penny drops.

                                     JOHN
                         Today?

               She frowns. John leafs through the dictionary.

                                     JOHN
                         Syevodnya?

                                     NADIA
                         Syevodnya

                                     JOHN
                         Happy Birthday. Happy Birthday.

               He puts his hand on her shoulder.

                                     NADIA
                         Party.
                              (pause)
                         Party. Syevodnya.

               John nods, smiling.

                                     JOHN
                         Yes. Party. Party syevodnya.

               She lights a cigarette from the butt of her last. Blows smoke. 
               She holds the jumper up to John, as if to try it for size, 
               and the theme returns.

               INT. KITCHEN - DAY

               John is on the telephone.

                                     JOHN
                         ...It might just be a twenty-four 
                         hour bug...

               INT. BANK - DAY

               Clare listens, concerned.

                                     CLARE
                         Well you just get better. I'll tell 
                         Beaky. You just get some rest, ok?

               INT. KITCHEN - DAY

               John puts the phone down. He looks down the hall, where Nadia 
               is killing ants on the table, with her dictionary. He smiles.

               EXT. JOHN'S CAR - DAY

               A shot from above, of the Rover's windscreen, reflecting the 
               passing trees.

               The roof is down. We glide up the windscreen, up Nadia's 
               body, in the passenger seat. Her face is upturned slightly, 
               she's wearing sunglasses, which reflect the passing trees.

               INT. JOHN'S LOUNGE - NIGHT

               Nadia sits alone at the dining room table. Suddenly the lights 
               go out. John enters, carrying a small birthday cake glowing 
               with candles.

               The light throws huge shadows on the walls and flickers across 
               their faces.

               He sets the cake down on the table and sits down opposite 
               Nadia

                                     JOHN
                         Happy Birthday to you. Happy Birthday 
                         to you. Happy Birthday dear Nadia...

               The front doorbell rings. A loud long burst. Nadia's face 
               transforms into a big grin. She hurries out into the hall, 
               leaving John alone with the cake. Nadia whooping and shouting 
               excitedly. Other voices. Shouting. Shouting in Russian.

               A man bursts in carrying Nadia in his arms. He spins her 
               round in the candlelight, kisses her, puts her down and goes 
               to the table where he blows out the candles. They are plunged 
               into darkness.

               Lots of whooping and laughing. A Zippo flares up and 
               illuminates some faces, all laughing.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               John's hand groping along the wall. It finds the light switch.

               There are two men here. One small and wiry, one big and dark, 
               like Rasputin. They each carry rucksacks and a guitar case.

                                     YURI
                         You must be John. You seem very nice. 
                         Excuse me.

               In Russian, the first man introduces Nadia to the other man, 
               who is relighting the candles with a Zippo. It seems they 
               haven't met before.

               The first man, Yuri, pulls out a bottle of vodka and hands 
               it to John.

                                     YURI
                         How's that? We can't drink our piss 
                         can we?

                                     JOHN
                         Hang on hang on, sorry, but like, 
                         who are you?

                                     YURI
                         You must find some glasses, small, 
                         for the toast, and some plates.

                                     JOHN
                         What are you doing here?

               Yuri stops.

                                     YURI
                         Sorry. You've lost me...

                                     JOHN
                         I'm asking what you're here for.

                                     YURI
                         What?

               Yuri speaks to Nadia in fast Russian.

                                     YURI
                              (to John)
                         You don't speak Russian? Pratsteetye! 
                         This explains your cold eyes.

               Nadia begins gabbling to Yuri in Russian. Yuri says the 
               English word -- "Friends".

                                     NADIA
                              (to John)
                         "Frenzy".

                                     JOHN
                         Yes I know.

                                     YURI
                              (himself)
                         Yuri.
                              (Rasputin)
                         Alexei. Alexei and Yuri.

               Alexei speaks.

                                     JOHN
                         What did he say?

                                     YURI
                         He says he feels safe here.

               Nadia talks fast to Yuri.

                                     YURI
                         She says she wanted to tell you but 
                         her English is shit. And no one speaks 
                         Russian, it's very hard for her. The 
                         light please.

               Alexei turns off the light again. Nadia blows out her candles. 
               They are plunged back into darkness. John turns the light on 
               again. Yuri is already sitting down.

                                     JOHN
                         I need to know who you are first 
                         please.

                                     YURI
                         Oh.
                              (Yuri stands)
                         We are Russian.

                                     JOHN
                         Yes. I know.

                                     YURI
                         Good.
                              (he sits down)

                                     JOHN
                         And...

                                     YURI
                         And what? You mean from the beginning? 
                         Jesus. Can I uh okay, as we say in 
                         Russia can I cut a long story short. 
                         Okay. Nadia is my little cousin. 
                         Except she's not. But we say cousin. 
                         This is for you.

               He hands John another bottle of vodka.

                                     JOHN
                         Hold on.

                                     YURI
                         Toast first then we talk seriously, 
                         I can see you are serious about us.

               Vodka is splashed into their glasses. Yuri raises his glass 
               and shouts a toast in Russian: "Vashe Zdarovye!". They down 
               their vodka, John sips at his, then realises he must finish 
               it. Yuri makes as if to throw his in the fireplace.

                                     YURI
                         Just kidding.

               Sausages, cheese, bread and pickle bottles rain onto the 
               table from Yuri's rucksack.

                                     JOHN
                              (to Yuri)
                         So hang on. You're both Nadia's 
                         cousins?

                                     YURI
                              (shaking his head)
                         Of course not. Alexei, he's is my 
                         problem.

                                     JOHN
                         Right.

                                     YURI
                         We better watch him. He's crazy.

                                     JOHN
                         Right.

                                     YURI
                         I am actor, he is actor, although he 
                         is an actor stroke musician. I just 
                         noodle along, I'm not so good. He 
                         makes me look like a retard -- He 
                         smokes me. I don't mean he smokes 
                         me.

               Yuri mimes giving a blow-job.

                                     YURI
                         I mean he smokes me. Do you say 
                         "smoke" in U.K.?

               He mimes the blowjob again.

                                     JOHN
                         No.

                                     YURI
                         Right. So I can say he smokes me. 
                         So.

               Pause.

                                     JOHN
                         So?

                                     YURI
                         So I come to England with other actors 
                         to make shows, I meet this freak 
                         from Novgorod I tell him of you and 
                         Chicken and the birthday here we 
                         are.

               Yuri speaks to Nadia in Russian, she replies looking at John.

                                     JOHN
                         What was that?

                                     YURI
                         I asked her if you were happy to see 
                         us. I find it hard to tell with you.

                                     JOHN
                         Yes it's okay. Thank you for the 
                         food.

               Nadia lights a cigarette. John notices that on both wrists 
               she has bold red marks from the ties. He freezes.

                                     YURI
                         She says you are a little shy. I 
                         think I know this.

               John is thrown, panicking that one of them will notice the 
               marks.

                                     JOHN
                         So how long will you be in England?

                                     YURI
                         Plans are for the architects, 
                         politicians and so forth.

                                     JOHN
                         You must have a visa or something...

                                     YURI
                         You're asking for my documents?

                                     JOHN
                         No, no...

               Yuri laughs, translates for Alexei and they both get a big 
               laugh out of this. Yuri gets his passport out and makes a 
               big show of presenting it to John. But John keeps glancing 
               at the marks on Nadia's wrists. We see a close up of her 
               neck. There is the tiniest blood mark. John sees it and starts 
               to sweat.

                                     YURI
                         We are all Europeans here. Europe, 
                         Tony Blair and Maggie Thatcher!

               Yuri raises his glass and they all drink to Tony Blair and 
               Margaret Thatcher. John drinks his vodka in two hot gulps.

                                     YURI
                         So. You have nothing to say to your 
                         Fiancee? Maybe to wife of forty years 
                         it's understandable. Come on. You 
                         speak and I will translate.

               John looks glazed. The room falls silent.

                                     JOHN
                         Hello.

               Yuri translates -- She replies.

                                     YURI
                         She says 'Hello' to you. Go for it 
                         John!

                                     JOHN
                         Uh. Do you like England?

                                     YURI
                         Classic!
                              (he translates)
                         Thank God. She says 'Yes!'

               John nods. He watches Nadia tap ash. The wrist again.

                                     JOHN
                         Uh...

               They all wait. Yuri nods encouragingly.

                                     JOHN
                         I can't think of anything. Hang on.

               Nadia speaks in Russian to Yuri.

                                     YURI
                         She says she has a secret to tell.

                                     JOHN
                         What?

               Nadia speaks. John waits uncomfortably. Silence.

                                     YURI
                         She says she watched you at the 
                         airport.

               John stops.

                                     JOHN
                         When?

                                     YURI
                              (translating)
                         "I saw you waiting there, by the 
                         gate."

                                     JOHN
                         I...

                                     YURI
                         "I have these uh..." She explains to 
                         you... "When I was a little girl my 
                         father had these beautiful old 
                         glasses." Like... I don't know the 
                         word. Like for watching uh... for 
                         watching the birds.

               We see John's face.

                                     JOHN
                         Binoculars.

                                     YURI
                         Binoculars. He had these Binoculars 
                         he has kept from the war.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               Scene 1 reprise.

               EXT. SUMMER MEADOW - DAY

               A young girl runs through a summer meadow with a pair of 
               Russian Army field binoculars, around her neck.

                                     YURI (V.O.)
                         I would run around with them taking 
                         pictures of things I liked with my 
                         mind. If I saw something beautiful I 
                         would take a picture.

               With the binoculars pressed to her face, she spies 
               butterflies, birds, a rabbit. She stops running and aims the 
               binoculars up, up, into the sun

               INT. JOHN'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

               Yuri translates.

                                     YURI
                         The day before I left Russia my father 
                         gave me the old binoculars. He said 
                         that when I saw you I was to stand 
                         far away and look at you with these, 
                         and to examine your face closely. 
                         And if you were a bad person I could 
                         run away.

               Nadia looks at the table.

                                     YURI
                         She says she took a picture.

               John watches Nadia looking at the table. She glances up once 
               and catches his eye.

               Alexei suddenly slams his hand down on the table. He raises 
               his palm. There is an ant squashed there. He shows Yuri.

                                     ALEXEI
                         Nasyekski.

               EXT. JOHN'S GARDEN - NIGHT

               The small party has moved outside to the patio, where they 
               sit around a low wooden table in the mellow candlelight. A 
               huge late Summer moon hangs over the fields. Alexei tinkles 
               beautifully on his guitar.

               He stops asks a question in Russian.

                                     JOHN
                         What was that?

                                     YURI
                         Oh nothing.

                                     JOHN
                         Tell me.

                                     YURI
                         No. It is too judgmental.

                                     JOHN
                         Tell me what he said.

                                     YURI
                         He says why did you send to Russia 
                         for a wife.

               Silence. John suddenly looks sick.

                                     YURI
                         You are not ashamed of it? It's no 
                         surprise to want to love.

                                     JOHN
                         No. It's not that.

                                     YURI
                         Do you believe in love?

                                     JOHN
                         I suppose it's... I mean define your 
                         terms.

                                     YURI
                         It's very strange. How many people 
                         are truly themselves with their love? 
                         It is the greatest human disaster 
                         and it is never in the newspapers. 
                         There are no Marches Against 
                         Heartache, no Ministries Against 
                         Loneliness, no Concerts Against 
                         Disappointment. We look away. And 
                         still we know in secret that nothing 
                         is more important to us. The one 
                         thing we all share but don't say. 
                         Look John I will show you something.

               He takes a plate and starts reaching for the food.

                                     YURI
                         Here look, something beautiful from 
                         Russia. Here is Life, there, take 
                         it.

               John accepts the plate.

                                     YURI
                         Here is bread. Khylep. This is work. 
                         We all need this, here eat.

               John eats.

                                     YURI
                         Good. But we cannot survive with 
                         just work, so here is meat and blood. 
                         Myasa. This is family and country, 
                         flesh, strength, eat.

               John bites the sausage.

                                     YURI
                         But again this is not life. Here is 
                         joy and pain. Chyesnok. Without these 
                         life has no flavour, is too serious. 
                         Eat.

               John nibbles some pickled garlic.

                                     YURI
                         But this vodka.
                              (pause)
                         Is love. Only this magic changes you 
                         inside. The moon and the stars and 
                         the sun.

               Yuri offers John the glass. He looks at Nadia, takes it and 
               swigs it down in one. He looks across at Nadia, wiping his 
               mouth, his eyes watering. She looks back at him.

               Alexei begins softly singing a song. As he sings:

                                     YURI
                         This is a love song, a soldier's 
                         song to his beloved -- Alexei, he's 
                         Afghanstya, a veteran of Afghanistan. 
                         He saw terrible things.

               They listen to the beautiful, sad voice. For the second verse 
               Yuri joins in, a slow stirring lament. For the end Nadia 
               joins in too and the three of them begin harmonising 
               beautifully. John watches in the candlelight.

               John, Nadia and Alexei pose with the cake. Nadia puts her 
               arm round John and Alexei. With a FLASH! Yuri takes a 
               Polaroid.

               The guitar theme returns as we see the Polaroid on the table 
               in close up, developing speeded up. John comes into focus, 
               beaming.

               INT. LOUNGE - NIGHT

               We track across the sleeping faces of Yuri and Alexei tucked 
               into their sleeping bags with guitar cases for pillows. John 
               switches the light off and closes the door.

               INT. JOHN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

               John and Nadia seen from above lying asleep, with their heads 
               together, in the moonlight. Nadia whispers something in her 
               sleep, in Russian. Fast asleep John mutters something in 
               English. Their sleeping, unintelligible conversation, drifts 
               on in the night.

               INT. BANK - DAY

               John sits at his desk in the open plan office. He looks 
               nervous.

               This is because he is wearing Nadia's ring. People pass his 
               desk, a couple say hello, but they don't notice. He rubs his 
               chin. Nobody notices.

               Eventually his manager approaches.

                                     BRANCH MANAGER
                         Quick word John?

               He leans over the desk.

                                     BRANCH MANAGER
                         This is sensitive. Your car. Lovely 
                         car. Doesn't necessarily give the 
                         right impression.

                                     JOHN
                         Ch...

                                     BRANCH MANAGER
                         To customers approaching the bank 
                         from the rear

                                     JOHN
                              (thrown)
                         Right.

                                     BRANCH MANAGER
                         You can see why it's sensitive?

                                     JOHN
                         Uh... Yes.

               The manager smiles and taps the desk twice.

                                     BRANCH MANAGER
                         I'll leave it on your desk.

               John is left alone.

               INT. HALL / LIVING ROOM - DAY

               The front door opens and John walks into his hall. The two 
               rucksacks are still side by side where they were the night 
               before...

               INT. KITCHEN - DAY

               He opens the fridge and pours himself a glass of orange. He 
               stops -- There on the draining board lies the bloody skin of 
               a rabbit. John jumps out of his skin.

               Next to the rabbit skin is a hand-drawn map. A dotted line 
               winds around the map and ends with an X in a small wood.

               He looks at the rabbit skin, with its eyeless sockets.

               EXT. FOREST - DAY

               John follows a path through a big silent wood, the low sun 
               flaring and catching his white work shirt.

               P.O.V. OF JOHN

               through binoculars, a long way off and squinting into the 
               sun.

               Nadia lowers the binoculars and looks past us.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               John spots some figures lying on the grass in the distance. 
               He heads towards them, and watches them for a moment from 
               thirty yards away.

               Alexei, Yuri and Nadia sit in a small clearing. A blanket, 
               cushions, bread and vodka are scattered around. Yuri is 
               strumming a guitar. Alexei and Nadia are laughing and 
               chatting. He removes a small twig from her hair and flattens 
               it under his big hand. John watches the gesture. It's so 
               intimate they could be lovers.

                                     YURI
                              (calls)
                         John. We can see you hiding.

               John steps out of his hiding place and approaches the group. 
               Alexei has Nadia falling about laughing about something. He 
               smiles at her then nods to John.

               Pieces of cooked rabbit lie in tin foil. Alexei feeds a piece 
               to Nadia with a big hunting knife. Nadia smiles at John, and 
               starts knitting.

                                     YURI
                         How is bank?

                                     JOHN
                         Fine. I thought you were leaving 
                         today.

                                     YURI
                         To be indoors on such a day. It's 
                         crime.

               Nadia stops knitting and takes her shirt off and stretches 
               back to sunbathe in her black bra. Alexei takes the knife he 
               has just finished cleaning and holds the cold wide blade 
               flat above Nadia's bare stomach. Just before pressing it 
               down he looks across at John. Nadia yelps and sits up. They 
               laugh, and Yuri joins in. John laughs uneasily.

               Alexei notices marks on Nadia's midriff. He asks her about 
               them in Russian.

               John goes white, unable to understand Nadia's explanation. 
               He has no idea what she told him.

               EXT. LAKE IN FOREST - DAY

               At sunset, the four run towards a lake in their underwear. 
               They jump and dive in, and begin splashing each other.

               John duck-dives under the water and swims through the sunlit 
               streaked green water. We see him under the water, swimming 
               towards us, caught by the sun's rays.

               John surfaces, and wipes the water from his eyes. He spots 
               Alexei and Nadia playing in the water. Alexei grabs her and 
               throws her in the air and she comes down with a splash.

               John treads water nearby. He watches them both hold their 
               noses and disappear under the surface.

               They've both vanished. John ducks under the water.

               John's underwater P.O.V.: It's too murky to see anything.

               The two surface, breathing hard, laughing. John watches them.

               Alexei holds Nadia tight and looks like he might even kiss 
               her. But instead he ducks her and holds her under the water.

               John treads water nearby. She's been under a long time.

                                     JOHN
                         Hey.

               John begins to swim toward Alexei. Just as he gets near, 
               Alexei lets Nadia surface, coughing and spluttering -- she 
               shouts at Alexei in Russian, angry.

               Alexei makes for her again but she pushes him away, twice, 
               almost slapping him. She is very uncomfortable. She swims 
               away.

               Yuri admonishes his friend in Russian. Alexei stares at John, 
               then swims off powerfully back towards the shore.

                                     YURI
                         He's just having fun. He's maybe too 
                         strong you know...

               John watches Nadia walk out of the lake towards her clothes.

               INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

               John walks into his bedroom. Nadia is on the bed with a 
               dictionary. She puts it down. She speaks very slowly.

                                     NADIA
                         They go. John. They go.

                                     JOHN
                         What's wrong?

                                     NADIA
                         They go.

                                     JOHN
                         Of course. They go. Yes. Yes.

                                     NADIA
                         They go.

               INT. JOHN'S SITTING ROOM - NIGHT

               John stands at the end of the two sleeping bags.

                                     YURI
                         I understand. I'm so sorry

                                     JOHN
                         You can stay tonight.

                                     YURI
                         I have brought you trouble. Maybe I 
                         should have come alone.

                                     JOHN
                         Good night.

               Alexei stares at John as he backs out of the room.

               INT. JOHN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

               John closes his bedroom door and slips back into bed. Nadia 
               is already asleep. John lies back in the moonlight, and stares 
               at the ceiling.

               EXT. GARDEN - DAY

               A light summer rain. Drips fall from rose petals.

               INT. JOHN'S BEDROOM - DAY

               John opens his eyes. He rolls over towards Nadia, but she's 
               already up and about.

               Alone in his bedroom, John holds the now-finished jumper up 
               to himself. He tries it on. It's a good four sizes too big, 
               the arms are too long and it hangs down to mid-thigh. He 
               looks at himself in the mirror and smiles.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. STAIRS / HALL / KITCHEN - DAY

               He pads downstairs in his pants, picks up his mail from the 
               doormat and peers into the living room. The sleeping bags 
               and guitar cases have gone. About to peruse his mail, his 
               eye is caught by something else.

               There is a small wild deer standing in the living room. 
               Looking at him. John stares back at it transfixed, when he 
               hears a scream. The deer starts and bolts out of the patio 
               doors. John is thrown. It was a woman's scream. He goes back 
               out and looks down the hall.

               Twenty feet away, down the hall, is Yuri, sitting on the 
               kitchen floor, his back to the cooker. He's crying.

                                     YURI
                         John. You must call the Police.

               Suddenly Alexei steps between them in the doorway. As he 
               moves out of view, we see he is holding his hunting knife. 
               John hears Nadia cry out, from inside the kitchen. He drops 
               his mail and rushes forward.

               INT. KITCHEN - DAY

               Nadia is tied to a chair. Alexei pulls a gag tight around 
               her mouth and holds the knife to her throat.

                                     JOHN
                         What are you doing?

               Alexei shouts at Yuri in Russian.

                                     YURI
                         John, I'm sorry. It's my fault.

               Alexei shouts again. Nadia is frozen with terror.

                                     JOHN
                         What's he doing? What the fuck are 
                         you doing? Leave her alone.

               Alexei addresses John.

                                     YURI
                         He says sit down. Or he'll cut her.

               Alexei and Yuri shout at each other. Nadia begins crying.

                                     YURI
                         Sit down please.

               John sits across the table from Nadia.

                                     JOHN
                         Tell him to stop and let her go, and 
                         we'll talk.

               The kettle boils. Alexei takes the kettle and holds it over 
               Nadia's head.

               John springs up.

                                     JOHN
                         Put the fucking kettle down.

                                     YURI
                         John.

                                     JOHN
                         Put the fucking kettle down. Tell, 
                         Yuri, tell him put it down or I'm 
                         going to make him.

               Yuri translates -- Alexei replies.

                                     YURI
                         He says you scare him so much he 
                         must go to the toilet in his trousers. 
                         John, he is a soldier. A trained 
                         killer. We must do what he says.

                                     JOHN
                         What? What does he want?

               Alexei speaks.

                                     JOHN
                         What did he say? Tell me!

                                     YURI
                         He says you are very sad ridiculous 
                         man. I don't agree of course. And 
                         that you must pay someone to have 
                         sex like a prostitute. Nadia is a 
                         prostitute. I'm sorry.

                                     JOHN
                         What does he want. The Russian 
                         shithead. What do you want ?

                                     YURI
                         He wants money.

                                     JOHN
                         Tell him to put the kettle down and 
                         I'll give him money.

               Yuri translates this for Alexei. Alexei has a reply.

                                     YURI
                         He wants a lot of money.

                                     JOHN
                         I'll give him money. Tell him to put 
                         the...

                                     YURI
                         He wants the money from your bank.

                                     JOHN
                         I'll fuckin' give it to him! We'll 
                         go down there.

                                     YURI
                         You don't understand. He wants all 
                         the money that is in your bank.

                                     JOHN
                         I've got eight hundred pounds. Oh 
                         Jesus.

               The penny drops.

                                     JOHN
                         Oh Jesus.

                                     YURI
                         He is sure you can do this. Of course 
                         you can not.

                                     JOHN
                         Oh Jesus. Of course I can't.

               Alexei doesn't need the translation he tilts the kettle, and 
               a small amount of boiling water trickles onto Nadia's hair. 
               She screams through the gag.

               John tries to reach across to her but Alexei draws the knife 
               and holds it to his face.

                                     JOHN
                         Just leave her alone.

                                     YURI
                         I'm so sorry.

                                     JOHN
                         Leave her alone.

               CLOSE UP On Nadia's terrified eyes, imploring John to help 
               her.

               INT. / EXT. JOHN'S CAR - DAY

               John drives grim-faced through the morning rain. Yuri is 
               next to him staring ahead at the road. Alexei is in the back 
               with Nadia who is still bound and gagged. He's holding his 
               knife to her ribs.

               INT. MULTI-STOREY CAR PARK - DAY

               The car parks on the top floor. John turns off the engine. 
               He looks at Nadia in his rear view mirror but she seems in 
               shock.

               INT. HIGH STREET - DAY

               John strides towards us down St. Albans High Street, carrying 
               the two guitar cases, his raincoat flapping. His eyes look 
               glazed, the busy street sounds around him muffled.

               INT. NATIONAL WESTMINSTER BANK - DAY

               The doors slide apart and John enters his branch. The place 
               is full of customers. He cheeks himself through the security 
               door and into the back.

               INT. OPEN-PLAN OFFICE - DAY

               John walks through the open plan office. His Branch Manager 
               is there with another bank official, and Clare.

                                     BRANCH MANAGER
                         Ah John. This is Robert Moseley, 
                         Head of South East New Business. 
                         Robert, this is John Buckingham.

                                     MOSELEY
                         Hello John.

                                     JOHN
                         Hello.

                                     BRANCH MANAGER
                         I thought you could give us the tour 
                         this morning. Sort of be our Indian 
                         Guide.

                                     JOHN
                         Right.

                                     MOSELEY
                              (i.e. the guitars)
                         Do you play?

                                     JOHN
                         Yes. I do.

                                     CLARE
                         That's John. He's always surprising 
                         you with hidden talents.

                                     MOSELEY
                         I used to be in a band. Keyboards. 
                         Sort of like very loud, uh -- very 
                         loud Marillion.

               They laugh. Pause.

                                     CLARE
                              (to John)
                         Well, Maestro, give us a tune.

               They laugh. Pause.

                                     JOHN
                         I'll give you a tune later.

               The Branch Manager takes John to one side and stage-whispers.

                                     BRANCH MANAGER
                         Take the ball and run with it John.

               INT. BANK CORRIDOR - DAY

               John leads the team down the corridor past the training room 
               where his colleagues are busy with Trust and Letting Go.

                                     JOHN
                         This is uh... This is the uh...

               A colleague passes carrying a file.

                                     PASSING COLLEAGUE
                         Morning John. Give us a tune.

                                     JOHN
                         I'll give you a tune later.

               INT. TRAINING ROOM - DAY

               They enter the training room.

                                     JOHN
                         This is where we're doing Trust and 
                         uh... Trust and Letting Go.

                                     MOSELEY
                         We're not doing this till the fourth 
                         quarter -- Has it, uh -- any results, 
                         has it been been beneficial?

                                     JOHN
                         Yes.

                                     CLARE
                         It's weird at first. Sort of exciting 
                         and frightening at the same time. 
                         Wouldn't you say John?

                                     JOHN
                         Yes.

                                     BRANCH MANAGER
                         We're starting to see results. This 
                         is Karen, who's uh... taking uh... 
                         it.

               They say hello to each other and MOSELEY asks her a couple 
               of questions.

                                     JOHN
                         Excuse me.

               INT. CORRIDOR - DAY

               John nips out and fetches his guitar cases. He rounds the 
               corner, down a couple of steps. He checks himself into the 
               Safe Area. A Colleague passes him.

                                     COLLEAGUE
                         Morning John. Hey, Moseley's here.

                                     JOHN
                         I'll give you a tune later.

               INT. SAFE ROOM DOOR - DAY

               John punches in the security code. He opens the safe door 
               and goes inside, closing it behind him. We see his stricken 
               face peering through the toughened glass.

               INT. TRAINING ROOM - DAY

               Robert Moseley falls backwards into the arms of an employee.

                                     MOSELEY
                         It's weird isn't it.

               A little bored perhaps, Moseley gazes out through the open 
               door. He sees...

               INT. CORRIDOR - DAY

               John bowling out of the safe-room backwards heaving two guitar 
               cases. One bursts open spilling bundles of fifties onto the 
               floor.

               INT. TRAINING ROOM - DAY

               Moseley, the Branch Manager, Clare, and five Trust and Letting 
               Go catchers all watch...

               INT. CORRIDOR - DAY

               John scoops up the money, refasten the case and stand to see 
               them all watching him, as the five Trust and Letting Go 
               fallers crash to the ground in unison.

               EXT. SIDE STREET - DAY

               John hauls ass towards us straight down the middle of the 
               road, a guitar case in either hand, footsteps clapping loudly 
               on the wet cobbles. Alarms sound, dogs bark.

               EXT. STREET CORNER - DAY

               He skis around a corner, and sprints up this other street. 
               We are close by his head, as he sprints one hundred metres.

               EXT. CAR PARK ROOF - DAY

               Running flat out across the car park. Yuri throws open the 
               car door and John hurls the guitar cases inside. He dives 
               in, turns the key in the ignition. The Rover coughs and 
               wheezes. He tries again. It spits and misfires. The third 
               time it catches and lives. John grinds the gears and lurches 
               off.

               INT. MULTI STOREY CAR PARK - DAY

               The Rover hurtles down the ramps.

               EXT. STREET - DAY

               It careens down a side-street.

               INT. / EXT. MOVING ROVER - DAY

               Alexei opens one of the cases and looks inside. He takes a 
               deep breath and swears in Russian.

               He shows what is in the case to Nadia. Her eyes widen.

               Alexei gently lowers the gag and kisses her on the mouth. 
               She returns the kiss hungrily.

               John spots them in the mirror and nearly crashes the car.

               He looks desperately across at Yuri. Yuri is now pointing 
               the big knife at John's ribs. The Russian shrugs almost 
               apologetically.

               In the back seat Nadia has freed herself and is beginning to 
               pull at Alexei's clothes. They begin making out passionately.

               John's eyes slowly lose focus. He turns grey, then white. He 
               drives and we watch the life seep out of him.

               EXT. DUAL CARRIAGEWAY - NIGHT

               Cars tear through the night along the carriage way, past a 
               Happy Eater. We pan round, across the motorway to a single 
               storey run-down Motel.

               INT. MOTEL CHALET 17 - NIGHT

               A crusty motel chalet. Yuri and Alexei are sitting on a double 
               bed counting the money. The T.V. is on in the corner with 
               the sound turned down and there are empty miniatures from 
               the mini-bar scattered around.

               Nadia appears from the kitchenette area. They all seem more 
               relaxed, more themselves, as if what we've seen before was 
               an act. For the first time in the film their conversation 
               appears as English subtitles.

                                     NADIA
                         So?

               Alexei says "SSShhh" He is counting in his head. He stops.

                                     ALEXEI
                              (to Yuri)
                         You first.

                                     YURI
                         Fifty thousand. Almost exactly.

                                     NADIA
                         Sixty four thousand, eight hundred.

                                     ALEXEI
                         There's over eighty thousand here.

               They look at each other, absorbing the moment.

                                     YURI
                         Sweet Jesus...

               He lies back on the bed and chuckles.

                                     ALEXEI
                         Put it in the cases. Split it up. 
                         And don't forget you owe me £150.

                                     YURI
                         What for?

                                     ALEXEI
                         You know what for.

                                     YURI
                         No I don't.

                                     ALEXEI
                         I got you those trousers from Paul 
                         Smith.

                                     YURI
                         I've been buying you stuff all week. 
                         I've been buying him stuff all week.

                                     ALEXEI
                         Such as?

               Nadia is smiling at them as they squabble.

                                     YURI
                         When we went to the Hard Rock Cafe. 
                         Who paid? When we went to see 'Cats'. 
                         Who paid?

                                     ALEXEI
                         Those aren't presents. That's normal 
                         friendship stuff

                                     YURI
                         I paid for those guitar cases.

                                     NADIA
                         What was 'Cats' like?

                                     YURI
                         It was alright.

                                     ALEXEI
                         Yeah it was okay.

                                     YURI
                         Yeah. It was quite good actually. 
                         Some bits I really liked.

                                     ALEXEI
                         The sets were good.

                                     YURI
                         The sets were excellent. Everything 
                         was big, you know, all the rubbish, 
                         coke cans, sweet wrappers, dustbins, 
                         so when you were watching it you 
                         felt cat size. It was really clever.

               Yuri goes into the bathroom, leaving Nadia and Alexei alone 
               on the bed.

               Alexei runs his hand across Nadia's cheek.

                                     ALEXEI
                              (softly)
                         So. How many times did you have to 
                         fuck him?

               INT. BATHROOM - NIGHT

               Yuri in the bathroom, he undoes his flies pees. At the other 
               end of the bathroom, tied to the bidet, gagged, is John.

                                     YURI
                         How you doing?

               John refuses to meet his eye. Yuri flushes and wipes his 
               hands.

                                     YURI
                         I'll show you something. It should 
                         make all this easier I think.

               From his back pocket, Yuri takes out an old envelope. He 
               opens it and removes a dozen or so Polaroids.

               John looks down at the first Polaroid. Nadia, Alexei and a 
               man John doesn't recognise at a birthday party. There is a 
               cake with candles and everyone is smiling. The next picture 
               is the same. And the next.

               Sometimes Germany, sometimes France, but otherwise the 
               pictures are the same, each 'fiancee' beaming with his arm 
               round Nadia, Alexei looking on.

               John studies the faces of his fellow dupes and at last comes 
               to his own picture. Despite himself tears come to his eyes.

                                     YURI
                         Not all these bastards were like 
                         you, believe me. You should not too 
                         feel bad.

               Yuri takes John's left hand and pulls off Nadia's ring. He 
               puts it in his pocket.

               INT. MOTEL BEDROOM - NIGHT

               Alexei smokes on the bed. Nadia is lying the other way. She 
               holds her hand out for his cigarette and he passes it. They 
               have the relaxed air of longtime lovers.

               Subtitles again.

                                     NADIA
                         It's enough isn't it?

                                     ALEXEI
                         What do you mean?

                                     NADIA
                         You know what I mean babe, It's 
                         enough. We can stop.

                                     ALEXEI
                         Do you want to stop?

                                     NADIA
                         Yes.

                                     ALEXEI
                         We'll stop then.

               They kiss. He takes her hand, and notices the tie marks on 
               her wrists.

                                     ALEXEI
                         What's this?

                                     NADIA
                         It's nothing. I burnt myself.

                                     ALEXEI
                         That's not a burn.

                                     NADIA
                         It is. I did it cooking.

               They sit there looking at each other.

                                     ALEXEI
                         On both wrists?

               Nadia looks back at him. The seconds pass.

                                     NADIA
                         What? I did it cooking.

               Alexei studies her face. She pulls a face. He keeps staring.

                                     NADIA
                         What?

               They sit there in silence. Alexei is so big, and she is so 
               small.

                                     NADIA
                         Listen, I made you something.

               Nadia leans over the bed, and searches in her bag. Alexei 
               watches her closely. She comes back up with the jumper she 
               has knitted.

                                     NADIA
                         Put it on.

               He looks at the jumper, then back at her.

                                     NADIA
                         It's taken me weeks. I want to see 
                         you in it.

               She starts pulling at his shirt. Eventually he pulls the 
               jumper on. It fits perfectly.

                                     NADIA
                         Do you like it?

                                     ALEXEI
                         Yeah.

               He is still staring at her.

                                     NADIA
                         Say thank you.

                                     ALEXEI
                         Thank you.

               She takes his hands. He is still looking at her. He strokes 
               his hair. He places his big hand around her throat and holds 
               it there, holding her at arms length. She doesn't react, but 
               just looks levelly back at him. They sit like this for about 
               ten seconds, looking at each other.

                                     NADIA
                         We're going to have a baby.

               Alexei seems not to relax. He keeps his hand there.

                                     ALEXEI
                         What?

                                     NADIA
                         You heard what I said. I'm pregnant. 
                         I've been throwing up for weeks.

               Alexei removes his hand. Now he seems shocked. He lights a 
               cigarette.

                                     NADIA
                         We're having a baby.

               Pause.

                                     ALEXEI
                         A baby? What are we supposed to do 
                         with a baby?

                                     NADIA
                         Name it.

               She comes to him and holds him. He is still absorbing the 
               news.

               We see Alexei's face over her shoulder, behind her back, 
               unreadable. Behind his back she rubs her wrists.

               INT. BATHROOM - NIGHT

               Some hours later, it's dark outside. John still tied to the 
               bidet. The door opens a crack and somebody slips inside. We 
               hear the toilet seat go down. As his eyes adjust he can dimly 
               see Nadia sitting on the toilet. She doesn't look at him. As 
               she finishes she finally turns and holds his eye. She stands 
               and slips out the door, leaving him alone.

               EXT. DUAL CARRIAGEWAY - NIGHT

               Cars crawl by on the road outside, their tail-lights 
               stretching over the hill.

               The shot processes and fades into dawn and light.

               The early morning commuters now use the carriageway.

               INT. BATHROOM - DAY

               Bright sunlight pours through a high window. John is still 
               on the toilet. He begins to try to struggle free.

               After a great deal of fierce deadpan shimmying and pulling, 
               he succeeds in loosening his bindings. Freeing an arm, he 
               yanks the duct tape from his mouth and sits there panting.

               The first thing he does is take a pee, then he drinks handfuls 
               of water. He catches his reflection but can't look at himself.

               INT. MAIN ROOM - DAY

               John collapses in an armchair, rubbing his eyes. He looks 
               shattered.

               The Russians have gone.

               INT. MOTEL BATHROOM - DAY

               John in the shower, just standing there, letting the water 
               hit him.

               INT. MOTEL MAIN SUITE - DAY

               John dries himself in silence. He pulls on his trousers, 
               sits down to do his socks. One sock on, he walks to the 
               smaller bedroom. He opens the door and peers inside.

               INT. SMALLER MOTEL BEDROOM - DAY

               Tied to the radiator, gagged with duct tape, is Nadia.

               John looks down at her. She looks away as her eyes fill with 
               tears.

               He sits on the bed facing her. They stay like that for a 
               long moment before he reaches over and starts untying her 
               knots. He peels the tape off her mouth. Suddenly he slaps 
               her across the face.

               Her head hits the radiator. Nadia gasps hard from the shock 
               of the blow. Without warning she slaps his face, equally 
               hard.

               This starts a long silent fight; kicking, hitting, biting, a 
               real struggle.

               Its intensity is almost sexual, but has the edge of real 
               violence. They end up on opposite sides of the room, both 
               panting, hurt and beaten.

                                     NADIA
                              (in English)
                         Great. You've split my fuckin, lip.

               John lies there on the floor, panting, and he hears the 
               English words.

               Exhausted, John stands, wipes his mouth, and rushes her anew. 
               Nadia dodges out the way and cuffs him painfully on the ear. 
               The whole fight starts again and ends only when neither has 
               the strength to go on. Nadia staggers into the bathroom where 
               she shuts the door and begins to sob uncontrollably. John 
               lies on the bed listening to her cry.

               EXT. DUAL CARRIAGEWAY - DAY

               The mid morning traffic flows by on the dual carriageway.

               INT. HAPPY EATER - DAY

               Nadia and John sit in silence in the half empty diner. Nadia 
               has a cut lip and a graze on her chin. John has a Thousand 
               Yard Stare and a lesion over his left cheekbone.

               The Waitress comes over.

                                     WAITRESS
                         Good morning. What can I get you?

                                     NADIA
                         I'll have an espresso, with a small 
                         pastry, a croissant or something.

                                     WAITRESS
                         We only do a croissant with the 
                         Continental breakfast.

                                     NADIA
                         Just get me a coffee.

                                     WAITRESS
                         One coffee. And for you Sir ?

               John doesn't answer.

                                     NADIA
                         He'll have a coffee.

               The waitress leaves them. Nadia lights a cigarette and they 
               sit in tense silence, the pain of betrayal, and recent 
               violence, thick in the air.

                                     JOHN
                         You can't smoke in here.

               Nadia ignores him. John bellows

                                     JOHN
                         YOU CAN'T SMOKE IN HERE!

               The diner falls silent, people stare. She takes a last drag 
               and crushes the butt on the floor. A waitress comes over and 
               puts down two coffees.

                                     NADIA
                         I don't expect you to understand.

               It seems as if John has no intention of replying. He sips 
               his coffee, and puts it down. He begins speaking very calmly.

                                     JOHN
                         Oh, I don't know. In my job as Deputy 
                         Assistant of New Business at the 
                         bank would have to listen to the 
                         problems of a great many individuals. 
                         This took a lot of understanding and 
                         sympathy, to try to work out solutions 
                         to their problems. But, you see, I'm 
                         not in that line of work anymore. 
                         Nowadays I'm a bank robber.

                                     NADIA
                         You don't understand anything.

                                     JOHN
                         I think that about covers it. I think 
                         I have grasped the part about you 
                         being dumped though. That's got to 
                         hurt, I imagine. That's got to smart 
                         a bit. I mean strictly in my 
                         observer's capacity it seemed you 
                         two were getting on Pretty Fucking 
                         Famously.

               He sips his coffee.

                                     JOHN
                         Unless. Unless this is part of the 
                         routine. You get tied up, stick 
                         around, distract me, they both bust 
                         in and Steal My Cup Of Coffee.

                                     NADIA
                         It's makes it easier. Okay.

                                     JOHN
                         I don't want to know.

                                     NADIA
                         It makes it faster. If I don't speak 
                         to the men, they fall faster. It's 
                         pretty obvious why.

                                     JOHN
                         That's a relief. It's nice to know 
                         I'm a regular guy.

               Pause.

                                     NADIA
                         So what are you going to do?

                                     JOHN
                         I'm going to drink my coffee. Then, 
                         we're going to the police station. 
                         Where there will be lawyers, loss of 
                         job, house, humiliation, gutter press, 
                         and probably prison.

                                     NADIA
                         They don't blame you. When a bank 
                         employee does this they understand. 
                         You get your life back. Anyway I bet 
                         you hated that bank.

                                     JOHN
                         Even so I always felt the decision 
                         to burst in and rob it very much 
                         remained with me.

                                     NADIA
                         Why else would you send off for me? 
                         If you just wanted sex just go to a 
                         prostitute.

                                     JOHN
                         Well as it turns out I did.

               She slaps his face. He slaps hers back. The waitress comes 
               over.

                                     WAITRESS
                         More coffee?

                                     JOHN
                         Yes please.

                                     NADIA
                         No.

               She pours for John.

                                     JOHN
                         Splendid. Thank you.

                                     WAITRESS
                         Pleasure.

               She smiles and leaves them. John watches her walk away.

                                     NADIA
                         John, I need your help.

               This really tickles John. He has to put his coffee down.

                                     JOHN
                         You must think... I'm the biggest 
                         pillock... In the world.

                                     NADIA
                         No I don't.

                                     JOHN
                         In the world.

                                     NADIA
                         I know you just want to punish me --

                                     JOHN
                         I do. I want to very badly.

                                     NADIA
                         So you're just going to be vindictive

                                     JOHN
                         In every sense. If at all possible.

                                     NADIA
                         You can't hurt me more than I'm hurt 
                         already.

                                     JOHN
                         Well, Nadia, It it's all the same to 
                         you, I'd like to give it a bash.

               Pause.

                                     NADIA
                         My name isn't Nadia.

               John stares back at her.

               EXT. HAPPY EATER CAR PARK - DAY

               John drags her by the arm across the car-park towards the 
               Rover.

               EXT. OUTSIDE POLICE STATION

               John drags her out of the Rover. She wrestles her arm free 
               and walks up the steps on her own, with some dignity. John 
               follows her.

               INT. POLICE STATION DUTY DESK - DAY

               They sit side by side in the waiting room, not talking. Nadia 
               looks resigned to her fate. John is tight-jawed, unyielding.

               They wait as the the Duty Sergeant deals with a woman who's 
               lost her hat.

                                     NADIA
                              (quietly, to John)
                         Where's the restroom?

                                     JOHN
                         What?

                                     NADIA
                         I'm going to be sick. Where's the...

                                     JOHN
                         What? No you're not..

                                     NADIA
                         I'm going... I am... I'm going to be 
                         sick.

                                     JOHN
                              (overlapping)
                         No you're not. How... Nice one. How 
                         dumb do you think I am ?

               Nadia stands and addresses the Duty Sergeant.

                                     NADIA
                         Where's the restroom?

                                     SERGEANT
                         The what, love?

                                     NADIA
                         The toilet. Where's...

                                     SERGEANT
                         Down there on the left.

               She heads off. John springs up. He seizes her arm as casually 
               as possible.

               INT. POLICE STATION CORRIDOR - DAY

               John frog marches Nadia down the corridor to the Ladies. She 
               wrestles her arm free again and disappears inside.

               John lurks outside. He seems certain she's got one leg out 
               the window RIGHT NOW.

               He can't bear it any longer. He looks both ways and nips 
               inside.

               INT. LADIES - DAY

               Standing in the Ladies, John hears Nadia in a cubicle, 
               throwing up. He hears the toilet flush.

               Nadia comes out. He looks at her.

                                     JOHN
                         You're pregnant.

               Nadia looks at the floor.

               INT. POLICE CORRIDOR - DAY

               John walks out of the toilet and stands against the wall of 
               the corridor. He looks both ways. After a few seconds Nadia 
               appears in the corridor. They stand there. John isn't looking 
               at her.

               A policeman appears from round the corner, and walks towards 
               them. He stops, and addresses John.

                                     POLICEMAN
                         Can I help you?

               John looks at the Policeman, then at Nadia. The seconds pass.

                                     POLICEMAN
                         Sir? Can I help you?

               John is still looking at Nadia -- He closes his eyes.

                                     JOHN
                         No.

               EXT. OUTSIDE POLICE STATION - DAY

               John walks back to the Rover, Nadia behind. They reach the 
               car. Nadia looks at John over the roof of the car.

                                     NADIA
                         What are you doing?

               John looks sick. He speaks very quietly.

                                     JOHN
                         Get in the car.

               He gets inside. Nadia is left standing there. She gets in 
               too.

               INT. / EXT. JOHN'S CAR - DAY

               John driving with Nadia in the passenger seat. She is looking 
               across at him.

               He is taking no notice.

                                     NADIA
                         Plenty of women have babies in prison.

               John ignores her.

                                     NADIA
                              (tersely)
                         You don't have to do this. I can 
                         look after myself.

                                     JOHN
                              (flatly)
                         Have you got your passport?

                                     NADIA
                         What?

                                     JOHN
                         Shut up. Have you got your passport?

                                     NADIA
                         Yes.

               They drive along.

                                     JOHN
                         We've got to get off this motor-way.

               EXT. MOTORWAY JUNCTION - DAY

               From above we watch the car turn off the motorway, around a 
               roundabout and into a country B road.

               INT. CAR - DAY

               John is turning the pages in his Road Atlas. He is trying to 
               drive and map read at the same time. Nadia is looking out of 
               the window. Soon a big tear rolls down her cheek. She starts 
               to cry.

               John glances up from his map but ignores it. But she keeps 
               crying. He tosses the map in the back, pulls the car to the 
               side of the road and switches off the engine. As Nadia cries, 
               John gazes impassively out of the window. This goes on for 
               almost a minute, until Nadia pulls herself together, when 
               without looking across John restarts the engine and pulls 
               away.

               EXT. COUNTRY ROAD - DAY

               John's car pulling off a B road, into a slip road into a 
               garage.

               EXT. PETROL STATION - DAY

               Stern-faced, John fills the car up with petrol. He eyes the 
               Closed-Circuit.

                                     JOHN
                         Give me some money.

                                     NADIA
                         I don't have any money.

               John stops squeezing petrol.

                                     JOHN
                         What?

                                     NADIA
                         I said I don't have any.

               John stares at Nadia. He eyes the CCTV.

                                     JOHN
                         Give me your sunglasses.

               Nadia passes them and John puts them on,trying to look casual. 
               He gives the pump a couple more squirts, hangs it up, 
               nonchalantly sidles up to his door.

               In one move he opens it, dives in, turns the key in the 
               ignition. The Rover coughs. He tries it again. It howls, 
               barks and sneezes. The attendant comes out onto the forecourt 
               and starts approaching the yellow Rover.

               Miraculously it roars throatily to life, he floors it and 
               the Rover tears away from the station and off down the road

               INT. MOVING CAR - DAY

               We see John at the wheel of his Rover, sunglasses on, wind 
               in his hair, fleeing from the scene of the crime. Nadia 
               watches him in the late sunshine, but John is too busy making 
               a getaway to notice.

               EXT. COUNTRY LANE - DAY

               John's car shimmering as it comes over the brow of a remote 
               country lane, surrounded by fields and rolling hills.

               INT. / EXT. CAR (MOVING) - DAY

               Nadia puts a cigarette in her mouth and pops the dashboard 
               lighter. John takes the cigarette and throws it out the 
               window, followed by the lighter. Nadia just gazes out of the 
               window.

                                     JOHN
                         So, uh, Alexei, which I know isn't 
                         his name...

                                     NADIA
                         I don't want to talk about him.

                                     JOHN
                         Fine.

                                     NADIA
                         It's none of your business.

                                     JOHN
                         Fine. Absolutely. Must be 
                         disappointing though. Must come as a 
                         hell of a shock.

               Nadia ignores him.

                                     JOHN
                         So uh...

                                     NADIA
                         Look, if you want to know is he better 
                         in bed than you then yes he is.

                                     JOHN
                         Oh Jesus.

                                     NADIA
                         If what you want to know is does he 
                         have a bigger cock than you, then 
                         yes he does.

                                     JOHN
                              (overlapping -- bigger)
                         Of course. Of course. Of course he 
                         does. Of course. Thank you. Thanks.

                                     NADIA
                         But, you know, so what?

               They drive.

                                     JOHN
                         It's his baby I take it.

               She doesn't answer.

                                     JOHN
                         Not the kids type then is he? Not 
                         that broody. You must be pretty 
                         miffed.

                                     NADIA
                         He will come back.

                                     JOHN
                         Excuse me?

                                     NADIA
                         He left me my passport and ticket. 
                         It's pretty clear he wants to see me 
                         again.

                                     JOHN
                         Yeah. I tend to tie up and abandon 
                         women I really want to see again 
                         too.

                                     NADIA
                         No. But you tend to tie them up.

               John freezes. He looks across. Nadia gives nothing back.

                                     JOHN
                         Fuck off.

               Nadia is just looking at him.

                                     JOHN
                         Fuck off. You started it.

               She is just looking at him.

                                     JOHN
                         I don't want to talk about it.

                                     NADIA
                         Why not?

                                     JOHN
                         Shut up. I'm not listening.

                                     NADIA
                         You don't want to talk about it.

                                     JOHN
                         No.

                                     NADIA
                         Okay we won't talk about it.

               Nadia looks out the window.

                                     NADIA
                         We'll pretend it never happened.

                                     JOHN
                         So. What's it like having to fuck 
                         men you hate?

                                     NADIA
                         I don't hate you.

                                     JOHN
                         Okay. Let's... Okay. Okay. You have 
                         had sex with people you don't like 
                         haven't you? For money. To make money.

                                     NADIA
                         And? What are you saying?

                                     JOHN
                         And. It's wrong.

                                     NADIA
                         And who says what is wrong.

                                     JOHN
                         And that would be Morals. That would 
                         be one's own moral sense of decency.

                                     NADIA
                         What's a moral orgasm John? Tell me 
                         how it feels exactly.

                                     JOHN
                         So. What then? You just detach sex 
                         from everything..

                                     NADIA
                         Whereas "Wet 'n' Wild" is an emotional 
                         journey. "Tied and Tethered". It's 
                         pretty moving huh? Like Anna Karenina.

                                     JOHN
                         Listen. I didn't go rooting around 
                         in your private stuff.

               John remembers he did. Nadia looks across knowingly.

                                     NADIA
                         Funny. Usually it's the first thing 
                         they do.

               Pause.

                                     JOHN
                         So what? Do you just switch off in 
                         your head or do you imagine you're 
                         with him, or what?

                                     NADIA
                         Sometimes.

                                     JOHN
                         Sometimes which?

                                     NADIA
                         Sometimes neither.

                                     JOHN
                         Some... What does that mean?

                                     NADIA
                         There's nothing wrong in liking sex, 
                         John.

                                     JOHN
                         I don't like sex. I don't think I'll 
                         be having sex ever again.

                                     NADIA
                         Why?

                                     JOHN
                         Well, it's just that the thought 
                         trying to charm up an erection in 
                         front of a woman, or alone for that 
                         matter, makes me want to die.

                                     NADIA
                         So now you hate all women?

                                     JOHN
                         I think it's my safest bet, don't 
                         you?

                                     NADIA
                         Oh. I think you will recover okay. I 
                         think you got what you paid for.

               John looks across.

                                     JOHN
                         What?

                                     NADIA
                         You...

                                     JOHN
                         I got what I paid for.

                                     NADIA
                         You didn't mind too much.

               Pause.

                                     JOHN
                              (quietly)
                         It wasn't what I wanted.

                                     NADIA
                         So what did you want? I think we 
                         understand each other, no?

                                     JOHN
                              (quietly)
                         You don't understand me.

                                     NADIA
                         You don't understand you either.

               John turns to her.

                                     NADIA
                         It's no big thing. You are the same 
                         as most men. You are a man so you 
                         are a savage. Not a monster, but 
                         half animal. You put on a tie and 
                         you go to the bank, but really you 
                         are a beast. But also you are from 
                         woman so you have a soul. Half beast, 
                         half soul. But you hide your beast 
                         in the bottom of the wardrobe. It's 
                         not so healthy. It's fucked you up, 
                         no?

               John stops the car.

                                     JOHN
                         Get out.

               She sits there.

                                     NADIA
                         Excuse me?

                                     JOHN
                         Get out

                                     NADIA
                         You are throwing me out.

                                     JOHN
                         Get out.

               She collects her bag from the back seat, her cigarettes, 
               gathers up her belongings, clicks open the door and gets 
               out, leaving the shot. John sits there staring ahead. We 
               hear her voice offscreen.

                                     NADIA (O.S.)
                         You prefer your women mute.

               John turns the key in the ignition. The engine bellows and 
               screams. Silence.

               He tries again. The engine shrieks and wails like a soul in 
               torment. A terrible, mournful grinding noise. Silence.

                                     NADIA (O.S.)
                         Car trouble?

               John tries to start it. It lets out a whimper, a crying, a 
               few juddering moving sobs, and dies.

               John sits in his dead car. He shakes his head. He rubs his 
               face. He sits there.

               EXT. ROADSIDE VERGE - DUSK

               The two of them on a verge ten feet apart. John stares into 
               the distance.

               Nadia studies the map.

                                     NADIA
                         It's another twenty miles. It's going 
                         dark.

               She gets her holdall from inside the car and stuffs the map 
               inside.

                                     NADIA
                         What now?

               Nadia scans the horizon with her binoculars. John watches 
               her.

                                     JOHN
                         Jesus. You weren't even on the plane.

               Nadia lowers her binoculars and looks at John.

               FLASHBACK - INT. AIRPORT - DAY

               John watches the passengers stream out of the arrivals gate. 
               A woman is greeted and spun around.

               Across the airport, Nadia lowers her binoculars. We pull 
               back to see she is standing next to Alexei.

               They say goodbye in Russian. Even though we don't see 
               subtitles, it's a telling exchange. She kisses him, and he 
               watches her leave him and walk across the floor.

               Alexei watches Nadia approach John, and see him shake her 
               hand.

               They walk away together.

               FLASHBACK - EXT. JOHN'S STREET - NIGHT

               Alexei, dressed in a suit, stands outside John's house, 
               looking up. Nadia is in the window, her lipstick smeared. 
               They gaze at each other.

               EXT. DIFFERENT FOREST - NIGHT

               In a clearing, John watches Nadia carry a pile of sticks to 
               a fire she is building. She lights it with her gun cigarette 
               lighter, and teases the flames to life.

               EXT. FOREST - NIGHT

               John and Nadia sit by the fire. She sits wrapped up to her 
               neck in a blanket.

                                     NADIA
                         You know, in Russia, there's no work 
                         for women. It's a different world.

                                     JOHN
                              (interrupting on 
                              "different")
                         You don't have to say anything

                                     NADIA
                              (overlapping on "say")
                         What? I... I wasn't saying...

                                     JOHN
                              (overlapping on 
                              "saying")
                         Please, there's no... Oh.

                                     NADIA
                         I wasn't saying anything.

                                     JOHN
                         Then okay.
                              (pause)
                         So how old were you when you met 
                         him?

               Pause.

                                     NADIA
                         Fifteen. You don't know him. He was 
                         very kind and strong.

                                     JOHN
                         Yeah. He's a smashing bloke.

                                     NADIA
                         The rest of the world, John, it's 
                         not all like St. Albans.

                                     JOHN
                         Thank Christ for that.

                                     NADIA
                         You are pretty naive if you think it 
                         is.

                                     JOHN
                         I'm pretty naive? Look at you. You 
                         have to do all this, and what have 
                         you got to show for it? Nothing.

                                     NADIA
                         I don't have nothing.

                                     JOHN
                         Well what have you got?

               Pause.

                                     NADIA
                         I have my baby.

               They sit there in the lapping firelight.

                                     JOHN
                         Do you know if it's a boy or a girl?

                                     NADIA
                         No.

                                     JOHN
                         Have you had any before?

                                     NADIA
                         No.

                                     JOHN
                         Are you scared?

                                     NADIA
                         Not really. Maybe a little.

               A fox cries out in the night.

                                     NADIA
                         Listen. I think it's a fox.

               She listens. It cries out again. She gets out her binoculars.

                                     NADIA
                         It sounds close.

               She looks through them and searches the brush. John watches 
               Nadia with her binoculars. He looks suddenly very sad.

                                     NADIA
                         I can't see anything. It's too dark.

               She puts them back in her bag. John watches her. He sees her 
               wrist again. She lights a cigarette, and blows the smoke 
               into the air.

                                     NADIA
                         What happened between you and the 
                         blonde?

                                     JOHN
                         What?

                                     NADIA
                         The thin... the girl with small eyes. 
                         The one in your cupboard.

                                     JOHN
                         It's none of your business. She didn't 
                         have small eyes.

                                     NADIA
                         Did she leave you? Come on. It's 
                         nothing to be ashamed of. Who did 
                         she leave you for? Your best friend? 
                         Her boss? A woman? Did she leave you 
                         for a woman, John?

                                     JOHN
                         She's dead.

               Pause.

                                     NADIA
                         I'm sorry. I didn't mean to hurt 
                         you. I'm sorry. That's awful. Forgive 
                         me.

               Pause.

                                     NADIA
                         I'm sorry.

                                     JOHN
                         I don't know why I said that. She's 
                         not dead at all.

               Nadia looks at John.

                                     NADIA
                         What?

                                     JOHN
                         I don't know why I said it. I'm sorry.

                                     NADIA
                         She's alive?

               Nadia starts to laugh. Long and loud. We have never seen her 
               laugh before.

                                     NADIA
                         She's alive!! She is not dead?

                                     JOHN
                         Laugh it up.

               She starts to cough. She gets on her hands and knees and 
               coughs like fury.

                                     JOHN
                         You should stop smoking. You're 
                         pregnant. You smoke like a fucking 
                         lab dog.

                                     NADIA
                         I'm trying to quit.

                                     JOHN
                         I've got news for you. It's not 
                         working.

                                     NADIA
                         I smoke more these days. I smoke 
                         more when I'm unhappy.

                                     JOHN
                         Nobody's that unhappy.

                                     NADIA
                         Maybe I want to die. Don't you want 
                         me to die?

                                     JOHN
                         I don't want anyone to die.

                                     NADIA
                         Except for Small Eyes.

                                     JOHN
                         Except for Small Eyes.

               She laughs again.

                                     NADIA
                         So why did it end?

               John thinks. It looks as if he's going to tell the whole 
               story. In the end he shrugs.

                                     JOHN
                         I don't know.

                                     NADIA
                         What was her name?

                                     JOHN
                         What's your name?

               The fox cries out again.

                                     NADIA
                         Listen. It's definitely a fox. Now 
                         I'm scared.

               They listen to the fox crying in the night.

                                     NADIA
                         You know you can come under the 
                         blanket.

                                     JOHN
                         It's alright.

               The scene from bird's eye view. John lies back and stares at 
               the stars. Nadia curls up on the other side of the fire, and 
               hugs herself.

               We push down closer and closer until we are on John's face. 
               The theme returns.

               The cricket boys from John's Close stand in a line in the 
               middle of the street, bathed in flashing blue light. We pan 
               round and end on John's house.

               It is surrounded with Police.

               Police cars, Police Vans, plastic police tape "POLICE LINE. 
               DO NOT CROSS."

               John's neighbours press against the tape as officers come 
               and go.

               Inside the house is full of police, ransacking his possessions 
               and dusting fingerprints. A policeman is standing reading 
               The English-Russian Dictionary.

               We push on upstairs and along the landing to the spare room.

               An officer dumps a pile of porno magazines and videos on the 
               bed. He then spots the belts tied to the bedstead and points 
               them out to a detective. They exchange a knowing grin. A 
               photographer steps up and snaps the paraphernalia in a 
               blinding flash.

               The birthday cake is there, half eaten. A Policewoman puts 
               it in a baggy.

               We pan across the bed, across the magazines and underwear in 
               plastic bags, down below the bed, where we find the photograph 
               of Nadia with the binoculars.

               The young girl smiles hopefully out at us from the past.

               Early dawn. A woodpigeon coos. John wakes up next to the 
               dead fire. Nadia is gone.

               EXT. FOREST SLOPE / STREAM - DAY

               John slides down a rocky slope. He scans the forest, but 
               there's no-one around. He hurries through high bracken then 
               stops suddenly by a large oak.

               EXT. STREAM - DAY

               In a pool in a stream below, Nadia is washing herself. She 
               has her back to us.

               John watches her for a moment, before his eyes avert, and 
               his head bows.

               EXT. FIELD - DAY

               A shimmering sun. A giant combine harvester cuts a wide swathe 
               through a field of high corn. As it passes we find John and 
               Nadia coming towards us through the heat haze.

               They aren't speaking and both look tired. As they pass we 
               crane up out of the corn to catch an enormous 757 Jumbo Jet 
               just above us, coming into land. We pan round to see, half a 
               mile away, the massive airport beyond.

               They walk towards it, two tiny figures.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               Aeroflot 1311. Boarding Gate 12.

               INT. AIRPORT - NIGHT

               An attendant pushes a train of trolleys past. Businessmen 
               talk into mobile phones.

                                     NADIA
                         I've got an hour. Can I buy you a 
                         coffee?

                                     JOHN
                         No. I think I better just go.

                                     NADIA
                         Okay. Thank you.

                                     JOHN
                         Whatever.

               Nadia hesitates. There's just a touch of regret in this 
               goodbye.

                                     NADIA
                         John. These are for you.

               She hands him the binoculars case.

                                     JOHN
                         Yeah. No thanks.

                                     NADIA
                         Please. Why not?

                                     JOHN
                         Because it was a lie.

               She smiles.

                                     NADIA
                         No it wasn't.

               John shrugs. He takes them.

                                     NADIA
                         Goodbye.

               John nods and turns. Nadia watches him walk away.

               INT. / EXT. AIRPORT EXIT - NIGHT

               On the other side of the airport, John stands in front of 
               the exit to the taxi ranks. He's got nowhere to go. Passengers 
               swirl around him.

               He looks at the binocular in his hands. He removes the 
               binoculars and looks at them. Suddenly he stops. In the case 
               is a folded note marked John. John holds it in his hands -- 
               Slowly, deliberately, he screws it up, and drops it in the 
               case like a bin.

               P.O.V. OF JOHN

               Through the binoculars. Passengers criss-cross, but we find 
               Nadia sitting alone, waiting for her call.

               John lowers the binoculars and gazes across the airport. He 
               raises them for one last look.

               Nadia, glimpsed through the crowd. We spy someone standing 
               about twenty feet behind her. It is Alexei.

               We watch Alexei approach her. She looks up and is completely 
               thrown.

               Yuri stands about ten feet away, in shades.

               John lowers the binoculars, horrified. He looks again.

               Nadia pulls her arm away. Alexei crouches down in front of 
               her and puts a hand on her knee, coaxing her.

               Alexei takes her by the arm and leads her away.

               EXT. AIRPORT - NIGHT

               John hurries out of the exit to catch the trio leaving a 
               different exit fifty yards away, where they get into a taxi.

               EXT. AIRPORT - NIGHT

               John runs across a car park and over a low fence.

               EXT. SLIP ROAD TO AIRPORT - NIGHT

               He chases down a slip road, as the taxi rounds the corner 
               behind us. He takes cover behind a van as they drive past, 
               and away.

               EXT. GRASS VERGE - NIGHT

               John runs across a grass verge and another car park. He sees 
               the taxi rounding the corner and head down the road in front 
               of him.

               John runs as fast as he can up this road, but the taxi is 
               getting away. Eventually he gives up, and he drives away.

               EXT. ROUNDABOUT - NIGHT

               At the roundabout it turns round and starts coming back up 
               the road. John hides behind a car, and watches the taxi pull 
               up outside a small hotel about fifty yards away. He watches 
               the trio head into the hotel.

               EXT. HOTEL PERIMETER - NIGHT

               John skirts around the edge of the hotel. He peers in through 
               one of the windows. It's the foyer. He heads around the back.

               EXT. BACK OF HOTEL - NIGHT

               At the back of the hotel he looks through another couple of 
               windows. Suddenly he drops like he's been shot, and sits on 
               the grass.

               Warily he looks again.

               EXT. / INT. THE VIEW THROUGH THE WINDOW

               Alexei stands smoking in the middle of the room. Nadia is 
               sitting in a chair crying.

               Alexei kneels again and appeals to her. Nadia is resisting 
               and yells back, but something Alexei says seems to melt her 
               resolve.

               He holds her face, and kisses it. She turns her face. He 
               tries again, and this time she accepts the kiss. Slowly she 
               kisses him back.

               EXT. OUTSIDE ALEXEI'S SUITE - NIGHT

               John stares through the window at the scene.

               INT. INSIDE ALEXEI'S SUITE - NIGHT

               In the room, Yuri pops his head round the door and says 
               something to Alexei.

               Alexei says he's coming. He kisses Nadia again and leaves.

               Nadia is alone. She looks very sad and confused. She moves 
               towards the window and stares out into the blackness.

               EXT. OUTSIDE ALEXEI'S SUITE - NIGHT

               John's face at the window. Almost cheek to cheek with Nadia.

               INT. INSIDE ALEXEI'S SUITE - NIGHT

               Inside the room, looking out. It is pitch black.

               EXT. OUTSIDE ALEXEI'S SUITE - NIGHT

               John watches Nadia walk over to the dresser and search the 
               drawers. She goes over to the bed and looks under the pillow. 
               There she finds what she is looking for. Alexei's hunting 
               knife.

               She hears Alexei coming and stands hard against the window. 
               the huge knife behind her back.

               EXT. OUTSIDE ALEXEI'S SUITE - NIGHT

               John outside. He is four inches from the knife.

                                     JOHN
                         Oh Jesus.

               John ducks down, panting, swallowing hard. At once he springs 
               up and skirts the building again. He finds a window to the 
               next suite.

               He tries to force it open. Suddenly Yuri's face appears in 
               the window, cupped by his hands peering out into the 
               blackness. John drops down holds his breath.

               John scrambles back to the previous window. With real effort 
               he presses it open. He pulls himself up and drops inside.

               INT. ALEXEI'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

               Nadia still stands by the window, one hand behind her back. 
               Alexei sits on the bed. The scene is subtitled.

                                     ALEXEI
                         I love you. I don't need to tell you 
                         that.

               Nadia looks at the floor.

                                     ALEXEI
                         I wouldn't leave my child would I? 
                         You know that. I was confused. That's 
                         all.

               INT. ALEXEI'S BATHROOM / HALLWAY - NIGHT

               John opens the bathroom door a crack. He is at the opposite 
               end of a corridor from the bedroom. He can hear Alexei's 
               voice.

               Breathing hard, he tiptoes out and stands in the corridor, 
               his back pressed hard against the wall. He takes one step 
               down the hall. The floor creaks loudly.

               INT. ALEXEI'S SUITE - NIGHT

                                     ALEXEI
                         It wasn't easy for me. You know what 
                         I'm like. I needed to know what I 
                         wanted. Now I know. It's simple. I'm 
                         happy.

               INT. ALEXEI'S SUITE HALLWAY - NIGHT

               John takes another step down the hallway. There, by the door 
               are the two guitar cases full of money. Next to them is 
               Nadia's bag. Crouching, John opens the bag and searches 
               inside. He finds what he is looking for; the Silver Cigarette 
               Lighter-Pistol.

               We hear the Russian lovers' voices next door. John is 
               absolutely terrified, breathing hard and shaking, holding 
               the little gun.

               INT. ALEXEI'S SUITE - NIGHT

                                     ALEXEI
                         You still love me? Eh? Of course you 
                         do. Come here. Yuri won't be here 
                         for a while. Come on babe.

               He takes his shirt off -- Nadia glances up -- With horror, 
               she sees John in the doorway.

               Alexei turns to see John stand by the door, holding a little 
               silver gun.

                                     NADIA
                         What are you doing here?

               John and Nadia look at each other.

                                     ALEXEI
                         What the fuck is he doing here?

               He looks at the little gun.

                                     ALEXEI
                         That's that cigarette lighter I gave 
                         you isn't it?

               Alexei stands. John takes a step back. Alexei walks calmly 
               towards John and throws a punch. It catches John right on 
               the chin and he hits the wall and goes down very fast.

                                     NADIA
                         Stop.

               Alexei turns round to see Nadia holding the knife. He is 
               dumbstruck.

                                     ALEXEI
                         What? What are you doing?

                                     NADIA
                              (to John)
                         What are you doing here?

               Alexei kicks John in the ribs.

                                     NADIA
                              (in Russian)
                         Stop it!

               He looks at Nadia, the girl he came back for, angrily pointing 
               the knife at him. He suddenly looks completely punctured. 
               John has struggled up again and stands behind him. They are 
               both looking at Nadia.

                                     ALEXEI
                         What. You're what? You're with this 
                         creep now.

                                     NADIA
                         Leave him!

                                     ALEXEI
                         You have. You've actually fallen for 
                         this prick.

                                     NADIA
                         No I haven't.

               Alexei looks dumbstruck. He laughs emptily

                                     ALEXEI
                         Babe it's me. I won't let you get 
                         away.

               Nadia stares back at him. The seconds pass. She speaks in a 
               whisper.

                                     NADIA
                         I'll kill you if you try.

               In the impasse, John picks up a lamp and hurls it at Alexei's 
               head. It is going to hit him, but reaches the length of its 
               cord and stops six inches short. In the confusion. Alexei 
               grabs Nadia's wrist and forces her to the ground. He grabs 
               the knife, just as John brains him with one of the guitars. 
               It emits a fruity final chord.

               INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR / ALEXEI'S SUITE - NIGHT

               Whistling, Yuri comes out of his suite, knocks briskly on 
               the door of Alexei's and enters. We walk with him down the 
               hallway into the bedroom to find Alexei, heartbroken, tied 
               and bound to a desk chair.

               Yuri murmurs something in Russian.

                                     SUBTITLE
                         Fuck a duck.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. ALEXEI'S SUITE - NIGHT

               Nadia stands at the window and stares at her reflection, or 
               past it into the blackness.

                                     NADIA
                         Get their passports.

               John finishes tying up Yuri, and removes his passport from 
               his jacket. Behind Nadia another plane arcs up into the night 
               sky.

               He takes Alexei's passport from his pocket, but Alexei is 
               only watching Nadia.

                                     ALEXEI
                         Don't do this.

               She carefully places tape across his mouth.

               Almost as if having second thoughts she bends down to kiss 
               his cheek. The 'kiss' suddenly makes Alexei's eyes widen in 
               pain. As she stands her lips are bloody. She's bitten him on 
               the cheek. A single streak of blood runs from the gash.

                                     NADIA
                              (to John)
                         Get your money.

               John collects the cases and they head for the door. Nadia 
               stops to look back at Alexei. A final look.

               EXT. AIRPORT - NIGHT

               The front of the terminal. Taxis pull up and idle at a rank, 
               bringing travelers to their flights. The automatic doors 
               slide back and forth.

               INT. AIRPORT CHECKING IN DESK - NIGHT

                                     ANNOUNCEMENT (V.O.)

                         to Moscow. Proceed immediately to 
                         Gate 12.

               John carries the guitar cases full of money. Nadia just has 
               her small camouflaged hold all. They walk quickly together 
               in silence and come to a stop at the departure lounge gate 
               12.

                                     JOHN
                         Are you okay?

               She nods.

                                     JOHN
                         Okay. Goodbye.

                                     NADIA
                         Goodbye.

               They shake.

                                     JOHN
                         What will you do now?

               Nadia shrugs.

                                     NADIA
                         Something else.

                                     JOHN
                         Okay. Promise?

               She looks at him.

                                     NADIA
                         Promise.

               They stand around. She takes the last cigarette from a pack.

                                     JOHN
                         You can probably buy them on the 
                         flight.

                                     NADIA
                         I'm quitting. This will be my last 
                         one. So. Goodbye.

                                     JOHN
                         Goodbye.

                                     NADIA
                         You didn't deserve me John Buckingham.

                                     JOHN
                         Whatever.

                                     NADIA
                         I'm sorry.

                                     JOHN
                         Please.

               Pause.

                                     NADIA
                         You prefer your women...

               She seems about to say something more when the tannoy 
               interrupts.

                                     ANNOUNCEMENT (V.O.)
                         Gate closing for Flight 1311 to 
                         Moscow. Please have your tickets 
                         ready.

               She leans forward and kisses him. As they kiss, John puts a 
               guitar case in her hand. Nadia looks down at the case.

                                     NADIA
                         It's not mine.

                                     JOHN
                         It's not mine either.

                                     NADIA
                         It's what you came back for.

               John frowns and looks a little embarrassed.

               She speaks to him in Russian and we see the subtitles.

                                     NADIA
                              (in Russian)
                         You're a big surprise, you know.

               Pause.

                                     JOHN
                         Yeah, you see when I said I didn't 
                         speak Russian I wasn't actually just 
                         making it up.

               She leans forwards and whispers in his ear. John looks at 
               her. He looks to the four corners of the airport. And back 
               at her.

                                     JOHN
                         Why?

                                     NADIA
                         I'm not asking you to marry me.

                                     JOHN
                         No. What? No. I know.

                                     NADIA
                         It's more like a date.

                                     JOHN
                         It's a long way to go for a date.

                                     NADIA
                         Tell me about it.

               Pause. She speaks softly in Russian. We see the subtitle:

                                     NADIA
                         All that matters is to try...

               John frowns.

                                     NADIA
                              (in Russian)
                         We can only try. Say it.

               John repeats the phrase in Russian.

                                     JOHN
                         What does it mean?

                                     NADIA
                         Maybe you will find out.

               Pause. Nadia kneels and opens the guitar case. She stealthily 
               removes about five hundred.

                                     NADIA
                         Hurry. I'll wait for you here.

                                     JOHN
                         Right.

               INT. TICKET SALES - NIGHT

               John runs across the airport to the ticket desk. He joins a 
               queue of about three people. He works his way to the front.

                                     JOHN
                         Is the flight full?

                                     OFFICIAL
                         I'm sorry Sir. I believe the flight 
                         is closed.

                                     JOHN
                         Please check. Is it full? Please 
                         could you check.

                                                                   BACK TO:

               INT. AIRPORT - NIGHT

               Nadia stands alone holding her unlit cigarette, thinking. 
               She looks at the two guitar cases at her feet. She looks 
               across at John, anxiously drumming on the ticket sales 
               counter. What is she thinking?

               INT. TICKET SALES - NIGHT

               CLOSE SHOT on the photo of Yuri in his passport.

               The Aeroflot desk official holds the passport and studies at 
               John. With his four day beard there is a resemblance, but 
               it's far from perfect.

                         Cash.

               John collects his ticket, turns and heads back to where he 
               left Nadia with the guitar cases. He suddenly stops.

               She's gone.

               He looks all around. People swirl about. She's nowhere to be 
               seen.

               John hangs his head. He turns, and walks away.

               INT. AIRPORT CAFE - NIGHT

               John sits at a cafe table, and watches the people come and 
               go. He looks strangely calm, resigned.

               CLOSE UP: John's fingers uncrumple the note from the 
               binoculars case. He smooths it on the table, then opens it.

               Inside is written a short phrase in Russian:

               Kam Kapsi Schta.

               John looks at the note. He folds it closed and surveys the 
               airport for an exit.

               Through the crowd, fifty feet away, getting a light off two 
               policeman; it's her.

               Nadia blows out smoke, and speaks to the policeman. John 
               watches her. He smiles.

               Suddenly she turns and points straight at John. The Policeman 
               look straight at him. As they head towards him, Nadia picks 
               up the cases and walks away.

               John sits frozen as the Police approach.

                                     POLICE 1
                         Excuse me Sir...

               He takes John by the arm. John stands.

                                     POLICE 2
                         Okay. Come with us now.

                                     POLICE 1
                         He doesn't speak English. He's 
                         epileptic or something.

                                     POLICE 2
                         Can he walk? Can you walk?

               The Policeman help John to the front of the gate, where he 
               is shown to the front of the queue. The Policeman explains 
               to the airline staff.

               We see that Nadia is one behind in the queue. The Police 
               turn and walk away.

               INT. AIRPORT BOARDING GATE - FLIGHT 1311 TO MOSCOW - DAY

               John pushes his passport and ticket under the perspex window. 
               He glances at Nadia, then looks at the young airport official, 
               the blood beating in his ears.

               For a few interminable seconds the official's eyes burn into 
               John. John turns to Nadia and holds her gaze.

                                     JOHN
                         Kam. Kapsi. Schta.

               The subtitle appears: You've saved me.

               Nadia looks down at the floor. She smiles.

               CLOSE SHOT: The passport is snapped shut and pushed back 
               through.

               INT. AIRPORT BOARDING CORRIDOR - DAY

               John walks without looking back. He turns to see Nadia is 
               behind him. As they round the corner, she hands him a case.

               They walk side by side without speaking.

               Both look forward, straight-faced, as it both are thinking 
               about what it is that they are actually doing. John looks 
               back once, but he keeps walking. He looks across at Nadia, 
               but she doesn't look back.

               They stop opposite the automatic boarding doors. Nadia turns 
               to John.

                                     NADIA
                         My name's Sophia.

                                     JOHN
                         Sophia. Hello Sophia. Mine's still 
                         John.

                                     SOPHIA
                         Hello John.

               The doors slide open. John and Sophia walk through, and 
               disappear.

               SFX. The roar of Jet engines.

               EXT. AIRPORT RUNWAY - NIGHT

               With a deafening roar, an Aeroflot Boeing 757 lifts slowly 
               from the runway and climbs up into the night sky, where it 
               becomes a distant star.

               EXT. FIELD - DAY

               A distant aeroplane in a cobalt blue sky, through binoculars.

               The young girl from the very first scene lowers the binoculars 
               and lets them hang around her neck. She squints up at the 
               sun.

               A voice calls her.

                                     WOMAN'S VOICE
                         Nadia!

               The girl looks round.

                                     WOMAN'S VOICE
                         Nadia!

               She runs past us and we follow to see a couple sitting on 
               the grass having a picnic.

               The girl hurries towards them and we realise the couple are 
               John and Sophia, the girl her child. She sits down with them.

                                         THE END

     CREDITS ROLL OVER

     Black and white newsreel footage from the 1930s. Clips from
     prize fights featuring two different boxers against various
     opponents. One a light heavyweight--pure finesse, a
     counterpunches; the other, stouter and stronger, a
     headhunting puncher.

     The intercutting of the two fighters suggests a possible
     showdown at the end of the newsreel. No such luck.

     END CREDITS

     CLOSE UP ON:

     A TRIPLE CARBON LAPD "INCIDENT REPORT" FORM trapped in an old
     Corona typewriter. The keys pound letters into the blank
     spaces.

     INCIDENT: THE ZOOT SUIT RIOTS...JUNE 10, 1943...
     REPORTING OFFICER...DWIGHT "BUCKY" BLEICHERT

     EXT. BOYLE HEIGHTS - EVERGREEN AND WABASH - DUSK

     A WORLD WAR II ERA PERSONNEL CARRIER transports twenty silent
     LAPD officers into the heart of downtown Los Angeles. The
     sounds of glass breaking and men screaming serves as backdrop
     for their arrival.

     We focus in on BUCKY BLEICHERT, 26, (The counterpuncher from
     the newsreels) as he jumps from the carrier.

     Bucky's minus his gun but plus a WWI tin helmet and a three
     pound truncheon.

     BUCKY'S POV:

     Hundreds of in-uniform GI's use baseball bats and two-by-
     fours to beat the shit out of Zoot Suit-wearing Mexicans.

     Most of the cops wander to the edge of the race riot and
     hobnob with the pockets of MPs and Shore Patrol who've chosen
     to "restore order" by cheering on their countrymen against
     the outnumbered but equally fierce zooters.

     Sailors shatter streetlights and shop windows. Darkness falls
     quickly on what Bucky rightly realizes is chaos.

     Suddenly Bucky's RUNNING--

     away from the action...

     down a side street and onto a

     QUIET RESIDENTIAL BLOCK.

     He slows to a jog, trying to gather his thoughts. And then a
     voice:

                          VOICE
               Bleichert! Bleichert!

     EXT. A BUNGALOW COURTYARD - SAME

     A POLICE OFFICER has THREE MARINES IN DRESS BLUES and ONE
     ZOOT SUITER cornered in a center walkway.

     The marines swipe clumsily at the officer with their two-by-
     fours as he bobs back and forth on the balls of his feet,
     dodging the blows like the ex-fighter he is.

                          VOICE OVER
               I already knew him by reputation, had our
               respective records down pat: Lee
               Blanchard, 43-4-2 as a heavyweight,
               formerly a regular attraction at the
               Hollywood Legion Stadium.

     The terrified Mexican stands frozen on one side of Blanchard,
     trying to avoid the entire mess as the policeman parries the
     marines' blows with his own truncheon.

                          LEE BLANCHARD
               Code three, Bleichert!

     Bucky runs into the courtyard and immediately wades in,
     fending off the marines' blows to jab at them with his stick.

                          VOICE OVER
               And he knew me, Bucky Bleichert, light-
               heavy, 36-0-0, ranked tenth by Ring
               magazine in 1937 fighting no-name
               opponents in no-man's-land division.

     On instinct, Bucky drops his baton and begins wailing on the
     marines with his fists, connecting hard punches with soft
     midsections.

                          VOICE OVER (cont'd)
               In our first year at Central we'd never
               spoke--but people spoke of us. Opinions
               about a fantasy Bleichert-Blanchard
               fight, and who would win.

     And now Blanchard moves in, lashing vicious truncheon blows
     to the shoulders of the marines, sending them one by one into
     a heap.

                          VOICE OVER (cont'd)
               I'd heard almost all of 'em: Blanchard by
               early KO; Bleichert by decision;
               Blanchard stopped on cuts--everything but
               Bleichert by knockout.

     The marines reduced to rubble, Lee Blanchard turns his
     attention to the Zooter: he slaps handcuffs on him and leads
     him away. He motions for Bucky to follow.

     Lee turns back to the marines:

                          LEE
               To the halls of Tripoli, shitbirds.

     One of them flips Lee off. The Zooter kicks him in the chest
     as Lee pulls him away from them, laughing.

     The three men start back toward the riots. Gunshots can be
     heard. Palm trees blaze up into the night.

                          LEE (cont'd)
                   (re the Zooter)
               Bucky Bleichert, meet Senor Tomas Dos
               Santos, subject of an all-points fugitive
               warrant for manslaughter committed during
               the commission of a Class B Felony.
               Snatched a purse off a hairbag and she
               keeled of a heart attack.

                          BUCKY
               You come all the way down here to roust--

                          LEE
                   (smiling)
               I came all the way down here same as you
               did.
                   (jerks a finger to the riots)
               Keep from gettin' killed. Happened to see
               those jarheads beatin' on a good collar--
                   (nudging Dos Santos)
               Habla Ingles, Tomas?

     The man shakes his head "no".

                          LEE (cont'd)
               He's dead meat. Manslaughter Two's a gas
               chamber jolt for spics. Hepcat here's
               about six weeks away from the Big Adios.
               Been better off getting a couple cracked
               ribs from our Privates First Class back
               there.

     Blanchard spies a home with newspapers stacked on the front
     porch.

                          LEE (cont'd)
               We'll never get him booked tonight.

                                                            CUT TO:

     LEE JIMMYING THE FRONT DOOR...

     INT. THE KITCHEN - LATER

     Tomas Dos Santos cuffed by his ankles to a radiator. The
     three men are on their second fifth of Cutty Sark swiped from
     the kitchen cupboard.

     Dos Santos sings a drunken Spanish version of "The
     Chattanooga Choo Choo" before slumping to his side and
     passing out.

     Bucky covers him with a blanket.

                          LEE
               Tom here's my ninth hard felon of the
               month. Six weeks he'll be sucking gas. In
               three years I'll be working Central
               Warrants. Jewboy Deputy D.A. over there
               wets his pants for fighters. Promised me
               the next spot he can wangle.

                          BUCKY
                   (not impressed)
               Impressive.

                          LEE
                   (not impressed either)
               Wanna hear something more impressive? My
               first twenty fights were stumblebums
               handpicked by my manager. My girlfriend
               saw you fight a couple times over at the
               Olympic. Says maybe you could take me.

     Lee gets up and wanders into the living room. From the
     kitchen Bucky watches Lee stare out at the flames.

                          BUCKY
               Whatta we do about the Mex?

                          LEE
               We'll take 'em in the morning.

                          BUCKY
               You'll take him.

                          LEE
               He's half yours, partner.

                          BUCKY
               He's all yours. And I'm not your partner.

                          LEE
                   (without turning)
               Someday.

                                                       DISSOLVE TO:

     A CLOSE UP OF TOMAS DOS SANTOS' FACE

     screaming in silence.

     AS WE PULL BACK TO REVEAL

     Tomas Dos Santos dying in a large Plexiglas GAS CHAMBER.
     Bucky stands in the back of the room, forcing himself to
     watch. He can't stand it and leaves.

     IN THE FRONT ROW

     Lee also watches, elbows on knees and chin in hands. He can't
     stand it, either. He stays.

     IN THE HALLWAY AFTERWARDS

     Bucky watches from afar as men in suits shake Lee's hand and
     brush imaginary lint off of his BRAND NEW SERGEANT'S STRIPES.
     Their eyes meet briefly as Bucky retreats to daylight.

     Another TRIPLE CARBON FORM FILLED OUT ON THE CORONA...

     Transfer and Promotion...Sergeant Lee Blanchard...
     Highland Park Vice to Central Warrants...Effective
     10/14/46

     EXT. 2ND AND BEAUDRY - DAY

     An extremely bored Bucky Bleichert gives a man a speeding
     ticket and sends him on his way.

     EXT./INT. RADIO PATROL CAR - MOVING

     Bucky drives as a ROOKIE COP chatters in the seat next to
     him.

                          ROOKIE
               Yep, three years in the Canal Zone.
               Nothin' but skeeter bites and drunk
               fights over three-dollar skank tail...

     INT. THE CENTRAL MUSTER ROOM - DAY

     Bucky sits at his desk filling out a form as the rookie cop
     prattles on in the background.

                          ROOKIE
               ...fights over three-dollar skank tail...

     AN OLDER OFFICER

     walks by the rookie and rolls his eyes. Catching Bucky's
     look, the cop throws him a shadow punching one-two. Bucky
     smiles thinly. Returns to his paperwork. Then another cop
     passes by and breaks into a bob-and-weave. Bucky looks
     puzzled and annoyed.

     He grabs a third cop walking by (TOM JOSLIN).

                          BUCKY
               Somethin' up, Tommy?

                          TOM
               You, that's what.
                   (off Bucky's look)
               You know Lee Blanchard over at Central
               Warrants?

     Bucky nods.

                          TOM
               His partner's toppin' his twenty and
               goin' for early retirement. Word is the
               felony D.A.'s lookin' for a bright boy to
               fill the spot. Christ knows why but it's
               down to you and Johnny Vogel for the
               spot.

     Bucky takes a surreptitious peek across the room at JOHNNY
     VOGEL, fat, slick-hair and bad skin.

                          BUCKY
               His old man Fritzie's a Central Dick.

                          TOM
                   (chucking Bucky on the chin)
               But who'd look better when they bring back
               the boxing team, eh Buckaroo?

     Bucky shakes his head, dismissing the whole thing.

     INT. THE RADIO PATROL CAR - ANOTHER DAY

     Bucky drives on as the rookie talks and talks...

                          VOICE OVER
               Warrants was local celebrity as a cop.
               Warrants was plainclothes without a coat
               and tie, romance and a mileage per diem
               on your civilian car. Warrants was going
               after the real bad guys and not rousting
               winos and wienie waggers in front of the
               Midnight Mission.

     INT. BUCKY'S GARAGE - NIGHT

     Bucky hits a speed-bag, building up a sweat.

                          VOICE OVER
               I told myself I didn't care.

     He hits the bag faster and faster.

     INT. THE CENTRAL MUSTER ROOM - DAY

     A desk officer hands Bucky a note.

                                                            CUT TO:

     INT. CITY HALL - CHIEF OF DETECTIVES OFFICE - LATER

     A secretary leads Bucky into an office with CHIEF OF
     DETECTIVES THAD GREEN etched on the pebble glass door.

     Inside the office: Lee Blanchard, ASST. D.A. ELLIS LOEW, and
     CHIEF THAD GREEN. They all sit in matched leather chairs.

                          SECRETARY
               Officer Bleichert.

     She exits. An awkward silence.

                          LEE
                   (getting to his feet)
               Gentlemen, Bucky Bleichert. Bucky, Chief
               Thad Green, Deputy DA Ellis Loew.

     Bucky shakes their hands, nodding to each.  Chief Green
     gestures for him to sit.

                          CHIEF GREEN
               Read this aloud, Officer. It's running in
               Sunday's Times.

                          BUCKY
               "Before the war, the City of the Angels
               was graced with two local fighters, born
               and raised a scant five miles apart,
               pugilists with styles as different as
               fire and ice. Lee Blanchard was a
               bowlegged windmill of a leather slinger--

                          CHIEF GREEN
               Skip down to the fire and ice part.

                          BUCKY
                   (searching, finding)
               "Mr. Fire and Mr. Ice never fought each
               other, but a sense of duty brought them
               together in spirit, and both joined the
               Los Angeles Police Department." Blanchard
               cracked the baffling Boulevard-Citizens
               bank robbery case in 1939 and captured
               thrill-killer Tomas Dos Santos; Bleichert
               served with distinction during the '43
               Zoot Suit Wars--"

     A glance to Lee...

                          CHIEF GREEN
               Skip to the end.

                          BUCKY
               "Both men made great sacrifices to serve
               their city, and on Election Day, voters
               are going to be asked to do the same
               thing--vote on a five million dollar bond
               proposal to upgrade the LAPD's equipment
               and provide for an eight percent pay
               raise for all personnel. Keep in mind the

               Whattya think?

                          BUCKY
               Subtle.

     Blanchard and Green smile; Loew frowns.

                          ELLIS LOEW
               Prop. B's looking like a loser right now.
               But if we can drum up some publicity we
               may he able to get it passed in the '47
               Special. We need to build up morale in
               the department.
               Impress voters with the quality of our
               men. Wholesome white boxers are a big
               draw, Bleichert. You know that.

     Bucky looks to Lee.

                          LEE
               Fire and Ice.

                          LOEW
               Ten rounds. The Academy Gym. Three weeks
               from now. Right before the election. All
               the gate to charity. After that, we bring
               back the interdivisional boxing team.
               Wholesome fighters.

                          LEE
               Wholesome.

                          CHIEF GREEN
               Are you in, Bucky?

                          LEE
               It's not like you'll last the ten rounds
               anyway.

     Bucky eyes Lee quickly, assessing his larger but slightly
     softer physique.

     All the remaining eyes are on him.

                          BUCKY
               I'm in.

     Back slaps and congratulations all around.

                          LOEW
               I'm betting on great things from you,
               Bleichert. And if I don't miss my bet we
               may be colleagues soon.

                          BUCKY
               Uh, yes sir.

     EXT. THE CITY HALL PARKING LOT - MINUTES LATEER

     Bucky exits and sees Lee leaning against an unmarked car
     talking with a striking woman in an auburn pageboy cut.

     Lee waves Bucky over.

                          LEE
               Bucky I'd like you to meet Kay Lake.

                          BUCKY
               Hello.

                          FAY
               I saw you fight a couple times. You won.

                          BUCKY
               I always won. You a fight fan?

                          KAY
               Lee used to drag me. I was taking somme
               art classes so I'd sketch the boxers.

     Lee puts his arm around her.

                          LEE
               Made me quit fighting the smokers. Didn't
               want me doin' the "vegetable shuffle."

     He staggers around like a punch-drunk fighter.

                          BUCKY
               I'll try not to hurt you.

     A flicker of anger in her eyes.

                          LEE
               Sure make Loew happy.

                          BUCKY
               He's got money on me, I gather?

                          LEE
               Seems that way.

                          BUCKY
               And if I win I get Warrants?

                          LEE
               Seems that way.

     Bucky shakes his head. Turns to Kay.

                          BUCKY
               What do you think of all this, Miss Lake?

                          KAY
               For moral reasons I hope the LAPD gets
               ridiculed for perpetrating this farce.
               For financial reasons I hope Lee wins.
               And for aesthetic reasons I hope you both
               look good with your shirts off.

     Bucky and Lee break into laughter. Bucky sticks out his hand.
     Lee takes it.

                          BUCKY
               Luck short of winning.

                          LEE
               You, too.

     Bucky tips his hat to Kay and turns to go.

                          KAY
               Luck, Dwight.

     He stops at hearing his real name. But he knows she's waiting
     to see his reaction so he keeps walking...

     EXT./INT. BUCKY'S CAR - LINCOLN HEIGHTS - DAY

     Bucky pulls up in front of a small ugly house in a tired
     neighborhood. He exits the car carrying a cardboard box full
     of canned goods and old girlie magazines.

     ON THE PORCH OF THE HOUSE

     a bony old man sits in a broken chair, aiming a BB pistol at
     some balsa wood airplanes scattered in the yard.

     ON BUCKY'S FACE

     disgust and sadness.

     This is DOLPH BLEICHERT, Bucky's father. Bucky approaches,
     pulling a chair up next to his father. Up close it's even
     worse: white skin stretched tight over blue veins, yellow
     rimming his rheumy eyes. Flecks of dirt and vomit on a filthy
     shirt.

                          BUCKY
               Papa?

                          DOLPH
               Guten tag, Dwight.

                          BUCKY
               Speak English, papa.

                          DOLPH
               Englisch Schiesser! Amerikan Schiesser!

     He aims the BB gun and fires at an airplane: the gun's empty.

     Bucky enters the house. Half-eaten cans of beans on the
     dining room table, an entire legion of broken balsa wood
     airplane kits. Alley cats wander in and out of the kitchen,
     nosing their faces into open tuna fish cans...

     BACK ON THE PORCH

     Dolph leans on the porch rail. Bucky returns.

                          BUCKY
               Say something, Papa. Get me mad. Tell me
               how you can fuck this place up so bad in
               one month.

                          DOLPH
               Du, Dwight? Du?

                          BUCKY
               Speak...English. Papa, please.

     He searches his father's eyes for a response and gets none.

     He surveys the house again. Somewhere in the corner of his
     eye we see the glint of an idea...

     INSIDE THE HOUSE

     Bucky on the phone.

                          BUCKY
               ...He's had another stroke. If you could
               just come by and clean the place up and
               keep an eye on him for week or so...a
               hundred dollars is fine. No more than ten
               days. I promise. I do. Thank you.

     INT. THE POLICE BOXING GYM

     Bucky leans against a wall watching Lee spar. Studying him.
     Mentally fighting the sparring partner's fight.

                          VOICE OVER
               He was better than I thought. It made
               what came next easier.

     INT. A BANK - DAY

     Bucky sits at a desk with an assistant manager and fills out
     forms. The manager counts out approximately $4,500 in cash.
     Bucky slides him the forms. The manager slides him the cash.

     INT. THE GOOD LUCK BAR - NIGHT

     Bucky slides into a booth across from PETE LUKINS.

                          PETE
               So...I'm surprised but I'm not so
               surprised. I hear you been lookin' good.
               Better'n people think.

     Bucky pushes an envelope across to Pete. He looks in it.

                          PETE (cont'd)
               I guess what I hear is correct. Then
               you'll be wantin' to place this with
               Mickey Cohen's indie. He's got Blanchard
               2 to 1--

                          BUCKY
               I'm not bettin' on me, Pete.

                          PETE
                   (a beat)
               Oh.
                   (another beat)
               Then as a friend I feel it's my duty to
               tell you this: you better make it look
               good.

                          BUCKY
               Knockout between rounds eight and ten.

     Pete nods his head, thinking.

                          PETE
               Dragna's got a guy really sold on you.
               Even money. Best you're gonna get.

                          BUCKY
               Thanks, Pete.

     Pete sticks out his hand.

                          PETE
               Luck.

                          BUCKY
               Short of winning?

                          PETE
               Luck.

     Bucky takes his hand.

     INT. THE BOXING GYM - DAY

     Bucky takes apart his sparring partner with a series of
     lightning quick counterpunches.

                          VOICE OVER
               I'd almost finished the Police Academy
               when the background check turned up my
               father's German-American Bund membership.
               Pressured by the FBI goons to confirm my
               patriotism, I gave the Alien Squad Sam
               Murakawa, a guy I'd grown up with, in
               order to secure my LAPD appointment.

     EXT. DOLPH BLEICHERT'S HOUSE - NIGHT

     Bucky watches from across the street as AN OFF-DUTY NURSE
     tries to get Papa Bleichert to eat a sandwich.

                          VOICE OVER
               The old fuck never knew any better. Never
               knew what he cost me. Or Sammy, who'd
               died at Manzanar. I was a good fit in the
               snitch's jacket and with a little
               alteration I slipped easily into the
               whole suit.

     INT. THE BOXING GYM - DAY

     Bucky watches Lee spar. His quick eyes spying:

     --scar tissue over Lee's right eye

     --Lee dropping his left when throwing the right hook

     --Lee tucking his elbows too tight and opening up his ribcage

                          VOICE OVER (cont'd)
               I had traded Warrants for a close-out on
               bad old debts, the eight grand I was
               gonna clear enough to maintain the old
               man in a good clean rest home for three
               years; the late round tank job enough to
               convince myself I wasn't a complete
               coward.

     INT. THE BOXING GYM - DAY

     Kay approaches Bucky as he studies Lee.

                          KAY
               At least he looks good with his shirt
               off.

     She waves to Lee between rounds. He blows a kiss back.

                          BUCKY
               Where's your sketch pad?

                          KAY
               I was never very good. Ended up with a
               degree in History. Masters. Lee's fight
               money paid for it.

                          BUCKY
               Education's an expensive habit to kick.
                   (beat)
               He shouldn't have quit fighting.

                          KAY
               I asked him to. Besides, catching
               animals gave him a sense of order. You
               have a girlfriend, Dwight?

                          BUCKY
               Saving myself for Rita Hayworth.

     A roar from the gym onlookers. Lee's sparring partner hits
     the deck, blood spraying from his mouth.

                          BUCKY (cont'd)
               Quits fighting for you. Puts you through
               school. Quite a guy. Quite a pair.

                          KAY
                   (flirting)
               We're not getting married if that's what
               you're wondering.

                          BUCKY
               Why not? Shacking's against the regs.
               Probably cost him a stripe.

                          KAY
               I have to go, Dwight. Good luck tomorrow
               night.

                          BUCKY
               You didn't answer my question--

                          KAY
                   (a throwaway)
               Lee and I don't sleep together, Dwight.

     She keeps walking. He just stares...

     INT. BUCKY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

     A half-eaten steak and two beers gone. It's six hours later
     and Bucky's still thinking about Kay's exit line. Restless.
     He grabs his jacket.

     INT. HEARST BUILDING - HERALD-EXAMINER MORGUE - NIGHT

     Bucky flashes his badge to a late-night clerk who escorts him
     into the newspaper's morgue. Pulls a bound stack of newspaper 
     clippings and gives them to Bucky. He begins poring through
     them...

     A newspaper photo of a BANK shifts into live action:

     A GRAINY NEWSREEL-TYPE FLASHBACK (SLO-MO)

     An armored truck idles in front of the Boulevard-Citizens
     Bank. Three men dressed in guard uniforms run out of the
     front of the bank, an alarm keening in the background.

     Three police cars converge on the scene and a gun battle
     ensues... Two of the bank robbers are shot as the third man
     (the one carrying the money) jumps into the truck. The truck
     takes off, able to escape when someone from inside the truck
     throws open the doors and pushes the naked and bound
     legitimate guards out the back and into the line of
     pursuit...

                          VOICE OVER
               With no lead on the two escaped men, the
               heist quickly went from page one to page
               five. Two weeks later...

     A newspaper clipping headline: "Tip from Ex-boxer cop
     breaks B-C Bank Job"

     A still photo of Lee which becomes live action as...

     INT. A SMALL VENICE BEACH APARTMENT - DAY (FLASHBACK)

     A younger Lee and four other cops tear apart a small flat. In
     a closet they find BANK GUARD UNIFORMS, BANK BAGS, and a
     small stash of MARIJUANA.

                          VOICE OVER
               One of Lee's snitches fingered Bobby
               DeWitt, a greasy little pimp with a yard
               long rap, as the brains behind the bank
               job.

                                                            CUT TO:

               DeWitt howled frame-up the entire trial,
               never ID'ing the driver or coughing up
               the dough, even after damning character
               testimony from some of his employees,
               including one Katherine Lake, formerly of
               Sioux Falls, South Dakota and looking to
               go straight.

     FLASHBACK: LEE LEADING KAY FROM THE COURTROOM, HAND ON HER
     ELBOW...

                          VOICE OVER (cont'd)
               DeWitt got ten to life at San Quentin;
               Lee got Kay, or maybe the other way
               around.

     BACK TO PRESENT: Bucky walks through downtown L.A., hands
     stuffed in his pockets like James Dean...

                          VOICE OVER (cont'd)
               They both got a few weeks in the gossip
               pages before Kay dove into her college
               education and Lee down the hero's road
               ending in Warrants and a shack job with a
               woman he loved but wouldn't touch...

     Bucky passes A WHORE on the corner, their eyes meet for a
     moment and he walks on.

                          VOICE OVER (cont'd)
               You come off a winning fight. Sweat-
               drenched, tasting blood, still wanting to
               go. The handbooks who made money on you
               bring you a girl. A pro, a semi-pro. You
               do it in the dressing room, or a hallway.
               The eleventh round of a ten round fight.
               And when you go back to an ordinary life,
               it's just weakness, a loss.

     Bucky turns back to give the whore a second look but she's gone.

                          VOICE OVER (cont'd)
               To a fighter, sex tastes like blood and
               resin and suture scrub. I wondered if
               some day that would ever be different.

                                                            CUT TO:

     A HAMMER HITTING A BELL

     and the fight is on.

     INSIDE THE PACKED ACADEMY GYM

     Cops and mobsters sit shoulder to shoulder, cigar smoke like
     L.A. haze as

     LEE CHARGES BUCKY, the big man trying to cut of the ring.
     Bucky engages, dodging Lee's thundering blows and peppering
     back with counterpunches...

     **The general fight storyline is this: a very even and brutal
     match see-sawing back and forth, Bucky doing all he can to
     make it into the middle rounds. Somewhere around the fourth
     or fifth round his competitive juices take over and he begins
     trying to win at all costs. The two men hurt each other
     badly, and in the eighth round it's anybody's fight.
     Bucky punches toe-to-toe with Lee, abandoning his strategy.
     Lee knocks Bucky out.

     INT. BUCKY'S BEDROOM - DAY

     Bucky lies in bed, radio playing jazz. He looks horrible--
     face swollen, lip split, stitches across his nose. He sips
     whiskey from a bottle through a straw.

     The phone rings and rings. He refuses to answer it...

     INT. A REST HOME - ANOTHER DAY

     Bucky, bruised but somewhat better, stands in the hallway of
     a very nice rest home. He surreptitiously watches his father
     as the old man tries to grab at a nurse.

     EXT. THE REST HOME - MINUTES LATER

     Pete Lukins waits outside on the porch for Bucky.

                          PETE
               Well?

                          BUCKY
               He'll catch on soon enough.

     The scene widens behind the two men and we see the sign on
     the facility:

     KING DAVID VILLA

     Jewish stars adorn the sign.

     INT. BUCKY'S APARTMENT - DAY

     Bucky stands in front of his mirror clipping at his stitches
     with scissors. He hears a voice outside his window.

                          VOICE OVER
               Hey. Canvasback!

     Bucky recognizes the voice and goes to the window.

     EXT. THE COURTYARD - SAME

     Lee Blanchard, his own bruises fading, stands in the yard.

                          LEE
               You gonna hide in there another week?
               Ain't you bored yet?

                          BUCKY
               Gettin' there.

                          LEE
               Wanna work Warrants with me?

                          BUCKY
               What?

                          LEE
               Harrell's been callin' to tell you. You
               been hibernating--

                          BUCKY
               But I lost. Loew's deal--

                          LEE
               Don't you read the papers? The bond issue
               passed yesterday. Want the job, partner?

     Off Lee's devilish grin:

                          VOICE OVER
               Mister Fire. Mister Ice. The hero and the
               snitch.

                                                            CUT TO:

     INT. CENTRAL WARRANTS - MORNING

     A door marked "DETECTIVE'S MUSTER ROOM". Bucky, wearing his
     best SPORTS COAT AND SLACKS, pushes through the door.

     INSIDE THE MUSTER ROOM

     Full of the LAPD's plainclothes hotshots. All stand and give
     Bucky a standing ovation. Lee's there, too, playing to the
     crowd.

     On the blackboard at the front of the room: 8%!!!

     CAPTAIN JACK TIERNEY is at the podium.

                          TIERNEY
                   (as introduction)
               Officer Bleichert, the men of Central
               Dicks, Homicide, Ad Vice, Bunco, et
               cetera. I'm Captain Jack Tierney. You and
               Lee are the white men of the hour, so I
               hope you enjoyed your ovation. You won't
               get another one until you retire.

     Everyone laughs. Tierney raps the podium and speaks again.

                          TIERNEY (cont'd)
               Enough horseshit. This is the felony
               summary for the week ending November 14,
               1946. First, three liquor store
               stickups...

     Tierney begins the summary as Bucky's eyes wander around the
     room, taking in his new surroundings... Older men, coats and
     ties... He tunes back in...

                          TIERNEY (cont'd)
               And here's a collar'd please Cap'n Jack
               to no end. Sergeants Vogel, Koenig, have
               you read the SID memos on the Bunker Hill
               burglaries?

     FRITZ VOGEL AND BILL KOENIG, both hulking and unpleasant-
     looking (Fritzie being the elder version of his son Johnny).
     The two men shake their heads "no". Tierney disapproves.

                          TIERNEY (cont'd)
               Set of latents at the last break-in ID's
               one Maynard Coleman, two sodomy priors. A
               surefire baby raper. Highland Park's got
               four child sodomy unsolveds. Maybe he's
               our boy, maybe not. But between that and
               the B&E's I'd put Maynard as a high
               priority lamster right now. There's a
               list of his known associates on the
               bulletin board. Let's all take a look...

     INT. THE MUSTER ROOM - LATER

     The meeting's breaking up. A tall, elegant man (RUSS MILLARD)
     and a squat disheveled man (HARRY SEARS) approach Bucky.

                          RUSS MILLARD
                   (introducing himself)
               Russ Millard, homicides. Wife and kids
               thank you for the raise, Officer.

     Bucky smiles a dumb smile, not knowing what to say.

                          RUSS MILLARD (cont'd)
                   (re the other man)
               My partner, Harry Sears.

                          HARRY
                   (stuttering)
               Y-y-y-yes.  Th-th-thanks Officer B-B-
               Bleichert.

     Before Bucky can answer ELLIS LOEW grabs him by the elbow and
     leads him away.

                          ELLIS LOEW
               Officer Bleichert. Welcome to Central
               Warrants--

     When he gets him out of ear shot:

                          ELLIS LOEW (cont'd)
               You shouldn't have slugged with him. You
               were ahead on all three cards.

                          BUCKY
               The proposition passed, sir.

                          ELLIS LOEW
               Yes but some of your patron's lost money.
               Play things smarter here. Don't blow this
               like you blew the fight.

     Bucky's about to respond when Lee saves him--

                          LEE
               Ready to roll, canvasback?

     He grabs Bucky and they head out the door.

     INT. LEE'S CAR - LATER

     Lee cruises them through downtown, rambling about the job
     description.

                          BUCKY
               Why'd you really quit fighting?

     He pulls the car into a parking lot of a Mexican restaurant.

                          LEE
                   (matter of fact)
               Benny Siegel bought out my contract,
               scared off my manager. Said he'd get me a
               shot at Joe Louis if I'd take two dives
               for him. I said no, joined the Department
               'cuz Jew syndicate boys won't kill cops.
               Anything else?

                          BUCKY
                   (as they exit the car)
               One more. What are we doin' here?

                          LEE
               While you were dancing with Ellis at
               muster I checked Maynard Coleman's KA's
               on the bulletin and recognized the name
               of a fence. Think he tends bar here...

     INSIDE THE RESTAURANT

     Lee and Bucky slide into a booth on either side of BRUNO
     ALBANESE, halfway through plate of huevos rancheros.

                          LEE
               Bruno Albanese?

                          BRUNO
               Who wants to know?

                          LEE
               Police officers, Bruno. Let's make this
               fast so I don't have to watch you eat.

     Lee slides the Maynard Coleman mug shot to Albanese.

                          LEE (cont'd)
               We know he sells to you and we don't
               care. Where is he?

     Albanese burps.

                          BRUNO
               Never seen 'em before.

     Lee sighs. And then grabs Bruno by the back of the neck and
     jams his face into the hot cheese and goo of his food.
     Bruno's arms flap back and forth as Lee drowns him in his
     food.

     Finally Lee shrugs and pulls Bruno's face out of his food,
     blood from his nose mixing with the grease of the enchiladas.

                          BRUNO
               Versailles apartments. Sixth and St.
               Andrews.

     EXT. THE VERSAILLES APARTMENTS - MINUTES LATER

     Lee and Bucky pull up and look for a parking spot just as
     MAYNARD COLEMAN trots down the front stairs and gets into a
     car.

                          BUCKY
               Right there!

     They ease the car back into traffic and follow Coleman's car
     from a safe distance. Bucky picks up the two-way radio. Lee
     gestures for him to put it back:

     Coleman's pulling into the parking lot of THE POLAR PALACE,
     an ICE SKATING RINK. They follow.

     Coleman exits his car, eyeing a group of kids carrying ice
     skates and heading into the Polar Palace. He follows them
     inside...

     The two men follow...

     INSIDE THE POLAR PALACE

     Children skate around on the ice with a giant polar bear
     suit. Lee and Bucky scan the area--not an adult in sight. Lee
     spots some stairs leading to the restrooms and gestures to
     Bucky, who hustles down them.

     ON THE STAIRCASE

     Maynard Coleman, carrying a stuffed bunny rabbit, walks up
     the stairs toward Bucky. Just as the two men pass Bucky PULLS
     HIS GUN and puts it to Coleman's head.

                          BUCKY
               Police officer. You're under arrest.

     Coleman throws his hands in the air; the bunny drops to the
     ground. Bucky cuffs Coleman and leads him up the stairs as
     Lee comes down from above.

     A small voice from below Bucky:

                          VOICE OVER
               Let go of him! Let go of him!

     Bucky looks down to see A SMALL BOY pounding on his leg. The
     kid's hysterical.

                          BOY
               Let go a my daddy! Daddy!

     The resemblance is unmistakable. Two generations of Okie
     white trash. Bucky continues marching Coleman the elder up
     the stairs as Lee snags the kid, both the father and the son
     crying like babies.

     INT. THE HALL OF JUSTICE JAIL - LATER

     Lee and Bucky fill out a release form for the desk officer.

     Bucky looks up to see BILL KOENIG and FRITZ VOGEL march by
     with barely a nod.

                          LEE
               They got here fast.
                   (off Bucky's look)
               The confession.

     INT. CENTRAL WARRANTS - LATER

     Lee finishes typing up a report on a manual typewriter while
     Bucky talks on the phone. He hangs up as Fritz Vogel and Bill
     Koenig return.

                          LEE (cont'd)
                   (re the two meatheads)
               Play nice. They've got juice with Loew.

                          KOENIG
                   (stupid and proud)
               He confessed. Kiddie porks and the
               burglaries. Fritzie says we're all
               getting commendations.

     Bucky's POV: both Koenig and Vogel have small bits of
     blood spattered on their white dress shirts.

                          VOGEL
               Ellis loves the kid angle.

                          LEE
               You talk to Ellis?

                          VOGEL
               He's only "Ellis" to lieutenants on up,
               Blanchard.

                          LEE
               Least I don't call him "kike".

                          VOGEL
                   (flushing)
               C'mon, Billy.

     The two men push by with barely a nod in Bucky's direction.
                          BUCKY
               Play nice. Hm.

                          LEE
               Shitbirds.

     HARRY SEARS approaches their cubicle. He looks a little
     drunk. (And when you get to know him you'll realize that when
     he's drunk he doesn't stutter.)

                          HARRY
               Russ says good collar today.

     The men nod thanks. Bucky notes the lack of stutter and the
     presence of a liquor smell.

                          HARRY (cont'd)
               And Lee--I heard something you oughta
               know--I was over at County Parole--Bobby
               DeWitt got an "A" number. He'll be
               released to LA around mid-January.

     Lee bobs his head slightly as Harry moves off. He's disturbed
     but covers quickly--

                          LEE
               You like pot roast?

     EXT. A BEAUTIFUL DECO HOME - NIGHT

     Lee leads Bucky up the walk. Bucky's impressed with the house.

                          LEE
               Don't say anything to Kay about DeWitt.
               It'll upset her.

     INT. LEE AND KAY'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

     A doll's house of Danish Modern furniture, fresh flowers and
     polished mahogany wainscoting.

                          BUCKY
               You takin' bribes, partner?

                          LEE
               Fight stash.

     Kay arrives from the kitchen, smiling broadly at Bucky. She
     takes his hand.

                          KAY
               Hello, Dwight. Glad you could make it.

     And holds his hand about two beats than usual...

     INT. THE DINING ROOM - LATER

     Kay brings in the food. Bucky walks around the room, checking
     things out.

                          FAY
               Fairy tale come true, isn't it?

                          BUCKY
               Hm?

                          FAY
               The house. You and Lee partners. Fairy
               tale.

                          BUCKY
               Can't say I believe in fairy tales.

                          KAY
               Then you've never really had to. Lucky
               man. (beat) Lee! Dinner!

     INT. THE DINING ROOM - LATER

     The food is finished. So is a bottle of champagne. Kay pops
     another one, hitting Lee in the chest with the cork. Everyone
     laughs hysterically. They fill the glasses again.

                          LEE
               A toast...To Proposition B!

                          BUCKY
               To the Bleichert/Blanchard rematch!
               Bigger than Louis/Schmeling!

                          KAY
               To fairy tales!

                          BUCKY
                   (abruptly, drunk)
               To...us!

     He's referring to all three of them--something which doesn't
     escape or displease anyone. They clink glasses and drink.

     ANOTHER LAPD TRIPLE CARBON INCIDENT REPORT:

     JANUARY 10, 1947...Raymond "Junior" Nash...

     INT. ELLIS LOEW'S OFFICE - MORNING

     Lee and Bucky enter the Loew's inner sanctum where they are
     joined by Russ Millard and Harry Sears. A stack of L.A.

     Heralds sit on the desk, the top one folded to the headline:
     "Criminal Division's DA to try for Boss's Job in '48
     Primary?"

     Bucky's look of disgust says it all just as Loew walks into
     the room--

                          LEE
               Goin' into politics, Ellis? Give us a
               quote. (as FDR) "The only thing to fear
               is fear itself."

     Loew smiles thinly and hands over a photo and a rap sheet.

                          ELLIS LOEW
               Here's the man to fear.

     ANGLE ON THE MUG SHOT AND RAP SHEET:

     RAYMOND "JUNIOR" NASH:  Statutory raps, armed robbery,
     felony mayhem...Texas State Prison...Alcatraz...

     The cops are impressed.

                          BUCKY
               Give us the good news. He's in LA and
               actin' uppity?

                          ELLIS LOEW
               Witnesses made him at a stickup near
               Leimert Park over the weekend. Pistol-
               whipped an old lady. She died about an
               hour ago.

                          RUSS MILLARD
               Anything common in the sex beefs?

                          ELLIS LOEW
               Negro girls. Young ones. All the
               complainants have been colored.

                          LEE
               Seeya in Leimert Park.

     As they walk out...

                          ELLIS LOEW
               Sergeant Blanchard? Try not to kill the
               man. I'd like to do it in court.

     Lee flashes a demon smile.

     EXT. CRENSHAW BOULEVARD - DAY - LATER

     A montage of shots as Lee and Bucky cruise south on Crenshaw 
     Boulevard. The beginning of the post-war boom.

                          VOICE OVER
               From November through the New Year, Lee
               and I captured a total of eleven hard
               felons, eighteen traffic warrantees and
               three parole and probation absconders...

     On Crenshaw's northern end, once grand and now dilapidated
     houses in the process of demolition, their faces replaced by
     giant billboards advertising department stores, jumbo
     shopping centers and movie theaters.

                          VOICE OVER
               After tours of duty, Lee and I would go
               to the house and find Kay. Sometimes she
               made dinner for us, other times the three
               of us would go dancing, or see a flick.

     Southbound, older wooden structures looking more and more
     unkempt. Empty lots...

                          VOICE OVER (cont'd)
               Always she'd be there, never in between
               us, but always in the middle. It was the
               best time of my life.

     EXT./INT. THE CAR - A FILLING STATION - CONTINUOUS

     Lee pulls the car into the parking lot. Jumping out of the
     car--

                          LEE
               This grand tour stuff's for shit. I'm
               callin' in some favors.

     He heads to a payphone and beings pumping coins into it.

     BACK IN THE CAR - MINUTES LATER

     Lee gets back in the car. He's pale, sweating.

                          LEE
               Got a tip. Snitch a mine says he's
               shacking with some poon in a crib near
               Slauson and Hoover.

                          BUCKY
               It's all colored down there--

                          LEE
               We fuckin' roll.

     He pulls out.

                                                            CUT TO:

     EXT./INT. THE CAR - HOOVER AVE - MINUTES LATER

     Lee and Bucky roll up on four men loitering on a corner.
     Three are black and one is white.

                          LEE
               Hopheads. Let's shake 'em for an address
               or a name.

     As Lee and Bucky exit the car, the four men immediately start
     the slow walk to the wall, arms over their heads. The white
     guy glances at Lee:

                          WHITE HOPHEAD
               What the---Blanchard?

                          LEE
               Shut up, shitbird.

     Lee pushes him closer to the wall and starts frisking him.
     Bucky starts with one of the other men, pulling out some
     marijuana cigarettes.

     Out of the corner of his eye, Bucky sees the black man
     closest to Lee reaches for something shiny in his belt--

                          BUCKY
               Partner!

     Bucky pulls his .38...

     THE WHITE GUY swings around and LEE SHOOTS HIM twice in the
     face--

     THE FIRST BLACK MAN pulls a SHIV free and BUCKY SHOOTS HIM in
     the neck--

     ANOTHER OF THE MEN goes for his trousers, fumbling for
     something as BUCKY SHOOTS HIM THREE TIMES.

                          LEE
               Bucky duck!

     Bucky hits the cement and gets an upside down view of Lee and
     the last man drawing guns on each other--Lee's three shots
     cutting down the man before he can fire his tiny derringer.

     Bucky pulls himself to his feet, stumbling past the blood-
     covered sidewalk and vomits in the gutter.

     FROM THE DISTANCE: THE SOUND OF SIRENS.

     Bucky pulls out his badge and pins it to his jacket pocket.
     Behind him, Lee is busy turning the dead men's pockets inside
     out--scattering shivs and reefers onto the sidewalk away from
     the blood.

     All the while Lee cries like a baby.

     INT. THE 77TH ST. DETECTIVES' STATION - LATER

     Bucky and a Detective exit a de-briefing room. Bucky looks
     worn but composed.

                          DETECTIVE
               Thank you for your time, Officer. And
               your police work, as well.

     They pass another de-briefing area where Lee sits with
     another Detective. Lee looks terrible, muttering and
     shivering.

                          DETECTIVE (cont'd)
               Your partner's taking this hard.

                          BUCKY
               He knew one of the guys. Baxter Fitch.
               Busted him once for loitering. Sort of
               liked the guy.

     The detective nods sympathetically.

     EXT. LEE AND KAY'S HOUSE - NIGHT

     Lee and Bucky walk up the front steps where they're met by
     Kay. She runs to Lee and embraces him.

                          KAY
               Oh baby. Oh babe.

     She escorts him into the house. Bucky sees a newspaper on the
     front porch railing. The evening edition of The Mirror.

     "Boxer Cops in Gun Battle. Four Crooks Dead."

     Publicity boxing photos accompany a full-page article. Bucky
     begins to read it when he hears from inside:

                          LEE
               Leave me alone! You'll never fucking
               understand--

     A door slam. Soon after the sound of Lee's motorcycle roaring
     off... After a beat Kay comes outside and sits down next to
     Bucky.

                          BUCKY
               He knew one of the guys.

     She nods.

                          BUCKY (cont'd)
               It was them or us.

     She nods again.

                          BUCKY (cont'd)
               Tomorrow's off-duty so treat him nice--

                          KAY
               Bobby DeWitt gets out in a week, Dwight.
               We're on edge. He swore at the trial he
               was going to kill Lee.

                          BUCKY
               We can take care of Bobby DeWitt.

                          KAY
               Lee's scared. You don't know Bobby.

                          BUCKY
               I know as much as I need to know.

     Kay gives him a look: that's what you think. She gets up and
     goes inside. Not knowing what to do, Bucky continues reading
     the paper.

     INT. LEE AND KAY'S HOUSE - LATER

     Bucky wanders inside, obviously fidgety and not wanting to go
     home. He putters around their living room. From the back of
     the house Bucky hears the sound of A SHOWER RUNNING.

     Bucky walks back to the bathroom, drawn there by the sound of
     the drumming water. The bathroom door is open, an invitation.

     He stops at the threshold of the bathroom. His POV:

     Kay stands in the shower, curtain open for Bucky's benefit.
     She faces him and he takes in the view of her nakedness.

     Her attitude is not one of seduction, however, her expression
     passive and fixed even when their eyes meet. She pirouettes
     for him, showing:

     A SERIES OF OLD KNIFE SCARS CRISS-CROSSING HER BACK FROM
     THIGH TO SPINE.

     The history of Bobby DeWitt.

     Bucky backs away, retreating as he chokes back tears.

     INT. BUCKY'S APARTMENT - MORNING

     Bucky's awakened by the phone ringing. He pulls the receiver
     off the cradle but leaves it on the nightstand. From the
     receiver he barely hears:

                          LEE
               Rise and shine partner!

     Bucky grabs the phone.

                          BUCKY
               Lee? You okay?

                          LEE
               Sure. Ran Mulholland at a hundred and
               ten. Played house with Kay all day
               yesterday. Feel like doing some police
               work?

                          BUCKY
               Keep going.

                          LEE
               Junior Nash's got a fuck pad on Norton
               and Coliseum.

     EXT. THE CORNER OF COLISEUM AND NORTON - SOON AFTER

     Bucky and Lee pull up to a mangy apartment building.

     INT. RAYMOND NASH'S ROOM - SOON AFTER

     They push the door open to reveal a filthy little flop
     littered with muscatel short dogs and used rubbers.

                          LEE
               Okie trash.

     They poke around for a minute, finding nothing. The smell is
     awful. Bucky goes to a window and pulls it open.

     HIS POV OUT THE WINDOW:

     IN A VACANT LOT ACROSS THE WAY

     A cluster of uniformed cops and men in civilian clothes stare
     at something in the weeds. A CORONER'S VAN parks next to
     three black and whites and two detectives' sedans.

                          BUCKY
               Lee.

     Lee goes to the window.

                          LEE
               Is that Millard and Sears?

     An LAPD PHOTO VAN pulls up next.

     Lee and Bucky sprint out of the room.

     EXT. THE VACANT LOT - 39TH AND NORTON - SECONDS LATER

     Photo men have already begun fanning out and taking photos.
     Bucky sees Harry Sears take a shot from a hip flask in full
     view of other officers. Lee and Bucky elbow their way to the
     front and see:

     The nude, mutilated body of a young woman, cut in half at the
     waist. Another wide cut down her center reveal an empty
     cavity--her organs have been removed.

     Her face has been bashed in and her mouth cut ear to ear in a
     leering smile.

     Even the experienced cops are rattled by the scene. They
     point and whisper and generally begin to fall into disbelief
     and disorder when

     RUSS MILLARD

     whistles harshly with his fingers in his mouth.

                          RUSS MILLARD
               Before this gets out of hand let's put
               the kibosh on something. If this gets a
               lot of publicity we're going to get a lot
               of confessions. So we keep some things
               quiet. This girl was disemboweled. You
               keep this information to yourselves. Not
               your wives, not your girlfriends, no
               other officers.

     The men all nod, coming together as Millard takes control.

                          RUSS MILLARD (cont'd)
               No reporters view the body. You photo
               men, take your pictures now. Coroner's
               men, you put a sheet on the body as soon
               as they're done. Set up a perimeter six
               feet back. Any reporter crosses it,
               arrest him.
                   (noticing Bucky)
               Bleichert. What are you doing here?
               Where's Blanchard?

     Bucky indicates Lee, crouched down by the body taking notes.

                          BUCKY
               Nash is renting a room in that building
               over there.

                          RUSS MILLARD
               Blood on the premises?

                          BUCKY
               No. This isn't him.

                          RUSS MILLARD
               The lab'll be the judge of that.

     Millard and Bucky look dawn the street to see cars swinging
     onto Norton, beelining for the commotion. Reporters and
     photographers begin pouring out of their cars, quickly coming
     up against a line of cops keeping them from the body.

     Bucky makes his way over to Lee, unable to stop staring at
     the body.

                          BUCKY
               Hey. Junior Nash, remember?

                          LEE
               He didn't do this.

                          BUCKY
               No. He beat an old woman to death. That's
               why he's our priority warrantee.

                          LEE
               Not anymore.

                          BUCKY
               This ain't ours, partner--

                          LEE
                   (on edge)
               It is now, partner.

     EXT. THE CRIME SCENE - LATER

     Too sheet-covered stretchers are shoved into the coroner's
     wagon. The doors slam shut and the car pulls away.

                                                            CUT TO:

     RUSS MILLARD DIVIDING A STREET ATLAS INTO FOOTBEATS

     as fifteen officers (including Lee and Bucky) wait for their 
     assignment.

     A MONTAGE OF QUESTIONING

     Cops ring doorbells throughout Leimert Park:

                          OFFICER
                   (to an old woman)
               Have you heard female screams...

                          BUCKY
                   (to an off-duty serviceman)
               ...anyone discarding women's clothing?

                          LEE
                   (to a little kid)
               ...seen anyone in the lot on 39th...

                          BUCKY
                   (to a housewife)
               ...and what about this man?
                   (holds out a photo of Junior
                    Nash)

     To all of these questions a big fat "no".

     INT. THE OLYMPIC BOXING ARENA - NIGHHT

     Bucky watches two Mexican bantamweights beat each other
     bloody. An EMPTY SEAT next to him. Irritated, he gets up and
     leaves.

     ENT. 39TH AND NORTON - NIGHT - LATER

     Bucky gets out of his car and finds Lee standing inside the
     crime scene rope watching lab techs poke around in the weeds.
     The entire area is lit up by arclights, illuminating the two
     quicklime outlines of the body parts.

                          BUCKY
               You were supposed to meet me at the
               fights tonight, remember?

                          LEE
               Priority. Remember.

                          BUCKY
               Priority for the Bureau. Not for us.

                          LEE
               Nice white girl gets snuffed. Gotta show
               the voters they did the right thing
               passing the bond issue. It's a showcase.
               It's A-plus, Buck. We don't miss this.

                          BUCKY
               We've had enough headlines for the week.

     Lee points to the body outline. His hand shakes a bit and
     maybe for the first time we sense he's wired on something.

                          LEE
               With or without you, partner.

     Bucky shakes his head and begins walking away.

                          LEE (cont'd)
               With or without you.

                          BUCKY
               I heard you.

     INT. THE SQUAD ROOM - NEXT DAY

     Bucky enters a mob scene. One cop holds up a front page
     headline: "Hunt Werewolf's Den in Torture Slaying"

     Along a bench, five derelict-looking men are manacled to a
     bench. A cop walks by, notes Bucky's confusion:

                          OFFICER
               Confessors.

     Just then the interrogation room door opens and Bill Koenig
     leads a doubled-over fat man out of the door.

                          KOENIG
               He didn't do it.

     A couple officers clap satirically at their desks.

                          BUCKY
                   (to another cop)
               Blanchard?

                          OFFICER
               In with Loew.(beat) And reporters.

     Off Bucky's concerned look we

                                                            CUT TO:

     INT. ELLIS LOEW'S OFFICE - MORNING

     Bucky walks in to see Loew holding a press conference, Lee
     dressed in a suit and sitting at his side.

                          ELLIS LOEW
               ...and the heinous nature of this killing
               makes it imperative to catch this fiend
               as soon as possible. A number of
               specially trained officers, including Mr.
               Fire and his partner Mr. Ice...

     ON BUCKY'S FACE

     Disbelief. Disgust.

     BACK IN THE WARRANTS CUBICLE - LATER

     Lee catches up with a pissed off Bucky.

                          BUCKY
               You got us detached?

                          LEE
               Slow and easy, Bucky. First I gave Loew a
               memo saying Nash blew our jurisdiction--

                          BUCKY
               You did what?

                          LEE
               It's all right. The APB still stands.
               We've got the pad staked. He's covered.

     Bucky's face says he's not sold on Lee's reasoning.

                          LEE (cont'd)
               One week. Just one week. After that, it's
               back to Junior. I promise.

     Bucky studies Lee's resolve; he relents.

                          LEE (cont'd)
               Copacetic.

                                                            CUT TO:

     INT. PATHOLOGY ROOM - LATER

     Antiseptic white with metallic slab tables. Two objects
     covered in sheets lay on the table.

     Bucky, Lee, Russ Millard and Harry Sears sit on benches
     facing the table. THE CORONER and a STENOGRAPHER NUN stand
     over the body. The coroner pulls the sheets off.

                          LEE
               Jesus, Bucky.

                          CORONER
               On gross pathology, we have a female
               Caucasian between sixteen and thirty.
               Cadaver is presented in two halves with
               bisection level with the umbilicus.

     The nun scribbles furiously to keep up. The officers are torn
     between staring at their shoes and at the body.

                          CORONER (cont'd)
               ...Through-and through laceration from
               both mouth corners...no visible signs of
               neck bruises...massive depressed skull
               fractures...Inspection of upper half
               abdominal cavity reveals no free-flowing
               blood. Intestines, stomach, liver and
               spleen removed.

     The doctor stops to allow the nun time to catch up. Russ
     Millard clears his throat.

                          RUSS MILLARD
               Is it...all right to smoke, doctor?

                          CORONER
               She's not going to mind.

     Both Russ and Harry light up.

                          CORONER (cont'd)
               Lower half of the cadaver reveals removal
               of reproductive organs...Both legs broken
               at the knee, and healing, light lash
               marks on the upper back and shoulders...

     The door opens and a police officer enters, handing a sheet
     of paper to Millard and speaking to him briefly. Millard
     reads the sheet and hands it to Harry, who then hands it to
     Lee.

                          LEE
                   (reading)
               Bingo.

     He hands it to Bucky.

     The note: "Girl ID'd as Elizabeth Ann Short, DOB
     7/29/24, Medford, Mass."

     The coroner steps back from the table.

                          CORONER
               Questions?

                          RUSS MILLARD
               What's your best guess?

                          CORONER
               Here's what she wasn't. She wasn't raped,
               she wasn't pregnant, dried semen
               indicates voluntary intercourse within
               the last week...She took what I'd call a
               gentle whipping in the last ten days...In
               terms of the nitty-gritty...She was
               probably tortured with a knife for thirty-
               six to forty-eight hours before death.
               The cause of which is either the mouth
               wound or more likely she was beaten to
               death with something like a baseball bat.

                          LEE
               What about her insides?

                          CORONER
               They came out after death. Then I'd say
               he drained the blood from the body and
               washed it clean, probably in a bathtub.

                          LEE
               Did the guy know anything about medicine
               or anatomy?

                          CORONER
               Maybe. Probably not a surgeon type--but
               that doesn't rule out veterinary
               training, biological training, or my
               Pathology for Beginners class at UCLA.
               Has she got a name yet?

     The cops look to each other, hesitant to speak her name.

                          RUSS MILLARD
               Elizabeth Short.

                          CORONER
                   (saluting heaven)
               God love you, Elizabeth.
                   (to Millard)
               Russell, when you get the son of a bitch
               who did this to her, give him a kick in
               the balls and tell him it's from
               Frederick D. Newbarr, M.D. Now all of you
               get out of here, I've got a date with a
               jumper suicide in ten minutes.

     INT. CENTRAL DIVISION BULLPEN - LATER

     Jack Tierney posts mug shots of Elizabeth Short as Russ,
     Harry, Lee and Bucky look over his shoulder. (In the
     background we can hear the by-now constant droning of Ellis
     Loew to reporters, both in person and over the phone)

                          CAPTAIN JACK
               Cops popped her in '43. Santa Barbara.
               Underage drinking. Other than that she's
               clean. Four sisters. Parents divorced.
               Father's here in LA. Hear he sold some
               old portrait photos of her to the Herald.

     Russ makes a noise of disgust.

                          RUSS MILLARD
               How many confessions so far?

                          CAPTAIN JACK
               Eighteen.

                          RUSS MILLARD
               Double that by morning. More if Loew got
               the press excited with his purple prose.

                          LOEW
                   (he's been eavesdropping)
               I'd say my prose fits the crime,
               Lieutenant.

     Reveal Loew with Koenig and Fritz Vogel behind him.

                          RUSS MILLARD
               Too much publicity is a hindrance, Ellis.
               If you were a policeman you'd know that.

     Loew flushes and gives Millard a dark look.

                          ELLIS LOEW
                   (to Tierney)
               Captain have you sent men to talk to the
               victim's father?

                          CAPTAIN JACK
               Not yet, Ellis.

                          ELLIS LOEW
               How about Vogel and Koenig?

     Tierney looks to Millard. The second in command shakes his
     head ever so slightly. We understand that even though he's
     second in command to Jack he's in charge.

                          CAPTAIN JACK
               Aaah, Russ, who do you think we should
               send?

                                                            CUT TO:

     EXT. WILSHIRE DISTRICT - DUSK

     A garage apartment at the rear of a big Victorian house. Lee
     and Bucky amble up and ring the buzzer.

     A skinny man (CLEO SHORT) in his fifties opens the door,
     eyeing them narrowly.

                          CLEO SHORT
               Cops, huh?

     He leads them inside. The apartment resembles its resident,
     soiled, worn and ugly.

                          CLEO SHORT (cont'd)
               I've got an alibi, just in case you think
               I did it. Tighter than a crab's ass, and
               that is air tight.

     The two cops sit down, sizing up his hostility.

                          BUCKY
               I'm Detective Bleichert, Mr. Short. This
               is Sergeant Blanchard. We'd like to
               express our condolences for the loss of
               your daughter.

                          CLEO SHORT
               I know who you are. Neither of you'da
               lasted a round with Gentleman Jim
               Jeffries.
               (beat) As for Betty, c'est la vie. She
               called the tune, she paid the piper.
               (beat) You wanna hear my alibi?

                          LEE
               Since you're so anxious to tell it.

                          CLEO SHORT
               Johnny on the spot at my job. Twenty-
               seven straight hours. Refrigerator
               repairman. Twenty-seven straight and the
               last seventeen overtime. Call my boss.
               He'll alibi me up tighter than a popcorn
               fart, and that's air tight.

                          BUCKY
               When was the last time you saw your
               daughter?

                          CLEO SHORT
               Betty came west in '43 with stars in her
               eyes. I promised her three squares and a
               five-spot if she kept the house tidy.

     The cops look around at the squalor.

                          CLEO SHORT (cont'd)
               Gave her the boot in July. She moved to
               Santa Barbara. Sent me a postcard couple
               weeks later. Some soldier beat her up
               bad. Last I heard from her.

                          BUCKY
               Was that soldier her boyfriend?

     The old man lets out a hoot.

                          CLEO SHORT
               They were all her boyfriends! Not so ugly
               and wearing a uniform, can't go wrong
               there. Betty believed in quantity before
               quality.

                          LEE
               You calling your own daughter a tramp?

                          CLEO SHORT
               Got five daughters. One bad apple ain't
               so bad.

     Lee's about to burst. Bucky motions for him to take a walk.
     Lee goes through the den into the bathroom. From his view
     Bucky can see Lee chase a couple pills with a glass of
     water...

                          BUCKY
               Any names, Mr. Short?

                          CLEO SHORT
               Tom, Dick, Harry. Don't matter.
                   (he drifts for a moment)
               Said she was looking for movie work
               but...just paraded the Boulevard in those
               black get-ups of hers.

     Lee returns to the room.

                          CLEO SHORT (cont'd)
               Who wouldn't get herself killed doin'
               that? Who? Who wouldn't?

     EXT. CLEO SHORT'S APARTMENT - MINUTES LATER

     The two men walk out, disgusted.

                          LEE
               Jesus fuck. We just got handed the entire
               U.S. Armed forces as suspects.

                          BUCKY
               Flip to see who writes it up?

                          LEE
               I'm staking Nash's pad for the night. See
               if we get any strange drive-bys at the
               murder sight. Do me a favor and drop in
               on Kay. She's worried about me.

                          BUCKY
               She's a smart woman.

     INT. LEE AND KAY'S HOUSE - NIGHT

     Bucky opens the front door to find Kay reading a book on the
     couch. She doesn't even look up.

                          KAY
               Hi, Dwight.

                          BUCKY
               How'd you know it was me?

                          KAY
               Lee stomps, you tread lightly.

     Bucky appreciates her subtext.

                          BUCKY
               Lee's--

                          KAY
               Let me guess...Lee's up all night--
               probably on Benzedrine again--working
               that poor girl's murder--

     She says this as fact, not judgement. She knows him.

                          KAY
               You're worried about him. And he's
               worried about me.
                   (beat)
               But who's worried about you? Is that left
               for me?

                          BUCKY
               No need for that.

                          KAY
               For such a cautious man you're quite a
               hardcase.

                          BUCKY
               It's just...He's done a lot for me.

     Kay smiles, sweeps her arms around the perfect living room as
     if to reinforce to Bucky all Lee's done for her.

     The point is not lost on him.

     She crosses to him and kisses him softly on the cheek.

                          KAY (cont'd)
               Good night.

     INT. LEE AND KAY'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

     Bucky sits at their kitchen table, eating a ham sandwich with
     a glass of milk and filling out the police reports.

     INT. THE HOMICIDE BULLPEN - MORNING

     Bucky walks in reading the Herald front page: A picture of
     Elizabeth Short in a striking black dress. Underneath:"The
     Black Dahlia".

     He stops at a room where two detectives are sorting through
     a steamer trunk full of letters and assorted personal effects.

                          RUSS MILLARD (O.S.)
                   (re trunk)
               Found it in storage down at the railway.
               Carbons of mash notes to sailors.
               Hundreds of 'em.

     Bucky shows him the newspaper.

                          RUSS MILLARD
               Thank our friend Bevo Means at the
               Herald. Bevo's painting Betty and her
               black dress like some actress in that
               Alan Ladd movie, The Blue Dahlia. Should
               triple our confessions.

                          BUCKY
               Great.

                          RUSS MILLARD (cont'd)
               Hollywood will fuck you when no else
               will. What do you think?

                          BUCKY
               I think I want to go back to Warrants.

                          RUSS MILLARD
               No dice. You're a bright penny and I want
               you here.
                   (hands him a piece of paper)
               Betty's last known residences and KA's.
               Go to University Station and pick up Bill
               Koenig. Fritzie's sick. Keep Bill on a
               tight leash, and you write the report
               because Billy's practically illiterate.

                          BUCKY
               Lieutenant--

                          RUSS MILLARD
               Call me Russ and get out of here.

     Millard gestures for him to leave.

     EXT. AN APARTMENT HOUSE - LATER

     Bucky and Koenig walk up to the steps of an apartment house.

                          BUCKY
               How do you want to play this, Sarge?

                          KOENIG
               Fritzie usually does the talking and I
               stand back up.
                   (re a leather sap in his belt)
               Muscle job?

                          BUCKY
               Let's try talk job.

     Bucky checks names on the doorbells against a couple names on
     his piece of paper. He stops at "S. Saddon".

     INT. THE HALLWAY UPSTAIRS - LATER

     Bucky knocks on the door.

                          BUCKY
               Miss Saddon?

     A young woman dressed in a metallic Egyptian costume opens
     the door.

                          SHERYL
               You the driver from RKO?

                          BUCKY
               Police.

     The woman shuts the door. Seconds later the TOILET FLUSHES.
     She returns and opens it again.

                          SHERYL
               If this is about those jaywalking--

                          BUCKY
               It's about Elizabeth Short.

                          SHERYL
               I did all this on the phone this morning.
               Nine thousand questions about Betty's
               nine thousand boyfriends and I don't
               remember any of the names. Can I go now?
               The extras truck is due any minute.

                          BUCKY
               How about you sit dawn and answer my
               questions or I bust you for the reefer
               you flushed.

     She lets him in and sits defiantly.

                          BUCKY (cont'd)
               First question. Does a...
                   (re to his paper)
               Linda Martin or a Marjorie Graham live
               here?

                          SHERYL
               That's Betty's other place. DeLongpre and
               Orange.

                          BUCKY
               She moved around quite a bit. You know
               why? Was somebody threatening her?

                          SHERYL
               Betty's problem wasn't enemies. It was
               too many friends.

                          BUCKY
               I've gathered that. Let's change the
               subject.

                          SHERYL
               How 'bout "the world of high finance"?

                          BUCKY (cont'd)
               How about movies? You girls are all
               tryin' to break in, right?

                          SHERYL
                   (re her extras costume)
               I'm in mister.

                          BUCKY
               Congratulations. What about Betty?

                          SHERYL
               Maybe once. Maybe not. 'Round
               Thanksgiving she showed up bragging about
               gettin' her big break...Had one of those
               viewfinders around her neck? But who
               knows where she really got it. Betty had
               a tendency to--

                          BUCKY
               ...stretch the truth?

                          SHERYL
               Lie.

     A CAR HORN HONKS. Bucky walks to the window and looks
     outside: A FLATBED TRUCK FULL OF CLEOPATRAS waits.

                          BUCKY
               Your ride's here--

     But she's already gone.

     INT. THE CAR - MOVING - HOLLYWOOD - CONTINUOUS

     They cruise to the next address.

                          KOENIG
               What'd the cooze say 'bout me?

     Bucky just stares at him; the guy's an idiot.

     EXT./INT. DELONGPRE APARTMENT BUILDING - LATER

     Two men lounge on the stoop. Koenig gives them the eye as he
     passes.

     Bucky checks his piece of paper against the doorbells again.
     Finds "M. Graham" but no Linda Martin.

                          KOENIG
               I'm bored.

                          BUCKY
               This'll just take a minute.

                          KOENIG
               I'm gonna take those two guys outside.
               Maybe they knew the cooze--

                          BUCKY
               I'll handle 'em Sarge--

                          KOENIG
               No! I'm gonna do it! (beat) Now what do I
               roust 'em about?

                          BUCKY
               I dunno. Ask 'em anything. Alibis. See if
               Betty ever engaged in prostitution...

     Koenig goes running outside. Bucky shakes his head.

     INT. A COMMUNAL SITTING ROOM - LATER

     Marjorie Graham sits on a couch with a dog-eared back issue
     of Photoplay in her hands. She's mild but well-traveled.

                          MARJORIE
               ...Betty had this gift, you see. She was
               so sweet and eager to please...a bit
               dumb, maybe. But she'd do anything to be
               liked, become whatever you wanted her to
               be. She'd walk like you, or talk like
               you...but she wasn't...she was still her.

                          BUCKY
               Did she ever tell you she was in a movie?
               Sometime around November?

                          MARJORIE
               Sure. She had this viewfinder and showed
               it around to all the guys. Said it was
               from the director. A co-starring role.

                          BUCKY
               Did she say what it was?

                          MARJORIE
               Once she said it was for Fox. Another
               time Paramount. I think she was just
               fibbing. You know, for the boys.

                          BUCKY
               Do you remember the names of any of the
               guys?

                          MARJORIE
               Don and Harold--sitting outside. She
               dated both of 'em once or twice. Other
               than that...I just...didn't really pay
               attention to who she was with.

     Marjorie looks down, fidgeting.

                          BUCKY
               What is it? You can tell me.

                          MARJORIE
               Well...Right before she moved out...l saw
               her and Linda...

                          BUCKY
               Linda Martin?

                          MARJORIE
               Yeah. Her and Linda Martin--talking to
               this older woman up on the Boulevard. She
               had a man's suit and short hair like a
               man...Only that one time...

                          BUCKY
               Are you saying the woman was a lesbian?

     Marjorie nods yes.

     Bucky's about to press her for more when Bill Koenig barges
     in, all sweaty.

                          KOENIG
               Them guys talked. Said the stiff peddled
               her twat when she got strapped bad. I
               called it in. Mr. Loew said to keep it
               zipped cuz it don't look as good.

     Bucky looks at Marjorie. Back to Koenig.

                          BUCKY
               Take their statements, Bill. I've got a
               little more here.

     Bill disappears back to the porch.

                          BUCKY (cont'd)
               Linda Martin's room?

     INT. LINDA MARTIN'S ROOM - LATER

     Bucky pushes open the room and finds it empty. He checks the
     closet. Empty.

     Bucky runs his hand under the bed. Finds something and pulls
     it out. A small red vinyl purse. He opens the purse. Inside
     is an ID. He shows it to Marjorie.

                          MARJORIE
               That's her. God...She's only fifteen.

                          BUCKY
                   (re card)
               Lorna Martikova. Omaha, Nebraska.
               Runaway. When'd you see her last?

                          MARJORIE
               This morning. I told her I'd called the
               police to come talk to us about Betty.
               Was that the wrong thing to do?

                          BUCKY
               You couldn't have known.

     EXT. THE APARTMENT COMPLEX - LATER

     Bucky emerges. Koenig stands on the stoop with the two men,
     both of whom look like they might have seen the wrong end of
     Koenig's less-than-subtle interrogation style.

                          KOENIG
                   (re the men)
               They didn't do it.

                          BUCKY
               No shit Sherlock.

     INT. AN ANONYMOUS CASTING OFFICE - DAY

     Clapsticks come down in front of the camera: "Elizabeth
     Short...Screen Test #1."

     Elizabeth Short sits on a tiny chair in a cheap office. She's
     dressed for an audition, overly made up and nervous.

                          MAN (O.S.)
               Your name please?

                          ELIZABETH SHORT
               Elizabeth Short. Betty. Beth...Elizabeth.

                          MAN (O.S)
               Relax, Elizabeth.

     She nods, can't relax.

                          ELIZABETH SHORT
               Sorry. Can we try it again?

                          MAN (O.S.)
               We haven't even started yet.

                          ELIZABETH SHORT
               Oh.

     FADE OUT.

     INT. HOLLYWOOD STATION - LATER

     Bucky fills out forms.

                          VOICE OVER
               I used a Warrant cops special prerogative
               and issued an APB on Lorna Martikova aka
               Linda Martin. I wrote up my day's report,
               omitting Marjorie Graham's lead on the
               old dyke. I didn't need Ellis Loew
               quashing it along with the skinny on
               Betty as the part-time prostie.

     EXT. LEE AND KAY'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

     Bucky pulls up in front of the house. Heads inside...

                          VOICE OVER (cont'd)
               To be honest, I'd pretty much overdosed
               on Betty Short's low-rent last months on
               earth and decided to kiss off the rest of
               the day and head to Lee and Kay's for a
               sandwich.

                                                            CUT TO:

     CLOSE-UPS OF BLACK DAHLIA CRIME SCENE PHOTOS

     spread out on Lee and Kay's dining room table.

     Bucky stands just inside the door watching Lee study the
     photos, Kay a pace or two back, smoking nervously. Neither of
     them seem to notice him. Finally Kay sees him:

                          KAY
               Hi, Dwight.

                          LEE
                   (wired)
               It ain't a random job. Horseshit. Guy who
               did this...hated her. Bad. Wanted the
               whole goddamn world to know. Babe, you
               took pre-Med, whattya think? Mad doctor?

                          KAY
               Lee, Dwight's here.

                          LEE
               Oh, hey partner. Bucky listen to Kay.
               Babe's got ideas. Good stuff--

                          KAY
               This kind of theorizing's nonsense, but
               I'll give you a theory if you'll eat
               something to calm yourself down.

                          LEE
               Theory on, teach.

                          KAY
               Well. Just a guess. But maybe there were
               two killers. Because the torture cuts are
               crude, while the bisection and the cut on
               the abdomen are neat and clean...

     CLOSE ON: Lee's face, somehow both intense and unfocused...

                          VOICE OVER
               Three days 'til Bobby De Witt hit LA.
               Three days since we killed four men.

     BACK ON: BUCKY, who turns on his heels and exits, catching
     Kay's eye as he goes.

                          VOICE OVER (cont'd)
               Maybe nobody cared. Maybe they cared too
               much.

     EXT. 39TH AND NORTON - DUSK - LATER

     Bucky cruises by the crime scene. Rubberneckers gawk around
     the vacant lot while vendors peddle greasy food and cheap
     portrait glossies of the Dahlia in a black dress.

     INT. CENTRAL DIVISION BULLPEN - BUCKY'S DESK - NIGHT

     Bucky sits at his desk staring at RAYMOND NASH'S MUGSHOT.

     HIS EYES DRIFT TO:

     A WAGER POOL SIGN-UP LIST POSTED ON THE WALL: a crude felt
     craps table with various betting spaces: "Solved--2 to 1",
     "Random Sex Job--4 to 1", "Uhsolved--Even Money",
     "Boyfriend(s)--l to 4"...

     Next to it are TWO HALVES OF A BLACK DRESS on separate
     hangers...a crude joke.

     Bucky opens up his desk drawer and drops the Nash mugshot
     inside. He dials the phone:

                          BUCKY
               Administrative Vice Squad?

                                                       DISSOLVE TO:

     EXT. THE SWANK SPOT LOUNGE - THE VALLEY - NIGHT

     Bucky pulls his car up to a low-slung building with a log-
     cabin facade and swinging Western doors. He enters.

     INT. THE SWANK SPOT LOUNGE - CONTINUOUS

     A dimly lit LESBIAN BAR. Butch women in GI khakis mix with
     soft girls in cashmere skirt suits.

     Bucky approaches a bartender. The woman sizes him up and
     slides him a whiskey.

                          BARTENDER
               Beverage Control?

                          BUCKY
                   (downing the whiskey)
               LAPD Homicide.

                          BARTENDER
               Who got snuffed?

     Bucky slides her a photo of the Dahlia and Linda Martin's ID.

                          BUCKY
               Seen either of 'em?

                          BARTENDER
               Huh. The Dahlia's a sister?

                          BUCKY
               You tell me.

                          BARTENDER
               Never seen her 'cept in the papers. And
               the little schoolgirl twist I've never
               seen. We don't truck with underaged
               stuff. Capice?

                          BUCKY
               Capice when your girls tell me that.

                                                            CUT TO:

     INT. THE BAR - SOON AFTER

     as the photos are passed from patron to patron. Aside from a
     few raised eyebrows over the Dahlia, nothing to indicate
     anyone knows anything.

                                                       DISSOLVE TO:

     INT. A DIFFERENT LESBIAN BAR - LATER

     This time an Olde English motif. Bucky sips another free
     whiskey as a dozen more women pass the photos around. Bucky
     watches their reactions closely but doesn't see anything out
     of the ordinary.

     He takes another shot of whiskey and heads out the door.

                                                       DISSOLVE TO:

     INT. LAVERNE'S HIDEWAY - LATER

     A tropical motif. Faux bamboo wrap-around booths shield women
     snuggled deep into the dark corners.

     A bit buzzed and embarrassed to have to go booth to booth and
     break up couples, Bucky slowly makes his way around the bar
     with the two photos. More of the same...

     He approaches a woman polishing glasses at the bar. Slides
     over the photos.

                          BUCKY
               Black Dahlia.

                          BARTENDER
               No shit.

     He taps a finger onto Linda Martin's ID.

                          BUCKY
               What about this girl?

     The bartender picks up the card and squints at it. Bucky sees
     a flicker of recognition in her eyes. She hesitates--

                          BARTENDER
               Never seen her.

     He leans over the counter.

                          BUCKY
               Don't you fuckin' lie to me. She's
               fifteen fucking years old. So you come
               clean or I slap a contributing beef on
               you, and you spend the next five years
               servin' raisinjack to bulldykes in
               Tehachapi.

     The bartender looks again at the ID card.

                          BARTENDER
               A couple times. Two, three months ago.
               Just to cadge drinks off the sisters,
               though. She liked boys, I'm sure. And not
               the Dahlia. Never.

     Out of his peripheral vision Bucky sees another woman just
     starting to sit down on a bar stool but at the last minute,
     change her mind and make for the door.

     A baby spotlight catches her face; a fleeting resemblance to 
     Elizabeth Short.

     Bucky takes a deep breath, counts to ten and then goes out
     after the woman.

     EXT. THE PARKING LOT - CONTINUOUS

     The woman gets into a beautiful snow-white Packard.

                                                            CUT TO:

     SHOTS OF VARIOUS STREETS - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

     as Bucky tails the white Packard from three car-lengths back.
     He follows her all the way from the Valley to Hancock Park.

                                                            CUT TO:

     EXT. MUIRFIELD ROAD - HANCOCK PARK - NIGHT

     As the woman parks her car in front of A HUGE TUDOR MANSION,

     Bucky cruises by, catching her license plate and writing it
     on a pack of matches from LaVerne's.

     In his rear view mirror he sees her exit the car, a striking
     figure in a sharkskin suit. He watches her walk up the
     enormous lawn and into the home.

     EXT. A PAY PHONE - MINUTES LATER

     Bucky reads the license plate into the phone. He receives
     information back and writes it onto the matchbook, as well.

     INT. BUCKY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

     Bucky lies in his bed, staring at the ceiling. His bedside
     light reveals a still life: Elizabeth Short's mug shot photo
     tucked underneath the matchbook. The cover is flipped open
     and we can see written: "Madeleine Cathcart Sprague".

     INT. BUCKY'S CAR - MORNING

     Bucky's listening to The Dexter Gordon quartet on the radio
     when the tune is interrupted by a feverish voice:

                          ANNOUNCER
               We interrupt our regular broadcast to
               bring you a bulletin. A major suspect in
               the investigation of Elizabeth Short, the
               raven-haired beauty known as the Black
               Dahlia, has been captured! Red Manley, a
               Huntington Park hardware salesman and one
               of the last men to be seen with the
               Dahlia, was captured early this morning.
               Currently being held at Hollenback
               Station--

     Bucky takes a quick left down another street.

                                                            CUT TO:

     INT. HOLLENBACK STATION JAIL - LATER

     Bucky runs into Lee as he enters the station.

                          LEE
               Dahlia left San Diego six days before we
               found her. Dago cops got a witness puts
               her in a tan Dodge with a partial plate
               ident. Finally got a cross-check that
               matched on Red here.

     INT. OUTSIDE THE INTERROGATION ROOM - CONT.

     Seems like every cop in town has jammed themselves into a
     small corridor, watching Russ Millard interrogate RED MANLEY
     through a one way mirror. Manley is carrot-topped, 25, and
     scared shitless.

     Millard's soothing voice can be heard through speakers.

                          MILLARD
               Like I said, Robert. We're doing this
               because you didn't come forward.

                          RED MANLEY
               I've told it three times now. I didn't
               want my wife to know I was chipping her.

                          MILLARD
               But you said you didn't chip on her.
               Betty wouldn't put out. That's no reason
               to hide from the police.

                          RED MANLEY
               I dated her down in Dago. I slow-danced
               with her. It's the same thing as
               chipping.

                          MILLARD
               And you wanted to fuck her, didn't you?

                          RED MANLEY
               I wanted...to test my loyalty to my wife.

                          MILLARD
               Come on, son!

                          RED MANLEY
               I wanted to fuck her. Yes.

                          MILLARD
               But she cock-teased you.

                          RED MANLEY
               She said she had her period--

     All of the cops outside laugh.

                          RED MANLEY
               Said the father of her child would be a
               combat veteran--

                          MILLARD
               And you were in the Army band. You get
               angry?

                          RED MANLEY
               I told you. I didn't kill her.

                          MILLARD
               You drove her back to LA with you
               on...December tenth? And dropped her at
               the Biltmore Hotel?

                          RED MANLEY
               I've told it how many ways? How many more
               ways do you went to hear it?

     Millard straightens up and turns to the one-way mirror. He
     tugs at the knot of his tie. Soon after he slips out of the
     room and Harry Sears slips in.

     Bucky turns to Lee.

                          BUCKY
               Welcome back to earth, partner.

                          LEE
               Your fault, really. After you left Kay
               slipped me a Mickey. Slept for seventeen
               hours.

                          BUCKY
               Your fault for buying her all those
               chemistry classes.

                          LEE
               Learn anything interesting?

                          BUCKY
               No.

                          LEE
                   (re the interrogation)
               Now you'll see why Russ keeps Harry
               around.

     INT. THE INTERROGATION ROOM - SAME

     Harry circles Red Manley, lightly tapping a metal-studded sap
     in his hand.

                          LEE
                   (re the sap)
               Russ's only rule. No actual hitting.

     BACK INSIDE THE INTERROGATION ROOM - SAME

     Harry leans close to Red, tapping the sap on the table. His
     stutter completely gone.

                          HARRY SEARS
               You wanted some fresh gash, and you
               thought Betty was easy. You came on
               strong and that didn't work. You offered
               her money. She told you she was on the
               rag, and that was the final straw. You
               wanted to make her bleed for real--

                          RED MANLEY
               No no no. Not Betty--

     Harry SMASHES the sap onto a glass ashtray, shattering it.
     Red bites down on his lip, cutting it.

                          HARRY SEARS
               You plied Betty with drinks, got her to
               talk about her old boyfriends and came on
               like a pal, like the nice little corporal
               willing to leave Betty to the real men,
               the men who saw combat--

                          RED MANLEY
               No--

     Harry SMASHES the table again.

                          HARRY SEARS
               You took her to a toolshed, maybe one of
               those abandoned warehouses out by the old
               Ford plant in Pico-Rivera. There was some
               twine and lots of cutting tools lying
               around, and you got a hard-on...

                          RED MANLEY
               No no no--

     Again Harry smashes the table. Red almost topples his chair
     backwards out of fear, only Harry's hand an the back slats
     keeping it from going over...

                          HARRY SEARS
               Yes, Reddy, yes. You thought of every
               girl who said "I don't suck", every time
               your mommy spanked you, every evil eye
               you got from real soldiers when you
               played your trombone in the army band.

                          RED MANLEY
               No--

                          HARRY SEARS (cont'd)
               Goldbrick, needle-nick, pussy-whipped--

                          RED MANLEY
               No--

                          HARRY SEARS
               That's what Betty had to pay for wasn't
               it?

                          RED MANLEY
               No, please! God as my witness!

                          HARRY SEARS
               God hates liars!

     Smash!

                          HARRY SEARS (cont'd)
               Tell me, Red! Tell Betty! Tell God!

                          RED MANLEY
               I didn't hurt her--

                          HARRY SEARS
               Tell God!

     Harry smashes the sap down the table once more and then hurls
     the whole thing over onto its side.

     Red fumbles out of the chair onto his knees. He clasps his
     hands together--

                          RED MANLEY
               The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not
               want...

     He begins to weep. Completely broken.

     Harry turns to the one way mirror, looking straight out at
     his audience: self-loathing etched into his flabby,
     juicehound face.

     He gives the thumbs-down sign and walks out of the room.

     OUTSIDE IN THE HALLWAY

     Russ Millard meets him at the door and leads him away from
     the general crowd of officers.

     BACK IN THE INTERROGATION ROOM

     Bucky watches as Lee and another officer handcuff Red and
     take him outside. Lee has his hand on Red's shoulder like a
     kindly uncle.

     OUTSIDE THE STATION

     Bucky stands on the steps, taking fresh air. Russ steps out.

                          RUSS MILLARD
               Good report yesterday, Bleichert.

                          BUCKY
               Thanks.

                          RUSS MILLARD
               What next?

                          BUCKY
               You send me back to Warrants?

                          RUSS MILLARD
               Wrong again. But keep going.

                          BUCKY
               Canvass around the Biltmore. If Red
               dropped her off there on the tenth maybe
               we can start reconstructing the last days
               before she got snatched.

                          RUSS MILLARD
               Bright penny. You're doing well, Bucky.
               Run with the ball.

                          BUCKY
               All I know is you should keep an eye on
               Loew and his boys.
               I didn't put it in my report, but Betty
               sold it outright when she needed money
               bad enough, and Loew's been trying to
               keep it kiboshed so it'll look better if
               he ever takes it to trial.

                          RUSS MILLARD
                   (smiles)
               You calling your boss an evidence
               suppressor?

                          BUCKY
               And a grandstanding son of a bitch.

                          RUSS MILLARD
               You're a brighter penny than I thought.
                   (hands him a sheet of paper)
               Betty sightings. Wilshire Division. I
               need smart pennies to eliminate the
               phonies from the tip sheet.

                          BUCKY
               What are you gonna do?

                          MILLARD
               Keep an eye on the evidence suppressor
               son of a bitch and his minions to make
               sure they don't try to coerce a
               confession out of that innocent man in
               the holding tank.

     He pats Bucky on the shoulder and walks inside.

                                                            CUT TO:

     BUCKY CANVASSING THE WILSHIRE DISTRICT

     Restaurants, bars, juke joints. Bucky interviews every drunk
     on Western and Normandie...

                          VOICE OVER
               Barflies. Daytime juicers...The longer I
               listened the more they talked about
               themselves, interweaving their sad tales
               with the Black Dahlia, who they actually
               believed to be a glamorous siren headed
               for Hollywood stardom...

     Bucky cruises in his car into Lee and Kay's neighborhood.

                          VOICE OVER (cont'd)
               It was as if they would have traded their
               own lives for a juicy front-page death.
               I decided my report would consist of two
               words: "All bullshit".

     IN FRONT OF LEE AND KAY'S HOUSE - NIGHT

     Bucky pulls up just as Kay storms out the door and down the
     steps, hurling an armful of paper onto the lawn. Lee storms
     beside her, shouting and waving his arms as they go back
     inside.

     Bucky walks over and kneels down besides the papers: carbons
     of LAPD report forms, tip sheets, evidence tickets, the
     autopsy...all with "E. Short" typed at the top.

                          BUCKY
               Oh Jesus.

     Kay and Lee come back out again, Kay tossing out more files.

                          KAY
               It's sick and it's insane! After
               everything...And all that might happen--

                          LEE
               I need this, babe. You know it. I'll rent
               a room for the stuff but--
                   (noticing Bucky)
               You tell her Bucky. Reason with her.

                          BUCKY
               She's right, Lee. You've pulled at least
               three misdemeanors here. It's out of
               control--

     Bucky stops himself short, studying Lee's strained face.

                          BUCKY (cont'd)
                   (to Kay)
               I promised him a week on it. Four more
               days and it's over.

                          KAY
               Dwight, you can be so gutless sometimes.

     She turns on them both and goes back inside. Before Lee can
     make a wisecrack Bucky kicks his way through the LAPD papers
     back to his car...

     INT. LAVERNE'S HIDEAWAY - NIGHT

     Bucky sits low in his car, watching THE WHITE PACKARD parked
     near the front of LaVerne's. He's been there awhile...

     Finally the woman from the night before exits and heads for
     her car. He jumps out and walks quickly to intercept her
     while she's fumbling for her keys.

                          BUCKY
               Slumming, Miss Sprague?

     She sighs, exasperated.

                          MADELEINE
               I am now. Daddy spying on me again?

     She pulls a wad of cash out of her purse. Switching to a very
     deft imitation of a Scotchman's burr:

                          MADELEINE (cont'd)
               Maddy, girl, ye shouldn't be congregatin'
               in such unsuitable places--

                          BUCKY
               I'm a policeman.

                          MADELEINE
               Well that's a new one--

     She peels off another bill. Hands it to Bucky. He counts it
     out. Over a hundred dollars.

                          BUCKY
               Homicide.

     He hands the money back.

                          BUCKY (cont'd)
               Let's try Elizabeth Short. Linda Martin.

     All of her bravado drops. Bucky sees it immediately. He grabs
     her purse and keys and tosses them on the hood of her car.

                          BUCKY (cont'd)
               Here or downtown? I know you knew her so
               don't jerk me off on that or it's
               downtown and a whole lot of publicity.

     She opens the door to her car and slides in. Bucky gets in
     next to her. By the roof light he can see that her similarity
     to the Dahlia is more in her clothes and hair, but the
     resemblance is still there nonetheless.

                          MADELEINE
                   (gathering herself)
               This is all a fluke. I met them at
               LaVerne's last fall.
               Betty maybe one time. Linda a couple.
               She'd come in to cadge a drink or a meal
               off a sister.

                          BUCKY
               You sleep with either of them?

                          MADELEINE
               No. Just cocktail lounge chitchat.

                          BUCKY
               Are you lez?

                          MADELEINE
                   (Scotchman's burr)
               Ye might say I take it where I can find
               it, laddie.

     Bucky's charmed by her, but stays focused.

                          BUCKY
               Why'd you rabbit last night?

                          MADELEINE
                   (exasperated)
               Mister, my father is Emmett Sprague. The
               Emmett Sprague. He built half of
               Hollywood and Long Beach, and what he
               didn't build he bought. Imagine the
               headlines. "Tycoon's Daughter Questioned
               in Black Dahlia Case--Played Footsie with
               Dead Girl at Lesbian Nightclub". Get the
               picture?

                          BUCKY
               In Technicolor. (beat) What did you talk
               about?

                          MADELEINE
               Linda talked about her boring boy back in
               Hicktown, Nebraska, or wherever. Betty
               talked about the latest issue of Screen
               World. Hollywood dreams, the sad nine
               yards.

                          BUCKY
               Betty ever tell you about a movie she
               did? Show you a viewfinder? Anything
               specific?

                          MADELEINE
               On a conversational level they were right
               down there with you, only they were
               better looking.

                          BUCKY
               You're cute.

                          MADELEINE
               You're not. Look, I'm tired. You want to
               hear my alibi so I can end this farce and
               go home?

                          BUCKY
               That's all anyone ever wants to
               volunteer: the alibi. Go ahead.

                          MADELEINE
               My family and I were at our house in
               Laguna from Sunday through Thursday along
               with our live-in servants. If you want
               verification, call Daddy. But be discreet
               about where we met.

     She turns in the seat to face him directly.

                          MADELEINE (cont'd)
               Don't suppose I can convince you to keep
               my name out of the papers?

                          BUCKY
               I don't need your cash if that's what
               you're saying.

     She touches his leg.

                          MADELEINE
               Ah, Laddie...'S not what I'm saying...

     He knows exactly what she's saying.

                          BUCKY
               Convince me.

                          MADELEINE
               Tomorrow night. Eight o'clock. My address
               is 482 So. Muirfield.

                          BUCKY
               I know the address.

                          MADELEINE
               Not surprised. Pick me up. Like a
               gentleman.

     He starts to get out of the car.

                          MADELEINE (cont'd)
               One more thing--What's your name?

                          BUCKY
               Bucky Bleichert.

                          MADELEINE
               I'll try to remember.

     He pulls the purse off the hood and tosses her the keys. As
     he walks away he lets out a deep breath, as if he'd been
     holding it the whole time...

     INT. THE SQUAD ROOM - NEXT DAY

     Bucky enters and finds Lee at a desk, manning the tip phones.

                          LEE
               Yes, ma'am. I understand. A werewolf and
               Red Manley. Oh no. The werewolf is Red
               Manley. Yes that would be more
               efficient...

     Lee dutifully writes down the crank on a routing slip. Bucky
     slides into a chair across from him, brushing imaginary dust
     off of the phone in front of him.

     Lee rings off. Smiles at Bucky.

                          LEE (cont'd)
               I love tip duty.

                          BUCKY
               So...You smooth things with Kay?

                          LEE
               Yeah. I rented a room for the stuff at
               the El Nido Motel. Nine scoots a week.
               Chump change if it makes her feel good.

                          BUCKY
               De Witt gets out tomorrow, Lee. I was
               thinking maybe I should lean on him. Get
               Fritz Vogel and Koenig to do it--

     Lee swings away in his rotating chair, knocking over a
     wastepaper basket.

                          BUCKY (cont'd)
               Lee--

     The phone in front of Lee rings. He snatches it--

                          LEE
               Blanchard. Homicide.

     Lee listens to the call, not saying anything. It goes on for
     some time. Finally Bucky catches Lee's eye. Lee makes the
     "looney" sign with his finger.

     Bucky's phone rings. He picks it up.

                          BUCKY
               Bleichert. Homicide.

     The person on the other line starts rambling on. Bucky takes
     notes diligently as we

                                                       DISSOLVE TO:

     INT. THE SQUAD ROOM - LATER

     Bucky's on another call. His pile of tip sheets and routing
     slips have grown. Behind him Lee pulls on his jacket and
     gives Bucky a two-fingered salute as he saunters out.

                          VOICE OVER
               I logged forty-six phone tips, about half
               of which were reasonably coherent. Lee
               left early, dodging any talk about De
               Witt. Ellis Loew stuck me with writing up
               the summary report, most of which
               concerned the numerous dead end leads,
               bogus confessions and three hundred new
               Dahlia sightings per day. It left me gut
               certain of one thing:

                                                            CUT TO:

     A CLOSE UP OF THE BETTING POOL TABLE

     as Bucky drops twenty dollars on "Unsolved - pay 2 to 1".

     INT. ANOTHER CASTING OFFICE - DAY

     Elizabeth Short in another dress, her hair fixed differently.
     Clapsticks come in again: "Elizabeth Short...Screen Test
     #2"

                          MAN #2 (O.S.)
               Where are you from?

                          ELIZABETH SHORT
               Boston. Massachusetts.

                          MAN #2
               How long have you lived here?

                          ELIZABETH SHORT
               Two years.

                          MAN #2
               You've lost your accent.

                          ELIZABETH SHORT
               Well, you know, when in Rome...
                   (looks nervously into camera)
               Why? Do you want a girl with an accent?

     FADE OUT

     EXT. THE SPRAGUE MANSION - NIGHT

     Bucky rings the bell dressed in his Sunday best blazer.
     Madeleine answers, a knockout in a skirt and cashmere sweater.

                          MADELEINE
               Look. I hate to pull this, but Daddy has
               heard about you. He insisted you stay for
               dinner. I told him we met at that art
               exhibit at Stanley Rose's Bookshop, so if
               you have to pump everybody for my alibi,
               be subtle. All right?

                          BUCKY
               Sure.

     She leads him inside.

     INT. THE SPRAGUE MANSION - CONTINUOUS

     Thick Persian carpets, tapestries, giant rooms with a men's
     club atmosphere.

     Next to the fireplace Bucky notices A STUFFED SPANIEL with a
     yellowed newspaper rolled into its mouth.

                          MADELEINE
                   (re the dog)
               That's Balto. The paper is the LA Times
               for August 1, 1926. Balto was bringing in
               the paper when Daddy's accountant told
               him he'd made his first million. Daddy
               wanted to consecrate the moment so he
               shot him. Here we go--

     INT. A SMALL SITTING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

     The Sprague family sits in matching easy chairs. No one
     stands up.

                          MADELEINE
               Bucky Bleichert. May I present my family.
               My mother, Ramona Cathcart Sprague. My
               father, Emmett Sprague. My sister, Martha
               McConville Sprague.

     Emmett Sprague jumps to his feet, pumping Bucky's hand.

                          BUCKY
               A pleasure, Mr. Sprague.

                          EMMETT SPRAGUE
               Saw you fight Mondo Sanchez. Boxed the
               pants off him. Another Billy Conn you
               were.

                          BUCKY
               Thanks.

                          EMMETT SPRAGUE
               Mondo gave a good show. What ever
               happened to him?

                          BUCKY
               Died of a heroin overdose.

                          EMMETT SPRAGUE
               Too bad. Shamed his family. (beat)
               Speaking of families--

     Both Martha and Ramona stand up. Martha is 19, plain and
     serious, with a tenacious resemblance to Emmett. (Neither of
     whom look much like Madeleine.)

     Ramona, on the other hand, possesses a pushing-fifty
     resemblance to Madeleine combined with the flaccid face and
     unfocused features of a booze or drug addict.

                          RAMONA
                   (trace of a slur)
               Madeleine says nice things about you.

                          MADELEINE
               Daddy can we eat? Bucky and I want to
               catch a nine-thirty show.

     INT. THE DINING ROOOM - LATER

     A black maid serves large portions of corned beef and cabbage.

                          EMMETT SPRAGUE
               Dig in, lad. Hearty fare breeds hearty
               people. Haute cuisine breeds degenerates.

     Bucky smiles politely and begins eating.

                          MARTHA
               I want to draw Mr. Bleichert, Daddy.

     On Emmett's nod Martha pulls out a small sketch pad.

                          EMMETT SPRAGUE
               You're in for a cruel caricaturing,
               Bucky. Maddy's my pretty one, but
               Martha's my certified genius.

     A wince from Martha.

                          EMMETT SPRAGUE (cont'd)
               What kind of name is Bleichert? Dutch?

                          BUCKY
               German.

                          EMMETT SPRAGUE
               A great people, the Germans. Hitler was a
               bit excessive, but mark my words that
               someday we'll regret not joining forces
               with him to fight the Reds. I killed a
               lot of your countrymen during the war.

                          MARTHA
               Did you meet Balto out in the hallway?

                          BUCKY
               Very realistic.

                          EMMETT SPRAGUE
               An old friend stuffed him. We were in the
               Scots regiment together. Georgie Tilden.
               He wanted to work in the flickers.

                          BUCKY
               So when did you come here?

                          EMMETT SPRAGUE
               1920. Hollywood was a cow pasture, but
               the silent flickers was booming. Georgie
               got work as a lighting man, and me
               building houses.
               Georgie got me introduced to Mack Sennett
               and I helped him build that housing
               project he was putting up--Hollywoodland--
               underneath that godawful sign.

                          BUCKY
               I always loved the Keystone Kops.

                          EMMETT SPRAGUE
               Old Mack knew how to squeeze a dollar
               dry, he did. He had extras moonlighting
               as laborers and vice versa. I used to
               drive 'em over to Hollywoodland after
               twelve hours on a Keystone Cops flicker
               and put in another six hours by
               torchlight. Even gave me as assistant
               director credit a couple times, so
               grateful he was for the way I squeezed
               his slaves--

     A SCREECH interrupts Emmett's monologue. Bucky looks across
     the table to see Ramona trying to corral a potato with her
     fork (the source of the sound).

                          EMMETT SPRAGUE (cont'd)
               Mother? Are you feeling well? Would you
               like to contribute to the conversation?

     Ramona forks a small bit of food and chews it daintily.

                          RAMONA
               Did you know, Mr. Bleichert, that Ramona
               Boulevard was named after me?

                          BUCKY
               No Mrs. Sprague, I didn't.

                          RAMONA
               When Emmett married me for my father's
               money he promised my family that he would
               use his influence with the City Zoning
               Board to have a street named after me.
               But all he could manage was a dead-end
               block in a red light district in Lincoln
               Heights. Are you familiar with the
               neighborhood, Mr. Bleichert?

                          BUCKY
               I grew up there.

                          RAMONA
               Then you know that the Mexican
               prostitutes expose themselves out of
               windows to attract customers. I hear many
               of them know Mr. Sprague by name--

     Emmett Sprague SLAMS the table. Plates rattle. Silence. Bucky
     stares into his lap as Madeleine grabs his knee tightly.

                          RAMONA (cont'd)
               I'll sing for my supper when Mayor Bowron
               comes to dinner, but not for Madeleine's
               male whores. A common policeman. My God,
               Emmett. How little you think of me.

     She struggles to her feet and leaves the room. Her husband
     follows.

                          MADELEINE
               I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

                          MARTHA
                   (cheery)
               Mr. Bleichert?

     Martha tears a piece of paper out of her sketch pad. Bucky
     takes it as she walks away.

     ANGLE ON THE SKETCH:

     A caricature of a naked Bucky having sex with Madeleine.

                                                            CUT TO:

     EXT. THE RED ARROW INN - LATER

     A cinderblock auto court filled with pre-war jalopies. The
     camera closes on a dingy door. Room 11.

     INT. THE RED ARROW INN - ROOM 11 - SAME

     A single yellow light illuminates the dreary flop as Bucky
     and Madeleine fuck on the bed.

                          MADELEINE
               I'm so...sorry. Don't hate my family--
               don't--they're not so bad--

     Bucky grabs her hair--

                          BUCKY
               Not them, me. Do me. Be with me.

     Focusing, Madeleine pins Bucky with her knees and pulls him
     deep into her until they're no longer common policeman and
     rich girl slut. They're one.

     INT. THE RED ARROW INN - ROOM 11 - SAME

     They hold each other, sweaty and spent.

                          BUCKY
               Well. I think you kept your name out of
               the papers.

                          MADELEINE
               Until we announce the wedding?

                          BUCKY
               Your mother would love that.

                          MADELEINE
               She's a hypocrite. She takes pills the
               doctor gives her, so she's not a hophead.
               You know how Daddy really made his money?

                          BUCKY
               How?

                          MADELEINE
               He bought rotten lumber and abandoned
               movie facades from Mack Sennett and built
               houses out of them. He's got firetraps
               all over LA registered to phony
               corporations...His "good friend" George?
               Disfigured in a car crash while running
               Daddy some errands. Daddy throws him
               scraps now--odd jobs tending some rental
               property--

                          BUCKY
               You don't have to tell me this--

                          MADELEINE
               I want to. I like you Bucky.

                          BUCKY
               I like you, too.

     She looks at him earnestly.

                          MADELEINE
               Bucky, I didn't tell you all about Betty
               Short.

                          BUCKY
               Jesus--

                          MADELEINE
               Don't be mad at me. It's nothing. I just
               don't want to lie to you.

                          BUCKY
               What is it?

                          MADELEINE
               Last summer I was bar-hopping a lot.
               Straight bars. I heard about a girl who
               looked like me. I got curious and left
               notes at a couple places: "Your lookalike
               wants to meet you", things like that. I
               left my number. She called. That's how I
               met her at LaVerne's with Linda.

                          BUCKY
               And that's all of it?

                          MADELEINE
               Yes. That's all of it.

                          BUCKY
               Then be prepared, babe. There's fifty
               cops out there combing every bar in town
               looking for Dahlia info. You could be
               headed for the papers no matter what.

                          MADELEINE
               Serve my family right.

                          BUCKY
               You don't mean that.

                          MADELEINE
               No. I don't.

     He strokes her dark hair.

                          BUCKY
               Tell me something. Why'd you want to meet
               Betty Short?

                          MADELEINE
               I've worked pretty hard to be loose and
               free. But the way people described Betty.
               It sounded like she was a natural.

                          BUCKY
               How do you mean?

                          MADELEINE
               Hmmm...She was this poor girl...Came from
               nothing...But then she carried nothing
               with her, either. I don't know...when
               you're rich sometimes you romanticize the
               poor...

                          BUCKY
               I wouldn't know.

     An awkward silence as she considers her foot in her mouth. He
     studies her for a moment. Pulls her close, kisses her
     mouth...the arch of her neck...They begin to move together
     again...

     Another LAPD FORM: "Witness Report: Lorna
     Martikova...aka Linda Martin..."

     EXT./INT. BUCKY'S CAR - MOVING

     Bucky weaves fast through traffic. He whips a right turn...

     EXT. THE CALEDONIA LOUNGE - CONTINUOUS

     Bucky's car screeches into the parking lot just as LINDA
     MARTIN bursts through the doors and takes off running.

     Bucky jumps from the car and sprints after her, the girl
     clutching an oversized purse to her chest as she dashes in
     and out of busy traffic.

     The girl runs like a fucking antelope as Bucky barely misses
     being hit by a large BEER TRUCK and gets to the other side of
     the street just as Linda stumbles over a curb--sending her
     sprawling on the sidewalk.

     Bucky jumps on her, grabbing her tiny fists as she kicks and
     screams like a hell cat.

     He cuffs her and pulls her up, dragging her to where she
     spilled her purse.

                          LINDA MARTIN
               I'm an emancipated minor and if you touch
               me without a matron present I'll sue you!

     He picks it up her purse. Surprised by the heft, he opens it
     and pulls out A METAL FILM CAN.

     Her demeanor changes instantly to fear:

                          LINDA MARTIN
                   (near tears)
               Please, mister...My...my parents.

     INT. JUVENILE DETENTION HALL - INTERROGATION ROOM - LATER

     Russ, Harry and Bucky sit opposite Linda Martin. She's pretty
     and small, and about to get smaller...

                          RUSS MILLARD
               ...and you don't recall any of the names
               Betty went out with last fall?

                          LINDA MARTIN
               They were just pickups.

                          RUSS MILLARD
               No one who would do her harm?

     The girl thinks hard, shakes her head "no".

                          BUCKY
               You made the casting rounds together.
               Ever get any movie work?

                          LINDA MARTIN
               No.

                          BUCKY
               So what about the film can?

     Her eyes go to the floor, tears begin to drop.

                          LINDA MARTIN
               It's...a movie.

                          BUCKY
               A dirty movie?

     She nods her head silently.

                          RUSS MILLARD
               You have to tell us the whole thing,
               sweetheart. So think it through.

     Harry pours her a paper cup of water. She takes a sip.

                          LINDA MARTIN
               I was...cadging at a bar in Gardena. This
               Mexican man - Raoul or Jorge or something
               - starting talking to me.
               I thought I was pregnant, and I was
               desperate wicked bad for money. He said
               he'd give me two hundred dollars to act
               in a nudie film.

     She takes a large gulp of water.

                          LINDA MARTIN (cont'd)
               He said he needed another girl so I asked
               Betty. The three of us drove down to
               Tijuana and we made the movie at this big
               house outside of town. (beat) Then he
               drove us back to LA.

     Her head bowed. Russ and Harry stare at her impassively.

                          BUCKY
               Was this around Thanksgiving?

     She nods yes.

                          BUCKY (cont'd)
               Did the Mex give Betty a viewfinder?

     She raises her head in recognition and nods yes.

                          BUCKY (cont'd)
               Did he seem particularly interested in
               Betty? Did she see him again?

     She shakes her head "no".

                          BUCKY (cont'd)
               But you saw him again, didn't you? How
               else could you have gotten a copy?

     Linda looks sadly at Bucky.

                          LINDA MARTIN
               After Betty...After I read about
               Betty...I went looking for him in
               Gardena. He was about to go back to
               Mexico and I conned him out of a print.

                          RUSS MILLARD
               Where was that?

                          LINDA MARTIN
               I don't remember. On Aviation somewhere.

                          RUSS MILLARD
               Why would you do that?

                          LINDA MARTIN
               A Black Dahlia stag film? I thought...I
               could sell it if I had to. (ashamed) It
               was...a collector's item.

                          RUSS MILLARD
               And he willingly gave you a copy of the
               film? For nothing?

                          LINDA MARTIN
               No. Not for nothing.

     She looks down again. The cops look at each other. Linda's
     harder and more desperate than they imagined.

                          LINDA MARTIN (cont'd)
               You'll let me have it back, won't you?
               You won't let people look at it?

     Now its the cops turn to look away.

     EXT. THE HALLWAY - AFTER

     Russ and Bucky.

                          RUSS MILLARD
               Whattya think?

                          BUCKY
               I think she's covering on the Mex angle.
               Maybe she knows him and doesn't want him
               taking a smut rap. Maybe he's white. The
               TJ stuff is sound, though. I'd detach Meg
               Caulfield from Wilshire Clerical to play
               cellmate for a day.

                          RUSS MILLARD
               Bleichert you are a very bright penny
               today. (beat) Well. Looks like it's blue
               movie night at City Hall.

     INT. THE MUSTER ROOM - LATER

     A projector and screen has been set up. All the big-wigs are
     present: Ellis Loew, Jack Tierney, Thad Green and Chief of
     Police C.B. Horrall. Millard, Harry and Lee.

     A clerical assistant threads the projector as Bucky settles
     into a seat next to Lee. On Lee's lap is a newspaper with the 
     headline: "Boulevard-Citizen's Mastermind to be Released
     --LA Bound after 8 years of Custody"

                          LEE
                   (raggedy)
               Gettin' any?

     Bucky's about to respond when the lights dim and a blurred
     image hits the screen. It begins to focus.

     A title: "Slave Girls From Hell"

     The movie: A big high-ceiling room with Egyptian
     hieroglyphics on the walls. Pillars shaped like coiled
     serpents are stationed throughout the room; the camera zooms
     in for a close-up of two inset plaster snakes swallowing each
     other's tails. The snakes dissolve into Betty Short, wearing
     only stockings and doing an inept hoochie koochie dance...

     An audible breath in the muster room.

     A hand reaches into frame, passing Betty a large cylindrical
     object: a dildo, scales covering the shaft, fangs extending
     from the circumcised head. Betty puts it in her mouth, sucks
     it, eyes wide open and glassy.

     An abrupt cut: Linda Martin, naked, lying on a divan. Betty
     enters the frame with the dildo; she puts it between Linda's
     legs, pushing it inside her. Linda rotates her hips, trying
     her best to fake ecstasy instead of pain and sadness.

     Another cut: Betty mouthing the words "No, please" to the
     camera. A hand pushing her head down towards Linda's crotch.
     Betty tonguing next to the dildo...

     BACK ON THE MUSTER ROOM

     The atmosphere is somber, but calm. The film continues...

                          CHIEF HORRALL
               Whattya think, Russ? This got anything to
               do with the girl's murder--

                          RUSS MILLARD
               Long shot, Chief. Harry and I are headed
               down to TJ tonight. The Mex doesn't play
               as the killer. But maybe he showed it to
               someone--

     Suddenly Lee jumps up, standing in front of the screen.

                          LEE
               Who gives a fuck if he didn't kill her!
               I've sent Boy Scouts to the green room
               for less than this!

     He yanks down the screen with a crash and storms out of the
     room. The movie continues on the chalked up blackboard.

     INT. THE LOCKER ROOM - LATER

     Lee sits on the ground, head in his hands. Bucky enters and
     sits on a bench next to him.

                          LEE
               Did you see her face, Bucky? Did you see?

                          BUCKY
               Yeah. I did, partner. I did.

     Bucky notices Lee's still clutching the De Witt article in
     his fist. He pries it loose.

     Ellis Loew and Russ Millard enter.

                          ELLIS LOEW
               Goddammit, Blanchard! I got you Warrants.
               You're my man, and you made me look like
               a fool in front of the two most powerful
               men in the Department. If you weren't
               Mr. Fire you'd be suspended from duty
               already. You've gotten personally
               involved in the Short case--

                          BUCKY
                   (holding up the newspaper)
               Mr. Loew, it's not just Betty Short--

                          ELLIS LOEW
               Shut up, Bleichert.
                   (back to Lee)
               You're back on Warrants as of tomorrow.
               Report to me at 0800 with letters of
               apology for Green and Horrall. For the
               sake of your pension I'd suggest you
               grovel.

                          LEE
               I want to go to TJ--

                          ELLIS LOEW
               Blanchard!

     Poison hangs in the air. Ellis turns on his heels.

     INT. THE SQUADRON - DAY

     Bucky sits in his cubicle searching the Dahlia files. The
     clock behind him reads "12:30". Loew approaches.

                          ELLIS LOEW
               You've been skating around all morning,
               Bleichert. Vogel and Koenig went to
               Tijuana an hour ago so I need you to
               check out a radio car and get out there.

                          BUCKY
               Yes, sir.

                          ELLIS LOEW
               And if you see that phantom partner of
               yours, tell him this no-show's gonna cost
               him three days pay.

     Loew walks off. Bucky dials the phone.

                          MADELEINE (VO)
               Hello.

                          BUCKY
               It's me. You want to get together?

                          MADELEINE (VO)
               When?

                          BUCKY
               I'll pick you up in forty-five minutes.

                          MADELEINE (VO)
               Not at the house. Daddy's having a
               business soiree. The Red Arrow.

                          BUCKY
               I have an apartment, you know.

                          MADELEINE (VO)
               Room 11. Forty-five minutes.

     She hangs up.

     INT. RED ARROW MOTEL - ROOM 11 - LATER

     They lie naked in the bed. Bucky's lost in thought.

                          MADELEINE
               Smile at me. Look soft and sweet.

     He looks anything but.

                          BUCK
               They picked up Linda Martin yesterday.
               She had a stag film of her and Betty
               Short playing lez. Spooky stuff.

     Madeleine sits up.

                          MADELEINE
               Did she mention me?

                          BUCKY
               No. And I checked through the case file.
               There's no mention of that note-leaving
               number you pulled. (beat) Babe, I'm
               withholding evidence for you. It's a fair
               trade for what I'm getting, but it still
               shakes me. Is there anything you haven't
               told me about Betty and Linda?

     She runs her fingers down his ribcage, teasing his boxing
     scars.

                          MADELEINE
               Sugar, Betty and I made love once, that
               one time we met last summer. I just did
               it to see what it would be like to do it
               with someone who looked like me and--

                          BUCKY
               Jesus Christ.

     He jumps from the bed and pulls on his pants.

                          MADELEINE
               Bucky that's it, I swear. Please stay--

     He pulls on his shirt, his handcuffs and his .38. Grabs his
     jacket--

                          MADELEINE (cont'd)
               Stay sugar stay--

     --and slams the door on the way out.

     INT. THE POLICE CRUISER - LATER

     Bucky steamed in the car. He flips on the police radio,
     looking for distraction. Instead he gets:

                          RADIO DISPATCHER
               Code four all units at Crenshaw and
               Stocker. Two dead, suspect dead, Raymond
               Douglas Nash, warrant number--

     EXT. A KOREAN GROCERY - MINUTES LATER

     RAYMOND NASH lies dead on the sidewalk. Off to one side, a
     short and wiry cop is describing for detectives how it all
     went down, pantomiming how he shot an escaping Raymond Nash.

     Bucky stands over Nash, staring at his dead features. He
     walks inside.

     INT. A KOREAN GROCERY - CONTINUOUS

     Bucky's POV:

     A robbery gone bad. A sixty-year old Korean shopowner lies
     dead behind the counter and his teenaged son lies dead in an
     aisle. Blood and green linoleum.

     INT. THE SQUAD ROOM - SOON AFTER

     Bucky bursts into the squad room, seeing red.

                          BUCKY
               Blanchard!

     A cop walking through the bullpen points to the bathroom.

     INT. THE BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS

     Bucky kicks in the door, finding Lee washing his hands in the
     sink. He holds his hands up to Bucky, blood oozes from Lee's
     knuckles.

                          LEE
               I beat up a wall. Penance for Nash.

                          BUCKY
               Not good enough.

     Bucky steps into Lee with fists flying, a mad demon. He
     smashes him again and again, beating his only friend until
     Lee slides senseless to the floor...

     INT. BUCKY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

     Bucky drinks bourbon straight, his wrist heavily bandaged.

                          VOICE OVER
               Losing the first Bleichert-Blanchard
               fight got me local celebrity, Warrants,
               and close to nine grand in cash;
               winning the rematch got me a sprained
               wrist, two dislocated knuckles and the
               rest of the day off. Whoever said winning
               isn't everything got that part right.

     EXT. LEE AND KAY'S HOUSE - NEXT DAY

     Bucky walks into the house and finds Kay there. She holds up
     a newspaper: The front page includes The Black Dahlia, Junior
     Nash, and Bobby De Witt.

                          KAY
                   (eyes red from crying)
               We're famous, Dwight.

                          BUCKY
               Notorious, maybe. Where's Lee?

                          KAY
               I haven't seen him since you beat him up.

     Bucky looks ashamed.

                          KAY (cont'd)
               I don't blame you.

     He walks to her and she holds him.

                          BUCKY
               He's in trouble, you know.

     She nods. He strokes her hair.

                          BUCKY (cont'd)
               De Witt's probably in LA by now. If Lee
               doesn't show up by tonight I'll come over
               to stay with you.

                          KAY
               I don't want you coming over here just to
               sleep an the couch again.

                          BUCKY
               Kay. Lee--

     She holds up a hand, waving him off. She knows all this.

                          KAY
               You know Dwight? Fighting, cops, guns. To
               most people--that's the scary stuff. Not
               everything else.

     She knows him to the core. She steps back, holding his hands.

                          KAY (cont'd)
               Luck.

                          BUCKY
               Short of winning?

                          KAY
               Luck.

     INT. POLICE STATION - BUCKY'S CUBICLE - LATER

     Bucky's on the phone.

                          BUCKY
               Thank you very much.

     He rings off looking very disturbed as Russ and Harry arrive.

                          BUCKY (cont'd)
               What happened in TJ?

                          HARRY SEARS
               Checked for the smut pad. Goose egg.
               Peddlers--double goose egg--

                          RUSS MILLARD
               Bucky. Blanchard's in Tijuana. A border
               cop spotted him hobnobbing with a bunch
               of rough-looking Rurales last night.

     Bucky exhales hard.

                          RUSS MILLARD (cont'd)
               What is it?

                          BUCKY
                   (re his phone call)
               That was County Parole. Bobby DeWitt
               bought a bus ticket at the Santa Rosa
               depot this morning. San Diego. Transfer
               Tijuana.

     EXT. TIJUANA - VARIOUS SHOTS - DAWN

     Bucky cruises the Tijuana streets: child beggars dig for 
     breakfast in trash cans, taco venders stir pots of dog-meat
     stew, sailors and marines stumble out of whorehouses. Rurales
     drive prewar Chevys wearing black uniforms...

                          VOICE OVER
               Back in LA, Linda Short let slip that her
               "Mex" was actually a local named Walter
               Wellington, who copped to making the film
               but quickly provided the cops his alibi
               for the Dahlia's missing days.

     Bucky parks at a big pink Art Deco hotel (The Divisidero).

     INT. THE DIVISIDERO - CONTINUOUS

     Bucky badges the desk clerk and gets a room number. He heads
     upstairs.

                          VOICE OVER
               Not that this stopped Loew and his boys
               from rousting spics all over town for a
               possible Dahlia frame-up. The circus was
               becoming a farce.

     INT. A DIVISIDERO HOTEL ROOM - CONTINUOUS

     Ellis Loew, Fritz Vogel, and Bill Koenig arguing.

                          ELLIS LOEW
               We can't do that! Wellington told Tierney
               he made the pic--

     Bucky opens the door and the room falls quiet.

                          ELLIS LOEW (cont'd)
               Bleichert.

                          BUCKY
               Lee's down here and so is Bobby De Witt.

                          ELLIS LOEW
               Fuck Blanchard. He's suspended.

     Bucky charges the DA but Vogel and Koenig intercept him,
     pushing him roughly back out in the hall. Loew retreats to
     the other side of the room.

                          VOGEL
               You know what, kid? I got a soft spot in
               my heart for light heavyweights.
                   (chucks his chin)
               You promise not to hit Billy and I'll
               help you look for your partner.
                   (re Bucky's ragged appearance)
               I'll drive. You look like shit.

     EXT. THE TIJUANA STREETS - VARIOUS SHOTS

     Bucky and Fritz Vogel drive past beggars swarming tourists,
     hookers dispensing front seat blow jobs, zoot suit youths
     prowling for drunks to roll...

     EXT. THE TIJUANA STREETS - VARIOUS SHOTS

     The two men park the car in the middle of a car-choked street
     and decide to try walking. They're immediately swallowed up
     by kid beggars shoving crucifixes in their faces.

     Bucky tosses handfuls of coins into the gutters and the
     children scatter, squabbling over the coins.

     IN THE BACKGROUND

     Fritz Vogel approaches a Rurale and talks to him. The Rurale
     nods yes, gesturing down an alley to a squat cinderblock
     building.

                                                            CUT TO:

     INT. A FILTHY MEXICAN JAIL - SOON AFTER

     Vogel and Bucky walk quickly down a corridor lined with empty
     cells. A Mexican jailer unlocks the last cell and the two
     cops walk in to face

     BOBBY DEWITT

     the hatchet-faced tough of 1939 now a grizzled and bloated
     well-used piece of work. He stands up, full of con bravado.

                          DEWITT
               Cops, huh? Well at least you're American.
               Never thought I'l be glad to see you
               guys.

                          VOGEL
               Why start now?

     Vogel kicks in the balls, dropping him to his knees. Vogel
     smashes him with a thick backhand across the face.

                                                            CUT TO:

     BUCKY HANDCUFFING BOBBY DEWITT TO A CHAIR

     Vogel stands over him.

                          VOGEL
               Lee Blanchard's here in TJ, and you came
               here flush out of Big Q. That's a
               goddamned strange coincidence and I don't
               like it. I don't like you and I don't
               like being down in this rat-infested
               country when I could be home with my
               family.

     DeWitt pisses his pants.

                          VOGEL (cont'd)
               Did you know Blanchard was in TJ?

                          DEWITT
               Ain't seen Blanchard since my fuckin'
               trial.

     Vogel smashes him across the face.

                          VOGEL
               Do not use profanity with me, and address
               me as sir.

     DeWitt's head bobs up and down.

                          VOGEL (cont'd)
               Now Blanchard's scared of you. Why?

                          DEWITT
               Man o Manieschewitz, what a laugh. Lee
               beauty gotta be scared of me 'cause of
               how I flapped my trap at trial, but all I
               know is what I read in the papers. Maybe
               I was thinkin' revenge, maybe talkin'
               trash to my cellies, but when Lee beauty
               killed them niggers--

     Vogel topples DeWitt with a right hook and then picks him
     back up by the neck, squeezing the life out of him.

                          VOGEL
               Bobby boy I do not like Sergeant
               Blanchard but he is a fellow officer and
               I will not have syphilitic scum like you
               defaming him. Now you risked a parole
               violation for a trip down here.

     He lets go of his neck, the color returning to DeWitt's face.

                          VOGEL (cont'd)
               Why are you here, Bobby. You tell me.

                          DEWITT
                   (a beaten dog)
               I came down to cop some heroin and move
               it back to LA. I'm meeting a guy, Felix
               Casco, at the Gardena Motel. Please.
               Don't hurt me no more. Please.

     Vogel claps his hands together, gleeful with this bonus bust.

                          VOGEL
                   (heading out of the cell)
               I'm gonna call Ellis.

     Bucky turns back to De Witt, who's much more relaxed now that
     Vogel's left the cell.

                          BUCKY
               Finish up with you and Blanchard.

                          DEWITT
               Sir, all that's between me and Blanchard
               is that I fucked this cunt Kay Lake--

     IN SLOW MOTION--

     Bucky leaps on De Witt, grabbing him around the neck and
     choking him. De Witt turns blue, his eyes bulging out--

     BEHIND BUCKY, VOICES IN SPANISH

     and then hands on his shoulders as Ducky is hurled backwards
     into the cell bars. And then

     BLACKNESS

     which slowly becomes grey, and then back to normal as Bucky
     finds himself awakening on the floor of the cell.

     Refocusing on the scene:

     Two Rurales in jodhpur boots pick their teeth with
     matchsticks as Fritz Vogel pulls Bucky to his feet.

                          BUCKY
               How long--

                          VOGEL
               I let Bobby boy go so we could tail him
               to his pal. But he blew his tail while
               you were catching up on your beauty
               sleep, which is too bad for him.

                                                            CUT TO:

     A STUDEBAKER PATROL CAR WITH LIGHTS FLASHING

     INSIDE THE STUDEBAKER

     Vogel, Koenig, a Rurale, and Bucky (holding a piece of ice to
     the back of his head).

     The car arrives at a horseshoe-shaped auto court. Two Mexican 
     policeman stand guard outside one of its rooms.

     INT. THE MOTEL ROOM - SECONDS LATER

     As the American cops walk in on a cordite-reeking
     slaughterhouse. Bobby De Witt and a Mexican man lay dead on
     the floor, bullet holes oozing blood all over them.

     Bucky notes the bruises on De Witt's neck from where he
     choked him. Bucky squints at the men, still a little
     disoriented...

                          VOGEL
               The spic's Felix Casco, a known dope
               trafficker. Maybe it was other dope scum,
               maybe Lee, maybe it was God. I say let
               our Mexican colleagues handle their own
               dirty laundry and we go back to LA and
               find the son of a bitch who sliced the
               Dahlia.

     INT. KAY AND LEE'S HOUSE - DAY

     Kay sits curled into a corner of the couch, defensively.
     Bucky sits on a small chair next to Lee's large easy chair.

                          KAY
               I spent the morning with Internal
               Affairs. I told them...everything I knew.
               I gave them so much...and in the end it
               didn't seem like anything at all.

                          BUCKY
               He'll came back, Kay. I'm sure of it.

                          KAY
               You don't know anything, Dwight. But
               that's what I like about you.

                          BUCKY
               Kay--

                          KAY
               I've been offered a job. Teaching sixth
               grade at Fairfax Primary. With Lee gone
               now--

                          BUCKY
               He's coming back.

     She nods, mollifying him.

                                                            CUT TO:

     as Bucky jimmies the lock and pushes open the door.

     INSIDE ROOM 204

     Boxes of police falls scattered on the bed and desk. Photos
     of Elizabeth Short pinned up all over the walls: glamour
     glossies, newspaper photos, enlarged crime scene
     grotesquerie.

     The amount of manpower represented here is staggering; so
     much work over one girl.

     Bucky sits down at the desk and buries his head in his hands.

               understood the detective's old saw: any

               Most cops'll tell ya...one day you wake
               up and you're in the head of the
               killer...Angry. Powerful. In control.
               You're the perp.

     FOOTAGE FROM BETTY AND LINDA'S PORN FILM

     as the camera dances across Betty Short's naked body. WE
     CLOSE IN on her, the 16mm film becoming finer and finer as
     the sex scene transforms into

     A LIVE SHOT OF BETTY SHORT, writhing in ecstasy underneath a
     man. She and the man fuck harder and harder, faster and
     faster.

                          BETTY SHORT
               No...Please...

     BUCKY'S FACE

     groaning with the ecstasy of ejaculation--

     BACK ON BETTY SHORT BENEATH HIM-

     but it's not Betty Short. It's Madeleine Sprague, staring up
     at Bucky as the two of them come simultaneously.

     As soon as it's over, she looks for his eyes. He won't look
     at her. She grabs his chin and turns him face to face.

                          VOICE OVER
               Few cops'll admit to walking the harder
               path...fear...pain...loss...Few will
               admit to waking up in the head of the
               vic.

     He lower his face to the pillow...

     INT. ANOTHER CASTING SESSION - DAY

     Another clapstick: "Elizabeth Short...Screen test #3"

     Elizabeth Short, looking a bit more worn down, holds a script
     up to her face.

                          ELIZABETH SHORT
                   (reading stiffly)
               Don't just walk out on me, Richard. Say
               something. Say you care say you--

                          MAN #3 (O.S.)
               I'm sorry. There's a pause there.

     She stops, frustrated.

                          MAN #3 (cont'd)
               Maybe with a little more sadness. Can you
               give me a little more sadness?

     FADE OUT

     CLOSE ON:

     the "UNSOLVED" sheet at the LAPD betting pool. Handwritten
     on the sheet are the constantly dropping odds: "2 to 1"
     replaced by "3 to 2" which has been replaced by "Even
     Money".

     THE CAMERA PANS UP FROM THE BETTING SHEETS:

     "TRANSFER NOTICE...As of 2/6/47 these officers
     currently assigned to the Elizabeth Short
     investigation will return to their regular duties...

     WIDE ON THE SCENE

     as Bucky reads the list. Unfortunately his name is not on it.

     He beelines straight to

     RUSS MILLARD'S OFFICE

     the quiet man looks up from his desk.

                          BUCKY
               I wasn't on the transfer list.

                          RUSS MILLARD
               I asked Jack to keep you on.

                          BUCKY
               Why?

                          RUSS MILLARD
               Because you're getting to be a damn good
               Detective, Bleichert. And Harry's
               retiring in two years. Need I spell it
               out?

                          BUCKY
               No.

                          RUSS MILLARD
               You been working this case pretty hard.
               Or is it the other way around?

     Bucky smiles weakly; Russ knows him.

                          RUSS MILLARD
               It's not as much fun once it moves to the
               back pages, is it? (changing subjects) I
               hear they arrested two Mexicans in Juarez
               for the Bobby De Witt murder.

                          BUCKY
               I heard that, too.

                          RUSS MILLARD
               You must be relieved.

                          BUCKY
               They've rescinded the APB on Lee. If he
               doesn't show up in thirty days he's out.

                          RUSS MILLARD
               He'll be found if he wants to be found.

                          BUCKY
               Like the guy who killed the Dahlia?

     Russ smiles grimly.

     EXT. FRITZ VOGEL'S HOUSE - EVENING

     Bucky rings the doorbell. Fritz Vogel answers.

                          VOGEL
               Boyo! Glad you could make it.

     He claps Bucky on the shoulder and leads him into the house.

     INT. FRITZ VOGEL'S LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

     The interior decorating equivalent of highballs and pretzels,
     which is exactly what Vogel, Bucky and Ellis Loew are
     consuming. Bucky drinks with the trepidation of the King's
     food taster.

                          ELLIS LOEW
               I called this little meeting for a couple
               reasons, Bucky.
               We'd both like to see the Short case
               closed out and get back to normal
               business.

     Bucky looks impatient and Ellis senses this.

                          ELLIS LOEW (cont'd)
               We're both comers, Bucky. Fritzie wants
               you for his partner when he gets his
               lieutenancy, and--

                          BUCKY
               Russ Millard wants me when Harry retires.

                          VOGEL
               You're too raw for him, boyo. Old Russ is
               a sob sister, and I'm much more your type.

     Bucky considers the truth in this. To Loew:

                          BUCKY
               What do you want, Ellis?

                          ELLIS LOEW
               Very well, Dwight. I'll tell you. There
               are four confessors still being held at
               City Jail. They've got no alibis, weren't
               coherent when they were first questioned,
               and they're all violent, frothing-at-the-
               mouth lunatics. I want them reintegrated.
               It's a muscle job.

                          VOGEL
               I wanted Bill Koenig--

                          ELLIS LOEW
               But Bill's a bit too enamored with
               violence. So it's you, Dwight. Yes or no?
               Because if it's yes, I'll make sure
               you're back on Warrants tomorrow with an
               inside track to some stripes. If not,
               it's Homicide shitwork until Russ Millard
               gets tired of you. We both know that Russ
               is a patient, forbearing man, Dwight.
               That could be a long time. Yes or no?

                                                            CUT TO:

     EXT. THE CITY JAIL PARKING LOT - NIGHT

     as four manacled men are being loaded into a drunk wagon
     while Bucky flips through their rap sheets and mug shots.

     INSIDE THE DRUNK WAGON

     the four men sit in the back as Bucky drives the truck. The
     camera pans their faces. The first, LOREN BIDWELL, pale, old
     and palsied.

                          VOICE OVER
               On my way over I played out their rap
               sheets in my head, trying to work up a
               head of hate...Loren Bidwell, three time
               Atascadero loser, falls for aggravated
               sexual assault on minors. Between prison
               jolts he confessed to all the big sex
               crimes.

     EXT. AN OLD WAREHOUSE BUILDING

     Bucky pulls the drunk wagon up to a building, its street
     facade illuminated: "KOUNTY KING LUNCH MEAT--SERVING L.A.
     COUNTY WITH INSTITUTIONAL FOOD SINCE 1923"...

     THE CAMERA finds the second man, CECIL DURKIN.

                          VOICE OVER (cont'd)
               Cecil Durkin--hophead, knife fighter and
               a jailhouse rape-o who played jazz drums
               with some good combos. He took two
               Quentin jolts for Arson and was caught
               masturbating at the scene of his last
               torch.

     AT THE FRONT OF THE WAREHOUSE BUILDING

     Fritz Vogel opens the door and leads the men inside.

     INT. THE WAREHOUSE BUILDING - CONTINUOUS

     A huge sawdust-covered roam, meathooks dangling from the
     ceiling. Beef dangles over half the hooks. The four men look 
     terrified.

     The camera finds the third man, CHARLIE ISSLER:

                          VOICE OVER
               Charlie Issler was a pimp and a career
               confessor specializing in copping to
               hooker homicides. His three procuring
               beefs had netted him a year county jail
               time, his phony confessions two ninety
               day observation stints at the Camarillo
               nut farm.

     And the fourth man, PAUL ORCHARD:

                          VOICE OVER (cont'd)
               And finally Paul Orchard. Jack roller,
               male prostitute, and a former San
               Bernardino County deputy sheriff.

     The group reaches a back wall of the warehouse where FOUR
     UNUSED MEATHOOKS DANGLE OVER FOUR CHAIRS.

     Bucky studies the men's apprehensive faces as Vogel stands
     each one on a chair with their manacled hands hooked over
     their respective meathooks.

     Bucky's gaze drifts back behind a large box where he sees A
     SHEET-COVERED TABLE sticking out. Before his curiosity draws
     him over Vogel addresses the prisoners.

                          VOGEL
               You all confessed to killing the Dahlia.
               We can't prove you did, so you're gonna
               have to convince us... Query on, Bucko.

     Bucky takes a deep breath and heads first to old man Bidwell.
     The man's palsy has him shaking and Bucky grabs the meathook
     above him to steady him.

                          BUCKY
               Tell me about Betty Short, pops. Why'd
               you kill her?

     Bidwell looks at him with beseeching eyes.

                          VOGEL
               Don't be timid, boyo. That bird made
               little boys suck his hog.

     Bucky's hand twitches on the meathook.

                          BUCKY
               Come clean, pop.

                          BIDWELL
               I didn't kill her mister. I just wanted a
               ticket to the honor farm. Three hots and
               a cot, that's all. Please, mister.

     The man's weakened state makes his argument for him. Bucky
     moves on to Cecil Durkin.

                          BUCKY
               Tell me about it, Cecil.

                          DURKIN
                   (laughing)
               You get that line from Dick Tracy or
               Gangbusters?

     Bucky catches Vogel out of the corner of his eye. Measuring...

                          BUCKY
               One more time, shitbird. Tell me about
               you and Betty Short.

                          DURKIN
               I fucked Betty Short and I fucked your
               mama! I'm your fucking daddy!

     Bucky one-two's him in the solar plexus. His legs buckle, but
     he keeps his feet on the chair.

                          DURKIN (cont'd)
               You think you clever, don't you. You the
               bad guy, your buddy the nice guy. Older
               than vaudeville.

                          BUCKY
               I'm the nice guy, Cecil. Keep that in
               mind.

     This shuts Durkin up. Bucky moves to Charlie Issler.

                          ISSLER
                   (sincere)
               Please. I didn't kill Liz. I don't know
               why I do these things, and I apologize.
               So please don't let that man hurt me.

                          BUCKY
               Convince me.

                          ISSLER
               I...can't. I just can't.

                          BUCKY
               You're a pimp. You know Betty Short?

                          ISSLER
               No.

                          BUCKY
               Why'd you confess to her murder?

                          ISSLER
               She looked so...sweet and pretty and I
               felt so bad. I always confess to the
               pretty ones.

                          BUCKY
               You feel guilty Charlie? You hit your
               girls, get 'em high on hop?

                          ISSLER
               I do such nasty things I don't know why--

     Vogel struts over, putting on brass knuckles.

                          VOGEL
               This kid glove routine's gettin' old--

     He kicks Issler's chair out from under him, the pimp
     screaming as his wrists snap. Vogel kicks the remaining three
     chairs out, punctuating each with a declaration:

                          VOGEL (cont'd)
               Jack roller! Nigger! Baby fucker!

     The men scream like dying animals as Fritzie zeroes in on
     Charlie Issler. He begins punching him in the gut with the
     brass knuckles.

                          VOGEL (cont'd)
               Tell me about the Dahlia's missing days
               you whoremonger! Tell me!

                          ISSLER
               I...don't...know...anything!

                          VOGEL
               Tell me what you know!

     He punches him in the crotch.

                          ISSLER
               I knew you at Ad Vice!

     Vogel ignores him, rabbit punching him, cracking one rib and
     then another--

     ON BUCKY'S FACE

     knowing this is getting out of control. He's mesmerized by A
     FIRE ALARM on the wall behind the men...

                          VOGEL
               Tell me what your girls tell you!

     Issler retches, coughing up blood. Bucky stares at the fire
     alarm as Fritz runs through his field of vision, cackling.

     Bucky refocuses on the scene as Fritzie returns, wheeling the
     sheet-covered table Bucky'd seen before. He whips off the
     sheet revealing:

     A NAKED FEMALE CORPSE, CUT IN TWO AND MADE UP TO LOOK LIKE
     THE DAHLIA.

     Vogel grabs Issler by the scruff of the neck and jerks him
     down off of the meathook.

                          VOGEL (cont'd)
               For your cutting pleasure, Jane Doe
               number forty-three. You're all going to
               slice her, and the best slicer buys the
               ticket!

     Issler bites through his lip as Fritzie pulls out a
     switchblade and pops it open.

     Bucky takes in the nightmare scene all in slow-motion, the
     men with their broken wrists, the pudgy naked corpse, Fritzie
     with the knife...

     He runs for the fire alarm and pulls the lever, a piercing
     bell ringing out as Bucky runs out of the warehouse and jumps
     into the drunk wagon, tearing off into the night.

     INT. KAY AND LEE'S HOUSE - NIGHT

     Kay answers the door and finds Bucky sitting on the front
     porch, sobbing.

     She moves to him, touching him on the back of the neck, the
     stroke of her finger enough to make him stand and face her.

     INT. THE BEDROOM - LATER

     Bucky tries to talk but she puts fingers to his mouth. Mouth
     to his fingers. She undresses him. Slowly she touches him,
     easing him, bringing him back to earth, back to humanity. To
     her.

     And finally they are joined.

                                                            CUT TO:

     Patrol, Swingwatch. Central Station..."

     EXT. SKID ROW - EVENING

     Bucky picks his way through passed-out drunks and bums. He's
     back in uniform.

                          VOICE OVER
               East 5th Street from Main to Stanford.
               Blood banks, liquor stores selling half
               pints and short dogs exclusively, fifty-
               cent-a-night flophouses and derelict
               missions...

     DOWN THE STREET

     two officers brutally herd winos into a drunk wagon. Bucky
     turns and walks the other direction, refusing to help. They
     see him and sneer.

                          VOICE OVER
               Banished by Ellis Loew, who dared me to
               try my word against a twenty-two year man
               and the city's future District Attorney.
               I confined the truth to Russ and Kay, and
               determined to spend my shifts trying to
               be the worst foot hack in history.

     He hands a quarter to a drunk as he passes, urging him with
     his nightstick to crawl back into a bar.

     INT. EL NIDO - ROOM 204 - NIGHT

     Russ Millard pores over a file in their private collection.
     Bucky sits with his feet up on the bed, flipping through a
     folder...

                          VOICE OVER
               A month passed. The Dahlia leads dwindled
               to zero and every officer except Russ and
               Harry were returned to their regular
               assignments. As for me, I'd been able to
               contain my Dahlia interests within the
               walls of the El Nido.

     Bucky eyes a Dahlia photo pinned to the wall.

                          VOICE OVER (cont'd)
               Still, I remembered what Madeleine said
               when I told her we were through...

     INT. THE RED ARROW MOTEL - NIGHT

     Madeleine sits on the bed fully dressed. Bucky stands in the
     doorway.

                          MADELEINE
               You'll be back. (beat) I look like her.

     Bucky turns and leaves as we

                                                            CUT TO:

     INT. KAY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

     where Kay and Bucky sleep in bed, locked as spoons. Safe.

                          VOICE OVER
               But sometimes Betty came to me...

     INT. THE MEAT WAREHOUSE - NIGHT - A DREAM

     Bucky watches Fritz Vogel beats the hell out of Charles
     Issler as he hangs off the meathook. In the background, Betty
     Short stands and screams:

                          BETTY SHORT
               Bucky! No! Stop him!
                   (crying)
               I'll do whatever you want...

                          ISSLER
               I'll be okay....Liz...

     Bucky turns and stares at her.

     CLOSE ON BUCKY'S BLAZING EYES

                          MILLARD (VO)
               Bucky. What is it?

     INT. THE EL NIDO - SAME

     as Bucky stares across the room at a picture of the Dahlia.
     Millard sits at the small desk, waiting for him to come back.

                          RUSS MILLARD
               Bucky.

     Bucky finally sees Russ again.

                          BUCKY
               You ever hear anyone refer to Betty as
               Liz? Anyone at all?

                          RUSS MILLARD
               Nope.

                          BUCKY
               Issler did.

                          RUSS MILLARD
               The pimp? I thought he said he'd never
               heard of her.

                          BUCKY
               You know what else he said?

     A FLASHBACK - THE WAREHOUSE

     As Vogel cracks Issler's ribs.

                          VOGEL
               What did you know about the Dahlia's
               missing days?

                          ISSLER
               I knew you at Ad Vice--

     INT. THE POLICE STATION - NIGHT

     Harry Sears cradles the phone in his ear as he flips through
     a large metal file cabinet. Behind him the glass door reads
     in reverse: "ADMINISTRATIVE VICE'.

                          HARRY SEARS (INTO PHONE)
               N-n-no, Russ. No file on Issler. Gone.

     BACK AT THE EL NIDO - SAME

     Bucky and Russ sit in silence, thinking. They know they're
     onto something...

                          BUCKY
               Fritzie didn't give a damn about those
               other three. It was all about Issler.
               Never occurred to me before.

     Bucky gets to his feet.

                          BUCKY (cont'd)
               Meet me back here. Late.

                          RUSS MILLARD
               Bright penny--

     But Bucky's already out the door.

     EXT. FRITZ VOGEL'S HOUSE - NIGHT

     Bucky stakes out the dark house.

     EXT. VOGEL'S SERVICE PORCH - LATER

     Bucky slips an oil dipstick into the narrow crack of the back
     door and flips the simple hook and eyehole lock. He slides
     into the house...

     INT. FRITZ VOGEL'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

     as Bucky creeps through the house until he gets to a closed
     door. He opens it, entering

     FRITZIE'S STUDY

     He stumbles along the wall until he finds a standing
     gooseneck lamp and turns it on. The walls are covered with
     pictures of Fritzie in uniform, dating back twenty-five
     years.

     Bucky bends down in front of the small mahogany desk and
     begins rifling through its file drawers. What he finds
     surprises him:

     --carbons of official LAPD intelligence reports, lists of
     account balances, financial dealings, payments made--all 
     cross-referenced to each individual being investigated.

     A veritable how-to primer on how to extort from criminals..

     Bucky digs deeper into the files and pulls out:

     ISSLER'S AD VICE FILE complete with mug shots.

                          BUCKY
               Hello, Charlie. Get lost?

     Bucky scans the file, running his finger down the list of
     names, looking for something familiar. He stops at one:
     "SALLY STINSON". Beside her name a handwritten note:
     "Biltmore Hotel".

     He writes it down and moves to another list of names: "Known 
     Associates, no Prostitution Record".

     And there it is: "Betty Short".

     INT. BUCKY'S CAR - LATER

     Bucky bops to jazz on his radio, pumped with adrenaline.

     INT. THE EL NIDO - NIGHT

     Bucky tears through a file as Russ watches.

                          RUSS MILLARD
               So good ol' Fritzie's shaking down
               crooks, maybe sellin' 'em tip-offs before
               a roust.

                          BUCKY
               I want him nailed.

                          RUSS MILLARD
               Easy, penny. They'd have to testify
               against him first. And that's not likely
               after he burns those carbons. But this
               Issler business--why hide the Issler-
               Betty connection?

                          BUCKY
                   (finding a file)
               Maybe Charlie pimped her out...to
               somebody Fritzie doesn't want us to know
               about...

     A FLASHBACK - THE WAREHOUSE

     as Fritz beats on Charlie--

                          FRITZIE
               Tell me what you know about the Dahlia's
               missing days--

     BACK TO THE EL NIDO

     Bucky reads through a letter.

                          BUCKY
               I knew it. Here. Betty writes to one of
               her phantom servicemen boyfriends:
                   (reading aloud)
               "...had drinks with a great girl, Sally
               Stinson, who thinks she way be able to
               help me get a job cocktailing..."

                          RUSS MILLARD
               Cocktailing.

                          BUCKY
               Yeah, I know. That's what made it stick
               with me...What next, padre?

                          RUSS MILLARD
               You sit tight. Go hack to swingwatch. Me
               and Harry'll poke around.

                          BUCKY
                   (displeased)
               I want him.

                          RUSS MILLARD
               You'll get him, too. But you've got to
               cool your temper. It's all patience with
               the big fish or they wriggle off.

     INT. KAY'S BEDROOM - LATE NIGHT

     Bucky lies awake while Kay sleeps.

                          VOICE OVER
               What kept me up that night wasn't the
               idea of Fritz Vogel extorting criminals,
               or Fritz Vogel bracing Charlie the pimp
               to see if Betty had told him something
               about one of her johns...maybe even
               Vogel, himself...No...

     A FLASHBACK - FRITZ VOGEL'S HOUSE

     Ellis Loew, Fritz Vogel and Bucky drink cocktails and eat
     pretzels...

                          VOICE OVER
               ...what kept me up was this thought: if
               Issler blabbed about Liz and her tricks I
               would have overheard. Fritz was confident
               he could keep me quiet.

     Ellis and Fritz clink glasses...Smile at Bucky.

                          VOICE OVER (cont'd)
               And that was an underestimation I would
               bleed him for.

     BACK IN KAY'S BED

     Her hand brushes against his cheek. He reaches for it.

     OVER THIS SCENE WE HEAR A PHONE RING AND THE FOLLOWING
     EXCHANGE.

                          BUCKY (VO)
               Hello?

                          RUSS MILLARD
               We've found her. Meet me at 1546 North
               Havenhurst in half an hour.

     INT. THE POLICE STATION - SAME

     As Bucky hangs up the phone. Trying to look casual he sidles
     over to a desk with FRITZ VOGEL on the name plate and snags a
     photo of Fritz and Johnny off the desk...

     INT. SALLY STINSON'S APARTMENT - DAY

     A worn woman in her early thirties (SALLY STINSON) sits on a
     stack of luggage, Russ and Bucky in chairs. She wears a cheap
     kimono and too much makeup for the middle of the day.

     She holds the photo of the Vogels. Shakes out her hair and
     closes her kimono a little.

                          SALLY
               I do a lot a cops, you know. Comes with
               the territory. Charlie used to say it was
               my union dues. Keep my operator's license.

     She laughs a little, trying to loosen herself up.

                          BUCK
               Ma'am. Please get to it.

                          SALLY
               Anyway. It was a full-day job. C-Note and
               a half. Kept talkin' about givin' me "The
               Big Schnitzel"...more like a cocktail
               frank once we got down to it...Well, we
               screw the whole afternoon...Go down to
               the lobby for some dinner and there's
               Liz, sittin' by herself.

                          BUCKY
               You'd hooked with her before?

                          SALLY
               Three or four times. Conventioneers. And
               lemme tell you something, I'm pretty good
               at faking it. But Liz, she was good. A
               virtuoso, Academy Award kind of stuff--

                          BUCKY
               --She do dyke?

                          RUSS MILLARD
               Bucky--

                          SALLY
               No. Nothing like that.

                          BUCKY
               Any porn?

                          SALLY
               No. But I bet she'd be gooood...

                          RUSS MILLARD
               Ma'am.

                          SALLY (cont'd)
               Anyway, we all get to talking...Schnitzel
               takes a liking to her and Liz tells me
               she needs the dough. So I set up a trick
               within a trick...I take a breather and
               they go at it in the bedroom. A couple
               hours later Liz left.

                          BUCKY
               Did anything unusual happen?

     Sally thinks...

                          SALLY
               I think it got a little kinky. He'd
               brought a couple toys...He may
               have...whipped her a bit.

     Russ and Bucky glance at each other, remembering lashmarks at
     the autopsy.

                          BUCKY
               Did Vogel say anything about Liz? Was he
               gonna see her again? Anything?

                          SALLY
               He said...she liked the Big Schnitzel.

                          RUSS MILLARD
               Anything else, Miss Stinson?

     Her face clouds over.

                          SALLY
               Two days...after...Liz got in all the
               papers...

     She has a hard time going on.

                          BUCKY
                   (helping her out)
               Is this when your pimp Charlie confesses?

                          SALLY
                   (composing herself)
               Yeah. Bad habit. Anyways, Fritzie V.
               shows up and shakes me hard about
               Charlie, whether he'd say anything about
               Liz to the caps. Beat me bad. Real bad.

     She lifts her head. Taps her nails on the suitcases
     underneath her.

                          BUCKY
               One last time to be sure.
                   (pointing to Fritzie's picture)
               You are sure this is the man that you
               tricked with? And tricked with Liz Short?

     A puzzled look covers her face.

                          SALLY
               No mister you got it all wrong.

                          BUCKY
               But you said--

                          SALLY
               Fritz just beat me. It was Sonny me and
               Liz did. Sonny.

     She taps her finger on John Vogel's face.

                          SALLY (cont'd)
               I'd recognize that lousy fuck anywhere.

     Off Bucky and Russ' shock we

     EXT./INT. RUSS MILLARD'S CAR - LATER

     as they cruise the streets of skid row. While Russ talks
     Bucky fills a HYPODERMIC NEEDLE with an amber liquid...

                          RUSS MILLARD
               I'll be a chimp's priest, Buck. A chimp's
               priest--watch the air bubbles--I shoulda
               known that Johnny I d need a pro to lose
               his cherry...Never had 'em for a kink and
               a cherry, though...

     Bucky points out the window.

                          BUCKY
               There.

     OUTSIDE ON THE SIDEWALK

     Johnny Vogel wrestles with two drunks, kicking at them as
     they scamper into some trash.

                          BUCKY
                   (exiting the car)
               Johnny--

     Johnny ambles over to Bucky.

                          JOHNNY VOGEL
               Whatcha doin' in civvies, Bleichert?

     Bucky drills him in the solar plexus, doubling him over. He
     grabs Vogel by the hair and slams his head into the roof of
     the car as Johnny's lights dIm...

     INT. THE EL NIDO - DAY

     Johnny Vogel handcuffed to a radiator, his head bobbing back
     and forth. His eyes trying to focus on Russ and Bucky.

                          RUSS MILLARD
               Pentothal's good for another couple
               hours. No way he can lie.

     Johnny's eyes drift to the pictures on the walls.

                          BUCKY
               Elizabeth Short, shitbird. Elizabeth
               fucking Short!

     Russ touches Bucky's arm, urging him to sit back.

                          RUSS MILLARD
               There's a method to this, Bucky.
                   (focusing on Johnny)
               What's your name, son?

                          JOHNNY

                          RUSS MILLARD
               Answer me anyway.

                          JOHNNY
               Vogel, John G.

                          RUSS MILLARD
               What's sixteen and fifty-two?

                          JOHNNY
               Uhmmm. Sixty-eight. Why'd you hit me
               Bleichert? I didn't do you no dirt.

                          RUSS MILLARD
               Focus on January, Johnny. Your father--

                          JOHNNY
               Friedrich Vogel. Fritzie.

                          RUSS MILLARD
               Yes. Fritzie. He wanted you to lose your
               cherry. He bought you a woman for two
               days. Is that right?

                          JOHNNY
               Not a woman. Not a real one. A hoooer.

     Johnny turns the syllable into a long laugh.

                          RUSS MILLARD
               This was at the Biltmore?

                          JOHNNY
               Daddy got a good rate on the room. He
               knew the house dick...This ain't right...

                          RUSS MILLARD
               We'll be done soon, Johnny. You met Liz
               Short at the Biltmore, too?

                          JOHNNY
               What's her name introduced me...the
               hooer.

                          RUSS MILLARD
               And what did you and Liz do?

                          JOHNNY
               We...played horse and rider. Gave her the
               Big Schnitz.

                          RUSS MILLARD
               Did you whip her?

     Johnny thinks back, his head lolling to and fro...

                          JOHNNY
               Softly. So so softly. Horse and Rider.

                          RUSS MILLARD
               Johnny. Did you kill Liz Short?

     Johnny jerks back spasmodically.

                          JOHNNY
               No no no no! I didn't kill her!

                          RUSS MILLARD
               Easy son--

                          JOHNNY
               I didn't slice her!

                          RUSS MILLARD
               It's all right...Do you know who did?
                          JOHNNY
               No! No!

     Johnny's starting to sweat. Russ and Bucky lean in...

                          RUSS MILLARD
               When your Daddy found out you'd been with
               her, he tried to fix things didn't he?

     Johnny nods yes.

                          RUSS MILLARD (cont'd)
               He found out Charlie Issler had been
               picked up and he knew Charlie had this
               confessing problem, right?

                          JOHNNY
               Daddy...went to Ellis...to the Jewboy.
               Wanted to get Charlie released...but the
               Jewboy said no...Daddy had a morgue
               friend owed him a favor and got this DOA
               cooze...Daddy wanted Uncle Bill but Ellis
               Jewboy said take Bleichert.
                   (looking right at Bucky)
               Daddy said you'd do it cuz without
               Blanchard you were jelly. Said you were a
               sob sister, weak sister...

     Johnny starts laughing hysterically, shaking his chained hands
     like a zoo animal trying to get loose. Russ steps in front of
     a red-hot Bucky--

                          RUSS MILLARD
                   (to Bucky)
               I think you should go outside.

     EXT. THE FIRE ESCAPE - LATER

     Bucky sits out on the fire escape watching cars drive by.
     Russ leans out the window and hands Bucky the statement.

                          RUSS MILLARD
               His statement. Signed.

     Bucky reads it and slips it into his pocket.

                          RUSS MILLARD
               We should sit on this for a little bit.
               Until I can talk to a legal officer.

     Bucky shakes his head no, climbs back inside the window.

     INT. THE HOTEL ROOM - DAY

     Bucky handcuffs Johnny's hands behind his back as the big man
     cries...

                          JOHNNY
               Daddy...

                          RUSS MILLARD
                   (to Bucky)
               It's the shithouse until you retire, you
               know that.

                          BUCKY
               I owe her this one.

     He squeezes Johnny's handcuffs tighter.

     INT. HOLLYWOOD STATION - BOOKING - NIGHT

     Reporters follow Bucky and Johnny inside, piqued by the sight
     of a plainclothes officer escorting a cuffed uniform inside.

                          BUCKY
               No comment...No comment...
                   (whispering in Johnny's ear)
               Tell your Daddy I know everything.
               Including his extortion deal. Tell him
               I'm goin' to the papers tomorrow.

     He approaches the desk sergeant.

                          DESK SERGEANT
               What the hell is this?

     A flashbulb goes off in their faces. Johnny sobs.

                          BUCKY
               I'm Officer Dwight Bleichert and this is
               Officer John Vogel.

     He hands over Johnny's signed statement.

                          BUCKY (cont'd)
               Book him.

     Another flashbulb.

     EXT. CENTRAL STATION - LATER

     Bucky jogs up the steps inside.

     INT. THE LOCKER ROOM - LATER

     He dresses in his blue uniform, preparing to go back to work.

                          INTERCOM
               Officer Bleichert, go to the watch
               commander's office immediately.

     Bucky brushes imaginary dust off his shirt and grabs his hat.

     INT. LIEUTENANT JASTROW'S OFFICE - SOON AFTER

     Bucky walks in, saluting like an idealistic rookie. Jastrow
     stands, ignoring the salute.

                          JASTROW
               You're on two weeks vacation leave as of
               now. When you return to duty, report to
               Chief Green. He'll reassign you to
               another division.

                          BUCKY
               Why?

                          JASTROW
               Fritz Vogel just blew his brains out.
               That's why.

     All Bucky can think to do is salute again, rock firm. He
     walks outside and crosses into

     INT. THE MUSTER ROOM - CONTINUOUS

     Crammed with blues awaiting roll call. They all stare at
     Bucky; he meets the eyes that seek his, making them look
     down. Defiant.

     As he passes he can hear the hisses: "Traitor". "Bolshevik".
     He continues towards the door, almost out when suddenly he
     hears applause.

     Bucky turns to see,Russ Millard, Harry Sears and Thad Green
     clapping good-bye...

     INT. THE CASTING OFFICE - DAY

     Clapstick: "Elizabeth Short Screen Test #4"

     She sits on an ugly brown sofa, sides in her hands. Silence.

                          MAN #4 (O.S.)
               Are you all right, Miss Short?

     She looks up, seeing the camera as if for the first time.

                          MAN #4 (cont'd)
               Why don't you just...talk.

                          ELIZABETH SHORT
               What do you mean?

                          MAN #4
               Put the sides down. Just...talk to me.

                          ELIZABETH SHORT
               What would you like to talk about?

                          MAN #4
               I don't know...Anything...Do you have a
               boyfriend?

     FADE OUT

     EXT. THE SANTA MONICA PIER - NIGHT

     Kay and Bucky sit on a bench, looking out at the water.

                          KAY
               I could take sick days. Maybe a trip to
               Santa Barbara, or even a drive to San
               Francisco...

                          BUCKY
               Kay.

                          FAY
               You don't owe him a thing, Bucky. I know
               you won't believe me. But you've more
               than repaid him already.

     He looks at her and she knows it's useless.

                          KAY (cont'd)
               When?

                          BUCKY
               First thing.

     She takes his hand.

                          KAY
               You're a fool, Dwight.

     EXT. THE SAN DIEGO FREEWAY - LATE MORNING

     as Bucky crosses the border into Mexico.

                          VOICE OVER
               I closed out my glory days the only way I
               knew how--I chased the gone man.

     EXT. TIJUANA STREETS - VARIOUS SHOTS - DAY

     Bucky hands out pennies and nickels to locals, flashing both
     his badge and snapshots of Lee.

                                                            CUT TO:

     BUCKY AND AN ENTOURAGE OF TRAILING LOCALS

     as Bucky tries to shake them, pulling out his pockets to show
     them he has no more coins.

                                                            CUT TO:

     BUCKY QUESTIONING TIJUANA COPS

     graduating from small change to one dollar bills. Same of
     them seem to have stories to tell.

                          VOICE OVER
               I got headshakes, bullshit broadsides and
               a strange series of tales that rang true.
               One had "el blanco explosivo" beating the
               shit out of three jack rollers, then
               buying off the cops with double-saws
               peeled from a large roll.
               Another had Lee donating 200 scoots to a
               leper ministry priest and then driving to
               Ensenada.

     EXT - THE COASTAL ROAD - LATE AFTERNOON

     as Bucky drives South, passing a sign which says "ENSENADA
     60 MI."

     He passes a cluster of families walking on the side of the
     road. They carry suitcases and head North.

     EXT. THE COAST ROAD - NEAR ENSENADA

     Bucky approaches Ensenada. The trickle of families headed
     north has now becoming a roadside migration march. Every
     fifth of sixth marcher carries a torch or lantern.

     EXT. THE CITY LIMITS OF ENSENADA - NIGHT

     Bucky cruises slowly into town and the most blatant shakedown
     he's ever seen:

     Rurales in brownshirts walk from peasant to peasant in the
     northbound migration line, taking money and attaching tags to
     their shoulders with staple guns; plainclothes cops sell bags
     of beef jerky and dried fruit, putting coins into dispensers
     attached to their belts.

     Two Rurales pull a man out of line and beat him senseless
     with the butts of their sawed-off shotguns.

                          VOICE OVER
               I decided it would be wise to check in
               with the law before going out to question
               the Ensenada citizenry.

     EXT. THE ENSENADA POLICE STATION - NIGHT

     Bucky stands outside a converted church with the word POLICIA
     painted in black over religious scenes.

     INT. THE POLICE STATION - NIGHT

     Velvet wall hangings depicting Jesus decorate the entrance
     hall. Blackshirts lounge on converted pews, a huge carved
     cross on the front desk betrays its altar origins.

     Bucky slides the Rurale at the desk his badge and a dollar.
     The man saunters off down the hall.

     INT. THE POLICE CHIEF'S OFFICE - MINUTES LATER

     as Bucky is escorted in. The man sitting behind the desk
     looks up. In flawless English:

                          CAPTAIN VASQUEZ
               Officer Bleichert. Come in, please. I'm
               Captain Vasquez. How can I help you?

     Bucky exchanges his badge for a photo of Lee.

                          BUCKY
               This man's LAPD. He's been missing in
               Mexico since January. He was last seen
               headed here.

     Vasquez studies the photo. Bucky senses a twitch...

                          CAPTAIN VASQUEZ
               No. I'm afraid not. I'll ask my men,
               however. Staying the night?

                          BUCKY
               At least.

                          VASQUEZ
               Are you here alone?

                          BUCKY
               I have two partners waiting for me in
               Tijuana.

     Vasquez nods, hard to know if he believes Bucky any more than
     Bucky believes him.

                          BUCKY (cont'd)
               If you don't mind I'll check back in the
               morning.

                          CAPTAIN VASQUEZ
               Please.

                                                            CUT TO:

     INT. A FLEABAG MOTEL ROOM - LATER

     Bucky squeezes a bit of brown water onto a handkerchief and
     wipes his brow off. He kicks his travel bag underneath the
     bed and heads out.

     EXT. THE HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

     as Bucky pulls two hairs from his head and spit-glues them to
     the door jamb.

     EXT. THE ENSENADA STREETS - NIGHT

     Garish neon, military personnel. Brownshirts packing serious
     weapons keeping the mostly white street crowd in order.

     HIS POV: An adobe streetfront with a neon sign: "CLUB BOXEO".
     Bucky goes inside.

     INT. THE CLUB BOXEO - CONTINUOUS

     Bucky finds a brightly lit room filled with sailors and half-
     dressed Mexican strippers. He stands on his tip-toes trying
     to see over the crowd to find somebody with the air of
     proprietor.

     Cn a far wall: boxing publicity stills. He wanders over.

     CLOSE ON THE WALL OF STILLS:

     A row of light-heavies: Gus Lesnevich, Billy Conn, and Bucky. 
     Three stills over, next to Joe Louis, is Lee's photo. They
     all look so young...So good...

     An old voice in English breaks his reverie:

                          OLD MAN
               Bleichert? Jesus. First Blanchard, then
               you. Who's next? Willie Pep?

     Bucky wheels and finds himself face to face with an old man.

                          BUCKY
               Blanchard? You've seen him? When?

                          OLD MAN
               Couple months ago. Heavy rains in
               February. Musta talked fights for ten
               hours straight. You know Blanchard thinks
               the feathers are the best division? me,
               it's the middies for sure. La Motta,
               Graziano--

                          BUCKY
               Is he still in town?

                          OLD MAN
               Don't think so. I own this place. He
               ain't been back. You lookin' for a
               rematch?

                          BUCKY
               I'm looking to get him out of a shitload
               of trouble.

     The old pug looks him up and down.

                          OLD MAN
               Well. I'll tell ya the little I know.
               Heard he caused a ruckus over at the Club
               Satan, had to bribe his way out big with
               Captain Vasquez. Talk to Ernie the cook.
               Tell him I said to be kosher with you.

                          BUCKY
               Thank you.

                          OLD MAN
               You ain't been in there.

     INT. CLUB SATAN - LATER

     Bucky walks into the biggest sewer you have ever seen. The
     bar is a urinal trough where marines and sailors masturbate
     while going down on nude women squatting on the bartop. Blow
     jobs are being dispensed underneath tables facing the
     bandstand.

     Up on the stage a man in a Satan costume is fucking a woman
     on a mattress. Next to him, a donkey with red velvet horns
     pinned to his head eats hay out of a bowl while drunken
     servicemen shout "Donkey! Donkey!"

     Bucky is accosted by a disgusting old woman.

                          OLD WOMAN
               You wan' the bar, handsome? Breakfast of
               champions, one dollar. Round the world,
               two dollars.

                          BUCKY
               Ernie. I need to see Ernie.

                          OLD WOMAN
               Vamanos!

     And grabs him by the arm...

     INT. THE KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

     ERNIE, a half-Mexican half-Chinese man, stands next to a huge
     vat of stew. Bucky flashes Lee's photo.

                          BUCKY
               I heard this man gave you some trouble a
               while back.

                          ERNIE
               Who wants to know?

     Bucky flashes his badge, giving him a glimpse of his gun.

                          ERNIE
               You his friend?

                          BUCKY
               He's my best friend.

     The chef tucks his hands into his aprons, fidgeting.

                          ERNIE
               Your friend drink fourteen shots of my
               best Mescal, a house record. That I like.
               He make toasts to dead women. That I don't
               mind. But he try to fuck with my donkey
               show, and that I don't take.

                          BUCKY
               What happened?

                          ERNIE
               Four of my guys he take, the fifth he
               don't. Rurales take him home to sleep it
               off.

                          BUCKY
               That's it?

     Ernie casually pulls a switchblade out of his apron and
     scratches the back of his neck with it.

                          ERNIE
               Finito.

     EXT. THE CLUB SATAN - LATER

     Bucky walks outside and begins weaving his way back through
     the crowds. Out of the corner of his eye he catches a couple
     Rurales who seem to have taken an interest in him.

     He dodges down an alley and cuts down another street,
     breaking into a slow jog.

     EXT. ANOTHER STREET - SECONDS LATER

     Bucky walks backwards, checking the crowd. He's lost them.

     INT. THE FLEABAG MOTEL - LATER

     Bucky stands in front of his door. He runs his finger up and
     down the door jamb. The hairs are gone.

     With one swift kick he breaks down the door.

     INT. THE MOTEL ROOM - SECONDS LATER

     A white man stands with his hands raised.

                          MAN
               Whoa, Bleichert. I'm a friend--

     Bucky gestures with his gun for the man to hit the wall. He
     frisks him, pulling out a wallet and tossing on the bed.

                          MAN (cont'd)
               Milton Dolphine, citizen of San Diego and
               a licensed private dick. I got seventy
               bucks in there but that money's jackshit
               compared to what Blanchard was holding.
               You go partners with me and it's easy
               street--

     Bucky kicks the man's legs out and pushes his to the floor.

                          BUCKY
               You tell me all of it and you watch what
               you say about my partner, or it's a B&E
               roust and the Ensenada jail.

     Dolphine pulls himself up.

                          DOLPHINE
               You mean Vasquez? How do you think I knew
               to follow you? He's got a vested interest
               in you not finding out about Blanchard.

     Bucky eyes the door.

                          BUCKY
               Does he know I'm staying here?

                          DOLPHINE
               No.

     Bucky steps back from Dolphine.

                          BUCKY
               So. Let's hear it.

                          DOLPHINE
               About a month ago this Mexican woman
               shows up at my office in Dago. Chubby,
               ten tons a makeup, but dressed to the
               nines. Offers me five hundred to find
               Blanchard. Just like you I track him here
               where he's playing the rich gringo--

     A FLASHBACK - LEE TEARING UP AN ENSENADA BAR

                          DOLPHINE
               I even see him beat up two spics who
               insult this Senorita--Rurales stand by
               and do nothing. So I know he's paying
               protection dough. A lot of it. Then  I
               hear he paid off two plainclothes Rurale
               to snuff a coupla guys in TJ--

     A FLASHBACK - BOBBY DE WITT AND FELIX CASCO BLOWN AWAY...

                          DOLPHINE
               I leave a message in Dago for the woman
               tellin' her what I know...

                          BUCKY
               What's her name?

                          DOLPHINE
               Delores Garcia. But it was obviously a
               phony. Casco ran with some rich bimbos
               and I'm betting she's one of his. Revenge
               on Blanchard for offin' Felix.

     Bucky tightens his grip on the slats of a wooden chair. This
     is hitting him hard.

                          BUCKY
               Go on.

                          DOLPHINE
               I come back to Ensenada on my own,
               thinking about all that cash he was
               flashing.

     Bucky's jaw clenches.

                          DOLPHINE (cont'd)
               You wanna hear this?

                          BUCKY
               Go on.

                          DOLPHINE
               Blanchard's dead. Bullet in the cabeza.
               (beat) Rumor is they never found any
               money.

     Bucky's head begins to reel...

                          DOLPHINE (cont'd)
               Maybe the Rurales. Maybe that woman or
               friends of hers. Who knows? I figured
               Blanchard was rogue, figured someone like
               you'd come lookin' for him. Maybe have a
               line on where the cash was. You knew
               Blanchard, maybe we can--

     Bucky backhands Dolphine hard, knocking him off the chair.

                          DOLPHINE (cont'd)
               Look I didn't know it was personal! Don't
               hit me again--

     Bucky has his gun out, leveled at Dolphine.

                          BUCKY
               Prove it to me. Prove it!

     EXT. THE BACKROADS OF ENSENADA - NIGHT

     Dolphine drives his car while Bucky trains his gun on him.

     They come over a ridge and find themselves on a big bluff
     overlooking the ocean. A HUGE WOODEN BURNING CROSS marks the
     spot.

                          DOLPHINE
               The locals keep the damn thing lit up.
               They got a lotta missing relatives.

                          BUCKY
               You got a shovel?

                          DOLPHINE
               Gardening tools--

                          BUCKY
               Good enough.

     EXT. THE BLUFF - LATER

     Bucky scavenges a spare piece of picket fence, wraps it in a
     rag and lights a torch off of the cross. Dolphine kicks at a
     filthy American flag in the sand.

                          DOLPHINE
               Here. Supposed to be near el bannero.

                                                            CUT TO:

     A SMALL SHOVEL PUSHING INTO THE GROUND

     as Dolphine digs at gun point. After a few strokes the crunch
     of the shovel hitting bone.

     Bucky terrified to look but has to know--

     --a white jumper--

                          DOLPHINE
               Sailor's uniform. It's a sailor...

     Bucky breathes out hard. Unbearable. Dolphine digs on,
     pushing the corpse out of the way and digging further into he
     sand.

     Bucky can't stand the suspense. He tucks his gun into his
     waistband and grabs the shovel. After a few more strokes the
     thump of something solid.

     And suddenly it's there--sunburned pink skin, blond hair and
     stitch scars on the eyebrows.

     Lee Blanchard. Lee Blanchard. Lee Blanchard.

     And Bucky's in Dolphine's truck while Dolphine's screaming
     for him to wait and Bucky slams the truck in reverse,
     knocking the burning cross to the ground and grinding out out
     of the sand onto the road, heading north and leaving Dolphine
     and Lee alone at the grave...Heading north like a refugee...

     EXT. KAY'S HOUSE - DAWN

     Bucky's car rolls up slowly as he kills the engine, trying
     not to make any noise.

     The sun comes up, illuminating Bucky's filthy face as he
     watches the picture-perfect house, wishing time would stand
     still. Or better yet, wishing it would go back...

     Finally he gets out of the car and begins a long walk into
     the house.

                                                       DISSOLVE TO:

     A LAPD CHAPLAIN READING SOLEMNLY FROM A BIBLE

     But as the camera PULLS BACK we see Bucky in his dress blues
     standing next to Kay in a wedding dress.

     EXT. THE BACKYARD OF KAY'S HOUSE

     Russ Millard and Harry Sears stand by as the only two guests.

                          VOICE OVER
               Lee and Kay had lived in sin; not because
               their shack job was against department
               regs, but because the ghosts of their
               past had forced them to choose between
               love and passion, the veneer of a "fairy
               tale" only a band-aid for a fractured
               life.

                                                       DISSOLVE TO:

     LEE AND KAY DANCING TOGETHER

     as Harry and Russ drink from a punch bowl...

                          VOICE OVER
               Our true vows were made in private; bury
               the past, bury our ghosts, and as Kay
               said, "bury that fucking girl"...

     ANOTHER LAPD TRANSFER FORM: "Officer Dwight
     Bleichert...Reassigned to: Scientific investigation
     Detail"

     INT. THE LAPD SCIENCE LAB - DAY

     Bucky with plastic gloves on typing blood with an eye dropper
     and a test tube. Meticulous and boring.

     News radio plays in the background...

     A Detective pokes his head in:

                          DETECTIVE
               Bleichert? You got those prints for me?

     Bucky pulls a file out of a stack and gives it to him. The
     nonchalance of a man whose job has become routine.

                          DETECTIVE (cont'd)
               Thanks. We gotta hot one I think.

     Bucky smiles politely and returns to his desk. The radio:

                          ANNOUNCER
               ...results in the 1948 Republican primary
               are final...John Dougdale trouncing D.A.
               Ellis Loew 64% to 36%...In county
               primaries...

     This gets a smile from Bucky as he returns to his test tubes
     and beakers.

     INT. AN APARTMENT - CRIME SCENE - DAY

     Detectives comb through a murder scene as Bucky collects
     latent fingerprints off doorknobs. No one pays him any
     attention. He's been relegated to the worst kind of
     purgatory.

     INT. THE KITCHEN - MORNING

     Bucky and Kay drink coffee and read the morning paper. She
     absently strokes his free hand.

     Bucky intently reads the front page.

     The headline reads: "CITY COUNCIL INVESTIGATES '20s BOOM
     BARONS FOR SHODDY HOME CONSTRUCTION".

     Underneath, a picture of Sprague and Mack Sennett posing in
     front of the HOLLYWOODLAND sign.

     He's startled by Kay tapping her finger on the photo.

                          KAY
               That reminds me of something, Dwight.

     Bucky tries to hide his panic.

                          BUCKY
               What?

                          KAY
               Floorboard's loose near the closet. Think
               you could fix it?

                          BUCKY
                   (relieved)
               Sure, babe.

     The phone rings. Bucky answers it.

                          BUCKY (cont'd)
               Hello...Hey Vic...

     Bucky writes something on a piece of paper. Hangs up.

                          BUCKY (cont'd)
               Gotta go. Work-up on a probable gunshot
               suicide.

                          KAY
               Sounds lovely. Where is it?

                          BUCKY
               Hancock Park.

     EXT. A COLONIAL MANSION - JUNE STREET - MORNING

     Bucky rings the bell. He's dressed plainclothes and carries a 
     technician's canvas bag.

     An attractive woman in her early fifties opens the door.

                          WOMAN
               Yes?

                          BUCKY
               I'm Officer Bleichert. LAPD. My I express
               my condolences, Mrs.--

                          WOMAN
               Jane Chambers. Condolences accepted.
               You're the lab man?

     He nods yes. She lets him in and he follows.

                          JANE CHAMBERS
               It's the study in back of the dining
               room. You'll see the police rope. If
               you'll excuse me, I'll be in my garden.

     He notices for the first time she's dressed for gardening.

     INT. THE STUDY - MORNING

     Bucky steps over the police rope and into the study. A large
     desk chair lies overturned an the ground next to A TAPE
     OUTLINE OF A BODY. Three feet away lies A SHOTGUN.

     Behind the chair the brown spattering of blood and brains
     decorates the white wall and crown mouldings.

                                                            CUT TO:

     A SERIES OF SHOTS

     as Bucky measures the splatter marks on the walls, scrapes
     tissue from the muzzle of the gun, dusts it for latent
     prints, etc. At the end he wraps the gun in a plastic bag.

     INT. THE HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

     as Bucky steps over the police rope and walks back towards
     the main foyer. He stops short.

     ON THE OPPOSING WALL

     hangs a disturbing PAINTING: the portrait of a clown, a young
     boy done up in court jester's garb. His body is gnarled and 
     hunched. He wears a stuporous ear-to-ear smile that looks
     like one continuous deep scar.

     It is eerily reminiscent of Elizabeth Short's death wound.

     Spooked, Bucky pulls his eyes away and settles them on nearby
     family photos--two young women linked arm in arm.

                          JANE CHAMBERS
               The other survivors. Pretty aren't they?

     She arrives next to him, dusty with soil.

                          BUCKY
               Like their mother. How old are they?

                          JANE CHAMBERS
               Twenty-one and twenty-three. Are you
               finished in the study?

                          BUCKY
               Yes. Tell whoever cleans it up to use
               pure ammonia...
                   (looking at the two girls)
               Mrs. Chambers--

                          JANE CHAMBERS
               Jane.

                          BUCKY
               Jane, do you know Madeleine and Martha
               Sprague? The next block over?

                          JANE CHAMBERS
                   (snorts)
               Those girls and that family. How do you
               know them?

                          BUCKY
               I did a little work for them once.

                          JANE CHAMBERS
               Consider it lucky if it was a brief
               encounter.

                          BUCKY
               How do you mean?

     The hallway phone rings. Jane moves to answer it.

                          JANE CHAMBERS
               Back to condolences. Thank you for being
               so nice, Mr.--

                          BUCKY
               Bucky. Good-bye, Jane.

                          JANE CHAMBERS
               Good-bye.

     INT. THE CRIME LAB - LATER

     Bucky writes up a report. VIC pokes his head in.

                          VIC
               You finish working up the suicide, Bucky?

                          BUCKY
               Yeah. Pretty routine. Whattya know about
               the husband?

                          VIC
               Eldridge Chambers? Widow said he was
               depressed, failing health. The terrible
               burden of all that money'll get you every
               time.

                          BUCKY
               Wonder how he made it?

                          VIC
               No mystery there. Real estate.

                          BUCKY
               Oh really?

     INT. THE GARAGE - EVENING

     The garage door is open to the evening air. Bucky's heavy bag
     and speed bag hang on hooks. Bucky leans against a stool, a
     large box open on the work bench.

     INSIDE THE BOX

     Bucky brushes aside a clutter of junk and pulls out A PHOTO
     ALBUM. He opens it and begins flipping through: articles and
     photos concerning Elizabeth Short. MOSTLY PHOTOS.

     It's like a man in a mid-life crisis fantasizing about his
     high school sweetheart.

     OFF ONE OF THE PHOTOS WE DISSOLVE TO:

     ANOTHER ELIZABETH SHORT CASTING SESSION

     "Elizabeth Short...Screen Test #5"

     She rambles on, almost oblivious of the camera.

                          ELIZABETH SHORT
               ...I had a fiance, Captain Matt Durand.
               He was in a tank battalion. A Commander.
               He had...the fiercest blue eyes. Like the
               deep water you see from a fishing boat...

     She's lost in thought...we're not sure whether this is a
     scene, her real life, or just a sad lie...

     THE NOISE OF A CAR APPROACHING

     BACK TO SCENE

     Bucky drops the album back in the box as Kay's car pulls into
     the driveway. He covers it back up.

                          KAY
                   (getting out)
               What're you doing?

                          BUCKY
               I'm...looking for the hammer.

     She points over his shoulder to the hammer hanging in plain
     view.

     INT. THE BEDROOM - LATER

     Bucky kneels on the ground near the closet, toolbox next to
     him. He pulls on the floorboard, it flexes and squeaks.

     He uses the hammer to pull the board completely off. He
     squeezes wood glue around the edges and is about to replace
     the board when something under the floor catches his eye.

     He reaches into the hole, pulling out STACKS OF HUNDRED
     DOLLAR BILLS BOUND WITH RUBBER BANDS.

     He spies another scrap of paper in the hole...

     INT. THE KITCHEN - SAME

     Kay pours two scotches.

                          KAY
               Dwight?

     She carries the scotches into the bedroom and finds Dwight
     sitting on the floor, staring at thousands of dollars in
     cash.

     He holds a paper money band inscribed: "$100...Boulevard-
     Citizens Bank..."

                          KAY (cont'd)
               Oh. I...always wondered where he kept it.

     THE BOULEVARD-CITIZENS BANK HEIST - A FLASHBACK

     A SHOTGUN BLAST shatters the back window of the armored
     truck. In the front seat, LEE BLANCHARD ducks down as the
     driver hits the gas...

     BACK ON THE SCENE

     as Bucky leans back against the bed.

                          BUCKY
               Were you ever going to tell me?

                          KAY
               He'd given all his money to Ben Siegel.
               (beat) He wanted to give me a home.

     A FLASHBACK - LEE'S CAR

     Lee and Bucky, their first day as partners...

                          LEE
               ...said I'd get a shot at Joe Louis if
               I'd take two dives for him. I said no...

     BACK ON THE SCENE

     as Bucky looks straight up into the ceiling light...

                          BUCKY
               Were you ever going to tell me?

                          KAY
               He knew what Bobby was doing to me...How
               he'd used a razor on me...pimped me to
               his friends...

     INT. DEWITT'S APARTMENT - A FLASHBACK

     as Lee plants the incriminating bank bags in DeWitt's closet...

     BACK ON THE SCENE

     Bucky staring back into the hole in the floor...

                          KAY
               ...Bobby know nothing about the bank job.
               He and Lee, they never even met. After
               Lee and his driver got away, Lee figured
               framing Bobby'd give me a way out...

     EXT. DEWITT'S TRIAL - FLASHBACK

     Lee leads Kay out of the courtroom.

     BACK ON THE SCENE

     as Kay leans down next to Bucky, gently putting her hand on
     his shoulder...

                          KAY
               Then last year...the fourth man--the
               driver--he heard Bobby was getting
               paroled. He threatened to tell DeWitt
               that Lee framed him. He wanted money we
               didn't have. Ten thousand dollars.

                          BUCKY
               Ever. Were you ever...?

                          KAY
               Promise me this: Forgive him for DeWitt.
               Forgive him for the bank. It doesn't
               matter anymore. Not to us.

                          BUCKY
               Who was the driver, Kay? Tell me. Tell
               me!

     He's in her face now. Okay, pal, you asked for it.

                          KAY
               Baxter Fitch.

     EXT. THE STREET - A FLASHBACK

     Three black man and a white man get rousted by Lee and Bucky.

                          BAXTER FITCH
               Blanchard?

     Chaos erupts as Lee executes Baxter Fitch and Bucky kills two
     others...

     BACK TO THE SCENE

     on Bucky's anguished face:

                          KAY (cont'd)
               He used you, Dwight. He did. Forgive him
               everything else. But don't forgive him
               for that. Ever.

     She reaches for his face and he pulls away.

     SLO-MO CLOSE-UP...

     as the crumpled money drops down into the hole in the floor,
     into the blackness...

     WE FADE UP TO:

     INT. THE GARAGE - NIGHT

     Bucky, stripped to bare chest, attacks the heavy beg.

                          VOICE OVER
               Fire and Ice. The hero and the snitch.
               Bank robber and his best friend the
               bumfuck detective. Triggerman. Stooge.
               Weak point in a fairy tale triangle.

     He lashes into the heavy bag with a series of brutal left
     hooks. Kay stands in the door, watching him. Her eyes red
     from crying.

                          VOICE OVER (cont'd)
               I would forgive Lee the bank job. And I
               thought I'd forgive Kay her role in
               keeping it from me. But the basic rule of
               Homicide applied: Nothing stays buried
               forever. Corpses. Ghosts. Nothing stays
               buried forever. Nothing.

     Kay turns around and shuts the door behind her.

     EXT. JANE CHAMBER'S GARDEN - DAY

     Bucky and Jane drink iced tea. A glorious garden behind them.

                          JANE CHAMBERS
               So. What brings you around again?
               Considering a courtin' the old rich
               widow?

                          BUCKY
               You're not that old. And you're not very
               widowed.

                          JANE CHAMBERS
               You either are or you aren't.

                          BUCKY
               You seem to be doing all right.

                          JANE CHAMBERS
               Eldridge had cancer. I half expected it.
               We weren't that close anymore...You married?

                          BUCKY
               Little over a year.

                          JANE CHAMBERS
               God. Newlyweds. Nothing better, is there?

     Bucky's face betrays his difficulties.

                          JANE CHAMBERS (cont'd)
               Sorry.

                          BUCKY
               So how well do you know the Spragues?

                          JANE CHAMBERS
               Eldridge and Emmett went way back. They
               served on the California real estate
               board together. But Emmett was a bit of a
               crook. My husband got him kicked off the
               board for building dangerous buildings
               under phony corporations.

                          BUCKY
               Your husband sounds like a good man.

                          JANE CHAMBERS
               He had his moments. Most of it was out of
               guilt. He owned slum blocks in San Pedro.
               When he learned he had cancer, he really
               started feeling guilty. He voted
               Democratic last year. Even went in and
               had meetings with the City Council. I'm
               sure he gave them dirt on Emmett.

                          BUCKY
               I read an article in the paper.

                          JANE CHAMBERS
               Same day Eldridge killed himself.
               Apropos, I guess.

                          BUCKY
               Maybe your husband--

                          JANE CHAMBERS
               My husband was rich and did a mean
               Charleston. I loved him until I found out
               he was cheating on me. Now I'm starting
               to love him again. How strange.

                          BUCKY
               It's not so strange.

     They watch each other, enjoying each other's company. A
     strange emotional peace.

                          JANE CHAMBERS
               You're very accepting of other people's
               frailties. You're young. You should have
               illusions.

                          BUCKY
               I'm a cop. Illusions aren't standard
               issue.

                          JANE CHAMBERS
               So how'd a cop get mixed up with
               Madeleine Sprague? It was Madeleine, I
               assume?

     Bucky's gut clenches.

                          BUCKY
               I stopped her at a red light. One thing
               led to another. Why do you assume it was
               Madeleine?

                          JANE CHAMBERS
               Don't play dumb, Bucky. The girl's a
               roundheels. Always has been.

                          BUCKY
               Jane. Don't be catty.

                          JANE CHAMBERS
               I'm sorry. She can't help it I'm sure.
               She probably inherited it from her
               mother.

     Before Bucky can press Jane stands up with the tray of iced
     tea. The visit is over.

                          JANE CHAMBERS
               You figure out the rest, officer.

     He follows her back inside.

     INT. THE HALLWAY - SAME

     As they stop momentarily in front of the scary clown painting.

                          BUCKY
               God that is spooky.

                          JANE CHAMBERS
               Valuable, too. Eldridge bought it for my
               birthday a couple years ago. I hate it.
               Want to take it with you?

                          BUCKY
               No thanks.

                          JANE CHAMBERS
               Thank you, then. You were my best
               condoler.

                          BUCKY
               And you mine.

     Jane gives Bucky a warm handshake.

     EXT. THE STREET - HANCOCK PARK - SOON AFTER

     Bucky pulls out of June Street, and passes Muirfield. He
     slows for a moment, squinting down the street, trying to
     discern the Sprague mansion. He drives on.

     We hang on the sign for Muirfield Avenue as the day turns to
     night...

     And down Muirfield Road, we see Bucky's car parked in the
     shadows. Watching the Sprague house. A voyeur.

     INT. KAY AND BUCKY'S BEDROOM - MORNING

     Bucky sleeps soundly as Kay readies herself for work. She
     watches him for a moment, considering whether to wake him.
     She decides not to and leaves.

     The minute she goes, Bucky opens his eyes...

     EXT. MUIRFIELD ROAD - HANCOCK PARK - EVENING

     Bucky spies on the Spragues. He digs back into his seat as
     Madeleine comes down the walk and puts mail in the mail box.
     Just for a second it looks like she sees him...maybe not...

     INT. CRIME LAB - DAY

     Bucky dozes, his tie almost catching on fire in a Bunsen
     burner.

     EXT. THE MUIRFIELD ROAD STAKEOUT - EVENING

     Bucky leans against the window, propping himself up.

     ACROSS THE STREET

     Madeleine's Packard pulls out and roars up the street. Bucky
     guns his car to follow...

     EXT. THE ZIMBA ROOM - NIGHT

     Bucky follows the Packard into a crowded GI bar parking lot.
     He parks a distance away. But as he watches Madeleine get out
     of her car he is staggered:

     It's ELIZABETH SHORT.

     Or, more accurately, it's Madeleine dressed up exactly like
     the Dahlia in one of her famous portrait photos. Slinky black
     dress, upswept hair, down to the yellow barrette. She strides
     into the bar...

     INT. THE ZIMBA ROOM - NIGHT

     Bucky ducks into a smoke-filled GI bar where a commotion is
     already taking place.

     Madeleine is surrounded by soldiers fawning all over her.
     Other men simply point and whisper--her Dahlia act isn't lost
     on anybody.
     Bucky slides into a booth in the corner to watch. He signals
     for a drink.

     INT. THE ZIMBA ROOM - NIGHT - LATER

     Four bourbons later. Bucky watches as Madeleine settles into
     a more intimate conversation with one soldier. Bucky downs
     his drink as Madeleine grabs the GI's elbow and escorts him
     out of the bar.

     EXT. THE RED ARROW INN - LATER

     Bucky sits in his car in the parking lot watching the soldier
     loiter outside of A motel room. Madeleine returns from the
     office with the key and lets the two of them in.

     He watches as the light goes on; and then off.

     INT. KAY AND BUCKY'S BEDROOM - LATER

     Bucky comes into the bedroom to find Kay waiting up for him.

                          KAY
               Dwight--

     He moves to her, pulling off his clothes as quickly as he
     can.

                          KAY (cont'd)
               Dwight--

     He's on top of her, his bourbon stained kisses go and down
     her neck and her breasts.

     She responds, but not quickly enough for him. He rushes into
     her before she's ready. Still, she tries to be there for him,
     hoping to catch up with his lust.

     She doesn't. And they both know it. They embrace, trying to
     cover up the hollow awkwardness with familiar affection.

     It doesn't work...

     INT. THAD GREEN'S OFFICE - DAY

     Bucky sits at Thad Green's desk, penitent.

                          THAD GREEN
               SID's not a bad beat, Bucky. At the time
               it was better than you deserved.

     Bucky nods.

                          THAD GREEN (cont'd)
               The blues hate you, Bucky. Vogel was
               their pal. I do this for you, you better
               be fucking supercop.

     Bucky just sits silent.

     ANOTHER LAPD TRANSFER ORDER: "Transfer order...Officer
     Bleichert...From SID...to Newton Street Division,
     Nightwatch.

     EXT. NEWTON STREET - MIDNIGHT

     Bucky back in uniform again. This time, the black slums.
     Heroin hookers, hard-core dealers, gangs.

                          VOICE OVER
               Newton Street Division. Footbeat hacks
               carried metal-studded saps; squadroom
               dicks packed .45 automatics loaded with
               unregulation dum-dums.

     INT. A LIQUOR STORE DOORWAY - NIGHT

     Bucky and a large black man come tumbling out of the liquor
     store throwing vicious punches at each other.

     Bucky takes three to land six, eventually knocking the guy
     out. He looks across the street to see to cops watching him,
     measuring him.

     INT. AN ALLEY - NIGHT

     As Bucky chases two men towards a chain link fence at the end
     of the alley. One of them gets to the fence and scrambles up
     it. Bucky yanks the other one off the fence, slamming him to
     the ground.

                          VOICE OVER
               Kay. Lee. Madeleine. Betty Short. For one
               month I escaped them all.

     INT. KAY AND BUCKY'S HOUSE - NIGHT

     As Kay sleeps alone in the bed.

                          VOICE OVER
               A fucking supercop.

     INT. A JAZZ BAR - EARLY MORNING

     Bucky sits in his uniform listening to a jazz quartet.

     INT. KAY AND BUCKY'S LIVING ROOM - MORNING

     Bucky sleeps on the couch as Kay leaves for work.

                          VOICE OVER
               I escaped them all. Almost.

     EXT. A STREET CORNER - NIGHT

     Bucky in his patrol car. The night a hot sweat. He listens to
     music on his radio and watches two hookers dance on the
     corner, waving at cars.

     A SCRAGGLY OLD WINO staggers up to the women, stumbling
     around them, dancing with them. They sneer at him, tell him
     to beat it.

     INSIDE THE PATROL CAR

     Bucky flashes his headlights at the bum. The bum ignores him.
     Bucky flashes them again, annoyed.

     The bum looks into the glare and flips Bucky off.

     And suddenly Bucky snaps, jumping from his car. In three big
     strides he's on the bum, clobbering him with roundhouse lefts
     and rights.

     The women are screaming. The drunk is screaming.

                          OLD DRUNK
               Pleease!

     Bucky drops him, staggering into a phone booth. He drops a
     nickel in the phone. Dials a number. Ring. Ring. Ring...

     He hangs up. Dials another. A woman's voice answers.

                          BUCKY
               It's me.

     EXT. THE SPRAGUE MANSION - NIGHT

     Bucky's just onto the porch steps when Madeleine answers the
     door. She's dressed like the Dahlia.

     He pushes her inside.

                          VOICE OVER
               It was a reunion of avowed tramps, old
               rutters who knew they'd never have it as
               good with anyone else...
               Afterwards we'd talk through the night.
               The Spragues...Crazy Papa Bleichert...

     INT. AN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL CLASSROOM - DAY

     Sixth graders write in silence. Kay sits at her desk, sadness
     in her eyes as she watches the children.

                          VOICE OVER
               Mostly, though we'd talk about Betty. Her
               utter malleability, a chameleon eager to
               please anybody...and the disrupter of
               every life close to me...It would last a
               month.

     INT. THE SPRAGUE MANSION - MORNING

     Bucky stands in the living room, examining family photos. A
     photo of two young, proud WWI vets: George Tilden and Emmett 
     Sprague...A photo of the dark-haired Ramona and the ruddy and
     fair-haired Emmett...Photos of Madeleine and Martha, the
     brunette and the ruddy blond...Back to the first photo:
     George Tilden's dark hair.

     Madeleine wanders in, Bucky smiles at her.

                          MADELEINE
               What?

                          BUCKY
               Nothing.

     She runs her hands over his shoulders.

                          BUCKY (cont'd)
               I thought the family came back from
               Laguna this week.

                          MADELEINE
                   (her Scottish brogue)
               You miss 'em, laddie? Mother's insults?
               Martha's pornography...

                          BUCKY
               Your father's Georgie Tilden war stories?

     He scans her for a reaction. If she has one it ripples
     through her almost undetectable. Almost.

     EXT. JANE CHAMBER'S HOUSE - LATER

     As Bucky cruises by, grinning. He salutes the house.

                          VOICE OVER
               In the scheme of things it wasn't much.
               Rich old lady gossip, as Jane put it.

                                                            CUT TO:

     EXT. BUCKY'S NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY

     as he drives onto his own modest street.

                          VOICE OVER (cont'd)
               But combine it with banging Madeleine in
               all twenty-two rooms of their mansion, it
               was good enough for me.

     EXT. KAY AND BUCKY'S HOUSE - DAY

     A moving van in the driveway and Kay's Plymouth stuffed with
     boxes. Bucky double-parks and bolts up the steps.

     The van pulls away behind him.

                          BUCKY
                   (to the van driver)
               Hey! Goddammit! Get back here!

     The van driver ignores him; Bucky turns as Kay walks out onto
     the porch.

                          KAY
               I didn't touch your things. You can have
               the furniture.

                          BUCKY
               Babe--

                          KAY
               Did you think I'd let my husband
               disappear for three weeks and do nothing
               about it? I've had detectives following
               you, Dwight. Detectives. She looks like
               that fucking dead girl, so you can have
               her--not me.

                          BUCKY
               Babe. Goddammit.

     He reaches for her and she backs out of grabbing range.

                          KAY
               Whoremonger. Coward. Necrophile.

     She spins out of his grasp and makes for her car. She guns
     the engine and disappears.

     INT. THE HOUSE - SECONDS LATER

     Bucky stands in the middle of the living room, cataloguing
     the little things. No periodicals on the coffee table, half
     the record collection gone, no candlesticks.

     He picks up the largest chair (Lee's favorite) and throws it
     at the wall. Next, Kay's rocking chair shatters the glass
     cabinets. The coffee table goes through the front window.

     IN THE BEDROOM

     Bucky yanks out all the drawers, turns over the bed.

     IN THE BATHROOM

     he takes a pipe wrench to the sink, crushes the mirror with
     one blow...

     In a terrible ten rounder with the ghosts of his past Bucky
     demolishes the dream house, pulls his uniforms out of the
     closet and bolts out of the house, leaving the door open so
     scavengers can pick the place clean...

     INT. THE EL NIDO - NIGHT

     Bucky sits on the bed, his back pushed up against the wall.
     Eyeball to eyeball with Elizabeth Short, Betty, Liz, the
     Black Dahlia.

     A collage of photos and file folders...

                          VOICE OVER
               It came on then, big and ugly: bye-bye
               Bleichert at the bus stop, adios
               shitbird, has-been, never-was, stool
               pigeon harness bull.

     EXT. THE SLUMS - LATE NIGHT

     Bucky stands in the worst of slums, his blue uniform a beacon
     to anyone who would do him harm.

                          VOICE OVER (cont'd)
               You traded a good woman for skunk pussy,
               you've turned everything that's been
               handed you to pure, undiluted shit, your
               "I will's" amount to the eighth round at
               the Academy gym when you stepped into a
               Blanchard right hand--pratfalling into
               clover that you turned into horse dung.

     ANOTHER ELIZABETH SHORT CASTING SESSION

     No clapsticks this time. Just Betty Short sitting an the
     couch. She reaches down and pulls off her pumps. Now she
     reaches under her dress and begins unrolling her stockings.
     Not sexy. Empty and resigned.

                          VOICE OVER (cont'd)
               Bye-bye Betty, Beth, Betsy, Liz, we were
               a couple of tramps, too bad we didn't
               meet before 39th and Norton, it just
               might have worked. Maybe us would've been
               the one thing we wouldn't have fucked up
               past redemption...

     EXT. 39TH AND NORTON - NIGHT - LATER

     An apartment complex has been erected at the murder site.

     EXT. AN AERIAL VIEW OF LOS ANGELES - DAY

     ANGLE ON: THE HOLLYWOODLAND SIGN. As we watch the sign
     changes, the "D" dropping off the end. It now reads
     "HOLLYWOODLAN".

     EXT. WILSHIRE DISTRICT - DAY

     Bucky, unshaven and out of uniform, leans against his car on
     a working class residential street. He stares across at a
     modest Victorian house and the garage behind it. We recognize
     it hopefully; we've been here before.

     EXT. A GARAGE APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

     It's Cleo Short's apartment. Or at least it used to be. Bucky
     peers in a window and sees it's filled with junk.

     He walks back towards the street, intent on heading back to
     his car. on a hunch, he walks up onto the porch of the
     Victorian house and rings the bell.

     EXT. THE PORCH - SAME

     Footsteps at the door. It opens to reveal another identical
     twin to Elizabeth Short.

     Bucky is stunned and can't find his tongue.

                          GIRL
                   (Boston accent)
               Can I help you? (no response). Great.
               Take a hike you big sicko--

                          BUCKY
               Wait--

     She begins to shut the door but someone behind her pulls it
     back open.

     Cleo Short, Elizabeth's father.

                          CLEO SHORT
               It's all right, dear. I know this pug.

     INT. THE SITTING ROOM - LATER

     The two men arrange themselves in chairs while the Betty look-
     a-alike makes herself busy in the kitchen behind Cleo.

     Bucky tries not to stare. He forces himself to focus on Cleo,
     who, while five years older, looks much better than last time
     Bucky saw him.

                          CLEO SHORT
               Came into a little change a while back,
               managed to trade in that shit shack out
               back for these digs. (beat) And I don't
               give a fuck what you think, you and your
               partner ain't much to look at now. I read
               the papers.

     Bucky can't deny that.

     The young woman brings in two beers for Bucky and Cleo. Bucky
     checks her out again. Cleo knows why.

                          CLEO SHORT (cont'd)
               My youngest, Christine.

     He squeezes her hand affectionately.

                          CLEO SHORT (cont'd)
               Best housekeeper of the bunch. Can't cook
               a damn, though.
               Got her sister's star-eyes for the
               pictures, damn straight. Thinks she's
               gonna be another goddamn Jayne Mansfield.
               Get out of here, Chrissie...

     She rolls her eyes, picks up a newspaper and heads out on the
     porch.

                          CLEO SHORT (cont'd)
               Used to be dozens'd stop by, you know.
               Drive up from Dago or San Berdoo just to
               snap a shot of the goddamn garage back
               there. Thought maybe they'd find one of
               Betty's dresses in the garbage. Jackals.

                          BUCKY
               You didn't move far.

                          CLEO SHORT
               Wouldn't a mattered if I did. (beat)
               Whatcha here for, mug? I know you ain't
               smart enough to solve the case, and you
               ain't dumb enough to still think I did
               it...I had an alibi.

                          BUCKY
               Tighter'n a popcorn fart.

                          CLEO SHORT
               And that's air tight, mug. Air tight.

     Bucky takes a swig of his beer. Cleo's eyes scour Bucky.

                          CLEO SHORT (cont'd)
               You're hooked on her still, ain't ya? Ha.
               That's a plug nickel you can't spend,
               ain't it, mug? Ha. Yea. Betty'll do that
               to a fella. Especially someone like you.
                   (off Bucky's look)
               Like I said, I know you mug.

                          BUCKY
               I just thought...Maybe after all this
               time...There's something you might have
               forgot...Anything she might have said...

     Cleo studies him, knows Bucky's a lost soul. He softens for
     the first time. Leans forward, elbows on knees. Almost
     looking like a father who'd lost a daughter.

                          CLEO SHORT
               She was a terrible actress. I'm sure
               folks've told you that. She'd practice in
               front of the john mirror.
               Once or twice she got me in on
               it...Reading parts with her for some
               audition. She stunk. Even a parent could
               tell. What Beth was good at was writing.
               All her teachers used to say that. Not
               that a grease like me'd know the
               difference. Maybe she coulda written for
               the pictures. But she wanted to be an
               actress like every other silly girl.

     His gaze drifts outside to his youngest daughter.

                          CLEO SHORT (cont'd)
               Your folks still alive?

                          BUCKY
               My father.

                          CLEO SHORT
                   (poking)
               He proud of his son, the ace copper? Or
               maybe he thought you'd end up champ?

     Bucky shrugs off any talk of his father. Cleo gets it.

                          CLEO SHORT
               Your momma?

                          BUCKY
               She killed herself a long time ago.

     Cleo takes a swig of his beer.

                          CLEO SHORT
               Probably better off then.

     INT./EXT. THE LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

     Cleo follows Bucky out onto the porch. Christine reads a copy
     of Photoplay. The cover touts the current Mack Sennett
     Revival in honor of the revised Hollywoodland sign...

                          BUCKY
               Thank you for your time, Mr. Short. if--

                          CLEO SHORT
               Get a life, Bleichert. Don't dream it all
               away. Dreamin'll kill ya.
                   (to Christine)
               You, too. Get me a sandwich.

     He snatches away the Photoplay and slaps it into Bucky's
     hands.

                          CLEO SHORT (cont'd)
               Clean up some dog shit with this for me,
               willya?

     The man winks. Bucky takes the magazine and salutes him with
     it. He heads back down the walk. Behind him Cleo Short
     watches him go.

     EXT./INT. BUCKY'S CAR - HOLLYWOOD - DUSK

     Bucky sits at a light, staring north. Scaffolding drapes the 
     Hollywoodland sign. Movie lights have been set up, capturing
     the event on film.

     His attention turns to Christine's Photoplay on the seat next 
     to him; the weekly rag is open to an ad for the Mack Sennett
     revival:

     A reproduction of the Hollywoodland sign across the top of
     the page, and below it the words "Keystone Kops at the
     Admiral Theater--Air conditioned!"

     Below that a still from a Keystone Kops movie, registering
     huge and loud and wrong: Three Keystone Kops standing between 
     pillars shaped like snakes swallowing their own tails; a wall
     inset with Egyptian hieroglyphics was behind them.

     Unmistakably the background that appeared in the Linda
     Martin/Betty Short porn film.

     Cars honking behind him. Bucky's transfixed by the image. The
     light is green.

     He jerks upright and squeals out of the intersection.

                                                            CUT TO:

     EXT. THE ADMIRAL THEATER - SOON AFTER

     Bucky buys a ticket underneath a marquee which reads MACK
     SENNETT REVIVAL".

     INT. THE THEATER - CONTINUOUS

     A Keystone Kop short in progress. Bucky can barely sit down
     to watch...

                          VOICE OVER
               I tried to keep calm. I told myself that
               just because Emmett Sprague helped Mack
               Sennett build sets in the twenties didn't
               mean he had anything to do with a smut
               film twenty-five years later.

     And there's a shot of the porn set--the Keystone Kops running
     around in it like they're solving at crime back in ancient
     Egypt.

                          VOICE OVER (cont'd)
               Duke Wellington had admitted making it.
               Linda Martin had said it was shot in
               Mexico.

     The short ends with a large pie throwing scene on the porn
     set. The credits begin to roll: "Director--Mack Sennett.
     Scenarist--Mack Sennett. Assistant Director--Emmett
     Sprague"

     On Bucky's face as one last piece of information hits him:
     "Filmed in Hollywood, USA."

     EXT. THE MOVIE THEATER

     as Bucky bursts out into the evening, the lights on the
     Hollywood hill catching his attention.

     INT. A FLASHBACK - THE SPRAGUE HOUSE

     Bucky at dinner with the Spragues.

                          EMMETT SPRAGUE
               Mack Sennett? Helped him build that
               housing project he was putting up--
               Hollywoodland--

     BACK TO THE SCENE

     as Bucky stares up at the sign.

     INT. EL NIDO - ROOM 204 - NIGHT

     Bucky tears through it, pulling out files. The door opens -
     it's Russ Millard.

                          RUSS MILLARD
               I got your message, Bucky.

                          BUCKY
               Look, Russ...I think...I may have it. I--

                          RUSS MILLARD
               It?

     Bucky whirls around, gesturing to the room--

                          BUCKY
               Her! Her! I've got a hot one, padre. It's
               just...

     Bucky flops onto the bed, almost frantic.

                          RUSS MILLARD
               Calm down, son. Tell me.

     Bucky meets his eyes: forgive me my sins.

     INT. BUCKY'S CAR - NIGHT

     Bucky drives with Russ in the car next to him.

                          VOICE OVER
               I told him everything. Me and Madeleine,
               the Spragues. Withholding evidence for
               her. Everything. Even Lee. After all of
               it he only had one thing to say:

     INT. THE EL NIDO - NIGHT - FLASHBACK

     On Russ:

                          RUSS MILLARD
               All right, then. It's your ball. What do
               you wanna do?

                          BUCKY
               I want to search every fucking inch of
               every goddamn acre of Emmett Sprague
               property if it takes the rest of my
               shitty career. And I know exactly where
               we start.

     INT. BUCKY'S CAR - BEACHWOOD CANYON - NIGHT

     as they inch their way up into a huge traffic snarl in
     Beachwood Canyon. The sign looms high above them as the "A"
     is taken dawn.

                          VOICE OVER
               Between my time with Madeleine and the
               local boom baron expose in the papers, I
               was practically an expert on Emmett
               Sprague's land deals...

     EXT. A PARK AREA AT THE NORTH END OF BEACHWOOD DRIVE

     A huge area is cordoned off as people watch the sign being
     torn down.

     Bucky and Russ leave the car there, badge the local blue
     doing crowd control, and split off down a dirt side road into
     the woods.

                          VOICE OVER (cont'd)
               For the first time since the beginning of
               the whole fiasco, I stopped trying to
               figure out who killed Elizabeth Short.
               Instead, I focused on where.

     EXT. A WOODED AREA - NIGHT

     Bucky and Russ play a flashlight over a piece of paper, like
     two men consulting a treasure map in the woods.

     In the background is a tiny bungalow with the windows blown
     out and the door hanging off its hinges.

                          VOICE OVER
               And if my hunch was right, we wouldn't
               have to look any further than one of
               Emmett Sprague's condemned bungalows. One
               that was isolated...abandoned...

     They walk on, leaving this particular bungalow behind.

     EXT. A STREAM - WOODS - LATER

     Bucky shines the light in a running stream as they follow it
     deeper into the night...

                          VOICE OVER
               ...and most importantly, close to a water
               source...where one could drain a body of
               its blood.

     Bucky and Russ round a bend in the stream and see

     THE SKELETON OF A BUNGALOW

     teetering on the edge of the stream. Empty window and doors
     hover over a rotting porch like skull sockets over a death
     leer.

     Bucky and Russ feel it, tensing up as they approach. They
     pick their footsteps carefully through the broken porch and
     step into the abandoned house.

     INT. THE BUNGALOW - SAME

     A scattering of trash in the front room, animal shit, a
     bicycle tire, rags.

     They move through the house, each roam, each closet and
     corner creeps with potential violence. Still, nothing.

     From the kitchen:

                          RUSS MILLARD
               Bucky.

     Bucky joins Russ at the back door, the screen rotted off.
     Through the empty window they see:

     AN ALUMINUM GARDENING SHED, the door wide open.

     You know it before they even get there. But as soon as they
     step inside...

     INT. THE GARDENING SHED - CONTINUOUS

     They know something bad happened here...

     Half the room is taken up by a mattress, its blue ticking
     stained dark brown with blood. A gas lantern sits in the
     corner, leaning against a stack of blood-spattered books,
     including a copy of Gray's Anatomy and Victor Hugo's The Man 
     Who Laughs along with a clutch of pornographic pictures.

                          RUSS MILLARD
               God help her.

     Bucky's already pulling on a pair of rubber gloves from his
     SID days. For the first time we notice he's carrying his
     forensic kit.

     He opens it, revealing the test tubes, fingerprint powder,
     tweezers, etc.

                          BUCKY
                   (throwing Russ gloves)
               Box up the books and papers. Maybe light
               that lantern.

     Russ grants Bucky his take-charge attitude. He snaps on a
     pair of gloves.

     A GRUESOME MONTAGE

     1. Bucky scrapes blood off a wall and into a test tube.

     2. Russ flips through the pornographic material--some of it
     very intense.

     3. Bucky fills up another test tube with dark hair tweezed
     from the caked blood on the mattress.

     4. Underneath the mattress, Bucky finds small pieces of
     rope...

     5. Bucky measures a bloody sole print and traces it onto a
     piece of paper.

     6. Bucky finger prints the whole fucking place, pulling good
     prints from the door jamb, the door, and the wall near the
     head of the mattress.

     OUTSIDE THE GARDENING SHED

     Russ fiddles with the books, making himself busy. Finally he
     walks back inside.

     INT. THE GARDENING SHED - CONTINUOUS

     Bucky sits on the floor, his hands shaking as he holds a
     fingerprint plate in one hand and a piece of paper in the
     other.

                          RUSS MILLARD
               You all right?

     Bucky hands him the fresh plate. Russ studies it. Bucky hands
     him the piece of paper with a blown-up set of prints on it.
     The two sets of prints are identical. Russ sees the name at
     the top of the paper: ELIZABETH SHORT.

     He exhales deeply.

                          BUCKY
               Thing is, Russ. Thing is...There's
               another set of latents up there on the
               doorjamb...And my hands're shaking so bad
               I can't transfer 'em.

                                                            CUT TO:

     RUSS MILLARD HACKING A FOUR INCH SECTION OF THE DOOR JAMB OFF
     WITH HIS KNIFE AND SLIPPING IT INTO A PLASTIC BAG.

     Bucky sits on the ground outside.

     EXT. UNDERNEATH THE HOLLYWOODLAND SIGN - LATER

     The last of the "LAND" letters has come down and a party has
     ensued. A marching band plays "There's No Business Like Show 
     Business".

     Bucky and Russ stumble out of the woods, carrying the
     evidence of Betty Short's death in their hands.

     INT. THE EL NIDO - NIGHT

     Bucky sits on the bed, the evidence spread out around him.
     Russ stands in the doorway.

                          BUCKY
               We finally have it, Russ. All of it. All
               of her.
                   (gesturing around the room)
               All right here.

                          RUSS MILLARD
               Are you sure you don't want to came home?
               Mrs. Millard'll fix up the couch.

                          BUCKY
               No. Thanks. I'll stay here.
                   (re the doorjamb piece)
               I want to get up early and confirm these
               prints.

     Russ nods.

                          RUSS MILLARD
               You're a very very bright penny, Officer.

     He closes the door, leaving Bucky alone with Elizabeth.

     INT. EL NIDO - ROOM 204 - NIGHT

     Bucky lies on the bed, staring at the ceiling.

                          BUCKY (cont'd)
               That night I pictured myself the way I
               wanted Elizabeth to picture me--her
               knight in shining armor, a reborn two-bit
               harness bull who cracked the biggest
               unsolved homicide in California history.
               A war hero, a heavyweight champion.

     INT. EL NIDO - ROOM 204 - DAWN

     Bucky flips through Gray's Anatomy, killing time.

                          BUCKY (cont'd)
               I stayed with her that night and dreamed
               of all the bullshit that would never
               happen. Not if I wanted to keep my job at
               all. Because there was no way for me to
               make the arrest without admitting that
               I'd suppressed evidence years ago. The
               case would always be open.
               And so while it killed me to wait 'til
               morning, in some ways...this was our last
               night together.

     INT. THE CRIME LAB - MORNING

     Bucky transfers the killer's prints from the doorjamb to a
     plate.

     INT. A LARGE ROOM WITH FILE CABINETS

     Bucky pulls a fingerprint card from a cabinet. He shuts the
     cabinet. The tab on the outside reads: "City Employees".

     EXT. THE SPRAGUE MANSION - MORNING

     Bucky edges his way along the side of the house. A side
     window is open and he pulls himself inside.

     INT. THE MANSION - CONTINUOUS

     Moving boxes fill the front hallway. Bucky hears voices
     coming from the main hall. Madeleine and Emmett.

     Bucky unholsters his gun; from his pocket he pulls out a
     SILENCER and screws it on the muzzle.

                          EMMETT SPRAGUE (O.S.)
               ...besides, one of my foremen said the
               goddamn pipes are spewing gas...There'll
               be hell to pay. It's about time I showed
               the three of you good ol' Scotland.

                          MADELEINE
               I don't wanna go to Europe, Daddy. You're
               always talking about how dreadful and
               provincial it is.

                          EMMETT SPRAGUE
               ...they've got what you need, lassie.

     Bucky steps into the main room, gun prominent at his side.

                          BUCKY
               And what is that, Emmett? Saps like me?
               Direct line to the straight dope? Or is
               that what you needed?

                          EMMETT SPRAGUE
               Aaah, laddie.

     He eyes the gun.

                          BUCKY
               George Tilden killed Elizabeth Short and
               the two of you covered it up.

     On the Spragues, trying to maintain their upper-class cool.

                          BUCKY (cont'd)
                   (to Madeleine)
               You helped Linda Martin and Betty make
               that stag film. Where was the set? In one
               of Daddy's old buildings?

     He levels the gun at Madeleine. Rock steady. Madeleine sits
     on a divan.

                          MADELEINE
               Georgie was always...sneaking around
               Daddy's properties. He saw them make
               it...He...got crazy about Betty.

                          BUCKY
               Of course. She looked like his daughter.

     Off Emmett's shocked look:

                          BUCKY (cont'd)
               He fucked your wife. But I don't think
               you cared about that. But he's her daddy.
               And that must have made you crazy. He was
               a handsome bastard, too. Somehow I don't
               think he was disfigured in a car wreck.

                          EMMETT SPRAGUE
               In the Argonne, Georgie used to bayonet
               the dead Gerries. I saw it. Thrilled him,
               it did. He was...hmm...disturbed. I think
               Ramona found him...a good way to strike
               back at me.

     Bucky points the gun at Madeleine again.

                          BUCKY
               How'd it all go down?

     She hesitates. He shoots a MING VASE next to her. She jumps.

                          BUCKY (cont'd)
               So many pretty things here...

                          MADELEINE
               It was Sunday I remember...Betty
               called...short of cash as usual.
               I put Daddy on, and he offered Betty
               money to date a nice man he knew.
               Georgie'd been driving Daddy crazy,
               wanting to get with Betty ever since the
               movie. Threatening to tell people he was
               my father. But we thought Georgie just
               wanted her for sex.

     Bucky blows away another objet d'art. The two Spragues huddle
     on the couch.

                          BUCKY
               He was a sick fuck and you knew it!

     Emmett gestures vainly towards the stuffed dog Balto.

                          EMMETT SPRAGUE
               He was passive. He liked to touch dead
               things. His father was a surgeon, did you
               know that? Famous in Scotland.

                          BUCKY
               What did you tell Betty? What did you
               tell her?

                          MADELEINE
               We said he was a war hero. Because we
               didn't want her to feel like a whore.

                          BUCKY
               Then?

                          MADELEINE
               You know the rest.

                          BUCKY
               Pretend I'm stupid. For old time's sake.

     Madeleine exhales hate.

                          MADELEINE
               I went looking for Linda Martin, and I
               found her at a motel in the Valley. I
               gave her money and told her to say the
               stag was filmed in Tijuana with a Mexican
               crew.

                          BUCKY
               And then what? I come along? Daddy tell
               you to fuck me or was that your idea?

                          MADELEINE
               Bucky--

     Two more shots from the gun destroy another fifty grand worth
     of art. Bucky reloads.

                          BUCKY (cont'd)
               The whole family have a good laugh at
               dinner that night? Pumping me for info
               about the case? Throwing me Georgie
               stories to see if I'd bite? A little
               hospitality and some cunt so I wouldn't
               check out your alibi--

                          MADELEINE
               Bucky--

                          EMMETT SPRAGUE
               Ramona didn't know a thing. Martha--

                          BUCKY
               What about sweet little Martha?

                          MADELEINE
               Martha knew I'd been with Betty. But that
               was all. But she's a demon, you know. She
               even called the cops with a tip on La
               Verne's--just hoping I'd get smeared in
               the papers. I scratched her good for
               that.

                          BUCKY
               Martha tell you this?

     She nods yes.

                          BUCKY
               Then she lied to get your goat, 'cuz no
               one ever called in a tip on LaVerne's.

                          MADELEINE
               Figures.

     Emmett clears his throat.

                          EMMETT SPRAGUE
               What are you gonna do?

                          BUCKY
               Passports. All four.

     Emmett walks to a small desk. He reaches into the drawer--
     Bucky puts his gun to Emmett's head--

                          EMMETT SPRAGUE
               Don't insult me, lad.

     He pulls out the four passports (not a gun). Bucky takes
     them.

                          MADELEINE
               We'll ruin you in court, you know. If you
               go after us, we'll ruin you. Over what?
               Some little slut--

     Bucky blows a hole in a vase some six inches from her. He
     cocks his head at her, as if to say: the next one will be
     closer.

                          EMMETT SPRAGUE
               You know, laddie. The rich don't
               necessarily own art just for themselves;
               we safekeep it for future generations.

     The dig crosses through Bucky's mind for a moment before he
     shooes it away. To Emmett:

                          BUCKY
               I need to see it.
                          EMMETT SPRAGUE
               It?

                          BUCKY
               Just to be sure. I need to see it.

                          EMMETT SPRAGUE
               I'm not sure I know...

     Bucky puts the silenced muzzled half an inch from Sprague's
     brain.

                          BUCKY
               I need to see his grave, you tightass
               kiltwearing motherfucker. Where'd you
               bury George Tilden?

     EXT. A PAUPER'S CEMETERY - DAY

     Bucky stands in front of a plain grave marker: "George
     Tilden. 1906 - 1948.  War Hero and Loyal Friend"

                          VOICE OVER
               When I'd pulled George's print card that
               morning, I'd already laid fifty down with
               Russ that he was our guy. Amateur
               taxidermist, transient. If he was a cop
               39th and Norton woulda been right in the
               middle of his beat...

     INT. THE ROOM WITH THE FILE CABINETS - FLASHBACK

     Bucky pulls Tilden's card and we see the close-up: "George
     Tilden". Added by hand: "Deceased"

                          VOICE OVER
               But I'd be lying if I said I hadn't
               wanted to nail the sicko myself, giving
               him ten rounds of Bleichert rage.

     EXT./INT. THE ALUMINUM GARDEN SHED - DAY

     Bucky watches as Russ tips the gas lantern over on its side,
     the gas leaking out into the tin shed.

                          VOICE OVER
               Maybe he'd have gone for a gun or
               probably a knife, and the Bleichert fists
               would've given way to a full load of .45
               in the chest.

     Bucky and Russ step outside. Russ lights a match and tosses
     it inside. Flames begin to eat away the bloody mattress...

                          VOICE OVER (cont'd)
               Sprague said they found him croaked in a
               parking lot downtown, just twelve blocks
               from where he'd dumped Betty Short. Just
               croaked. Natural causes, if anything
               about crazy Georgie was natural. I hoped
               the evil ate him from the inside out,
               filling him with blackness like the
               sawdust in Sprague's goddamn dog. (beat)

     Bucky kicks the tin door shut, sealing the fire inside
     Elizabeth Short's private hell.

     INT. JANE CHAMBERS HOUSE - ANOTHER DAY

     Bucky and Jane Chambers drink some iced tea.

                          JANE CHAMBERS
               ...and then Eldridge said: I'm sure
               that's the case Mr. Mayor, but that's not
               my dog and those sure as hell aren't my
               shoes!

     They laugh, Jane a bit more than Bucky. She narrows in on him.

                          JANE CHAMBERS (cont'd)
               It's so nice of you to stop by again. Of
               course you've been staking out the
               Sprague house. Four nights in a row.
                   (off his surprise)
               I walk my dog every night. And I'm almost
               as nosy as you.

                          BUCKY
                   (covering)
               Yeah, well. Old habits die hard.

     He gets up from the table.

     INT. JANE CHAMBER'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

     Bucky wanders over and stares at the slash-mouthed clown
     painting, always transfixed by it.

                          JANE CHAMBERS
                   (re the painting)
               I'd been thinking about giving it to
               charity, but it's too valuable. I found
               Eldridge's receipt...

     She wanders into the study and fishes out some papers from
     her late husbands desk while Bucky continues to stare at the
     clown. She returns, reading from the sale slip.

                          JANE CHAMBERS (cont'd)
               It's a Frederick Yannantuono original,
               inspired by an old classic novel--The
               Man Who Laughs by Victor Hugo.

     A FLASHBACK - THE GARDENING SHED

     A blood-spattered copy of The Man Who Laughs on the pile of 
     pornography--

     BACK TO SCENE

     As the slash-mouthed clown towers over Bucky, his head
     buzzing...

                          JANE CHAMBERS (cont'd)
               The clown in the painting is the book's
               main character, Gwynplain. When he was a
               child he had his mouth slashed ear to ear
               and then sold to the 16th century Spanish
               aristocracy to be used as a court jester.

     Bucky steps back.

                          JANE CHAMBERS (cont'd)
               Are you all right, Bucky?

                          BUCKY
               Yes, I'm fine.

     He focuses on her.

                          BUCKY (cont'd)
               Where'd Eldridge get the painting?

                          JANE CHAMBERS
               You'll appreciate the coincidence--

     She hands him the receipt.

     ANGLE ON THE RECEIPT:

     "Received from Eldridge Chambers, $3500 for the sale
     of the F. Yannantuono painting. Ramona Cathcart
     Sprague, January 15, 1947."

     Speechless.

                          JANE CHAMBERS
               What is it--

     He's out the door.

     EXT. JANE CHAMBER'S HOUSE - SAME

     Bucky runs to his car, pulls out his gun. He sprints off down
     the street...

     EXT. THE SPRAGUE MANSION - SAME

     Bucky waits outside, watching from behind a tree. He watches
     as the last of the cars, Madeleine's, pulls out of the
     driveway.

     He crosses the street. He tries the front door, surprised to
     find it unlocked. He goes inside.

     INT. THE SPRAGUE MANSION - CONTINUOUS

     Gun drawn, Bucky cases the downstairs. He hears a noise.

                          RAMONA
               I'm in here, officer.

     A red wave of sweat washes over him. He walks carefully into

     RAMONA'S SITTING ROOM

     where the matriarch sits on a tiny sofa, her arms lost in a
     silk dressing gown. Her face puffy and her eyes dark, her
     gray hair frizzy.

     Bucky trains a gun on her.

                          BUCKY
               I know what you did, Ramona. You and
               Georgia. I've seen the painting. You sold
               it the day of the murder. You know I've
               got the book. And now I've got you.

     She smiles. Very slowly she withdraws one of her hands from
     the folds of her dressing gown. She holds a tiny ladylike
     revolver in her fingers and drops it at her feet. When she
     speaks, it's with complete control.

                          RAMONA
               We see you out there, you know. Every
               night. We see you. You don't fool us. You
               didn't hurt Georgie. You didn't hurt
               Madeleine. And as much as I wish you
               would, you didn't hurt Emmett. You're a
               voyeur. That's all the lesser classes
               have. Pressing their nose up against the
               glass.

                          BUCKY
               So tell me. Let me see.

     She smiles at him again, loving his need.

                          RAMONA
               Emmett slashed his face, I'm sure you
               know. Madeleine was eleven and she looked
               just like Georgie. When he got out of the
               hospital I gave him the Hugo book as a
               present. My Gwynplain. But he was afraid
               of Emmett's rage...After that...we rarely
               spoke.

     Bucky eases himself into a chair opposite her.

                          BUCKY
               Tell me about Betty Short.

     Her face hardens.

                          RAMONA (cont'd)
                   (with venom)
               It was the cruelest of jokes. He'd become
               obsessed with her...That filthy film.

                          BUCKY
               Your husband bought her for George.

                          RAMONA
               Emmett never stopped hating me.

                          BUCKY
               For George--

                          RAMONA
               For being richer than he was.

     She looks over her nose at him.

                          RAMONA (cont'd)
               I followed them to the bungalow. There
               was a baseball bat under...under a
               tree...She tried to run from me...but she
               was drunk. The first swing knocked her
               out. I made Georgie tie her to the
               mattress....The second swing woke her up.

                          BUCKY
               You tortured her.

     She seems to drift.

                          RAMONA (cont'd)
               She looked so much like my Maddy. It
               was...the cruelest of jokes.

     Her thousand yard stare gradually returns to Bucky.

                          RAMONA (cont'd)
               Martha mustn't know. She's all that's
               left of this family that isn't dying. You
               consider her when you decide whether
               we're worth it.

     Bucky's not sure what to say next. She fills the space quite
     well.

                          RAMONA (cont'd)
               Honestly, though. Sometimes I thought
               Martha was going to bring the whole
               family down around her by chance. Her
               little stunt about tipping the police to
               LaVerne's--

                          BUCKY
               She lied about that. To get Madeleine's
               goat.

     Ramona's eyes brighten up.

                          RAMONA
               Oh is that so? You poor boy. Your life is
               worse than mine. Maybe the cruel joke is
               on you.

     She speaks with such an insanity and calm it frightens him.
     And on Bucky's hungry eyes we

                                                            CUT TO:

     BUCKY'S CAR peeling out of Hancock Park.

                                                            CUT TO:

     INT. THE FAIRFAX PRIMARY SCHOOL CLASSROOM - DAY

     Kay sits at her desk, grading papers. Bucky bursts in.

                          KAY
               Dwight?

                          BUCKY
               How much of the hundred grand did Lee let
               you keep?

     INT. THE TIP DESK - POLICE DEPARTMENT - FLASHBACK

     Bucky and Lee sit at the tip desk while Lee listens to a very
     long call, saying nothing...

     BACK TO SCENE

     Kay and Bucky stare each other down.

                          BUCKY
               He knew about Madeleine Sprague. He knew
               about Laverne's Hideaway.

     INT. THE SPRAGUE MANSION - NIGHT - A FLASHBACK

     Lee Blanchard beats the hell out of Emmett Sprague while
     Madeleine's looks on.

                          BUCKY (VO)
               He blackmailed Sprague--

                          MADELEINE (VO)
               --Don't come over. Daddy's having a
               business soiree--

     INT. THE BATHROOM OF THE POLICE STATION - A FLASHBACK

     Bucky bursts in on Lee washing his bloody fists.

                          LEE
               --Penance for Junior Nash--

     BACK TO SCENE

     Bucky's leaning on the desk...

                          BUCKY
               And you knew it, Kay! You knew it all! He
               took that hundred thousand and split to
               Mexico and you let him go!

     Kay fingers the edges of an exam. She looks him in the eye.

                          KAY
               You are so, so good at some things.

     He absorbs the blow and waits for her to continue.

                          KAY
               He was going to leave no matter what. I
               didn't know if I was ever going to see
               him again, and I wanted him to be
               comfortable if such a thing was possible.
               Dwight, he knew I was in love with you,
               and he wanted us to be together.

                          BUCKY
               He didn't leave, he ran. He ran from the
               bank job, ran from the frame on DeWitt.
               He knew who killed Elizabeth Short and
               fucking ran away! This whole time. You
               both knew everything--

     Kay slams down a book.

                          KAY
               Goddammit, Dwight! That girl--that girl!
               I don't give a damn about that girl. She
               ruined our lives!

     The room grinds to a halt.

                          KAY (cont'd)
               He loved us. Don't take that away from
               him. And I love you. And if you hadn't
               seen so much of yourself in her you'd
               realize how much you loved me. (beat) So
               if you're aware of something more
               important than that...I'd like to hear
               what it is.

     Bucky looks like he's about to burst. He wants to go to her,
     lock her in his arms and forgive. instead, he just backs up
     three steps, slowly turns on his heels, and walks out.

     INT. A BAR - NIGHT

     Bucky sits in the back of the bar, shrouded in smoke and loud
     music. He drinks bourbon and watches Madeleine over at the
     bar. She's got her hand on a soldier's knee.

     EXT. THE RED ARROW INN - NIGHT

     Madeleine Sprague and the soldier boy walk from the office
     over to the now familiar Room 11. They enter, shutting the
     door and flicking on the light to reveal

     BUCKY

     sitting on the back of a chair with his feet on the seat. He
     trains his silenced pistol on them. Flashing his badge, he
     points the soldier to the door:

                          BUCKY
                   (quoting Lee)
               Adios yourself back to the Halls of
               Tripoli, shitbird. I've got business
               with the lady.

     You don't have to tell the soldier twice. He backs out and
     shuts the door.

                          BUCKY
               I've been pointing my gun at a lot of
               people this week. But I haven't had much
               of a chance to shoot anybody. Whattya
               think?

                          MADELEINE
               I think you'd rather fuck me than kill
               me. But you don't have the guts to do
               either. You're a boxer. Not a puncher.

     Bucky smiles.

                          BUCKY
                   (Scotchman's burr)
               Aaaah, lassie. You wanna sell me short
               to the very end, eh?

     Now she's curious.

                          BUCKY (cont'd)
               It's not as good as yours, I'll admit.
               But then again you've got an ear for
               accents. Accents, dressing up in
               costumes...

     Maybe a trace of fear in her eyes...

                          BUCKY (cont'd)
               Do another one for me. Play someone else.
               Rich little slut...Lez...Daddy's
               girl...Dahlia...Play someone else. Do
               another.

                          MADELEINE
               I don't know what you're talking about--

     He cocks the gun.

                          BUCKY
               How 'bout the Mexican accent you used
               when you hired the private dick to track
               down Lee. Let's see the make-up job.
               Let's see the fucking dress, mamacita,
               that you wore when you chased after poor
               daddy's money. Tell me something--you
               shoot Lee yourself?

     She steps back against the door as he advances.

                          BUCKY (cont'd)
               Did you at least have the guts to shoot
               him yourself?

     He puts the gun to her forehead.

                          MADELEINE
               You'll never do it. Never. Remember...I
               look like her.

     She grins wickedly.

     He pulls the gun from her head and shoots her in the kneecap.

     EXT. THE RED ARROW INN - LATER

     Cap cars, flashing lights, an ambulance.

                          VOICE OVER
               We took the fall together.

     INT. A HOSPITAL ROOM - LATER

     Madeleine is interrogated by Homicide dicks.

                          VOICE OVER
               Ever the consummate actor, Madeleine
               Sprague confessed to killing Lee by
               concocting a love triangle from the three
               of us...The Bleichert/Blanchard rematch
               fought over her hand, with Lee beating
               Emmett and demanding he "hand over" his
               daughter when she preferred me.

     EXT. THE ENSENADA STREETS - NIGHT - FLASHBACK

     As Madeleine, dressed as a Mexican woman in heavy makeup and
     a large hat, tails Lee back to his motel...

                          VOICE OVER (cont'd)
               Madeleine stalking Lee...Revenge-killing
               him in Ensenada to avenge the Sprague
               honor...No mention of the Black Dahlia
               murder case at all.

     EXT. THE COURTHOUSE - DAY

     Madeleine led away amongst a flock of photographers. Her
     family linked arm-and-arm in the background, crying, only
     Martha looking like she might survive...

                          VOICE OVER (cont'd)
               Her story's enough to get her a psych tag
               as a delusional schizophrenic and ten
               years at Atascadero State Hospital.

     INT. THE POLICE INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY

     Bucky sits at a table, staring into the one-way mirror.

                          VOICE OVER
               So the brass girl took the fall for the
               whole family. And I took the fall for me.
               IAD cleared me on the motel shooting--a
               cop's code make-good for Blanchard's
               snuff.
     WE PULL OUT and see Bucky's cuffs, badge and gun sitting on
     the table in front of him.

                          VOICE OVER (cont'd)
               Afterwards I was fired from the Los
               Angeles Police Department on grounds of
               moral turpitude and conduct unbecoming an
               officer. I thought of turning over Ramona
               in hopes of pulling a grandstander's
               turnabout...

     THE CAMERA DRIFTS THROUGH THE ONE-WAY MIRROR revealing RUSS
     MILLARD standing on the other side.

                          VOICE OVER
               ...but I had people to protect...People
               who already knew that, for the briefest
               of times, and in the darkest of places, I
               had been so, so, good at some things.

     Bucky standing amongst the Dahlia files. He begins pulling
     photos off the walls...

     INT. BUCKY AND KAY'S HOUSE - NIGHT

     The destroyed fairy tale house is in mid-repair. Kay is in
     work clothes, painting a new trim in the living room.

     The front door opens. Bucky stands in the doorway, carrying a
     box of Dahlia files. Kay watches as he crosses the room
     without a word and dumps the box of files into the fireplace.
     He tosses on a match and the box goes up in flames.

     She moves to him.

     INT. A CASTING OFFICE - DAY

     We arrive just as she exits, the outline of her body quickly 
     disappearing into the blackness beyond the office door...

                                             November 1987






	A BLACK SCREEN:

	Various voices:	  "Big six"... "That's six the hard way"...
			  "Seven or eleven"... "Play two"...

	FADE IN:

	EXT.  UPPER EAST SIDE - NEW YORK CITY - NIGHT

	One of the pristine blocks of brownstones where even the
	garbage seems gift wrapped.  The VOICES continue over as
	we move in on a particular building where a DOORMAN is
	holding open the door for a dowager and her poodle.

	The voices continue:  "Hit me"... "Double down"... "Let it
	ride"... "Hit me"... "Anymore for the come out"...
	"Card"...

	In contrast to the outside of this sedate, quiet
	brownstone, we go inside to find...


	INT.  BROWNSTONE APARTMENT

	... a miniature Las Vegas, complete with music, drinks,
	tuxedoed dealers and croupiers:  roulette, craps, Black
	Jack.  Wall to wall people.  The fact that casino gambling
	happens to be illegal in New York doesn't stop these
	Connecticut slummers, hollow-cheek nightlifers, and junior
	wiseguys from having a good time.

	AT THE CARD TABLE

	NICK CONKLIN, holding a dollar cigar, is trying to pull a
	winning hand.  In his late thirties, Nick has the sort of
	quiet good looks that takes an extra glance to appreciate.
	His Moe Ginsburg rent-a-tux is too tight, his ruffled
	shirt, out of date; Nick could care less.

	Two other players are still in the game.  One of them is a
	lithe DEBUTANTE surrounded by an entourage of giggling
	friends and tuxedoed men.  The pot is huge.

	Nick flips two one hundred dollar chips onto the pot.

					NICK
			One, and one on top.

					DEALER
			House sees.

					PLAYER ONE
				(hesitates)
			I'm out.

	Disgusted, he throws down his cards.

	It's down to Nick and the debutante.  The cocky deb gives
	Nick a long look, confident she can win.

					DEBUTANTE
				(her eyes still on
				 Nick)
			I see the deuce, and one to chase
			them home.

	She throws her chips on the pot.  Nick hesitates, then
	decides to match it.

					NICK
			Call.

					DEBUTANTE
				(showing her hand)
			Ladies, aces wired.  Sorry sport.

	Nick turns over his cards, Jacks and tens, not good enough
	to win.  Elated, the deb gets up from the table and joins
	her giggling friends.  Nick walks over to her.

					NICK
			Very nice, Barbie.
				(pointing toward her
				 boyfriend)
			Now, I'd take Ken over there and go
			home.

					DEBUTANTE
			Why's that?

					NICK
			It's time.  That's all.

					BOYFRIEND
			The lady wants to play.  Someone
			should teach you to be a better
			loser, loser.

					NICK
			Listen, Ken --

					BOYFRIEND
			My name is not Ken --

					NICK
			-- I'm offering you the benefit of
			my experience.

					DEBUTANTE
			Looks like you have a lot of
			experience in places like this.  It
			was nice of them to relax the dress
			code for you.

	That draws a laugh from her friends.  The entourage heads
	for the bar.

	CHARLIE SKLOARIS, twenty-three, steps in front of the
	debutante, blocking her path.

	She steps to the side.  Charlie steps with her.  Charlie's
	pushing it, he's always pushing it.  She's not amused.
	Finally, Charlie lets her pass.  He comes up to Nick.

					CHARLIE
			Typical New York woman, big
			attitude, small apartment, no tits.

	Only two things count to Charlie:  his job and his women,
	but not necessarily in that order.

					CHARLIE
			I think she got to you, pappy.

					NICK
				(checking his watch)
			You want a popsicle, go to Good
			Humor.  And don't call me 'pappy.'

					CHARLIE
				(glancing at the
				 door)
			Still, you gotta wonder how she'd
			look in handcuffs.

	Nick, wary, eyes this kid.  Charlie shrugs, spreads his
	arms defensively.  The SOUND of pounding on the front
	door.

	THE DOOR

	splinters.  The bouncer steps back as four helmeted
	emergency service officers -- the first members of the
	raiding party -- rush in.

	Pandemonium.  People rush for the exit -- any exit.

	AT THE BAR

	Nick and Charlie hold up their glasses.

					NICK
				(calmly)
			Alley oop.

	They down their drinks, then set them down.

	Charlie pulls out the Binaca, offering Nick a spritz, but
	Nick is already pulling out his POLICE BADGE and hanging
	it around his neck.  Charlie quickly follows suit.

	A HALF DOZEN COPS

	line the patrons up against the wall.  The Asst. D.A.,
	PATTY ZACHARA, climbs onto the crap table.  A petite,
	nervous woman, Patty has dressed in a Channel suit for the
	occasion.

					ZACHARA
			Settle down.  Hey, quiet... Please.

	Not a prayer.

					NICK
			SHUT THE HELL UP, GODDAMNIT!

	That quiets them.

					NICK
			My name is Conklin.  Let's do this
			fast so I can go home.

	Zachara, annoyed, looks at Nick.

					NICK
				(softer)
			It's all yours.

					ZACHARA
				(reads)
			Under section 216 of the New York
			State Penal code, I serve notice
			that this premise and it's
			occupants...

	NICK

	catches the Debutante's eye across the room.  She smiles
	at him, he was right.  He shrugs, spreads his hands.
	That's life.

	A well groomed middle aged man, who we'll come to know as
	CAVELLO, suddenly bolts from the crowd lined up against
	the wall.

	Charlie spins around to stop him --

					CHARLIE
			Whoa -- where do you think you're
			going, hotdog.

	Cavello butts him with his head, sending Charlie to the
	floor.  Then, crosses his arms in front of his face and
	plunges through the WINDOW.

	Nick, not missing a beat, gives a small sigh as he
	follows.

					NICK
				(sighs)
			Fabulous...

	He takes off after him.


	EXT.  STREET UPPER EAST SIDE - NIGHT

	Nick, short of breath, chases Cavello down the residential
	street, past the dog-walkers, past the doormen, past the
	fur-coated women climbing out of taxies... Unfortunately,
	Cavello has a good half block on him.

	From nowhere, Charlie blasts past leaving Nick a half
	block behind, silently cursing his age.

	AT THE CORNER

	a limo jerks to a halt, and Cavello jumps in.  The limo
	streaks away.

	CHARLIE

	turns to see Nick, hands on knees, gasping for air.

								 CUT TO:

	INT.  LOCKER ROOM - TWO EIGHT PRECINCT - NIGHT

	Now in their street clothes, Charlie and Nick stand in
	front of the mirrors.  Charlie is working his brush and
	hair dryer as if his life depended on it.  Nick, in
	contrast, shoves his hair back with his fingers and
	glowers at himself in the mirror.

					CHARLIE
				(over the dryer)
			... It's not like you were slow or
			anything... I think you did just
			fine.  I think you did great.

					NICK
			Thanks.

	Nick turns to leave.

					CHARLIE
			Hey, hey, where you goin'?

					NICK
			Home.


	EXT.  POLICE PARKING LOT - NIGHT

	Nick strides out the door.  Charlie hurries after him.

					CHARLIE
			Wait up.  You know the guy who did
			the Weismuller through the window --

					NICK
			-- Cavello.  Ronnie Cavello.

	Charlie trails Nick to his motorcycle:  a Harley hog
	complete with wide gleaming fenders and twin tanks.  The
	bike is held together with tape and baling wire.

					CHARLIE
			You know him?

	Nick tries to kick-start this behemoth, but it's not easy.

					NICK
			He works for Frank Abolofia.
			Atlantic City.  Casinos.

					CHARLIE
			So why dive through the glass for a
			nickel and dime bust?

	Charlie puts his foot up on Nick's fender to tie his shoe.
	Nick, spotting an ankle holster peeking from Charlie's
	sock, grabs Charlie's foot.  Charlie teeters.

					NICK
			What's this?

					CHARLIE
			Let go...

	Nick pulls out a Beretta 32.

					CHARLIE
			Back-up.

					NICK
			Get rid of it.

					CHARLIE
			Why?

					NICK
			It's not regulation.  And the only
			way you're gonna stop anybody with
			it is to show it to him, and while
			he's laughing, you can shove it down
			his throat.

					CHARLIE
				(looking at Nick's
				 bike)
			I'll get rid of it when you get rid
			of the egg-beater.

	The Harley comes to life spitting a cloud of blue smoke.
	Nick puts on his paint-flecked helmet, slides down some
	ski goggles.

					CHARLIE
			Nick, let's go hunting.  Bag
			Cavello.

					NICK
			Charlie...

	Nick pops the bike into gear.

					NICK
			... You still got shaving cream on
			your ear.

	Nick rolls out and disappears in a haze of blue smoke.


	EXT.  BELT PARKWAY - VERRAZANO BRIDGE - NIGHT

	WE FIND Nick, a lonely, solitary figure bobbing in and out
	of the lights and shadows.  The SOUND of wind whips
	through his helmet; cold air stings his cheeks... The tail
	lights of Nick's bike disappear into the night.


	EXT.  SUBURBAN STREET - STATEN ISLAND - NIGHT

	Civil service heaven.  Nick hits the cut switch and glides
	past the manicured lawns and well kept houses of this
	development.  A basketball net in every driveway, a Buick
	or Chrysler in every garage.

	One house sticks out.  The lawn is brown, paint is peeling
	off the garage door and newspapers are scattered on the
	driveway.  Nick glides once around the cul de sac looking
	at the house.  His house.  It's as inviting as an open
	grave.  He shoots away.


	INT.  EL GRECO DINER - STATEN ISLAND - NIGHT

	A hanger sized roadhouse, wall to wall red velvet.

	Nick's the sole figure at the counter, coffee and the
	Daily News in front of him.  A NURSE walks in and sits
	down a half dozen seats away.  Nick look up.

					NICK
			Short shift?

					CONNIE
			Yeah... I came to save you.  If
			you're hopeless, I'll pull the plug.

								 CUT TO:

	INT.  CONNIE'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - NIGHT

	Nick and Connie are in bed.  They're both looking up at
	the ceiling.  They've just made love.

					CONNIE
			It's getting too cold even for me,
			Nick.

					NICK
			Connie...

					CONNIE
			All right, how's the new partner?

					NICK
			High spirits, desire, commitment.

					CONNIE
			You'll take care of that.

					NICK
			Give me a break, would you?

					CONNIE
			If you give me one.

	Nick kisses her.  The first suggestion of real affection.
	The SOUND of someone KNOCKING on the door.  Reluctantly,
	they stop.  Connie gets up and puts on her robe.

					NICK
			Are you expecting anyone?

					CONNIE
			I wasn't expecting you.

	She disappears down the hallway.  We HEAR the door open,
	then telling someone to wait.

					CONNIE
				(poking her head in
				 the room)
			Imagine a small, greasy Boy Scout.

								 CUT TO:

	INT.  CONNIE'S APARTMENT

	Nick, wearing only his pants, is doing a slow burn.
	Charlie is holding his hands up defensively.

					CHARLIE
			... I found the goombah... Cavello.
			He's --

					NICK
			-- I should tear your head off.

					CHARLIE
			Whoa, I knew you were going to say
			that.  I absolutely anticipated
			that, Nick.  But I said to myself,
			Charlie, Charlie, we can move up on
			this, so go find Nicklaus... He'll
			be pissed for a moment, but then
			it'll dawn on him --

					NICK
			-- Hey, I got a better chance of
			being hit by a bus then moving up.

	Charlie looks away momentarily, letting it slide.  He
	knows he's on sensitive ground.

					CHARLIE
			... Look... they told me at the
			Greek's you were here.  I'm sorry, I
			never imagined...

					CHARLIE
				(buddy buddy)
			I like her.  She's nice.
				(lowering his voice)
			For her age.

	The bedroom door opens.  Connie enters, dumps Nick's
	clothes on the couch, tosses his gun on top of the pile.
	Without a word, she goes back inside and slams the door
	behind her.

	Nick, pissed, slowly turns to face Charlie.  Charlie
	shrugs.  Nick's got nothing better to do than go.

								 CUT TO:

	INT.  LIME HOUSE - CHINATOWN - NIGHT

	The Lime House is a little piece of Italy in the heart of
	Chinatown, and tonight, it's packed.  Any selection on the
	jukebox that isn't Frank Sinatra is Jerry Vale.  Behind
	the bar are two fat BROTHERS.  One pours drinks, the other
	dishes out Scungilli.  It's three a.m.  It's always three
	a.m. at the Lime House.

	AT THE BACK TABLE

	Our man CAVELLO is unloading steaming Scungilli onto an
	already heaping plate in front of an imperious looking
	JAPANESE MAN.  The Japanese Man, in his mid-fifties, wears
	a gray suit, and not a strand of his jet black hair is out
	of place.

	A Japanese TRANSLATOR, doing his best to translate
	Cavello's heavily accented English, sits between them.

	AT THE BAR

	Charlie is looking straight ahead, afraid Cavello might
	peg him.  Nick is at ease.

					CHARLIE
			What are they doing now?

					NICK
			Eating Scungilli, just like the last
			time you asked.

					CHARLIE
			Who do you think the Jap is?

					NICK
			Maybe Cavello's buying a Subaru.
			How would I know?

					CHARLIE
			I don't blame you for being sore.
			It'll pass when we bag him.

	Charlie, trying to relax, gestures toward his foot.

					CHARLIE
			Whatdaya think?  'Bostonians'.
			Eighty-five bucks.
				(lowering his voice)
			Girls go for shoes.  Second place
			they look.
				(off Nick's
				 reaction)
			Hey, I read it in a magazine.

	Nick's attention is drawn to a trio walking in the door.

					NICK
				(dead serious)
			Charlie, don't do anything.  Promise
			me?

					CHARLIE
			What?

	WHAT THEY SEE:  TWO BODYGUARDS are making a quick sweep of
	the bar.  FRANK ABOLOFIA, s stocky man with silver grey
	hair, sweeps in behind them.  Abolofia has mitts like a
	meat packer and a fifty dollar manicure.  A heavyweight
	Mafioso.

					NICK
			Frank Abolofia.

					CHARLIE
			The Wolf?

	Abolofia walks to Cavello's table.  All rise and shake
	hands.  The two hitters take seats at the bar.  The two
	brothers scramble to serve their distinguished guests.

					NICK
				(in a whisper)
			Some party.

					CHARLIE
			Maybe we should do something?

					NICK
			Charlie, take your gum, stick it
			under your ass and keep it warm.

	Nick turns away, resumes his drink.

	NICK'S POV IN THE MIRROR BEHIND THE BAR:  two new Japanese
	men step in the door.  Early twenties, spiky hair, dark
	Versace suits.

	NUMBER ONE

	wears tortoise shell shades.  He coolly checks out the
	room then nods to --

	NUMBER TWO

	who pulls a Spas 12, automatic shotgun from under his
	coat, and spits out three rounds.  A window shatters.
	Everyone hits the floor.

	NUMBER ONE

	slowly walks toward Cavello's table.

	NUMBER TWO

	covers the floor.  Abolofia's bodyguards show their empty
	hands.

	NICK AND CHARLIE

	on the floor.  They don't have the artillery for this guy
	either.

	AT THE TABLE

	Our Japanese businessman knows these people.  He eyes them
	contemptuously.

	Abolofia has put enough people in this situation to be
	philosophical about it.  He stops chewing.  A tiny
	hand motion to his bodyguards is enough to stop any
	precipitous action.

					NUMBER ONE
				(in Japanese)
			Give it to me.

	The Japanese businessman looking straight ahead.  A long,
	silent pause... Then, still not facing him:

					BUSINESSMAN
				(in Japanese)
			Go to hell.

	Number One slips his fingers beneath his shades, massaging
	his eyes.  IN A FLASH, he pulls a shuto from under his
	coat.  The 18 inch blade gleams like a neon tube.

	He presses the tip of the blade against the businessman's
	throat.

	CHARLIE

	his hand close around the grip of the Beretta.  He unsnaps
	the ankle holster.  The SNAP can be heard across the room.
	Nick's hand closes around Charlie's and squeezes till the
	knuckles turn white.

					CHARLIE
				(in a whisper)
			What are you doing?

					NICK
			Saving your life.

	NUMBER TWO

	levels the scattergun at Nick and Charlie.

	AT THE TABLE - NUMBER ONE

	calmly holds the blade at the man's throat as he reaches
	into the man's jacket and removes a small, rectangular,
	plastic-wrapped parcel.

	He feels its weight, then flips it to NUMBER TWO.

	Abolofia, realizing that whatever is going on doesn't
	affect him or his, resumes eating.

					ABOLOFIA
			You people are wild... Wild.

	NUMBER ONE backs the blade off.  The man raises his napkin
	to the small wound.  A droplet of blood has stained his
	shirt collar.  NUMBER ONE turns around as if to leave.

	What happens next could be a whim, an after thought.
	Number One spins around and THRUSTS the blade deep into
	the man's chest.  He withdraws it with a half twist, and
	in the same motion fatally slashes the translator's throat
	before the old man's body hits the floor.

	Blood pours from the businessman's mouth onto his
	Scungilli, spreading across the white cloth and onto the
	floor.

	CAVELLO

	reaches for a gun under his coat.  But NUMBER TWO pumps
	two rounds into his face.  At this range, there's not much
	left.

	The killers slowly back out the door, covering the room
	with the scattergun.  The minute the door shuts, Nick
	leaps up, pulling his shield and revolver.

					NICK
				(shouting)
			Police officers.  Everybody stay
			put.
				(to Charlie)
			Get back up.

	Abolofia's eyebrows rise at this development.

	Nick bolts out the door leaving Charlie in charge.  He's
	never been in charge before.

					CHARLIE
				(nervously showing
				 shield)
			Police.


	EXT.  THE LIME HOUSE - NIGHT

	A Lincoln tears around the corner to pick the killers up.

	Nick flies out the Lime House door and hits the ground.

	Number Two pumps out shells as fast as he can squeeze the
	trigger.  He's wild.  The front windows of the Lime House
	shatter.

	The LIMO DRIVER jerks to a halt.  Number Two tosses the
	package to him.

	Nick empties his revolver.  Number Two goes down.

	The driver floors the accelerator, leaving Number One to
	take off on foot.  Nick follows, reloading as he runs.


	INT.  THE LIME HOUSE

	Everyone's frozen on the floor.

					CHARLIE
			Call 911.  Tell them an officer
			needs assistance.  Say ten thirteen.

	Nothing from the owner who looks at Abolofia.  Charlie
	grabs the owner by his collar and shoves him toward the
	phone.

					CHARLIE
			Do it, you dumb bastard!

	Suddenly Charlie feels something wet at his feet.  He
	looks down to see that he's standing in a pool of blood
	from the massacre.  So much for his new shoes.

	He wheels around, then quickly backs out the door.


	EXT.  STREET - DOWN THE BLOCK FROM THE LIME HOUSE

	Deserted.  The wail of police sirens in the distance.
	Charlie has his gun out.  He's drenched in sweat.  Where
	is his partner?

					CHARLIE
			NICK...!  Shit... SHIT!!

								 CUT TO:

	ANOTHER STREET - ALLEY - NIGHT

	Nick, gun drawn, slowly rounds the corner to the alley:
	it's the ad hoc drugstore for the night.  Drugs going up
	and down in pails, two dozen junkies buying, shooting,
	slumped on the ground.  Everyone scatters -- the one's
	that can.

	AN ABANDONED PAIL

	swings slowly back and forth from three stories up.  Nick
	cautiously moves down the alley, holding the gun in both
	hands.  A Junkie steps out of a doorway, Nick swings his
	gun and nearly blows him away.

	NUMBER ONE

	We see his eyes first as he steps out of the darkness at
	the back of the alley.  From now on we'll call him KOBO.
	His sunglasses are on his forehead; his hands dropped
	casually at his side.  A very cool character.

	Kobo slowly raises his hand, and making a gun with his
	finger, slowly points and "shoots" at Nick... He lowers
	his hand.

					NICK
			On the ground, man.  NOW!!

	Kobo cups his hands around his ear.  He doesn't understand
	English.  Nick, keeping his gun fixed, comes up to him and
	kicks out his legs.

	Kobo falls flat on his chest.

	Nick pulls out his cuffs.  But Kobo lunges for Nick's
	ankle and yanks it toward him.  Nick stumbles backward;
	Kobo's on his feet.  Before Nick can stand, Kobo lands a
	brutal kick to the side of Nick's head.

	Nick gets up, barrels into him.  Kobo knees Nick in the
	solar plexus, then lands two more well placed kicks in
	Nick's back.  It's not that Nick's a bad fighter, it's
	that this kid is so damn fast.

	Nick slowly gets to his feet.  KOBO lands two more brutal
	shots to the side of Nick's head.  He's a bloody mess.

	TWO POLICE CARS

	stop at the end of the alley.  FOUR OFFICERS climb out.

	CHARLIE

	joins the cops as they run down the alley to find Nick
	getting pummeled.

	Charlie shoots at Kobo.  Misses.  Kobo turns to see the
	five cops, guns drawn.

	Nick, on one knee, spits out blood and a few teeth.

	Kobo calmly slips the shuto out of his coat pocket and
	drops it next to Nick.  The blade gleams in the light.
	That was next.  Nick got lucky.

	Kobo towers imperiously above Nick.  Their eyes lock.  We
	hold then...

								 FADE TO BLACK.

	FADE IN:

	NICK'S LIVING ROOM - STATEN ISLAND - MORNING

	There isn't a stick of furniture, but that's not the half
	of it.  In the middle of the room is a motorcycle on a
	centerstand.  A drop cloth is spread around it, tools
	neatly aligned.  It's a Harley -- but this one is in
	perfect condition.

	A phone RINGS insistently from off screen, then stops.

					NICK (O.S.)
			Yeah... sure, sure I'll be down.

	Nick walks in, naked.  Every muscle aches.  One side of
	his face is completely swollen.  He has a band-aid over
	his right eye; some blood caked on his earlobe.  He stops
	to twist a spark plug in with a ratchet, but it snaps.

								 CUT TO:

	INT.  EIGHT - THREE PRECINCT - DAY

	CAPT. OLIVER, early forties, walks between Charlie and
	Nick as they head toward the Medical Examiner's room.
	Oliver doesn't face Nick as he speaks; no love lost
	between these two.

					OLIVER
			How big a package we talking about?

					NICK
				(holding up his
				 hands)
			This by this...

					OLIVER
			Dope?

					NICK
			Not in that company.

					OLIVER
			The old man was a Japanese paper
			manufacturer.  Hotel room and rental
			car were full of it.

					CHARLIE
			Full of what?

					OLIVER
				(annoyed)
			Art and stationary paper.  Cavello
			had five hundred thousand in his
			attache case.

	Nick rubs the back of his neck in obvious pain.

					OLIVER
			One guy do all the damage?

					NICK
			Yeah.

					OLIVER
			Thought you knew your way around
			dark alleys, detective.

	Oliver goes through the swinging doors into the Examiner's
	room.  Charlie shoots Nick a look.  Nick let's it slide.


	INT.  MEDICAL EXAMINATION ROOM

	A TECHIE is showing the night's harvest to Charlie, Nick
	and Oliver.  They're standing over the body of the middle-
	aged Japanese man.

					TECHIE
			... The old man's suit was Japanese.
			The hitter's was Saville row.  No
			I.D.  We're doing a peel now.

	AT ANOTHER TABLE

	Another techie is carefully removing the skin from Number
	Two's fingertips.

	Charlie shuts his eyes and turns away, trying not to throw
	up.

					TECHIE
			There's something you got to see.

	He whips back the sheet, the body is nude.  A towel covers
	the genitals.  Except for the feet, hands, neck, and face,
	the body is covered with elaborate tattoos:  flowers and
	blood, dragons and snakes.

					TECHIE
			What's wrong with this picture?

					CHARLIE
				(nervously)
			I got a tattoo.  Birdie on the ball.
			We all got them when we finished
			basic at Camp Lejune.

					NICK
			Charlie.

					TECHIE
			I thought you guys were trained
			observers?

	They look up surprised.  The techie picks up a hand.  The
	third and forth fingers have been neatly amputated.

					TECHIE
			Eight fingers.
				(ironically)
			Hey, it was a trick question.

								 CUT TO:

	INT.  INTERROGATION ROOM

	ABOLOFIA is seated in chair next to his LAWYER.  Nick,
	Oliver, and a third detective are grilling him.

					ABOLOFIA
			He was with a friend, sure.  I shake
			hands with the guy and a minute
			later he's bleeding all over my
			socks.

					ATTORNEY
			Will that do officers?  My client
			has had a terrible shock.

					NICK
			Yeah, he's not used to seeing other
			people do the killing.

					ATTORNEY
			I won't tolerate harassment!

					OLIVER
			What about the package?

					ATTORNEY
			We know nothing about it.

	Silence.  Abolofia looks at Nick, then at Oliver.

					ABOLOFIA
			Hard to believe a trained police
			officer could let this kind of thing
			happen right in front of his face.

					NICK
			I did make a mistake.  I let the
			wrong guy get hit.

	Abolofia doesn't blink an eye, goes for the jugular.

					ABOLOFIA
			Cheer up, Nick.  I'm sure it's
			easier to pick a dead man's pocket.

	Nick springs from his feet.  Oliver grabs Nick before he
	can get close to Abolofia.

					ATTORNEY
			That's it, we're through!

								 CUT TO:

	KOBO

	the Japanese killer who smashed in Nick's face last night.
	He's sitting in an interrogation room an hour later with a
	DETECTIVE and a JAPANESE TRANSLATOR.  He won't talk.

	OBSERVATION ROOM

	Nick and Oliver watching through the glass.

					OLIVER
			Doesn't speak a word of English.
			And he won't speak Japanese either.
			No papers.  The Japanese embassy is
			very interested.

					NICK
			Why?

					OLIVER
			He's wanted in Japan.  They want him
			first.  Then we can have him.

					NICK
			What?

	Oliver nods.  That's the way it is.

	ON KOBO

	he turns and looks at Nick.  He can't possibly see him
	through the one way glass but he knows Nick's there.

	ON NICK

	looking at him.

	ON KOBO

	making a cutting mark across his forehead, right where
	Nick's bandage is.  It's uncanny.

								 CUT TO:

	INT.  OLIVER'S OFFICE - LATER

	Nick is sitting in front of Oliver's desk.  The sunlight
	makes him wince; wincing makes his face hurt.

					OLIVER
			Japanese embassy talks to state
			department.  State talks to police
			plaza.  They to me and me to you.
			Shit rolls down hill.

	Oliver drops a file folder on the desk.  Nick opens it:
	petty cash, vouchers and plane tickets.

					OLIVER
			You and Charlie are taking the Jap
			home, tonight.

					NICK
			What...?  What if I say no?

					OLIVER
			Check your gun before you leave.
			They're not allowed in Japan.  It's
			a nice, safe country.

					NICK
			Why me?

					OLIVER
			They said send a detective if I
			could spare one.
				(then)
			I can always spare you.

	Nick bridles at the insult.  Oliver's had a hard-on for
	Nick for years, and Nick's tired of it.

					NICK
				(soft)
			You got something to say to me,
			Captain?

	Oliver doesn't want to get into it.

					OLIVER
			Yeah.  Have a wonderful flight.

								 CUT TO:

	THE ORANGE SUN

	on the tail of a Japan Airlines 747.  A driving rain
	storm.  The plane taxies down the runway and disappears
	into the black rain.


	INT.  AIRLINER

	Kobo, handcuffed and shackled, is in the center seat.
	Nick and Charlie sit on either side.  Charlie is holding
	"Bachelors Japan" in one hand.  Nick's in a sour mood.

					CHARLIE
			... Nick, you're the one that's
			always saying you never go anywhere.

					NICK
			I was thinking the Poconos, Charlie.
			Maybe Vegas.

					CHARLIE
			What are you missing?  Riding your
			motorcycle to the nurse's house.
			That shit is sadder than Ethiopia.

					NICK
			Beats forty hours on a plane.

					CHARLIE
			They say we got to turn around and
			come right back.  That's what they
			say.  I got a plan.

	The last thing Nick wants to hear -- too late.

					CHARLIE
			I call, right?  I say I got the
			dreaded thirty six-hour Asian shits
			from some raw clam and we stretch it
			into three days.  You and I become a
			driving force on the local Geisha
			scene.

					NICK
			Not a prayer.

					CHARLIE
				(grinning)
			Hey, come on, big guy like you, cop
			from New York.  You're gonna be the
			biggest thing to hit town since
			Godzilla.

	Nick can't help but smile at this kid.  Charlie looks down
	at the guide book.

					CHARLIE
			Says here, it's very impolite to
			touch someone while you're talking
			to them...
				(nudges Kobo)
			Guess that means you can't talk and
			screw at the same time, huh, hotdog?
			What's the matter, no -- speaky-the-
			language?  Understand this:  You
			will never ever fuck with my partner
			again.

	Nothing from Kobo who is looking straight ahead.  He
	doesn't understand.

					NICK
			Shut-up, Charlie.

	A beat, then Charlie reads a Japanese phrase from the
	book.  A slight facial response from Kobo.  Charlie tries
	it again.  This time Kobo laughs openly.

					NICK
			What'd you say?

					CHARLIE
			Where is the subway station, please.

	Kobo keeps laughing; it's obviously not what Charlie said.

					NICK
			Get a new book.

								 CUT TO:

	INT.  AIRLINER - LATER

	The cabin is now darkened.  Kobo and Nick are asleep.  Not
	Charlie, he's still at his book, and listening to U2 on
	his Walkman.  Nick rolls over and opens his eyes to see
	Charlie watching him.  He shuts them hoping to avoid talk.
	Too late.

					CHARLIE
			Nick... You up?

					NICK
			No.

	Charlie removes his headphones.

					CHARLIE
			Nick, have I been a good partner?

					NICK
			Number five with a bullet.

	Nick shuts his eyes.

					CHARLIE
			I just want you to know... I mean
			anybody who says you ever took has
			got to deal with me.

					NICK
			Go to sleep, Charlie.

					CHARLIE
			You didn't take, did you...?  You
			hear things.

	Nick opens his eyes.

					NICK
			I worked the three nine in Queens,
			Charlie.

					CHARLIE
				(surprised)
			I didn't know.

					NICK
			The lieutenant was on the pad along
			with the rest of the squad.  I was
			new, didn't know shit.  When the
			feathers flew, I got called in front
			of the special prosecutor.  It's on
			the top of my personnel file.  They
			think I'm dirty or I cut a deal.
			Doesn't leave you with a lot of
			friends either way.

	Nick shuts his eyes.

					NICK
			I might as well have done something.
			I've been paying for it every
			goddamn day since I got
			transferred...

	HOLD on Nick then...

								 CUT TO:

	INT.  NARITA AIRPORT - JAPAN - DAY

	Nick and Charlie, with Kobo between them, are a strange
	sight in a sea of Japanese faces.  Kobo's hands are cuffed
	behind his back.  Nick also has Kobo cuffed to his wrist.
	The cops are rumpled, exhausted, showing two days of
	stubble.  Kobo looks sharp and wide awake.

	A pair of attractive teenage girls walks past them.

					CHARLIE
			Whoa.  Nick, we're in paradise.

	A PAIR

	of white gloved hands belonging to a Tokyo police officer
	holds up a small, hand letter sign that says:
	CONKLIN/SKLOARIS.  The man holding the sign is NAGASHIMA.
	Two other police officers in spotless tan uniforms stand
	at his side.

	Nick, holding Kobo by his arm, steps up to the police and
	show his I.D.  Nagashima bows.

					NAGASHIMA
			Officers Conklin and -- and...
				(he can't say
				 Charlie's name)
			... gentlemen, welcome.  I am
			assistant inspector Nagashima.

	They show their I.D.

					NICK
			You going to take this crap off our
			hands?

					NAGASHIMA
				(confused)
			Crap...?  Oh, the prisoner.  Yes.

	He barks some orders to the officers who immediately take
	Kobo by the arms and put cuffs on him.  Nick unfastens
	his cuff when they're through.

	In contrast to Nagashima's gentility, the cops are rough
	with the prisoner.

					CHARLIE
				(extends his hand)
			Charlie.  Kon-ich-iwa.

	Nagashima shakes his hand.  Bows.  Charlie bows back.
	Nick wouldn't bow if his life depended on it.  Nagashima
	hands Nick an official looking document.

					NAGASHIMA
			If you will please give this to the
			customs inspector he will expidate
			-- expedite you.  We have a car and
			a driver outside.

					NICK
			Right.

					CHARLIE
				(bows)
			Arigato.

	Nick grabs Charlie by the arm and starts for the customs
	line.

					NICK
			Givin' you a book is like givin' a
			baby a gun.

					CHARLIE
			Hey, when in Rome --

					NICK
			In Rome, I'll bow.

								 CUT TO:

	INT.  CUSTOMS BOOTH - DAY

	NICK and CHARLIE make their way through the crowd toward
	the head of a long line.  They dump their bags on the
	counter.  The INSPECTOR, furious that they have taken cuts
	in line, barks at them in Japanese.

					NICK
			Inspector Nagashima told me to give
			you this.

	He hands the Inspector the official looking document.  The
	Inspector scans the paper.  Hands it back to them.

					INSPECTOR
				(broken English)
			You must get in line behind the
			rest.

					NICK
			We're cops.  Pol-ice-men.

	The Inspector signals a nearby POLICEMAN.  The Inspector
	says something in Japanese.  Hands the policeman the
	document.  The policeman shakes his head, amused, points
	to the end of the line.

					NICK
			Fellas, get serious.

	From off screen someone CALLS OUT:

					MAN (O.S.)
			Nick!

	Nick and Charlie turn to see KOBO, their prisoner,
	standing on the other side of the thick plastic divider.
	The handcuffs are off.  The three alleged 'policemen' are
	heading out the door behind him.  It was a set-up:  Nick
	and Charlie have been had.

					KOBO
				(perfect English)
			Thanks for the ride, detective.

	He slowly backs away from the glass as if he had all the
	time in the world, finally disappearing in the crowd.

								 CUT TO:

	NICK AND CHARLIE

	trying to shove past the customs inspectors who are
	wrestling them aside.

					NICK
			Cops!  He's our prisoner!

	Two more policemen arrive.  Nick and Charlie are thrown up
	against the wall.  Out come the cuffs.  SNAP!

					NICK
			What's going on?  We're the good
			guys!

								 CUT TO:

	INT.  TOKYO POLICE HEADQUARTERS - DAY

	Fifty identical desks.  Fifty identical phones.  Fifty
	identically dressed men in white shirts and ties working
	under the fluorescent lights of this large open room.

	We GLIDE PAST the rows of desk to find INSPECTOR OHASHI,
	mid forties, sitting behind a perfectly arranged desk.
	Ohashi prides himself on order.

	Nick and Charlie are standing in front of him.

					NICK
			Get me something like an Identi-Kit
			and I'll give you a description.

	Ohashi remains poker faced.  He continues to arrange
	papers and apply his hanko (personal seal) to the bottom
	of a stack of official papers.

					CHARLIE
			There must be some witnesses from
			the airport?

	Still nothing from the good inspector.

					NICK
			What is it, tea time?

	Still nothing from Ohashi.  Finally:

					OHASHI
				(quiet rage)
			You lost a man we wanted for some
			time.  It was very incompetent on
			your part, officer.

					NICK
			Incompetent is letting people waltz
			through a secure area wearing your
			uniforms, carrying official
			documents.

	Ohashi bows slightly, we're not sure why.

					NICK
			I want a gun.

					OHASHI
			It is not allowed.

					NICK
			We're police officers.

					OHASHI
			You're foreigners.

					NICK
			Work with me.  I want your best
			detective.

	Pause.  Ohashi returns to his papers.  Nick can't believe
	it.

					NICK
			Hey, inspector, I don't intend to
			take the rap for this.

					OHASHI
				(not looking up)
			Do you know what this is?

	Ohashi holds up the document that was handed to Nick at
	the airport.

					OHASHI
			It's a laundry list.  Go home,
			detective.

	Nick studies him for a beat, then turns away.  To Charlie:

					NICK
			Let's go.

					CHARLIE
			Nick, we can't just --

					NICK
			I said let's go, Charlie.

	Reluctantly they head towards the door, passing long rows
	of bureaucrats, telephones ringing off the hook.  Nick
	stops at the door, spots a fuse box nearby.  He glances
	back to make sure no one is looking.

	Nick pulls out his handcuffs.  Charlie can't figure out
	what the hell he's doing.  Nick attaches one cuff to the
	main lever then yanks it down.

	The lights go out.  The fan's stop; so do the typewriters;
	so does the air conditioning.  Dead silence.

	Nick attaches the other cuff to a pipe, snaps it shut.
	Now it's impossible to left the main lever.

	From the far end of the room:

					OHASHI
			What are you doing?!

	Nick drops the key down the water fountain drain.

					NICK
			Your best detective, Ohashi.

								 CUT TO:

	EXT.  POLICE STATION - DAY

	Nick and Charlie cross the street.  Charlie's trying to
	read the name from the piece of paper Ohashi has given
	them.

					CHARLIE
			... Detective Ich-iro Matsu-moto.
			Hey, we're getting Mr. Moto on our
			side.

					NICK
			Let's grab some food.

					CHARLIE
			First decent idea you've had.

	Charlie pulls out his 'Footloose in Tokyo" book, flips
	through the pages.

					CHARLIE
			Food... Food, here we go.  Tokyo
			offers a wide variety of food.  It's
			best to sample the local
			specialties, including sashaimi,
			soba, and world renown Kobe beef...

	Nick goes into a restaurant.  Charlie drops the book,
	disgusted with Nick's choice.  Charlie reluctantly follows
	him in.  REVEAL it's a Shakey's Pizza restaurant.

								 CUT TO:

	EXT.  HOUSING PROJECT - SHIN OKUBO - DAY

	Rows of post-modern buildings of odd shaped windows and
	brightly painted concrete walls.  Nick and Charlie are
	searching for the Japanese cop's building.  They can't
	speak the language; they can't read the signs; and half
	the buildings don't have numbers.  It's a nightmare.

					CHARLIE
			This should be it...

					NICK
			You said that in the last two
			places.

	Charlie holds out the paper to a passing man.

					CHARLIE
			Kore?  Doku?  Kore doku?

	The man gestures toward the building Charlie was pointing
	to.

					NICK
			Okay, you were right.

	Charlie grins, satisfied.


	INT.  HOUSING DEVELOPMENT - CORRIDOR - DAY

	The boys are knocking on a door.  Nick turns the handle.
	It's unlocked.

	THE APARTMENT

	A four tatami room.  An unholy mess:  Food packages, beer
	bottles, stacks of papers and file folders.  Framed
	pictures of long dead relatives hang on the wall.

					CHARLIE
			This the right place?

					NICK
			I hope not.

	A WOMAN now appears at the door.  Middle aged, wizened
	face, in a full traditional Kimono.

					CHARLIE
			Konichiwa.  Ichiro Matsumoto?

	The woman babbles bird-like in rapid Japanese.  She bows.
	They're in the right place.

								 CUT TO:

	EXT.  SIDE STREET - MINIMAI MURAMATSU - NIGHT

	The jammed streets are barely wide enough to get a
	motorcycle down.  It's a bad neighborhood, one of the
	poorest in Tokyo.

	We spot the small kimono clad WOMAN, clip-clopping on
	wooden geta, leading Nick and Charlie through this
	labyrinth.

					CHARLIE
				(looking around)
			Getting very weird.

					NICK
			I'd feel better if we had some heat.

					CHARLIE
			Maybe we should bail?

	Seeing they've stopped, the woman gestures for them to
	hurry up, then disappears around the corner.

					NICK
				(looking at the maze
				 of streets)
			Think we could find our way back?

								 CUT TO:

	A GARISH PINK SIGN - PINK SARON BAR

	A poor man's idea of a bar.  The woman points inside,
	chirps away in Japanese, bows, then hurries off leaving
	Nick and Charlie on their own.

	INSIDE PINK SARON

	Nick and Charlie disappear into darkness as the woven
	flaps shut behind them.  A vintage wurlitzer juke box
	glows across the room.  An Enka plays.  (Haunting Japanese
	blues.)

					MAN'S VOICE (FROM THE DARKNESS)
			Big shots from New York.  I like
			your style!

	ICHIRO MATSUMOTO steps into a pool of light just inches
	from them.  He is a short overweight man looking every
	minute of his fifty-five years.  His white short sleeve
	shirt is too tight; his narrow tie spotted in the middle;
	his collar soaked in sweat.  He's not drunk yet, but he's
	been at it a while.  Call him Ich.

					ICH
				(bowing)
			Detective Ichiro Matsumoto.  I'm the
			man you're looking for.

	This is Ohashi's best man?  Well, at least he speaks
	English.

					ICH
			The man you are looking for, Kobo,
			was a member of the Samaguchi-gummi.
			A Yakuza.

	Ich nods, offers them what's left of his Sapphoro beer.
	They shake their heads.  Ich finishes it.

					NICK
			Where do we start looking for this
			guy?

					ICH
			Where would you look for the mafia?

					CHARLIE
			The back room at Lombardi's after
			the Columbus Day Parade.  Under the
			bed.  In the mayor's office.
			Everywhere.

	Ich heads for the door without saying a word.

					NICK
			Where're you going, Ichiro?

					ICH
				(stops, faces them)
			The mayor's office, under the bed,
			the back room at Lombardi's.
				(tucking in his
				 shirt tail)
			And call me Ich.

								 CUT TO:

	INT.  ICHIBANKAN BAR BUILDING - KABUKI CHO - NIGHT

	Imagine an ultra modern indoor shopping mall, except there
	aren't any stores.  The only product sold here is
	pleasure:  Bars, hostess clubs, Turkish baths.  A post-
	modern red light district with music piped in and
	automated doormen.


	INT.  LAS VEGAS WELCOME CLUB

	Hip, younger Japanese are wedged together at the long
	chrome bar.  The GUYS sport leather jackets and Raybans.
	The GIRLS are decked out in fifties American party dresses
	and short cropped hair.  Jerry Lee Lewis wails in the
	background.

	Nick, Ich and Charlie are at one end of the long bar.  Ich
	is drinking them both under the table.

					ICH
				(singing)
			"Goodness, gracious, great balls of
			fire."
				(raising glass for
				 toast)
			To the killer.  Jerry Lee Lewis.

					NICK
				(checking his watch)
			Jerry Lee Lewis, Elvis, Dinky Doo
			And The Don't's.  Let's book,
			Charlie.  If he starts on Motown,
			we'll be here all night.

					ICH
			No, this is the place for the young
			Yakuza.

					NICK
			That's what you said in the last
			three piss pots.

	Ich sets down his drink, pours more sake for Nick and
	Charlie then for himself.  He's having a great time.

					ICH
			I love you people.  The music, the
			clothes, the movies... Japanese
			respect only what is Japanese.

	Nick glances at Charlie.

					NICK
			It's incredible.  Hit him or
			something.

					CHARLIE
			I don't think he'd feel it.

					ICH
				(beginning to slur
				 his words)
			Americans change everything.  When I
			was young the city was wood and
			paper... I was ten when the bombers
			came.  I lived underground for three
			days.  When I came up, the city was
			gone... A ball of fire.

	Nick gets to his feet.  Ich grabs him by the arm, stopping
	him.

					ICH
			It began to rain, Nick.  You know
			what color the rain was?

	Ich doesn't give him a chance to answer.

					ICH
			Black... It was black from the ash.
			Very impressive.  You Americans, you
			could make black rain.

	Ich polishes off his drink.  An awkward silence.  Charlie,
	wanting to lighten the mood --

					CHARLIE
				(leaning close)
			Say Ich, between friends, where can
			I grab some squish around here?

	Nick sighs, digs in his pocket for some yen for the bill.

					ICH
			Squid?

					CHARLIE
			Pussy, ass, soft personnel.

	Ich looks up to see a picturesque, blood-haired American
	WOMEN in a tight silk blouse and skirt.  She works here
	and has obviously heard Charlie.

					ICH
			Ah, Joyce...
				(in Japanese)
			How are you tonight?

					JOYCE
				(in Japanese)
			Hello, Ich.  Johnny Walker?

	Ich nods.  Joyce's Japanese is impeccable.  She's a part-
	time bartender, translator, model.  One of Japan's western
	wanderers.  She's sliding past thirty, but only her weary
	eyes give it away.  She is about to pour Ich another
	drink.

					NICK
			Don't give him any more.

					JOYCE
			He gets as much as he wants.

	Charlie extends his hand to Joyce.  She ignores it.

					CHARLIE
			Hello hello, Charlie Skloaris.  New
			York City.

	She refills Ich's glass.

					CHARLIE
			My partner and I are cops.
				(lowering his voice)
			We're on a very big assignment here.
				(nothing from Joyce)
			When do you get off?

					JOYCE
			Right when you're being tucked into
			bed.

	Cold.

					ICH
			You should be nicer to my American
			friends, Joyce.

					JOYCE
			They wouldn't appreciate it, Ich.
			Trust me.

	She says something in Japanese to Ich as she eyes the
	cops.  Then, she walks off.

					ICH
			Joyce can be nice.

					CHARLIE
				(brightening)
			What'd she say?

					ICH
				(big smile)
			That I should let you pay for the
			drinks.
				(raising his glass)
			Kampai.

								 CUT TO:

	EXT.  ICHIBANKAN BAR BUILDING - NIGHT

	Charlie and Nick are trying to help a besotted Ich find a
	taxi, but no one will take him.  Ich is shouting half
	English, half Japanese phrases.

					ICH
			... We got to keep looking.  Track
			him down!  Great balls of fire!

					NICK
				(frustrated, to a
				 cabbie)
			What's the problem here?

	The cabbie ignores them.

					WOMAN (O.S.)
			You don't speak the language.  I'll
			drop him off.

	They turn to see Joyce standing behind them.

					ICH
			Ah, Joyce...

	The rest is slurred Japanese.  Joyce speaks to a cabbie in
	Japanese.  The rear door swings open.  She helps Ich in.
	Joyce climbs in.

					ICH
				(out the window)
			See you tomorrow!

	The taxi pulls away.  Nick and Charlie watch it go.

					NICK
			Not a prayer.

								 CUT TO:

	EXT.  STREET - FOUR A.M.

	An early morning wind jostles the red paper lantern and
	plucks at the tails of dragon-like banners hanging outside
	the shops.  Nick and Charlie are walking down this narrow
	sidestreet on the way back to their hotel.

					CHARLIE
			... He's a sorry old guy, but I like
			him.

					NICK
			He couldn't find his ass with both
			hands.

	A brand new Kawasaki 1000 motorcycle with windshield and
	full farings gleams under a street light.

					CHARLIE
			Now that's the kind of motorcycle I
			want to see you on.

					NICK
				(muttering)
			Sure, a rice burning crotch
			rocket...

					CHARLIE
			Nick, how we gonna bag this guy
			without any help?  Maybe I should
			work on that girl Joyce, she speaks
			the language.

	Nick glances over at his partner, smiles.  But before he
	can respond --

	The DULL ROAR of a half dozen motorcycles in the distance
	breaks the pre-dawn stillness.

	TWENTY BOSOZOKU (BIKERS)

	on their multi-cylinder high tech street bombers, creep
	around the corner and slowly ride toward Nick and Charlie.

	We get a better look at them:  turbo punk Elvis-samurai
	hybrids -- some wearing a slipper under their headbands,
	courtesy of their girlfriends; some in leopard skin pants.
	And tattoos...

	They head straight for Nick and Charlie, then, at the last
	moment, split and float away IN SLOW MOTION, as if the
	cops didn't exist.

	Suddenly, the street is empty again.  Silent except for
	the SOUND of the wind beating against paper lanterns,
	rustling the wind chimes...

	Hold on Nick and Charlie standing in the middle of the
	street, realizing just how far away from home they are.

								 DISSOLVE TO:

	EXT.  HOTEL - THE NEXT MORNING

	A rocket shaped building:  a mixture of Dutch Gable and
	Japanese Minka roof.  The mid-day sun beats down on a
	particular room.


	INT.  HOTEL ROOM

	Nick and Charlie are sacked out.  They never bothered to
	pull the curtains.  THE SOUND OF KNOCKING at the door.

					ICH (O.S.)
			Nick!

					NICK
			Give us a break...

					ICH (O.S.)
			It's Ichiro.  Ich.

					NICK
			Leave the rice cake outside and go
			home!

	But Ich persists.

	AT THE DOOR

	As Nick opens up.  Ich bows.  He's now clean shaven and
	has put on a clean shirt.

					ICH
			There's been a murder.  Yakuza.  You
			should come.

								 CUT TO:

	INT.  PRINTING PLANT - DAY

	The murder scene.  NO SOUND.

	A SERIES OF SHOTS:

	A BODY FROM THE WAIST DOWN in the claws of six foot
	working robotic.  The tattooed covered legs swing back and
	forth like a pendulum.

	THE TORSO is wedged in between two enormous printing
	rollers.

	THE HEAD is resting in the middle of a conveyer belt.
	It's been drenched in black printer's ink which has begun
	to congeal.

	WE SLOWLY TRACK PAST Ich, Charlie, and Nick, watching.
	Charlie has the dry heaves.

	REAL SOUND as we reveal the full crime scene.  Instead of
	the usual cigar smoke, camera flashes and radio chatter,
	there is order and quiet.  A slow underwater dance.

	INSPECTOR OHASHI

	quietly gives an order.  Someone turns off the robotic.
	The severed legs stop swinging.

	Nick, Charlie and Ich walk over to Ohashi.  Ich bows
	deeply.  Ohashi doesn't acknowledge any of them, talks to
	a man holding a tape measurer.

					NICK
			Could you fill me in?

					OHASHI
			Why don't you ask your chief
			detective?

	Ich looks down at the floor.

					NICK
			Because I want you to tell me.

					OHASHI
			The young are eating the old,
			something that usually doesn't
			happen here.

					NICK
			Can we skip the poetry, inspector?

	Ohashi pauses.  Ich looks at Nick as if to warn him he
	can't speak to Ohashi that way.

					OHASHI
			There's a war, detective, between
			two rival groups.  The man who
			escaped, Kobo, leads the younger
			group.  They did this.

					ICH
			Kobo's a wild boy.  He was a
			lieutenant in the Sammaguchi-gummi.

					OHASHI
				(in Japanese)
			Excellent, Officer Matsumoto.  How
			is your investigation going?

					ICH
				(in Japanese)
			Well, sir.  Thank you for giving me
			the opportunity to work with these
			distinguished gentlemen.

	He bows.  It's pathetic.

					POLICE LIEUTENANT
			Looking for clues in the bottom of a
			sake bottle, Matsumoto?

	Laughter all around.

					OHASHI
			He's an officer of great
			distinction.

	Another sarcastic dig.  Ich stoically stands and takes it.

					CHARLIE
			Hey, Ich has been helpful.

					OHASHI
				(ignoring him, to
				 Nick)
			Have you changed your mind and
			decided to go home, detective?

					NICK
			Not until one of us bags Kobo.
				(looking at the
				 corpse)
			And it doesn't look like you're
			doing so hot.

	Ohashi coolly flicks the ashes of his cigarette and we --

								 CUT TO:

	EXT.  PRINTING PLANT - DAY

	Ich, Nick, and Charlie are threading their way through the
	crowd toward the subway entrance.

	TWO BIKERS, their hair slicked back, watch the trio from
	the top of two different subway entrances.

	As soon as Ich, Nick and Charlie go down the steps, they
	climb off their bikes and follow.


	INT.  SUBWAY STATION

	Nick, Ich and Charlie are riding the people mover that
	stretches the length of this endless tunnel.  They're
	sandwiched between the legions of SALARYMEN (white collar
	workers) who all wear identical blue suits and white
	shirts.

	Nick looks over at Ich, who is still suffering in silence
	from the recent humiliation.

					NICK
			You know, Inspector, you take shit
			once, you take shit forever.

					ICH
				(beat)
			I don't deserve Ohashi's respect.

					NICK
			Why the hell not?

					ICH
			I don't, that's all.

	Ich looks away, obviously uncomfortable.

					CHARLIE
			You cool, Ich?

					ICH
			Cool?

					CHARLIE
			You all right?  You okay?

	Ich nods.

					CHARLIE
			What does Ichiro mean, anyway?

					ICH
				(smiling)
			What does Charlie mean?

					CHARLIE
			Hey, all right.

	Charlie slaps Ich on the back.

	NICK smiles at Charlie's remark.  He can't help but like
	this wide-eyed goofy kid.

	Something makes Nick's smile fade.

	NICK'S POV

	KOBO, their escaped prisoner, hurrying in the opposite
	direction.  His Kamali suit looks like it just came from
	the cleaners.

					NICK
			Charlie!

	Charlie spots him.  In a flash, the two men jump the
	railing and charge after him, leaving Ich in their wake.

	Ich can't possibly make it over the side.  He furiously
	shoves his way through the Salarymen, trying to get to the
	end of the walkway.

	CHASE SEQUENCE

	-- Nick barreling through the mass of faceless Salarymen.

	-- Kobo, hurrying ahead, occasionally glancing back.

	-- Charlie catching up to Nick.  They've lost him.  They
	   spin around.  A half dozen tunnels spin out in all
	   directions.

	-- Nick and Charlie spotting Kobo.  He's waiting for them
	   near the turnstile.

	Nick suddenly realizes it's a set-up.  Before he can say
	anything, Charlie sprints ahead, recklessly shoving
	people out of the way.

					NICK
				(calling after him)
			It's a set-up...!  Charlie!

	Charlie hasn't heard him.

	AT THE TURNSTILE

	Kobo hands a ticket to the turnstile guard and disappears
	onto the platform.  Charlie doesn't have a ticket.  The
	guard points to the automatic ticket machine.  Screw it.
	Charlie leaps over the turnstile.

	The GUARD blows his shrill whistle to signal the subway
	police.

	THE PLATFORM

	Charlie pushes through the crowd -- a wall of blank faces.
	Kobo is gone.

	NICK

	shoving through the crowd.  He spots Charlie.  Shouts at
	him to wait.  Charlie can't hear his partner.

	THE SUBWAY

	pulls in.  An immaculately uniformed CONDUCTOR blows his
	whistle and waves his white-gloved hands to keep the crowd
	back.

	A LEATHER JACKETED BOY shoves Charlie from behind; he
	stumbles forward toward the track.  Someone catches him at
	the last moment.  Charlie turns around to see it's Kobo.

	Kobo smiles, it's all a big joke.

	What follows happens in a flash:

	ON NICK

					NICK
			Charlie!

	Nick is close enough to see, too far to do anything.  He's
	blocked by TWO MORE LEATHER BOYS.  He tries to shove past,
	but they grab him.

	KOBO

	holding Charlie by his coat lapels.  An express train
	tears into the station.  Kobo casually glances at

	NICK

	trying to struggle free.

	KOBO

	his eyes still on Nick, drops Charlie in front of the
	speeding express as if he were a sack of laundry.

	NICK

					NICK
			NO!!

	A woman SCREAMS.

	The train barrels through the station.

	Kobo starts toward Nick.  He's next.

	A pair of SUBWAY POLICEMEN burst through the crowd
	searching for Charlie because he vaulted the turnstile.

	NICK

	manages to break free of the leatherboys holding him.
	They flee into the crowd as the police close in.

	ACROSS THE PLATFORM - KOBO

	slips into the wave of commuters being shoved into a
	train by white-gloved MEN.  It's their job to shove
	commuters into the already packed cars.

	Nick goes for Kobo, but the crowd closes in front of him.
	He can't get through.

	THE SUBWAY DOORS

	slam shut.  The train pulls out leaving Nick standing on
	the empty platform.

	THE LAST CAR

	streaks past him.  Kobo stands in the rear window, getting
	smaller and smaller until the train disappears down the
	tracks.

					ICH
			Nick!

	Ich, out of breath, is standing on the platform.  Nick
	looks at him with disgust -- where the hell was he.

	STAY on Nick, his head bowed, being surrounded by the sea
	of blue-suited commuters.

								 FADE TO WHITE.

	FADE IN:

	NICK'S FACE against a white wall.  That's all we see.
	Ohashi's voice OFF SCREEN.

					OHASHI (O.S.)
			... You ignored me.  I don't care
			about what you want.  Get on a
			plane, detective Conklin.  Go home.

	We HEAR a door open and SLAM shut off screen.  Hold on
	Nick, frozen in place, then:

								 CUT TO:

	INT.  CENTRAL SECTION - TOKYO POLICE H.Q. - DAY

	Again, the fifty desks, fifty faceless men working.
	Typewriters CLACKING, phones RINGING.  We MOVE down the
	rows to find Nick sitting behind one of the desks.  He's
	on the phone to New York.

					OLIVER (V.O.) (PHONE)
			It's not your job.

					NICK
			He was my partner.

					OLIVER (V.O.) (PHONE)
			They're blaming it on you.  Christ,
			Conklin, you didn't even tell me you
			lost the prisoner!

					NICK
			I planned on catching him, Captain.

					OLIVER (V.O.) (PHONE)
			How?  You don't know the place.  You
			don't know the language.  Get on the
			plane.

					NICK
			He killed a police officer.

					OLIVER (V.O.) (PHONE)
			Your plane's at nine a.m.  Be on it.
			That's orders.  Period.

	Oliver hangs up.  A moment of long distance hum cross
	talk.  Nick doesn't move.  Pull back through the rows of
	cops busily working... SOUND FADES.

	Charlie Parker's alto sax FADE UP as we --

								 CUT TO:

	EXT.  SHINJUKU - NIGHT

	The MUSIC continues.  The sax screams as the melody is
	abandoned.

	Nick is drunk.  Roaring angry drunk.  He doesn't know
	where he is.  He doesn't care.  He plows down the street,
	occasionally grabbing a passerby, then letting them go.

	Nick begins to laugh.  A couple is staring at him, Nick
	yells at them, but we DON'T HEAR HIM.  He stumbles on...
	drop back to find.

	ICH

	following in his wake.  He bows and apologizes to the
	offended.

								 CUT TO:

	EXT.  LAS VEGAS WELCOME BAR - NIGHT

	Nick is thrown onto the street.  He tries to reenter and
	is thrown out again.  We spot JOYCE inside watching; she
	turns back to her customers.


	EXT.  GINZA - NIGHT

	Nick is hassling a news vendor who pointedly ignores him
	and continues selling his papers.  Ich appears and
	apologizes to the news vendor.


	EXT.  STREET - TWO A.M.

	Nick's sitting on the curb, his head in his hands.  People
	step around him.

	Across the street, out of Nick's sight, Ich is watching
	his partner, feeling every barb of Nick's shame.

	Charlie Parker continues over the slow...

								 DISSOLVE TO:

	NICK --

	asleep, the futon tangled around him.  He opens his eyes.
	A woman is making tea in the kitchenette.  This is the
	kimonoed woman who led Nick and Charlie to Ich the other
	night.

	A RADIO is on softly in the background.  The Charlie
	Parker tune we've been listening to over the previous cuts
	ends, and the announcer comes on:

					RADIO
			... That was the Bird, from the Blue
			Note years.  1230 hours and 72
			degrees in central Osaka.  This is
			specialist Doug Dale, Tapestries in
			Jazz, on the Far East Network, armed
			forces radio...

	Nick slowly sits up to see

	ICH

	seated at a low table looking at him from across the room.

	Nick spots his clothes and luggage stacked in the corner.
	Nick now realizes he's in Ich's apartment.  It's spotless.
	Everything is now in its proper place.

					NICK
			What happened?

					ICH
			They made you leave your hotel...
				(looks away)
			... you caused a disturbance.

	Nick's eyes fall on Charlie's things:  his sports clothes,
	his tour book, his shoes which Ich has stacked on the
	table.

					ICH
			It may be too soon to talk about it.
			When someone we care for dies we...
				(beat)
			... keep something of their's.  A
			tie, a pen.

					NICK
			Why weren't you at the platform?

					ICH
			I couldn't keep up.  My shame is
			complete.

	Nick slowly shuts his eyes, his head pounding.

								 CUT TO:

	INT.  PUBLIC BATH - DAY

	The neighborhood bathhouse.  Thick with steam and
	neighborhood kids.

	Nick walks toward the huge pool of water.  Ich is beside
	him.  Nick's about to climb in when Ich stops him, hands
	him a pail and a washcloth and points to the faucets along
	the wall where a dozen men squat on small stools as they
	wash themselves.

								 CUT TO:

	NICK

	as he pours a pail of water over his head, it runs down
	his face in slow motion.

								 CUT TO:

	THE POOL

	Nick soaking, on one side.  Ich is soaking nearby.

					ICH
			You must leave?

					NICK
			Yeah...

					ICH
			I'll get him for you, Nick.

	Nick looks at this thick bellied, alcoholic cop.  Not a
	very reassuring thought.

	TWO MEN carrying plastic pails cross in front of the tub.
	Young, muscular Yakuza, their bodies covered with
	exquisite tattoos.  They stare openly at Nick.  One makes
	a joke.  Both laugh obscenely as they slip into the hot
	tub.

					NICK
			Yakuza?

	Ich nods.  Nick eyes them for a long beat, then climbs out
	of the tub.

								 CUT TO:

	NICK

	Nick tossing two bags into a taxi in front of Ich's
	apartment building.

	ICH

	Ich watching Nick through the window from inside his
	apartment.  He glances back and sees Charlie's "Members
	Only" coat hanging on a hook.

	When he turns back, Nick's taxi has disappeared.


	EXT.  NARITA AIRPORT

	The brightest object in the frame is a yellow forklift
	carrying a jostling aluminum coffin toward the open belly
	of the cargo plane.  Nick watches it from the edge of the
	tarmac.

	AIRPORT CHECK IN GATE

	Nick hands the clerk his ticket.

					NICK
			... Smoking.

					CLERK
			Aisle or window?

	Nick spots a folded newspaper someone has left on the
	counter.  He can't read it, of course, but there's a
	picture of the subway platform where Charlie was killed,
	swarming with police.  Nick continues to stare at the
	paper.

					CLERK
			Aisle or window, sir?

					NICK
				(looks up)
			I want to cash it in.  Yen.

								 CUT TO:

	ICH'S APARTMENT - DAY

	Nick steps in, drops the two suitcases.

					NICK
			Ichiro?

	The woman steps out of the kitchen, babbles something in
	Japanese.  Nick doesn't have a clue.

								 CUT TO:

	INT.  LAS VEGAS WELCOME BAR - AFTERNOON

	Only a handful of patrons.  Joyce is straightening bottles
	behind the bar.

					NICK (O.S.)
			What's tricks?

	She looks up, surprised to see Nick standing in front of
	her.

					JOYCE
			Ich said you left.

					NICK
			There was a change in plans.

	Beat.

					JOYCE
			I'm sorry about your friend.

	Nick's surprised at how fast she heard.

					JOYCE
			Dead gaiijin's are big news.

					NICK
			Gaiijin?

					JOYCE
			An outside person.  A foreigner.  A
			barbarian.  You, me.
				(beat)
			More you.

					NICK
			I could use some help.  Show me
			around.  I'll pay you for your time.

					JOYCE
			I don't give tours.

	Nick smiles.

					NICK
			You can count on the truth from
			people who don't like you.

					JOYCE
			You have a helluva way of asking for
			help.

					NICK
			You have a helluva way of answering.

	Draw.

					JOYCE
			Look, you need Ich.  I've been here
			five years and I still can't read
			all the street signs.

					NICK
			Maybe I'm a quicker learner.

					JOYCE
			I don't think so.

	From OFF SCREEN:

					ICH (O.S.)
			Nicklaus-san.

	Nick turns to see Ich, leaning against the door frame.
	He's already had a few drinks too many.  He's delighted to
	see Nick.

					ICH
			I've continued working on the case!

					NICK
			I can see that.

	Ich ambles into the room, slips down into a chair.  He
	spills the contents of the large manila envelope he's been
	carrying onto the table:  a wallet, a set of keys, playing
	cards, etc.

					ICH
				(signaling to Joyce)
			Joyce... A drink please.
				(to Nick)
			Kobo has disappeared.  My superiors
			don't trust me.

	Nick walks over to the table and looks at the items.

					ICH
			Kobo's.  Taken off him when he was
			arrested in New York.

	Nick sits down.  Joyce gives Ich his scotch.

					ICH
			I knew you'd come back.  You feel
			you have a debt you can never pay.
			But you will, even if it costs you
			your life.  Giri.  Honor.

	Nick picks up various items off the table.

					NICK
			How'd you get this?

					ICH
			I stole them.

	Ich drapes his arm over Nick's shoulder.

					ICH
			Partners, Nicklaus-san?

	Ich reaches for his drink.  Nick gets there first.  He
	holds it up as if he were proposing a toast, then
	purposefully spills his drink out.

					NICK
			Partners.

	Ich has just had his last drink on duty.

								 CUT TO:

	THE TABLE - LATER

	All the contents of the envelope are spread out on the
	table:  credit cards, matchbooks from New York City,
	choice clipping from Screw magazine, sugarless gum, cuff
	links...

	Nick's holding up a series of photos.

	CLOSE ON PHOTO

	of a naked women and Kobo screwing on a Tatami mat.
	Another photo.  Then another.  Each photo is more
	pornographic than the next.

	Joyce picks them up as Nick sets them down.

					JOYCE
			Busy man.

	Nick holds out several of the same girl in various poses.

					NICK
			Know her?

					ICH
				(shaking his head)
			We can ask someone I used to work
			with.  A criminal.  Someone I pay
			money to...

					NICK
			A snitch?

								 CUT TO:

	INT.  PACHINKO PARLOR - DAY

	The largest in Tokyo.  Endless rows of men sitting in
	front of the machines (horizontal pinball games) furiously
	punching the flippers.  The NOISE from the metal balls is
	deafening.

	A MAN

	in a Hawaiian shirt, his arms covered with tattoos, is
	starting a new game.

	Ich moves up to the vacant machine beside him, puts in his
	change.  Ich doesn't face the man as they speak in
	Japanese.  The man in the Hawaiian shirt walks off.

	ON NICK

	as the man in the Hawaiian shirt walks past him.  This is
	the snitch.  Nick glances back at Ich.  Ich nods --
	they're in business.

								 CUT TO:

	A CRAMPED ROOM - REAR OF PACHINKO PARLOR

	We HEAR the clattering of the machines outside.  The man
	in the Hawaiian shirt, mid-fifties and badly in need of a
	shower, is sitting on the floor studying the photos.  Ich
	and Nick tower above him.

	The man says something to Nick in Japanese, then continues
	to study the photos.

					NICK
			What's he saying?

					ICH
				(looking up)
			He says they're very nice.  He wants
			to know if you have anymore.

	Nick sighs.

					ICH
			I'll ask him again.

	Ich asks in Japanese.  The man shrugs.

					NICK
			My turn.

	He grabs the man by his shirt collar and shoves him
	against the wall.  The photos spill to the floor.

					NICK
			Who is she?

	He bangs the man's head back against the wall.  The man
	starts babbling in Japanese.

	Ich, horrified, tries to pull Nick off him.

					ICH
			Nick, stop.

	Nick bangs the snitches head against the wall again.  Ich
	gets Nick away.  The man is terrified.

					ICH
			This man must be treated with
			respect.

	Ich bows to the man, apologizes in Japanese.

					NICK
			Aw, for Christ's sake.

	They continue speaking in Japanese.  They bow to one
	another again.  Ich gives the man a glass of water, then
	motions for him to sit down.

	Nick, impatient, starts for the guy again.  Ich stops him.
	The snitch holds up one of the photos, and starts
	babbling.

					NICK
				(to Ich)
			Now we're making progress.

								 CUT TO:

	INT.  SEIBU DEPARTMENT STORE - DAY

	CLOSE ON A SALESGIRL behind the cosmetic counter.  She is
	wearing the store uniform:  blue and white dress and white
	gloves.  A doll.  We shouldn't recognize her at first.
	Then --

	INSERT A PHOTO

	one of Kobo's porno pics.  It's the same face.

	REVEAL NICK

	holding the photo, standing in the crowded store.  Ich is
	beside him.

					NICK
			That's Kobo's girl?  He's sure?

	Ich glances back at the man in the Hawaiian shirt standing
	by the door.  The man nods.

					ICH
			He's sure.

	They watch the girl help a customer choose an eyeliner.

					ICH
			Nick, no one's seen Kobo in three
			days.  He might not even be in
			Tokyo.

					NICK
			Only one way to find out... Get her
			up in the morning and put her to bed
			at night.

								 CUT TO:

	INT.  SOBA RESTAURANT - DAY

	NICK

	is struggling with his chopsticks and bowl of noodles.
	From O.S. A LOUD SLURPING SOUND.  The sound stops, then
	starts again.  Nick can't eat.  He sets his bowl down and
	looks over at

	ICH

	slurping his noodles.  It is considered polite to slurp
	soba noodles as loud as possible.

	Ich stops.  Looks at Nick, then resumes his slurping.

					NICK
			Think you could keep it to a dull
			roar?

	They're sitting by the window across from the Seibu
	department store watching the entrance.

					ICH
			It's good manners.

	Nick nods.  Picks up his bowl.  Again the LOUD slurping
	off screen.  Nick starts to eat the noodles.  He can't
	continue with Ich slurping.  He sets the bowl down.

	Ich grins, resumes slurping and we --

								 CUT TO:

	EXT.  DEPARTMENT STORE - SIX P.M.

	The SALESGIRLS are lined up at the door bowing and
	thanking the last customers for shopping in their store.
	Standard practice.

	The GIRL whom Nick and Ich have been watching comes out
	wearing her uniform and heads down the street.

	NICK AND ICH

	waiting in the restaurant, get up to follow.

								 CUT TO:

	THE GIRL

	stepping out of the laundry carrying her wash.  She walks
	past a doorway where...

	NICK is standing.

	ICH now walks past his partner picking up the tail.  No
	acknowledgement between them.


	EXT.  STREET CAR STATION

	There are dozens of street cars waiting to pull out.  The
	girl is on one of them.  Ich has lost her.  Nick and Ich
	hurry from car to car.

					ICH
			You said you could keep up with her!
			'No problem, Nick-san.'

					NICK
				(cutting Ich off)
			No.  Don't say anything.  Don't do
			anything, and for Christ's sake,
			don't apologize!

					ICH
			Nick...

	Nick hurries toward another car to check it out.

					NICK
			What'd I tell you?

					ICH
			There she is!

	They spot the girl sitting in the window of one of the
	street cars, about to turn onto the main street.

	The two cops race for the car.  Nick leaps on.  Ich is a
	few steps behind.  Nick sticks out his hand, pulls Ich up.
	They stand looking at one another, both breathing hard,
	both out of shape.

								 CUT TO:

	NIGHTCLUB DISTRICT - NIGHT

	Narrow streets with exploding neon ideograph signs as far
	as the eye can see.

	We spot our girl hurrying down the street.  Nick, a half
	block behind, is bumping into people, trying not to lose
	her.

	She crosses the street and Ich picks her up.  Nick drops
	off.

	ON A SIDE STREET

	around the corner the girl disappears into a three story
	apartment building above an electronics store.

								 DISSOLVE TO:

	EXT.  GIRL'S APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT

	off the TV and climbs into bed.

								 CUT TO:

	A STOREROOM - NIGHT

	We've been watching the girl from a window across the
	street.  It's a storeroom full of shipping crates, not
	much else.  Ich is sitting on the floor, legs crossed,
	back erect, watching Nick.  Nick glances over.  Ich
	continues to watch him.  Nick returns to the window.

					ICH
			You dislike me.

	Nick keeps looking out the window.

					NICK
			Did I say that?

					ICH
			You toler -- yes, tolerate me.   

					NICK
			Are we getting married?

	Pause.

					ICH
			I'm a joke.  They sent you to me to
			make a fool of you.

	Nick looks over at Ich.  Ich is looking away.  Nick looks
	out the window, then back at his partner.

					NICK
			You're doing fine, Ich.  Now drop
			it, okay?

					ICH
			Sure.

	The girl switches off her light across the street.

								 DISSOLVE TO:

	THE STOREROOM - MORNING

	Ich is sleeping on his back looking like a grounded whale.

	Nick, exhausted, is sitting by the window his head resting
	against the sill.

	NICK'S POV OF THE STREET

	as the girl, dressed in her store uniform, comes out of
	the apartment and heads for work.

	NICK

	nudges the sleeping Ich with his foot.  Ich opens his
	eyes.

					NICK
			Let's book.

	Ich is groggy, nonplused.

					NICK
			Let's go.

								 CUT TO:

	INT.  HALLWAY - GIRL'S APARTMENT BUILDING

	Ich, tucking in his shirt, comes down the hall to see --

	Nick, on his knees, examining the lock on the girl's
	apartment door.  He slides his NYPD card into the jam and
	lightly raps the knob plate.

					ICH
			You can't do this.

	Nick uses his sleeve to wipe prints off the knob and jam.

					NICK
			Call a cop.

	The door swings open.  Nick walks in.

								 CUT TO:

	INT.  GIRL'S APARTMENT

	A cheesebox with a few vintage pieces of American deco
	furniture.

	Ich, very uptight, stands at the door while Nick goes over
	the place.

	Nick opens the closet.  It's packed with expensive
	dresses, pants, sweaters...

					ICH
			Nick...

					NICK
				(facing him)
			If you're gonna give me a hard time,
			wait outside.

	Nick goes through her chest of drawers:  on the top, a lot
	of high quality lingerie.

	INSERT PHOTO:  The girl and Kobo posing in a vintage
	Corvette.

	Nick replaces the picture, and carefully rearranges the
	drawer so it appears untouched.  He pulls open another
	drawer.  Then another.  Under the jeans and Mickey Mouse
	T-shirts, he finds:

	A BANK STACK OF U.S. CURRENCY

	in hundreds.  The bottom of the drawer is lined with
	stacks.  Nick holds them up for Ich to see.

					NICK
			Not too shabby for a perfume pusher.

	Ich, shocked, tries to play it cool.

					ICH
			Too bad it's not in yen.

	Nick shoves the drawer shut.

	THE GIRL - DUSK - TWO DAYS LATER

	The GIRL buys fruit from a stand as NICK watches from one
	end of the block; ICH, listening to his transistor radio,

	INT.  STOREROOM - NIGHT

	Nick, leaning against the wall, watches the girl's

	her light, then disappears into the bathroom.

	Ich walks in, exhausted, soaked to the skin.  He tosses
	his cap in the corner.  Struck out again.

			Work, lunch, groceries, laundry...

			Four goddamn days.  This is going

	A KNOCK at the door.

					JOYCE (O.S.)
			It's me.

	Ich opens the door.  Joyce, dressed for work, is carrying
	two odons (box dinners).  Joyce and Ich exchange greetings
	in Japanese.

					JOYCE
			What's the latest?

	Nick shrugs.

					ICH
			We'll get him, Joyce.

	Joyce peeks out the window.  The girl is getting
	undressed.

					JOYCE
			She ever pull down her shades?

					NICK
				(right back at her)
			Sure, but then I just pull out the
			photos.

	Ich opens one of the box dinners and sets it on the ledge
	in front of Nick.

					ICH
				(enthusiastically)
			Chikuwa, Hampen, Kobu, Konnayaku,
			Ganmodoki --

					NICK
			Ichiro --

					ICH
				(realizing)
			Broiled fish paste cake, Kelp roll,
			soybean curd, devils tongue --

					NICK
			Smells like Bayonne at low tide.

	Joyce hands Ich a flask of hot sake in tinfoil.

					NICK
			Whoa whoa...

	Nick grabs the flask.  Dumps it out the window.

					JOYCE
			Don't be an ass.

					NICK
			He's on duty.

					JOYCE
			I paid for that.

	Nick tosses a few thousand yen on the table.  Then,
	spotting something out the window.

					NICK
			Alley oop!

	Nick grabs his coat and goes out the door.  Joyce slips
	Ich another flask of sake.

								 CUT TO:

	EXT.  STREET - GINZA DISTRICT - NIGHT

	It's our GIRL standing alone on the corner of the street
	but you wouldn't know it at first.  She's wearing tight
	leather pants, red leather jacket, earrings, bright red
	lipstick, and she's dumped the pony-tail, allowing her
	hair to fall to her waist.

	NICK AND ICH

	watching in a doorway down the block.  Nick's shivering,
	his hands thrust in his army surplus jacket.  Ich doesn't
	mind the cold.  He's had his sake.

	THREE BOSOZOKU

	riding their bikes come around the corner drive past her,
	then circle back.

	One of the RIDERS stops to talk to her, then drives off.
	She hurries off in the opposite direction.

					ICH
			Yakuza.

					NICK
			Good.  Very good...

								 CUT TO:

	A SUBWAY STATION

	The girl waits until the last minute, then after glancing
	back, steps in the car.  The train pulls out.  The cars
	race past until we see --

	Nick and Ich standing inside of the last car.  It
	disappears into the tunnel.

								 CUT TO:

	THE SHINZOA DISTRICT - NIGHT

	The girl, on the move, pushing through the crowd.  Drop
	back to find Ich twenty yards behind.  She crosses the
	street.  Nick, pretending to be looking in a store window,
	picks her up.

	AROUND THE CORNER

	Nick has lost her.  It's a cul de sac with a dozen
	buildings.  He's standing in the middle of the street.
	Ich catches up to him.

					NICK
			She disappeared... shit!

					ICH
			You were too far behind.

	Nick does a double-take.

					ICH
				(recalling Nick's
				 words)
			Don't say anything more.  Don't do
			anything.  And, for Christ's sake,
			don't apologize!

								 DISSOLVE TO:

	EXT.  STREET - SHINZOA DISTRICT - NIGHT - LATER

	NICK

	dropping another cigarette butt to the ground.  There's a
	small pile at his feet.  He's leaning against the wall
	watching one end of the block.  TRACK over to reveal Ich,
	his back to Nick's, watching the other end.

	Ich glances back at Nick.  Nick ignores him.  Ich turns
	back.

					ICH
			Nicklaus-san!

	Nick turns to see the GIRL walk out of a bath house.
	She's wearing her ponytail again, with a black dress.  She
	climbs into a taxi.

								 CUT TO:

	EXT.  PINK SARON HOSTESS CLUB - NIGHT

	The girl climbs out of the taxi and goes inside.

	Nick and Ich are watching from across the street.


	INT.  HOSTESS CLUB

	Packed with Salarymen from the nearby brewery and
	hostesses in silk dresses selling cheap champagne at
	expensive prices.

	NICK AND ICH

	Walk in.  Everything seems normal.

	The BOUNCER in a white tux, stops them.  This is not a
	place frequented by Gaiijin.

	Ich beseeches the Bouncer to let his good friend in,
	promising that his friend will spend lots of money.

	Nick, thinking he's in, takes a step forward.  The Bouncer
	shoves him back.

					NICK
			Hey, no hands, huh?

	He bats his hands away.  Ich grabs Nick by the shoulders,
	preventing a fight.

					ICH
			You can't come in.  They don't
			want --

					NICK
			Gaiijin.

					ICH
			I'll check it out.

	Nick, unsure, turns to go, but before he does:

					NICK
			If I smell one drop of Scotch on
			your breath, my friend --

					ICH
			You can trust me.

	Nick hesitates, he's not so sure, then shoves the door
	open.


	EXT.  HOSTESS CLUB

	Nick waiting under the pink neon sign.


	INT.  HOSTESS CLUB - LATER

	Ich is sitting at the crowded bar.  A HOSTESS has her arm
	around his neck.  He checks out the room, searching for
	the girl.  He notices two THUGS standing outside a sliding
	door.  Ich finishes his drink.

					ICH
				(in Japanese)
			Let me up.

					HOSTESS
				(shoving him down)
			Sit, sweetie.
				(to bartender)
			Another Seagrams!

	Ich relents.  Then, spotting something across the room:

	WHAT HE SEES:  A rice paper door slides open, momentarily
	revealing a DOZEN men with close cropped hair sitting on
	tatami mats, playing poker.  Some have their coats off,
	revealing arms covered with tattoos.  Yakuza.

	A hostess, serving drinks, steps but leaving the door
	partially open.

	The hostess slides the door open to the adjacent room, but
	Ich CANNOT see inside.  She slides it shut.

	Ich's hostess wants him to buy another drink, but Ich
	shakes his head, gets to his feet, and pretending to be
	drunk, stumbles toward the sliding doors.

	Ich bumps into a table; slaps a stranger on the shoulder;
	then starts singing along with Frank Sinatra on the
	stereo.  He's a little too loud, a little off key.

	The bodyguards eye Ich suspiciously.  He stumbles past
	them, then grabs the sliding door and yanks it open.

	INSIDE THE ROOM

	A low table.  Kobo is at one end.  An older,
	distinguished, sliver-haired man in his seventies whom we
	will come to know as SUGAI is at the other.  Ich can't
	believe his eyes:  Sugai is the head of the largest Yakuza
	syndicate in Japan.

	A half dozen LIEUTENANTS sit on either side of the table.
	Half are older, dressed in conservative suits; the other
	half are younger wearing $700 Issy Miyake jackets.

	SUGAI AND KOBO

	are having a heated discussion.  The GIRL Ich and Nick
	have been following walks over to Kobo and sits beside
	him.  This makes Sugai even more irate.  He's on his feet,
	red faced and screaming.

	FOUR GUARDS

	seeing Ich, pull out their Beretta's.  Two more grab him
	and fling him head first against the wall.

					ICH
				(drunken, in Japanese)
			I have to piss, gentlemen... I'm so
			sorry but I have to --

	The bodyguards hurry him towards the door.


	EXT.  HOSTESS CLUB

	Nick checks his watch, it's been an hour - where the hell
	is Ich?

	Ich comes stumbling up the steps, still affecting his
	drunken, pigeon-toed walk.  Nick, of course, thinks Ich
	has gotten drunk again.  Two of the bodyguards are
	watching from inside.

					NICK
			I don't believe it...
				(grabs him)
			Son-of-a-bitch --   

	Ich, knowing they're being watched, grabs Nick by the
	sleeve and drags him off still pretending to be drunk.

					ICH
				(under his breath)
			I'm not drunk...

					NICK
			We're through.  I mean it.  This is
			the end of the line, Matsumoto.

					ICH
			Nick --

					NICK
			Shut-up.

	No longer fearing he's being watched, Ich abruptly stops
	his affected walk, and sounding very sober --

					ICH
			You shut-up!
				(then)
			Kobo is inside.  He's with Sugai,
			the head of the Summaguchi-clan.

	ACROSS THE STREET

	Ich is dialing on the police call box as he fills Nick in
	on Sugai.

					ICH
			... A Godfather.  His man was killed
			at the printing plant.

					NICK
			I want to yank Kobo.

					ICH
			Not without a small army, Nicklaus-
			san.

	Ich quickly speaks on the police phone, then hangs up,
	pleased with himself.

					NICK
			Ich, my name is Nick.  Not Nicklaus,
			not Nicklaus-san, not Nick-san.
			Nick.

					ICH
			San is an honorable title.

	Ich realizes it's better to drop it.

								 CUT TO:

	THE HOSTESS CLUB - MINUTES LATER

	Drunken Salarymen spill out the door.

	ICH AND NICK

	are standing across the street waiting for the cops to
	arrive.

	Nick freezes.

	THE GIRL

	they've been following steps out and lights a cigarette.
	TIME SLOWS.  She looks up and spots the two men through
	the traffic.  Nick turns away, afraid he's been made.
	When he looks back, she's gone back inside.

					NICK
			Shit...

	Nick races across the street toward the club.  Horns
	BLARE.

					ICH
				(doesn't understand)
			Nick?!

	IN FRONT OF THE CLUB

	Nick reaches the curb just as the front doors to the club
	BURST OPEN.  He's too late.  Three bodyguards burst out,
	checking the street.  A red and white Debonnaire pulls up.

	Sugai, surrounded by a half-dozen additional bodyguards,
	comes out and slips into the car.  It tears off down the
	street.

	SIRENS AND POLICE CARS

	from either end of the street peel around the corner.
	It's a madhouse.  The remaining lieutenants and bodyguards
	fan out, trying to elude arrest.

	Nick hurries down the steps.

	INSIDE THE CLUB

	The patrons are still in place, but the two side rooms are
	empty.

	Nick spots KOBO going out the rear entrance.  He starts
	after him but is confronted by the bouncer who stopped him
	earlier.  Nick connects to the guy's jaw before his
	adversary can raise his hands.  The bouncer staggers back.
	Nick flies out the rear door.

								 CUT TO:

	EXT.  FRONT OF CLUB - NIGHT

	Several lieutenants and bodyguards toss their guns --
	possession is a felony in Japan -- as the police close in.


	INT.  HOSTESS CLUB - NIGHT

	Ich hurries in, but Nick's long gone.


	EXT.  REAR OF HOSTESS CLUB - NEARBY STREETS - NIGHT

	SILENCE.  The narrow streets are deserted.  Nick slowly
	makes his way down the street.  The SOUND of a GUNSHOT.
	Nick ducks for cover -- it's a car BACKFIRING.  He
	continues on.

	Nick's POV of a woman giving a man a blow-job in a narrow
	alley.  The man's face is hidden by the shadow.

	Nick continues on.

					JAPANESE MAN (FROM THE DARKNESS)
			People like Charlie are a dime a
			dozen.

	Nick turns back to see Kobo as he steps into the light.

	Kobo tosses a handful of change at Nick.

					KOBO
			Keep the change.

					NICK
			I'm taking you back.

	The girl takes off down the block.

					KOBO
			Here I am.

	From across the street, a dozen bodyguards appear from
	various doorways and alleys.

					KOBO
			Charlie was a rookie...

	Kobo traces his finger across the spot where he cut Nick
	in New York.

					KOBO
			... But you can take care of
			yourself.  You're 'the biggest thing
			to hit this town since Godzilla.'

	Nick glances at the guards, then back at Kobo.  He is
	unarmed.  To make a move would be suicide.  More POLICE
	SIRENS in the b.g. closing in.

					KOBO
			What's the matter.  I'm right in
			front of you, Nick.
				(takes a step closer)
			But I was right in front of you when
			you let Charlie die.

	Kobo takes a step forward.  His face is inches from
	Nick's.

					KOBO
			Walk away again.  Maybe you'll get
			used to it.

	Nick doesn't budge.

	A LONG BEAT, then... Nick turns and slowly walk off.
	After a dozen yards Nick looks back.

	The street is empty, except for a street sweeper pushing
	his wet broom down the block.


	EXT.  HOSTESS CLUB - NIGHT

	A half dozen bodyguards are being frisked, then shoved
	into police cars.

	Ohashi is talking to the enraged nightclub owner.  Nick
	steps up to him.  Ich hurries over.

					ICH
			Nick!

					NICK
				(to Ohashi)
			A few minutes faster, we might've
			nailed him.

	Ohashi doesn't say a word, hands Nick a document.

					NICK
			What's this?

					OHASHI
			Your visa has expired.  Be on a
			plane in twenty-four hours or you
			will be deported.

					NICK
			While you were hanging out at the
			visa office, we found the son-of-a-
			bitch.

					OHASHI
			Look.

	Ohashi directs Nick's attention across the street where a
	SURVEILLANCE VAN is parked.  The rear doors are open
	revealing a van full of surveillance equipment and cops.

					OHASHI
			You ruined an on-going investigation
			that could have gotten us more than
			one runner.
				(to Ich, in Japanese)
			I want a full report in the morning,
			officer.

	Ich bows as Ohashi walks off.

					NICK
			Maybe if you'd work with us --

	Ohashi ignores him, continues walking toward his waiting
	car.

					NICK
				(shouting)
			Hey...!
				(Ohashi keeps
				 walking)
			HEY, I'M TALKING TO YOU, INSPECTOR!

					OHASHI
				(his back toward
				 Nick)
			Twenty-four hours, detective.

	Ohashi slips into his car.  Nick storms up to the car and
	slams his fist on the window.

					NICK
			Ohashi!

	Ohashi faces straight ahead, ignoring Nick.  Nick takes
	the extradition paper and spikes it on the car antenna.

	Ich grabs Nick by his arm, pulling him back from the car.
	The car pulls away.

					ICH
			Nick, stop!

	Nick whirls, and before he realizes what he's doing,
	punches Ich below his left eye.  Ich stumbles back over
	the curb and lands on his ass.

					NICK
			Damnit, Ichiro, I'm tired of people
			telling me what I can and can't do.
			No one ever solved anything sitting
			on their ass.

	Nick, beside himself with frustration, watches Ohashi's
	car disappear down the block.

	ON ICH

	looking up at

	NICK

	who walks off without looking back at his partner.

								 CUT TO:

	INT.  ICH'S BATHROOM - SEVERAL HOURS LATER

	Nick, standing beside the tub, dumps a pail of hot water
	over his head, rinsing himself off.  He grabs a towel and
	walks out of the room.


	INT.  ICH'S APARTMENT

	Ich, holding an ice pack to his face, is lying on a tatami
	mat against the wall looking up at the ceiling.  An open
	bottle of Seagrams beside him.

	Nick stretches out on another tatami on the opposite side
	of the room and looks up at the ceiling, too.

					NICK
			The ice help?

	Nothing from Ich.

					NICK
			Where does this Sugai live?

					ICH
				(cold)
			A resort city, Beppu.

					NICK
			I want to go talk to him.

					ICH
			What...?  Why?

					NICK
			Because he knows how to get to our
			man.

					ICH
			He'll never speak to a Gaiijin.

					NICK
			I'll be a nice Gaiijin.

	Nick gets up and goes to the closet.  He slides open the
	door.  All of his and Charlie's clothes have been neatly
	hung up.

	He shoves Charlie's jacket aside.  Something's wrong with
	the way it hangs.  He pulls the jacket out, runs his hand
	over the coat, feeling something heavy in the lining.

	Nick rips the lining open.  Charlie's .32 Beretta and a
	spare clip tumble out.

					NICK
			The little bastard.  God bless him.

	Ich takes a drink from his bottle.

					ICH
			It's very small.

					NICK
			Big enough.

					ICH
			It's illegal, Nick.

					NICK
			It's a new deal.
				(putting it in his
				 waist band)
			... coming with me tomorrow?

					ICH
			Sugai's not going to be impressed
			with your gun, Nick.
				(beat)
			No.  I won't put myself in danger
			for you anymore.

	Nick picks up the liquor cap which rolled across the
	floor.  He tosses it to Ich.  Ich reaches for it, but
	misses.

					NICK
			Sure, pal.  You've got better things
			to do.

	Nick walks out shutting the door behind him.  Stay on Ich
	watching the door, then --

								 CUT TO:

	EXT.  LAS VEGAS BAR - CLOSING TIME

	The last customers find their way to the street, some with
	a little encouragement from a BOUNCER.

	Joyce steps out.  Nick comes up to her.

					NICK
			You know where I can get a decent
			cup of coffee this time of night?
			I'm buying.

					JOYCE
			Somebody must be suffering
			somewhere, you're being so nice.

	Joyce takes off down the street.  Nick watches her for a
	beat.

					NICK
			I need your help, Joyce.

					JOYCE
			Where's Ich?

					NICK
			Unavailable.

								 CUT TO:

	INT.  KARAOKE BAR - NIGHT

	On the stage, a young professional looking man is singing
	along to "SUMMERTIME" blasting from the stereo.  The
	Japanese way of letting it all hang out.

	We find Joyce and Nick at a corner table having a drink.

					JOYCE
			I've heard of Sugai.  I've also
			heard of the emperor.  They're both
			national treasures.  One's a hood.

					NICK
			I need someone to translate for me.

					JOYCE
			My Japanese isn't that hot...
			Besides, you'll never get in.

					NICK
			It's my last shot.  I have to be on
			a plane home tomorrow night.

					JOYCE
			And I'm supposed to care?

					NICK
			You could fake it.

	Joyce finishes her drink, sets it down.

								 CUT TO:

	EXT.  STREET - NIGHT

	The neon flickers on the rain slicked pavement.  Nick and
	Joyce walk down the deserted street.  She's carrying an
	umbrella.

					JOYCE
			You're wrong to sell Ich short.

					NICK
			He drinks.

					JOYCE
			He's got a reason.

	Nick shrugs, everyone's got a reason.

					JOYCE
			His son hooked up with some bikers.
			Yakuza kids.  A cop shot him running
			from a robbery.

	Nick looks over for the first time.

					JOYCE
			A father doesn't out live that kind
			of thing here, much less a police
			officer...

	Pause.

					NICK
			Where's the wife?

					JOYCE
			You met her.

	Nick looks surprised.

					JOYCE
			The woman in the apartment.  She
			won't speak to him.  But she won't
			leave either.  Japan... Nice, huh?

	Before Nick can respond, something catches his eye:  What
	he sees --

	A MAN

	partially shadowed, standing in the alley.

	Nick grabs his gun.  The man steps out zipping up his
	trousers.  It's a drunken Salaryman.  Nick lowers his gun.
	The Salaryman staggers down the street singing to himself.

					JOYCE
			Not wound too tight...

								 CUT TO:

	EXT.  JOYCE'S APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT

	A three story modern building on a quiet street.  She's
	searching for her keys.

					JOYCE
			I'd invite you up but I know you'd
			hate the incense.
				(as if to explain)
			I chant.

					NICK
			What do you chant?

					JOYCE
			'Nam oyo ranged kyo.'  You think
			it's dumb of course.

					NICK
			Not if it works.
				(holding the door
				 open for her)
			I'll meet you at the train?

					JOYCE
			I don't remember saying yes.

					NICK
			I don't remember you saying no.

	Joyce smiles, heads inside.

								 CUT TO:

	INT.  ICH'S APARTMENT - DAWN

	Ich is sleeping.

	Nick slips into his leather motorcycle jacket.  He drops
	Charlie's gun into his pocket.  He glances down at Ich,
	seeing if he's awake.  He's not.  Nick walks out.

	Ich opens his eyes.  He's been awake the whole time.

								 CUT TO:

	THE YANAKA CEMETERY - DAY

	Ich, wearing a blue suit, is pouring water over a simple
	stone with a wooden dipper.  Next, he places incense in a
	holder and folds his hands in prayer.

	The photo on the stone is of a young man wearing a school
	uniform.  Ich's son.

								 DISSOLVE TO:

	A BULLET TRAIN - DAY

	It's bull's-eye nose cone scuds across the endless rice
	paddies west of Tokyo.  Women in straw hats stand in the
	knee deep water pruning the rice by hand.  Old Japan
	rubbing shoulders with the new.


	INT.  TRAIN - DAY

	CLOSE ON NICK looking out the window as the countryside
	shoots past at 140 mph.  From O.S. several children
	chanting:  "Harrow, Harrow."

	Nick looks over to see three uniformed school children
	thrusting their notebooks and pens at him.

	JOYCE

	is sitting across from Nick.

					JOYCE
			They want your autograph.

					NICK
			Who am I supposed to be?

					JOYCE
			This little guy thinks you're Robert
			Redford... the other one thinks
			you're Charles Bronson...

					NICK
			Tell them I'm not.

	She does, but the kids insist.

					JOYCE
			They'll never go away.

	Nick, reluctantly signs.  Joyce takes one of the kid's
	notebooks before passing it back.

					JOYCE
			Mick Jagger?

	Joyce smiles, surprised at his choice.  Then, she looks up
	shocked to see --

	ICH

	carrying a gift wrapped package under his arm.  He's
	wearing his hat, blue suit and tie.

	Ich sits ACROSS the aisle from Nick and Joyce.  He doesn't
	say a word.  Faces straight ahead.

	Nick looks at Joyce, then back at Ich.

					NICK
			I'm sorry, Ichiro.  I lost it last
			night.  I shouldn't have hit you.

	Still nothing from Ich.

					NICK
			What's in the box?

					ICH
				(still not facing
				 him)
			For Sugai.  Caviar, French cheese,
			ham... If you come to apologize for
			interrupting his meeting, Sugai may
			feel obligated to see you.

					NICK
			So I bring some cheese?

					JOYCE
			Gifts are expected here.

	Nick nods, looks back out the window.  He'll never
	understand this country.  He looks back to see --

	Joyce looking annoyed at him.  Nick gets the message.

					NICK
			Hey, Ich... Thanks.  I'm glad you're
			here.  I mean it.

	Ich still won't acknowledge Nick.


	EXT.  BULLET TRAIN

	The Bullet Train disappearing into the foothills.


	EXT.  BEPPU - DAWN

	Plumes of white steam spindle skyward from every street
	corner.  If you didn't know it was steam, you'd think the
	city was on fire.  Beppu is a resort famous for it's
	geothermal baths.


	EXT.  SUGAI'S HOUSE

	The only traditional house we'll see in our story.  It's
	surrounded by a pool of blood red steaming water from the
	hot springs.

	AT THE GATE

	CLOSE ON A 1000 yen bill as it is dropped on the ground.
	A pair of dice rolls over it.  A handful of GUARDS wearing
	suits and ties are playing craps.

	OUTSIDE THE GATE

	Ich is sitting on the ground leaning against the wall,
	sound asleep.  Nick is standing nearby.  He checks his
	watch.  Tired of waiting, he walks over to --

	JOYCE

	reading the Manichi Daily.

					NICK
				(impatiently)
			They took the gift an hour ago.

	The phone rings inside the gate.  A guard picks it up.

					JOYCE
				(certain it's bad
				 news)
			All's not lost.  There's a famous
			temple here.  We could chant.

	The guard hangs up, calls out to Joyce.  Joyce responds in
	Japanese.  The guard opens the gate.

					NICK
			We're in?

					JOYCE
			The cheese...


	INT.  A ROOM IN SUGAI'S HOUSE

	A vast, austere, traditional room with sliding rice paper
	doors and tatami mats on the floor.

	Ich and Joyce, drinking tea, are sitting with their feet
	beneath them in the traditional manor.

	Nick, smoking, is in a semi-sprawl; using his tea cup as
	an ashtray.

	A LIEUTENANT enters.  He says something and beckons.  They
	all rise.  He says something else.

					JOYCE
				(to Nick)
			Just you.


	INT.  ANOTHER ROOM - SUGAI'S HOUSE

	Nick enters, ducking his head in the low doorway.  the
	shoji slides shut behind him.

	The furnishings are minimal but elegant.  There's a
	butsudan, a tokonoma, and a low, long table in the middle
	of the room.  No chairs.  Nick sits on the floor.

	A door slides open at the far end of the room.  Sugai,
	wearing a kimono over western style suit, walks in.  Nick
	stands up to shake his hand.  Sugai ignores it, and sits
	in the traditional position:  feet tucked beneath him.

					SUGAI
			I'll spare you the ritual.

	He tosses him a palm sized bundle.  Nick catches it.
	Inside, are brand new greenbacks:  hundreds.

					NICK
			This supposed to impress me?

	He sets it down.

					SUGAI
			Pick it up.  Look at it.

	Nick hesitates, then picks it up again.  He runs his
	fingers over the face of the bill and snaps the paper.

					SUGAI
			Seven years work by the finest
			engraver.  Mass produced,
			sequentially numbered.  The best
			there has ever been, Mr. Conklin.

					NICK
			I'm impressed.  But let's use the
			short form.  I'm looking for --

					SUGAI
			-- Kobo... I know.  He killed two of
			my partners.  One in New York, one
			at the printing plant.

	Sugai fills a cup of tea for Nick and hands it to him.

					NICK
			I don't drink tea.

	Sugai hands it to him anyway.

					SUGAI
			I took Kobo from the street.  I gave
			him a home, a future... But my ways
			were too slow for him... I served
			seven years in prison for my boss
			when I was a young man.  Kobo
			wouldn't serve seven minutes for his
			Oyabun.
				(sipping his tea)
			He was supposed to take over this
			syndicate when I retired.

					NICK
			I want him.

					SUGAI
			He'll be dealt with.

	Sugai sets a plastic wrapped object on a table before
	Nick.  Nick recognizes it from the restaurant massacre in
	New York.

	CLOSE UP:  Nick's fingers tear at the plastic.  A block of
	black iridescent polymer.  The negative image of a $100.00
	bill.  A printing plate.

					SUGAI
			Our associates in New York were
			close to closing a deal with us.

					NICK
			The families who control the
			casinos?

					SUGAI
			Yes.  Unlike our syndicates, your
			criminals don't understand the words
			'honor' and 'duty'... We can't
			afford not to deal with them.

	Sugai takes the plate back.

					SUGAI
			Imagine if your families could pay
			their gambling and drug debts with
			perfect counterfeit bought for cents
			on the dollar.

					NICK
			The Feds would be onto you in a
			month.

					SUGAI
			Not with these bills.  And even if
			it only took them six months, do you
			know what our profit margin would
			be?

	Nick looks at a child playing near one of the hot pools in
	Sugai's garden.

					NICK
			Why tell me this?

					SUGAI
			The other plate is currently in New
			York, in the hands of Kobo's man.
			Find it for me.

					NICK
			You trust me?

					SUGAI
			I'll pay you.

	Nick laughs at Sugai's audaciousness.

					NICK
				(indicating the
				 counterfeit bills)
			With these?

					SUGAI
			Swiss bank deposit.  Gold bullion.
			Whatever you want.  You know the
			city and the police.

					NICK
			If I say no?

					SUGAI
			You're smarter than Kobo.  You know
			the price of deceit.  Think about
			it.

					NICK
			I don't have to.

	Sugai cools.  Without a word he gets to his feet and
	starts toward the door.

					NICK
			I have ten hours to grab my man.

	ON SUGAI

	still walking with his back to Nick.

					NICK (O.S.)
			You won't get hurt.

	Sugai turns to see Nick, across the room, pointing the
	Beretta at his head.

								 CUT TO:

	INT.  ROOM - SUGAI'S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

	The room where Ich and Joyce are waiting.  Sugai enters.
	Their surprise turns to shock when they see Nick behind
	him holding a gun to the old man's head.

					ICH
			No...

					NICK
			Let's go.  Him first.

					ICH
			Nick, you can't do this.

					NICK
			It's done.
				(to Joyce)
			You don't have to come.

	She hasn't moved a muscle.


	INT SUGAI'S HOUSE - ENTRANCE WAY

	Sugai watches calmly as Nick, Ich, and Joyce put their
	shoes on.  Nick keeps the gun on him.

								 CUT TO:

	EXT.  SUGAI'S COURTYARD

	Nick steps out of the house.  He now has one end of a wire
	coat hanger loosely wrapped around Sugai's neck, the other
	end around his wrist.  His gun is pressed just beneath
	Sugai's ear.  If nick gets shot, so does Sugai.

	A handful of guards stand in the courtyard, one is
	polishing Sugai's Debonnaire car.  They spot Nick and
	Sugai coming, and immediately pull their guns.

					NICK
			Explain to them.  They shoot me,
			they kill you.
				(Sugai hesitates)
			DO IT!

	Sugai explains to his lieutenants.  They stand helpless as
	Nick walks Sugai toward the car.

					NICK
			Grab the keys, Ich, and get inside.

					ICH
			No.

					NICK
			Not now, man, okay, not now.  Work
			with me.

	Ich takes the keys from the man polishing the car.  He
	gets inside.  Joyce hurries in bedside him.

					ICH
			You don't know what you're doing.

	Nick slides Sugai in the back seat, carefully reaches over
	and shuts the door.

					NICK
			Start it.

					ICH
				(terrified)
			I can't...

					JOYCE
			Slide over.

	Joyce, furious at Nick, starts the car, gets behind the
	wheel.  Ich gets in on the other side.

	She spins the car around.  The gate opens.  They tear off.

								 CUT TO:

	EXT.  STREET - BEPPU - DAY

	The car bursts through the funnels of steam from the hot-
	springs beneath the street.  It tears down the narrow
	block dodging traffic.  Joyce is concentrating hard on the
	road.

					NICK
				(to Ich)
			Where's somewhere safe?

	Nothing from Ich.  He's still apoplectic.

					JOYCE
				(angrily)
			You came up with the first part.

								 CUT TO:

	EXT.  KUDAN LOVE HOTEL - BEPPU

	A four story concrete hotel, strictly for making love.
	"Love Hotels" exist all over Japan.  Each have various
	themes:  western, fifties drive in, Star Wars, etc., each
	complete with music and lighting effects.


	INT.  HOTEL ROOM

	Western style.  Plastic five foot cacti in front of the
	western vista on the walls.  A hitching post at the head
	of the bed.  Cowboy hats and boots at the other end.

	Sugai hangs up the phone and turns to Nick and Joyce who
	are sitting nearby.  Ich hangs up the extension.

					SUGAI
			Kobo will meet me here tomorrow.
			Ten a.m.

	Ich nods, confirming that what Sugai says is true.

					NICK
			Good.

					SUGAI
			He'll find out you took me.  I'm
			unprotected.  He'll kill us.  All of
			us.  You don't stand a chance.

	Ich, knowing Sugai is right, looks at Nick.  Nick flips
	Ich the gun.

					NICK
			Not if we're careful.

	Ich checks to make sure the gun is loaded, then watches as
	Nick escorts Joyce out of the room.

								 CUT TO:

	A HOTEL ROOM ACROSS THE HALL

	Fifties theme.  The front end of a pink chevy curves
	around the bed.  A "Drive-In" movie screen along one wall.

	Nick is dropping change into the vintage Wurlitzer.  Joyce
	steps in, leaving the door open.

					JOYCE
			You're out of your mind.  I'm
			leaving.

	Nick doesn't respond.

					JOYCE
			You'll get Ich killed.

					NICK
			No one's keeping him here.

					JOYCE
			Bullshit, Nick.  And don't tell me
			this is all just about Charlie.
			It's not.

					NICK
			Why would you care?

	That pushes her over the line.

					JOYCE
			Bastard...

	She moves toward him, enraged.  Nick grabs her arm.

					JOYCE
			Let go.

	He won't.

					JOYCE
			You're out of your mind.

	He grips her tighter.

								 CUT TO:

	THE ROOM - LATER

	Nick and Joyce, only partially undressed, are making love
	on the floor.  The Drifters singing "Under The Boardwalk"
	can be heard on the Wurlitzer.  The fifties decor, the
	music, it's all pretty incongruous.

								 CUT TO:

	EXT.  LOVE HOTEL - DAWN

	Nick is putting Joyce in a taxi.  He shuts the door.

					JOYCE
			I still think you're a bastard.

					NICK
			What if I chant?

					JOYCE
			Wouldn't help.
				(beat)
			Watch out for Ich.

	He nods.  The cab drives off.  Nick watches her taxi until
	it is out of sight, around a corner, then heads inside.

								 CUT TO:

	NICK - LATER

	walking into Sugai's room.  Sugai's asleep on the bed.
	Ich is vigilantly sitting awake in the corner, the gun
	resting on the table in front of him.

					NICK
			Better wake him up.

								 CUT TO:

	EXT.  LOVE HOTEL - LATER

	Quiet.  The wind twirls a discarded newspaper in the
	parking lot.

	INSIDE THE LOVE HOTEL - HALLWAY

	A YOUNG GIGGLING COUPLE step out of a door, arm in arm,
	and disappear down the hall.  STAR WARS MUSIC from one
	room.  HAWAIIAN MUSIC from another.

	THE CAMERA FINDS the closed elevator door.  It opens, Kobo
	steps out, followed by a half-dozen more men all carrying
	Sig-Saur assault rifles -- very heavy artillery.

								 CUT TO:

	SUGAI

	wearing his hat and coat is sitting on the couch, his back
	to us, facing out the window.

	Drop down to --

	THE ROOM BENEATH HIM

	A couple are making love in the Hawaiian theme room.

	The door burst open.  Two men, cradling Sig-Saur rifles in
	their arms, step in.  They aim at the ceiling, blasting
	into Sugai's room above.

	THE GIRL

	starts screaming.  The men ignore her and continue to pump
	bullets into the ceiling.

	KOBO AND HIS MEN

	stop in front of every door long enough to blast into the
	room.  They make their way down the hall.

	A naked man steps into the hallway and is matter-of-factly
	gunned down.

	Kobo and his men stop in front of Sugai's room.


	INT.  SUGAI'S ROOM

	Sugai, wearing his hat, is slumped down on the couch which
	has been splintered by the bullets from below.

	OUTSIDE THE ROOM

	Kobo signals the men.  All six open-up through the door.

	INSIDE THE ROOM

	The door, what's left of it, is kicked open.  The six men
	step in, shooting in all directions:  into the bathroom
	door, into the closet... Windows shatter, mirrors fall,
	total destruction.  They stop.  SILENCE.

	Kobo walks up to Sugai who is slumped on the couch.  He
	lifts up his hat.  It's a cowboy mannequin wearing Sugai's
	clothes.

	THE ELEVATOR DOOR

	opens.  A DOZEN of Sugai's men carrying machine pistols
	come out.

	THE OUTSIDE BALCONY

	Nick and Ich lie on their bellies, guns out.

	INSIDE THE ROOM

	Kobo's men turn.  Sugai's men open-up.  Three of Kobo's
	hitters go down.  The others try to flee into the
	adjoining room.

	Kobo goes for the balcony.

	THE BALCONY

	as Kobo steps out.  He steps right into --

	NICK

	who slams the side of Kobo's head with the butt of his
	gun.

	THE ROOM   

	Nick and Ich drag Kobo in by his jacket collar.  Sugai,
	very much alive, walks in from the hallway.  Nothing is
	said.  Sugai looks at Kobo for a long beat, then walks
	out.

								 CUT TO:

	INT.  SUGAI'S HOUSE - DAY

	KOBO

	standing alone in the middle of a tatami room.  His face
	is badly beaten.  His hands are bound.  Two guards stand
	near the wall.  Nick and Ich stand across the room.

	SUGAI

	wearing a western suit, is asking Kobo questions in
	Japanese.  Sugai barks at him again.  Kobo refuses to
	answer.  Sugai pulls up a shuto -- an 18 inch knife --
	from it's scabbard.

					SUGAI
				(in Japanese)
			Contact your associate in New York
			and tell him to hand my plate over
			to Abolofia.

	Nothing from Kobo.

					SUGAI
			You have betrayed the syndicate and
			personally dishonored me.  I would
			rather the deal fell through than...

	The guards walk over and turn Kobo around.  His back is to
	Sugai.  Sugai runs the sword across the nape of Kobo's
	neck drawing blood.  The guards tighten their grip on
	Kobo's arms.

	NICK

	can't believe Sugai's going to kill him.  Nick starts to
	get up, Ich stops him.

	Kobo realizes Sugai isn't just threatening him.

					KOBO
			No... I'll arrange it.

								 DISSOLVE TO:

	THE ROOM - LATER

	Kobo is led back into the room by two guards.  The guards
	shove him down to the floor.  His hands are still bound.

	Nick walks over and stands above him.  He doesn't say a
	word.  Just stands above him.  Then, Nick pulls spare
	change from his pocket and slowly drops the coins, one by
	one, in front of Kobo's face, like Kobo did to him.  He
	walks away.

	Sugai steps in.

					SUGAI
			Abolofia's person has received the
			plate.  It's done.

	A door opens at the far end of the room.  It's Kobo's
	girlfriend, the one Nick and Ich had been following.

	She starts toward Kobo; a lieutenant intercepts her.

					SUGAI
				(in Japanese)
			I wanted you to see him like this.

					GIRL
				(in Japanese)
			Let him go, father.

	ON ICH

	realizing she's Sugai's daughter.

					GIRL
				(in Japanese)
			You're too old...

					SUGAI
				(in Japanese)
			That's enough.

	Sugai turns away and picks up the sword.  The guards
	clutch Kobo.  Sugai's going to kill Kobo after all.

	The girl screams at him to stop.  Sugai's oblivious.

					NICK (O.S.)
			That wasn't our deal.

					SUGAI
			You want him dead too.

					NICK
			After a court convicts him.  He
			belongs to me.

	There's a long pause.  Then, something unusual happens.
	Sugai tells the lieutenant to unfasten Kobo's wrist.  When
	he does, Sugai hands Kobo the sword and demands that he
	cut off his finger.

	This is Yubitsume:  the ritual act within the Yakuza of
	slicing the joint of the little finger to atone for a
	mistake.

	Kobo, not believing in this ancient tradition, refuses.
	Sugai nods to a guard who places Kobo's finger on the
	table.

	KOBO

	stares defiantly at Sugai.  He doesn't even wince as the
	blade slices off his finger.  The guard hands Sugai the
	finger in a handkerchief.

					SUGAI
				(looking at Nick)
			If anything happens to Abolofia or
			my plate, detective...

	HOLD on Nick then --

								 CUT TO:

	EXT.  TRAIN - DAY

	as it bursts out of a tunnel on it's way to Tokyo.


	INT.  TRAIN - DAY

	Kobo is sitting by the window, his hands cuffed in front
	of him.  Another pair of cuffs chain him to the arm rest.

	Nick pours a drink from an airline-sized bottle of Scotch.
	He holds it out to... Ich.  It's his first drink in a
	week.

					NICK
			Just one, compadre... Kampai.

					ICH
			Kampai.

	They clink glasses.  Ich drinks it down.

					NICK
			It took 12 years to make it, you
			could take five minutes to drink it.

	Ich slows down.

					NICK
			You did great, Ichiro.

					ICH
			I called Ohashi, he'll be waiting.
				(smiling)
			I like him waiting.

	Ich gets up.

					ICH
			Needs ice.

	He heads for the bar car, leaving Kobo and Nick alone.

	Kobo looks out the window at the people working the rice
	paddies, then back down the aisle at the Salarymen in
	their identical suits, then at the women separated from
	them.

					KOBO
			Ugly... A couple of thousand years
			they've been bound by these little
			rules.  Looking in.  Always afraid.
			Ugly little lives...

					NICK
			Save it, I already took the tour.

					KOBO
			You are a lucky man.  Where you come
			from a man can stand out.  It's
			expected.  Here a man is made to
			look a fool for standing out.

	Nick isn't paying much attention.

					KOBO
			I like your friend, Joyce.  You're
			lucky.

					NICK
			Guess I'm on a roll.

					KOBO
			She's such a long way home for you.

					NICK
			Time, I've got plenty of.

	A raucous SALARYMAN comes down the aisle, singing an Enka,
	swaying with the train, bumping into seats.  A common
	enough sight and ignored by the rest of the passengers.
	The Salaryman stumbles and falls across Nick's lap.

					NICK
				(helping him up)
			Hey, hey, come on, blow...

	The Salaryman bows deep.  Nick ignores it.  The man moves
	on.  Kobo looks out the window, the train begins to SLOW
	as it approaches the next station.

					KOBO
				(matter-of-factly)
			This is my stop.

					NICK
			I'm amused.

					KOBO
			Don't be.

	Nick looks up to see Kobo calmly fingering a lock of blond
	hair tied with black ribbon.  Joyce's ribbon.  Joyce's
	hair.

					KOBO
			I have her.

	Nick looks down the car.  The drunk Salaryman who stumbled
	over Nick is quite sober.  He made the hand-off to Kobo.
	Kobo holds out his wrists.  Nick hesitates.

					KOBO
				(matter-of-factly)
			I'll kill her.

	Nick, reluctantly, unlocks both sets of cuffs.  The train
	pulls into the station.

					KOBO
			I want the plate from your pal,
			Sugai.  When you get it, you get
			her.

	Kobo gets up, starts down the aisle.

					NICK
			Sugai won't give it to me, you know
			that.

					KOBO
			Then take it from him.

	Kobo gets off the train.

	NICK

	follows him to the door.

	THE STATION

	Kobo get into a waiting Jaguar.  Four guards nearby.

	INSIDE THE TRAIN

	Nick runs down the length of the car trying to keep the
	Jaguar in sight as the train pulls out... the car is gone.

	NICK

	bursts into the packed bar car.

					NICK
			Ichiro?!

	Everyone turns around.  No Ich.

								 CUT TO:

	EXT.  TRAIN - TRAIN STATION - TOKYO

	It slows into the station.


	INT.  TRAIN

	Nick shoves past the passengers lined up in the vestibule,
	ignoring a conductor's angry shouts.


	INT.  TERMINAL - MOMENTS LATER

	The train stops.  Nick flies out and starts running,
	dodging the crowd.

	Three uniformed policemen, including Ohashi's assistant,
	hurry toward him; they're dismayed to find that Kobo is
	gone.

					NICK
			Where's Ohashi?

	Instead of offering him help, the policemen grab him and
	slap a pair of handcuffs on Nick's wrists.

					NICK
			What the hell are you doing?!

								 CUT TO:

	HOLDING CELL - TOKYO POLICE STATION

	Nick, waiting alone in the cell.  It's been hours.  A door
	at the end of the hall opens.

	Ohashi stops in front of his cell.

					OHASHI
			Your plane leaves at six.  Two
			officers will escort you.

					NICK
			For God's sake, Ohashi, I need your
			help.  Let me out of here!

					OHASHI
			You had my help, detective.

					NICK
			If anything happens to her while I'm
			here --

					OHASHI
			-- Do you know where she is,
			detective?  Do you know how to find
			her?  Even where to start?  We will
			find them.

					NICK
			I have to get to Sugai.

					OHASHI
			Goodbye, officer.

	Ohashi keeps walking.

					NICK
			OHASHI!

	The LOUD clank of metal on metal.  Ohashi's gone.

					NICK
				(yelling at the top
				 of his lungs)
			OHASHI!!

	HOLD on Nick, his fingers squeezing the bars in rage,
	then --

								 CUT TO:

	EXT.  ROAD - DAY

	Flood rice paddies stretch to the distance on either side
	of the road.  We PAN over to Kobo at a phone kiosk outside
	a gas station.

					KOBO
				(in Japanese)
			Yes.  Do it.


	INT.  SUGAI'S HOUSE - AT THAT MOMENT

	Kobo's girl, Sugai's daughter, hangs up the phone.  She's
	been on the other end of the line.


	INT.  SUGAI'S ROOM

	The door swings open.  Sugai is sitting on the floor.  The
	girl is carrying a tray of tea.  Beneath the tray, we spot
	something else -- the butt of a short-bladed tanto.

								 CUT TO:

	EXT.  NARITA AIRPORT - TOKYO - DAY

	A police car rolls through the service gate.  We see Nick
	inside the car along with two police guards.


	INT.  HOLDING ROOM - NARITA AIRPORT

	A white room.  No chairs.  Jet engines can be HEARD
	through the walls.  Nick is sitting on the floor,
	defeated.  He doesn't look up when he hears someone enter.

					ICH (O.S.)
			I'll tell you one thing.  You can't
			solve a thing sitting on your ass.

	Nick looks up.  Ich is in uniform.  A revolver and batton
	hang from his white web gear.  His undershirt bulges
	through his khaki shirt.  He looks ridiculous.  Nick has
	never seen a more beautiful sight.

								 CUT TO:

	INT.  POLICE CAR

	Ich is driving.  Nick is seated behind a cage in the back
	seat.  His hands are cuffed.  Ich is driving through the
	freight area towards a perimeter guard.

					NICK
			I was ready to have your ass for
			taking off on me.

					ICH
			I followed them.  An hour from the
			train station.

					NICK
			How many men?

					ICH
			I couldn't tell.

					NICK
			Joyce?

					ICH
			I don't know.

					NICK
			We need the plate to negotiate with.

	Ich nods.


	EXT.  AT THE GATE - TOKYO AIRPORT

	The car slows.  Ich speaks rapidly to the guard showing
	him his papers.  The guard takes a good hard look at Nick.
	Time stands still... He waves them through.  Nick can
	breath again.

					NICK
			You know, Ichiro, you just burned
			your bridges.

	Ich is silent for a moment.  He hands Nick's Beretta back
	through the partition.  So it goes.

					ICH
			Rest.

	Nick looks for Ich's eyes in the rearview mirror.  The
	little cop keeps driving, his eyes on the road.

								 DISSOLVE TO:

	EXT.  STREET - BEPUKU - DAY

	Nick and Ich are standing outside their car.  The Police
	radio crackles from inside.

	WHAT THEY SEE:

	A large crowd gathered outside of Sugai's estate.  Police
	have cordoned off the area.  An empty ambulance is parked
	out front with various other cars:  Debonnaire's,
	Cadillac's... A boy in shorts is endlessly bouncing a ball
	against the compound wall.  Whatever happened is long
	over.

	Ich flips off the radio.

					ICH
			Someone attacked him.

					NICK
			Now we've got nothing to negotiate
			with.

								 CUT TO:

	EXT.  ROAD - DUSK

	The police car streaks across endless fields.

	INSIDE THE CAR

	Nick is at the wheel.  He rubs the sleep from his eyes.
	Ich is slumped down in the seat watching the road.

	Ich pulls out a cigarette.  Nick lights it for him.

					NICK
			Joyce told me about your family.
			It's tough...

	Ich looks up surprised.

					ICH
			Thank you.
				(beat)
			You have one?

					NICK
			A wife.  She left.

					ICH
			I'm sorry.

					NICK
			Me too.

	Ich glances over at Nick, then back at the road.

	Nicks rubs out his cigarette and presses down on the
	accelerator.

								 DISSOLVE TO:

	EXT.  KOBO'S HIDEOUT - DAWN

	A small, contemporary house perched on a dry piece of
	land.  A paved road, lined with dense foliage runs on a
	berm between the flooded rice paddies.

	ON NICK AND ICH

	sitting in the car watching from a hillside turnoff.
	There's no easy way in.

					NICK
			Let's go.

	Ich hands Charlie his shuto -- an 18 inch long knife.

					NICK
			What's that for?

					ICH
			Luck.

	Nick tucks the shuto inside his jacket.

					NICK
			Thanks.

	Nick opens up his door and climbs out.

					ICH
			You know, Nick, we can't lose.

					NICK
				(stopping)
			Why's that?

					ICH
			Because we're the biggest things to
			hit this town since Godzilla.

								 CUT TO:

	THE DIRT ROAD

	leading to the house lined with foliage.  The rice paddies
	on either side.

								 CUT TO:

	NICK AND ICH

	making their way through the waist high water.

	TWO WORKERS

	with their hoes make their way into the water.  They don't
	see our cops.

	OUR COPS

	making their way along the edge of the road.  The SOUND of
	a motorcycle coming.

	THE MOTORCYCLE RIDER

	slows and drops a gear as he turns off the main road and
	onto the dirt berm toward the house.  He's one of Kobo's
	Bosozoku -- a long way from the streets of Tokyo.

	The rider comes around the bend to see --

	A COP

	standing in a uniform.  Ich.  For a moment he doesn't know
	what to do.  Then, he draws a pistol from his belt and
	accelerates toward Ich.

	ICH

	stands his ground as the bike closes in.  The biker takes
	aim.

	Ich drops off to the side as --

	NICK

	rises from a ditch and swings a hoe at the rider as he
	passes, catching the man across the face.  The rider drops
	like a swatted fly.  The biker's momentum carries it a few
	yards before it falls and skids to a halt.

	Nick hurries to the bike.

	Ich drags the biker off the road, then catches up to his
	partner.

	NICK AND ICH

	raise the heavy bike.  Nick mounts.  He takes the riders
	helmet and goggles from Ich, and puts them on.

					ICH
			What are you going to do?

	Nick doesn't know exactly.  He taps the bike into gear, it
	torques like a mule.  There's a lot more juice here
	than he's used to.

	Nick fishtails for a minute, then gets the hang of it.

	Ich heads off taking another route.


	INT.  HOUSE

	KOBO AND SUGAI'S DAUGHTER

	are putting the last of their belongings into a suitcase.
	She hands him the plate -- Sugai's plate.

	Kobo kisses her as he slips it into his breast pocket.
	The SOUND of a motorcycle approaching from outside.


	EXT.  THE HOUSE

	Kobo steps out, and not recognizing Nick, raises his hand
	to greet what he thinks is one of his men.

	ON NICK

	bearing down on Kobo.

	ON KOBO

	as Nick keeps coming.  He is unable to see clearly until
	Nick is almost on top of him.

	NICK

	dumps the bike at the foot of the stairs and leaps on
	Kobo.

	Nick and Kobo roll off the narrow porch.  Nick breaks
	free.  He isn't fighting fair this time.  He slams his
	foot into Kobo's face and ribs.  Kobo tries to get up, but
	Nick knees him in the chin.

	A woman cries out in Japanese.  Nick turns to see

	JOYCE

	standing at the top of the steps.  A biker is pressing the
	muzzle of a Sig-Saur assault rifle on her.  Kobo's girl is
	beside them holding a small pistol.

	KOBO

	gets to his feet.  The biker tosses Kobo the rifle.  Kobo
	works the charging lever and holds the weapon at his side.
	He has all the time in the world.

	Kobo whirls and kicks Nick in the groin.  Nick falls to
	his knees in agony.

	Kobo towers above Nick as he did in the alley in New York.

					KOBO
			Still on your knees, Nick?

	Kobo walks off, his back to Nick.

					KOBO
			There's nothing you can do for me
			anymore.  I have the plate.  Sugai's
			dead.  No there is something.

	He walks up to the steps to Joyce.

					KOBO
			You can tell me who I should shoot
			first.

	Nick struggles to get to his feet.  Kobo turns and faces
	Nick at the foot of the steps.

	ICH

	appears behind Kobo and takes him down with an amazing
	display of baton work that shows a lifetime of training.

	He grabs the gun.  A biker bursts out of the door.  Ich
	fires, hitting him in the thigh.  He drops his gun.

	SUGAI'S DAUGHTER

	grabs the gun.

	NICK

	tackles her, and wrestles the gun away.  She grabs for it.
	Nick slugs her.

	A GUN BLAST

	Ich is hit in the back of his shoulder, falls onto the
	porch.

	KOBO

	the shooter, is holding a pistol -- a Glock 17 automatic.
	He fires at

	NICK AND JOYCE

	who scramble for cover.

	KOBO

	continues firing as he climbs onto a motorcycle.  He pops
	the clutch and flies off down the road.  Nick fires after
	him, but Kobo's gone.

					NICK
				(to Ich)
			You all right?

					ICH
			Yes...

					NICK
				(to Joyce)
			Call for help.

	Nick mounts the other bike, and puts the turbo charged
	rocket into gear.

	THE ROAD

	Rain pours down as Kobo turns onto the main road.  He
	opens up the throttle, and in less than a second, he's a
	screaming dot in the distance.

	NICK

	comes around the same corner.  His bike fishtails and
	slides out from under him.

	FURTHER DOWN THE ROAD

	Kobo tears past a police car.  The police car takes off
	after him.

	THE FOOTHILLS

	A series of steep switchbacks traverse the steep, densely
	forested hills.

	Kobo's bike flies up the road.  The police car can't keep
	up, begins losing ground.

	THE POLICE CAR

	going flat out, falling further and further behind.
	Kobo's going to escape.

	SUDDENLY

	Nick, bent low, shoots past the cop car.  His left arm is
	scraped and bloody.

	ON KOBO

	glancing back, to see Nick gaining on him.  Kobo's
	pleased.  He gives it more gas.

	NICK

	pulling eight-five... ninety... one hundred.  The rain
	stings his face.  It's hard to keep his eye open.

	THE FOOTHILLS

	Kobo leaning into one of the steep turns, climbing higher
	and higher toward the clouds clinging to the top of the
	peak.

	NICK

	is gaining on him.  He HEARS something coming up behind
	him.

	A BOSOZOKU

	the one Ich shot in the leg, is closing fast on his tail.

	ON NICK

	as the biker draws even.

	THE BIKER

	pulls out his long knife and slashes at Nick's shoulder.

	Nick drops back causing him to miss.  The biker drops
	back.  Nick tries to speed up, but the biker sticks with
	him.  He's a good rider, this boy.  Very, very good.

	The biker moves in again, blade drawn.

	NICK SEES

	something the biker doesn't.

	A TRUCK

	coming around the corner.

	NICK

	swerves to avoid it at the last moment.  The biker reacts
	too late and runs --

	INTO THE GLEAMING

	radiator of the two ton truck, and disappears beneath its
	wheels.

	ON KOBO

	around the bend, glancing back.  Empty road.  He eases up
	on the throttle -- a free man... He circles back only to
	see

	NICK

	burst around the corner charging toward him at a hundred-
	and-twenty miles per hour, in the driving rain.

	KOBO

	waits and waits.  Nick draws closer.  Then, Kobo tears off
	back down the mountain, shooting past Nick.

	Nick brakes... He slows down, and starts to turn, but the
	wheels whirl on the gravel and the bike goes into a skid,
	heading right for the edge of the road.

								 CUT TO:

	NICK'S MOTORCYCLE

	flying over the edge of the road, and down the cliff.

								 CUT TO:

	THE EDGE OF THE ROAD

	Nick, lying on his stomach at the edge of the cliff, his
	arm is probably broken.

	He tries to get up with a one arm push up.  It's hopeless.
	His head falls into a puddle of water.

	The WHINE of an approaching motorcycle.  Kobo has come
	back for him.

	Nick, in excruciating pain, struggles for his gun.

	KOBO

	bearing down on Nick.

	NICK

	struggling to get his gun.  Finally he does.  But it's
	caked in mud.  If the barrel is stuffed it will explode.
	Nick has to take the chance.

	ON KOBO

	Closer and closer.

	NICK

	aims as best he can and fires.  The mud caked gun explodes
	in his hand.  Nick screams in agony.

	KOBO

	pulls his bike up inches in front of Nick's head.  Nick
	seems to be bleeding everywhere:  his hand, his nose, his
	mouth, the side of his head...

	Kobo's face and neck is caked in blood from when Nick beat
	him.

	The rain pours down.

	He picks up the gun.  Points it at Nick, squeezes the
	trigger.

					KOBO
				(slowly)
			Bang... bang...

	He tosses the gun in front of Nick's face.

					KOBO
			... You're dead.

	The sound of approaching Police SIRENS.

	Kobo swings the bike around, goes a hundred yards down the
	road, then swings back.

	Kobo guns the engine.  He gain speed... thirty, thirty-
	five.

	NICK

	struggles to get up.  He can't.

	KOBO

	opening the throttle.

	NICK

	crawling a few inches, that's it.

	KOBO

	twenty yards away.

	NICK

	reaches into his coat and pulls Ich's 18 inch shuto out.

	He rolls away at the last moment, slashing Kobo's ankle as
	he races past.

	KOBO

	screams in pain.  He tries to stop too suddenly.  The bike
	flips over.  Kobo flies into the air then hits the
	pavement on his side and rolls a few yards down the road.
	He stops on his back.  It's lucky he's alive.

	The SOUND of fast approaching police SIRENS.

	THE PLATE

	has fallen out of Kobo's jacket.  It rests in the road,
	halfway between the two men.

	KOBO

	crawls toward it on his belly.

	NICK

	mustering all his strength, struggles across the road on
	all fours.

	KOBO

	crawling snake-like.

	NICK

	still moving, his arms and legs feel like lead.

	KOBO'S FINGERS

	as they reach for the plate.

	NICK

	grabs Kobo's wrist forcing him to drop the plate.  Nick
	picks up a rock.  It looks as if he's going to smash
	Kobo's head.  Instead, he brings it down on the plate,
	shattering it in a half-dozen pieces.

	Nick tosses the pieces in front of Kobo's face.

					NICK
			Keep the change.

	Nick, exhausted, slowly falls onto his back.  He looks
	over at Kobo, their faces are inches apart.  Nick makes a
	slashing mark with his index finger above his eyebrows.
	The same gesture Kobo made to Nick through the two-way
	mirror in New York.

	Nick passes out.  His eyes shut... the screen...

								FADES TO BLACK.

	BLACK SCREEN

	The SOUND of three police cars screeching to a halt.  The
	SOUNDS of the police SIRENS winding down.

	The SIRENS get softer mixing with the SOUND of RINGING
	phones, CLACKING typewriters, VOICES...


	FADE IN:

	INT.  TOKYO POLICE HEADQUARTERS

	Fifty identical desks.  Fifty identically dressed men in
	white shirts and ties work under fluorescent lights.

	OHASHI

	is at his desk studying a report.

	Suddenly, the lights go out.  The fan's stop, so do the
	electric typewriters.

	Ohashi looks up to see --

	ICH

	walking toward him down the long aisle, his left arm is
	bandaged, his right hand handcuffed to Kobo on crutches.

	Ich silently leads the captured man down the long aisle to
	Ohashi's desk.

	ICH

	stops in front of the desk and snaps to attention.

					ICH
			Constable Ichiro Matsumoto presents
			captured prisoner Kobo, Chief
			Inspector Ohashi.

	Ich salutes.

					OHASHI
			Inspector Ohashi will take charge of
			the prisoner.

	Ich uncuffs Kobo and steps aside to reveal --

	NICK

	standing at the far end of the room by the fuse box.  He's
	also bandaged and on crutches.

	Nick looks at Ohashi without saying a word, then flips the
	main switch up.  The lights and fans start working.

	He turns and walks out the door.

								 CUT TO:

	EXT.  POLICE COURTYARD - A FEW DAYS LATER

	A small decoration ceremony.

	ON ICHIRO

	getting two golden suns pinned to the lapel of his dress
	uniform.

	In the far corner

	NICK, JOYCE AND

	Ichiro's wife, dressed in a formal kimono, watch the
	ceremony.

								 CUT TO:

	INT.  JAPANESE RESTAURANT - TOKYO - DAY

	Joyce and Nick are sitting alone at a table.  Nick's left
	arm in in a sling.

					NICK
			Can't make you change your mind?

					JOYCE
			Last time you asked me to come along
			I nearly got a hole in my head.

					NICK
			Might be different in New York.

					JOYCE
			Maybe.  If I come visit, we can find
			out.

					NICK
			I'd like that.

	Ich sits down with two fresh bowls of soba noodles.  Nick
	hesitates.

					ICH
			You can do it.

	Nick picks up his chopsticks with his good hand.  He
	begins to slurp the noodles.

					ICH
			Louder, pal, louder.

					NICK
			Joyce, give the assistant Chief
			Inspector a drink, would you?

	As Joyce refills all their cups we...

								 SLOWLY DISSOLVE TO:

	EXT.  EIGHT THREE PRECINCT - NEW YORK CITY - DAY

	It's raining.  A sun shower.


	INT.  POLICE STATION

	Capt. Oliver is standing by the window watching the rain
	pour down.

					OLIVER
			... Remember, counterfeiting is the
			Feds.  They'll be all over
			Abolofia's place.  Stick tight.
			You I.D. the other plate, he does
			real time.

					NICK
			Right.

	Reveal Nick sitting in front of Oliver's desk, his one arm
	is still in a sling.  Nick gets to his feet.

					OLIVER
				(still not facing
				 him)
			You know, Nick, if you'd held on to
			that plate, you could've been a very
			rich man.

	Oliver turns to face Nick.  Nick just looks at him, then:

					NICK
			Never crossed my mind.

	Oliver nods; he believes him.

					OLIVER
			Be careful on the run.

								 CUT TO:

	INT.  SQUAD BAY - NIGHT

	In contrast to the Japanese police station -- it's chaos.
	Cops are in every imaginable kind of dress, trash cans
	over flow, a handcuffed prisoner screams abuse to anyone
	who will listen.

	THE RAIDING PARTY

	a dozen men in all, are donning flak jackets and
	windbreakers with POLICE and TREASURY stenciled on the
	back.

	NICK

	walks in with two heavy bullet proof vests slung over his
	shoulder.  He squeezes past the raiding party to find

	ICH

	sitting at a desk, thumbing through a Frommer's guide to
	New York City.  Nick drops one of the vests on the desk.
	It lands like a ton of bricks.  Ich continues to read.

	A Sergeant walks in.

					SERGEANT
			Saddle up.  Hard team in the first
			unit.  Conklin, your RMP awaits.

	The cops and treasury men, grabbing their gear, head for
	the door.

	Nick is struggling to get into his vest using one arm.

					NICK
			Sure you want to come?  Probably
			better than the Greyline Tour.

	Ich stands up, shoves the guidebook in his back pocket.
	He helps Nick fasten the strap in back.

					ICH
			You wouldn't make it without me.

	Nick smiles, takes the Frommer's out of Ich's pocket and
	tosses it into the trash.

	Nick hands him a shotgun, takes another one off the rack
	for himself.

	We watch from behind as the two men head down the long
	hallway toward the exit.

					ICH
			Think we'll get him, Nick?

					NICK
			We can't lose.

					ICH
			How can you be so sure?

	Nick opens the door at the far end of the hallway.  They
	step out into the sunlit rain.

					NICK
			Cause you're the biggest thing to
			hit this town since...

	Before Nick can finish his line, the door SLAMS SHUT
	behind them.

								 FADE TO BLACK.

					THE END
BLACK RAIN

                                             November 1987






	A BLACK SCREEN:

	Various voices:	  "Big six"... "That's six the hard way"...
			  "Seven or eleven"... "Play two"...

	FADE IN:

	EXT.  UPPER EAST SIDE - NEW YORK CITY - NIGHT

	One of the pristine blocks of brownstones where even the
	garbage seems gift wrapped.  The VOICES continue over as
	we move in on a particular building where a DOORMAN is
	holding open the door for a dowager and her poodle.

	The voices continue:  "Hit me"... "Double down"... "Let it
	ride"... "Hit me"... "Anymore for the come out"...
	"Card"...

	In contrast to the outside of this sedate, quiet
	brownstone, we go inside to find...


	INT.  BROWNSTONE APARTMENT

	... a miniature Las Vegas, complete with music, drinks,
	tuxedoed dealers and croupiers:  roulette, craps, Black
	Jack.  Wall to wall people.  The fact that casino gambling
	happens to be illegal in New York doesn't stop these
	Connecticut slummers, hollow-cheek nightlifers, and junior
	wiseguys from having a good time.

	AT THE CARD TABLE

	NICK CONKLIN, holding a dollar cigar, is trying to pull a
	winning hand.  In his late thirties, Nick has the sort of
	quiet good looks that takes an extra glance to appreciate.
	His Moe Ginsburg rent-a-tux is too tight, his ruffled
	shirt, out of date; Nick could care less.

	Two other players are still in the game.  One of them is a
	lithe DEBUTANTE surrounded by an entourage of giggling
	friends and tuxedoed men.  The pot is huge.

	Nick flips two one hundred dollar chips onto the pot.

					NICK
			One, and one on top.

					DEALER
			House sees.

					PLAYER ONE
				(hesitates)
			I'm out.

	Disgusted, he throws down his cards.

	It's down to Nick and the debutante.  The cocky deb gives
	Nick a long look, confident she can win.

					DEBUTANTE
				(her eyes still on
				 Nick)
			I see the deuce, and one to chase
			them home.

	She throws her chips on the pot.  Nick hesitates, then
	decides to match it.

					NICK
			Call.

					DEBUTANTE
				(showing her hand)
			Ladies, aces wired.  Sorry sport.

	Nick turns over his cards, Jacks and tens, not good enough
	to win.  Elated, the deb gets up from the table and joins
	her giggling friends.  Nick walks over to her.

					NICK
			Very nice, Barbie.
				(pointing toward her
				 boyfriend)
			Now, I'd take Ken over there and go
			home.

					DEBUTANTE
			Why's that?

					NICK
			It's time.  That's all.

					BOYFRIEND
			The lady wants to play.  Someone
			should teach you to be a better
			loser, loser.

					NICK
			Listen, Ken --

					BOYFRIEND
			My name is not Ken --

					NICK
			-- I'm offering you the benefit of
			my experience.

					DEBUTANTE
			Looks like you have a lot of
			experience in places like this.  It
			was nice of them to relax the dress
			code for you.

	That draws a laugh from her friends.  The entourage heads
	for the bar.

	CHARLIE SKLOARIS, twenty-three, steps in front of the
	debutante, blocking her path.

	She steps to the side.  Charlie steps with her.  Charlie's
	pushing it, he's always pushing it.  She's not amused.
	Finally, Charlie lets her pass.  He comes up to Nick.

					CHARLIE
			Typical New York woman, big
			attitude, small apartment, no tits.

	Only two things count to Charlie:  his job and his women,
	but not necessarily in that order.

					CHARLIE
			I think she got to you, pappy.

					NICK
				(checking his watch)
			You want a popsicle, go to Good
			Humor.  And don't call me 'pappy.'

					CHARLIE
				(glancing at the
				 door)
			Still, you gotta wonder how she'd
			look in handcuffs.

	Nick, wary, eyes this kid.  Charlie shrugs, spreads his
	arms defensively.  The SOUND of pounding on the front
	door.

	THE DOOR

	splinters.  The bouncer steps back as four helmeted
	emergency service officers -- the first members of the
	raiding party -- rush in.

	Pandemonium.  People rush for the exit -- any exit.

	AT THE BAR

	Nick and Charlie hold up their glasses.

					NICK
				(calmly)
			Alley oop.

	They down their drinks, then set them down.

	Charlie pulls out the Binaca, offering Nick a spritz, but
	Nick is already pulling out his POLICE BADGE and hanging
	it around his neck.  Charlie quickly follows suit.

	A HALF DOZEN COPS

	line the patrons up against the wall.  The Asst. D.A.,
	PATTY ZACHARA, climbs onto the crap table.  A petite,
	nervous woman, Patty has dressed in a Channel suit for the
	occasion.

					ZACHARA
			Settle down.  Hey, quiet... Please.

	Not a prayer.

					NICK
			SHUT THE HELL UP, GODDAMNIT!

	That quiets them.

					NICK
			My name is Conklin.  Let's do this
			fast so I can go home.

	Zachara, annoyed, looks at Nick.

					NICK
				(softer)
			It's all yours.

					ZACHARA
				(reads)
			Under section 216 of the New York
			State Penal code, I serve notice
			that this premise and it's
			occupants...

	NICK

	catches the Debutante's eye across the room.  She smiles
	at him, he was right.  He shrugs, spreads his hands.
	That's life.

	A well groomed middle aged man, who we'll come to know as
	CAVELLO, suddenly bolts from the crowd lined up against
	the wall.

	Charlie spins around to stop him --

					CHARLIE
			Whoa -- where do you think you're
			going, hotdog.

	Cavello butts him with his head, sending Charlie to the
	floor.  Then, crosses his arms in front of his face and
	plunges through the WINDOW.

	Nick, not missing a beat, gives a small sigh as he
	follows.

					NICK
				(sighs)
			Fabulous...

	He takes off after him.


	EXT.  STREET UPPER EAST SIDE - NIGHT

	Nick, short of breath, chases Cavello down the residential
	street, past the dog-walkers, past the doormen, past the
	fur-coated women climbing out of taxies... Unfortunately,
	Cavello has a good half block on him.

	From nowhere, Charlie blasts past leaving Nick a half
	block behind, silently cursing his age.

	AT THE CORNER

	a limo jerks to a halt, and Cavello jumps in.  The limo
	streaks away.

	CHARLIE

	turns to see Nick, hands on knees, gasping for air.

								 CUT TO:

	INT.  LOCKER ROOM - TWO EIGHT PRECINCT - NIGHT

	Now in their street clothes, Charlie and Nick stand in
	front of the mirrors.  Charlie is working his brush and
	hair dryer as if his life depended on it.  Nick, in
	contrast, shoves his hair back with his fingers and
	glowers at himself in the mirror.

					CHARLIE
				(over the dryer)
			... It's not like you were slow or
			anything... I think you did just
			fine.  I think you did great.

					NICK
			Thanks.

	Nick turns to leave.

					CHARLIE
			Hey, hey, where you goin'?

					NICK
			Home.


	EXT.  POLICE PARKING LOT - NIGHT

	Nick strides out the door.  Charlie hurries after him.

					CHARLIE
			Wait up.  You know the guy who did
			the Weismuller through the window --

					NICK
			-- Cavello.  Ronnie Cavello.

	Charlie trails Nick to his motorcycle:  a Harley hog
	complete with wide gleaming fenders and twin tanks.  The
	bike is held together with tape and baling wire.

					CHARLIE
			You know him?

	Nick tries to kick-start this behemoth, but it's not easy.

					NICK
			He works for Frank Abolofia.
			Atlantic City.  Casinos.

					CHARLIE
			So why dive through the glass for a
			nickel and dime bust?

	Charlie puts his foot up on Nick's fender to tie his shoe.
	Nick, spotting an ankle holster peeking from Charlie's
	sock, grabs Charlie's foot.  Charlie teeters.

					NICK
			What's this?

					CHARLIE
			Let go...

	Nick pulls out a Beretta 32.

					CHARLIE
			Back-up.

					NICK
			Get rid of it.

					CHARLIE
			Why?

					NICK
			It's not regulation.  And the only
			way you're gonna stop anybody with
			it is to show it to him, and while
			he's laughing, you can shove it down
			his throat.

					CHARLIE
				(looking at Nick's
				 bike)
			I'll get rid of it when you get rid
			of the egg-beater.

	The Harley comes to life spitting a cloud of blue smoke.
	Nick puts on his paint-flecked helmet, slides down some
	ski goggles.

					CHARLIE
			Nick, let's go hunting.  Bag
			Cavello.

					NICK
			Charlie...

	Nick pops the bike into gear.

					NICK
			... You still got shaving cream on
			your ear.

	Nick rolls out and disappears in a haze of blue smoke.


	EXT.  BELT PARKWAY - VERRAZANO BRIDGE - NIGHT

	WE FIND Nick, a lonely, solitary figure bobbing in and out
	of the lights and shadows.  The SOUND of wind whips
	through his helmet; cold air stings his cheeks... The tail
	lights of Nick's bike disappear into the night.


	EXT.  SUBURBAN STREET - STATEN ISLAND - NIGHT

	Civil service heaven.  Nick hits the cut switch and glides
	past the manicured lawns and well kept houses of this
	development.  A basketball net in every driveway, a Buick
	or Chrysler in every garage.

	One house sticks out.  The lawn is brown, paint is peeling
	off the garage door and newspapers are scattered on the
	driveway.  Nick glides once around the cul de sac looking
	at the house.  His house.  It's as inviting as an open
	grave.  He shoots away.


	INT.  EL GRECO DINER - STATEN ISLAND - NIGHT

	A hanger sized roadhouse, wall to wall red velvet.

	Nick's the sole figure at the counter, coffee and the
	Daily News in front of him.  A NURSE walks in and sits
	down a half dozen seats away.  Nick look up.

					NICK
			Short shift?

					CONNIE
			Yeah... I came to save you.  If
			you're hopeless, I'll pull the plug.

								 CUT TO:

	INT.  CONNIE'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - NIGHT

	Nick and Connie are in bed.  They're both looking up at
	the ceiling.  They've just made love.

					CONNIE
			It's getting too cold even for me,
			Nick.

					NICK
			Connie...

					CONNIE
			All right, how's the new partner?

					NICK
			High spirits, desire, commitment.

					CONNIE
			You'll take care of that.

					NICK
			Give me a break, would you?

					CONNIE
			If you give me one.

	Nick kisses her.  The first suggestion of real affection.
	The SOUND of someone KNOCKING on the door.  Reluctantly,
	they stop.  Connie gets up and puts on her robe.

					NICK
			Are you expecting anyone?

					CONNIE
			I wasn't expecting you.

	She disappears down the hallway.  We HEAR the door open,
	then telling someone to wait.

					CONNIE
				(poking her head in
				 the room)
			Imagine a small, greasy Boy Scout.

								 CUT TO:

	INT.  CONNIE'S APARTMENT

	Nick, wearing only his pants, is doing a slow burn.
	Charlie is holding his hands up defensively.

					CHARLIE
			... I found the goombah... Cavello.
			He's --

					NICK
			-- I should tear your head off.

					CHARLIE
			Whoa, I knew you were going to say
			that.  I absolutely anticipated
			that, Nick.  But I said to myself,
			Charlie, Charlie, we can move up on
			this, so go find Nicklaus... He'll
			be pissed for a moment, but then
			it'll dawn on him --

					NICK
			-- Hey, I got a better chance of
			being hit by a bus then moving up.

	Charlie looks away momentarily, letting it slide.  He
	knows he's on sensitive ground.

					CHARLIE
			... Look... they told me at the
			Greek's you were here.  I'm sorry, I
			never imagined...

					CHARLIE
				(buddy buddy)
			I like her.  She's nice.
				(lowering his voice)
			For her age.

	The bedroom door opens.  Connie enters, dumps Nick's
	clothes on the couch, tosses his gun on top of the pile.
	Without a word, she goes back inside and slams the door
	behind her.

	Nick, pissed, slowly turns to face Charlie.  Charlie
	shrugs.  Nick's got nothing better to do than go.

								 CUT TO:

	INT.  LIME HOUSE - CHINATOWN - NIGHT

	The Lime House is a little piece of Italy in the heart of
	Chinatown, and tonight, it's packed.  Any selection on the
	jukebox that isn't Frank Sinatra is Jerry Vale.  Behind
	the bar are two fat BROTHERS.  One pours drinks, the other
	dishes out Scungilli.  It's three a.m.  It's always three
	a.m. at the Lime House.

	AT THE BACK TABLE

	Our man CAVELLO is unloading steaming Scungilli onto an
	already heaping plate in front of an imperious looking
	JAPANESE MAN.  The Japanese Man, in his mid-fifties, wears
	a gray suit, and not a strand of his jet black hair is out
	of place.

	A Japanese TRANSLATOR, doing his best to translate
	Cavello's heavily accented English, sits between them.

	AT THE BAR

	Charlie is looking straight ahead, afraid Cavello might
	peg him.  Nick is at ease.

					CHARLIE
			What are they doing now?

					NICK
			Eating Scungilli, just like the last
			time you asked.

					CHARLIE
			Who do you think the Jap is?

					NICK
			Maybe Cavello's buying a Subaru.
			How would I know?

					CHARLIE
			I don't blame you for being sore.
			It'll pass when we bag him.

	Charlie, trying to relax, gestures toward his foot.

					CHARLIE
			Whatdaya think?  'Bostonians'.
			Eighty-five bucks.
				(lowering his voice)
			Girls go for shoes.  Second place
			they look.
				(off Nick's
				 reaction)
			Hey, I read it in a magazine.

	Nick's attention is drawn to a trio walking in the door.

					NICK
				(dead serious)
			Charlie, don't do anything.  Promise
			me?

					CHARLIE
			What?

	WHAT THEY SEE:  TWO BODYGUARDS are making a quick sweep of
	the bar.  FRANK ABOLOFIA, s stocky man with silver grey
	hair, sweeps in behind them.  Abolofia has mitts like a
	meat packer and a fifty dollar manicure.  A heavyweight
	Mafioso.

					NICK
			Frank Abolofia.

					CHARLIE
			The Wolf?

	Abolofia walks to Cavello's table.  All rise and shake
	hands.  The two hitters take seats at the bar.  The two
	brothers scramble to serve their distinguished guests.

					NICK
				(in a whisper)
			Some party.

					CHARLIE
			Maybe we should do something?

					NICK
			Charlie, take your gum, stick it
			under your ass and keep it warm.

	Nick turns away, resumes his drink.

	NICK'S POV IN THE MIRROR BEHIND THE BAR:  two new Japanese
	men step in the door.  Early twenties, spiky hair, dark
	Versace suits.

	NUMBER ONE

	wears tortoise shell shades.  He coolly checks out the
	room then nods to --

	NUMBER TWO

	who pulls a Spas 12, automatic shotgun from under his
	coat, and spits out three rounds.  A window shatters.
	Everyone hits the floor.

	NUMBER ONE

	slowly walks toward Cavello's table.

	NUMBER TWO

	covers the floor.  Abolofia's bodyguards show their empty
	hands.

	NICK AND CHARLIE

	on the floor.  They don't have the artillery for this guy
	either.

	AT THE TABLE

	Our Japanese businessman knows these people.  He eyes them
	contemptuously.

	Abolofia has put enough people in this situation to be
	philosophical about it.  He stops chewing.  A tiny
	hand motion to his bodyguards is enough to stop any
	precipitous action.

					NUMBER ONE
				(in Japanese)
			Give it to me.

	The Japanese businessman looking straight ahead.  A long,
	silent pause... Then, still not facing him:

					BUSINESSMAN
				(in Japanese)
			Go to hell.

	Number One slips his fingers beneath his shades, massaging
	his eyes.  IN A FLASH, he pulls a shuto from under his
	coat.  The 18 inch blade gleams like a neon tube.

	He presses the tip of the blade against the businessman's
	throat.

	CHARLIE

	his hand close around the grip of the Beretta.  He unsnaps
	the ankle holster.  The SNAP can be heard across the room.
	Nick's hand closes around Charlie's and squeezes till the
	knuckles turn white.

					CHARLIE
				(in a whisper)
			What are you doing?

					NICK
			Saving your life.

	NUMBER TWO

	levels the scattergun at Nick and Charlie.

	AT THE TABLE - NUMBER ONE

	calmly holds the blade at the man's throat as he reaches
	into the man's jacket and removes a small, rectangular,
	plastic-wrapped parcel.

	He feels its weight, then flips it to NUMBER TWO.

	Abolofia, realizing that whatever is going on doesn't
	affect him or his, resumes eating.

					ABOLOFIA
			You people are wild... Wild.

	NUMBER ONE backs the blade off.  The man raises his napkin
	to the small wound.  A droplet of blood has stained his
	shirt collar.  NUMBER ONE turns around as if to leave.

	What happens next could be a whim, an after thought.
	Number One spins around and THRUSTS the blade deep into
	the man's chest.  He withdraws it with a half twist, and
	in the same motion fatally slashes the translator's throat
	before the old man's body hits the floor.

	Blood pours from the businessman's mouth onto his
	Scungilli, spreading across the white cloth and onto the
	floor.

	CAVELLO

	reaches for a gun under his coat.  But NUMBER TWO pumps
	two rounds into his face.  At this range, there's not much
	left.

	The killers slowly back out the door, covering the room
	with the scattergun.  The minute the door shuts, Nick
	leaps up, pulling his shield and revolver.

					NICK
				(shouting)
			Police officers.  Everybody stay
			put.
				(to Charlie)
			Get back up.

	Abolofia's eyebrows rise at this development.

	Nick bolts out the door leaving Charlie in charge.  He's
	never been in charge before.

					CHARLIE
				(nervously showing
				 shield)
			Police.


	EXT.  THE LIME HOUSE - NIGHT

	A Lincoln tears around the corner to pick the killers up.

	Nick flies out the Lime House door and hits the ground.

	Number Two pumps out shells as fast as he can squeeze the
	trigger.  He's wild.  The front windows of the Lime House
	shatter.

	The LIMO DRIVER jerks to a halt.  Number Two tosses the
	package to him.

	Nick empties his revolver.  Number Two goes down.

	The driver floors the accelerator, leaving Number One to
	take off on foot.  Nick follows, reloading as he runs.


	INT.  THE LIME HOUSE

	Everyone's frozen on the floor.

					CHARLIE
			Call 911.  Tell them an officer
			needs assistance.  Say ten thirteen.

	Nothing from the owner who looks at Abolofia.  Charlie
	grabs the owner by his collar and shoves him toward the
	phone.

					CHARLIE
			Do it, you dumb bastard!

	Suddenly Charlie feels something wet at his feet.  He
	looks down to see that he's standing in a pool of blood
	from the massacre.  So much for his new shoes.

	He wheels around, then quickly backs out the door.


	EXT.  STREET - DOWN THE BLOCK FROM THE LIME HOUSE

	Deserted.  The wail of police sirens in the distance.
	Charlie has his gun out.  He's drenched in sweat.  Where
	is his partner?

					CHARLIE
			NICK...!  Shit... SHIT!!

								 CUT TO:

	ANOTHER STREET - ALLEY - NIGHT

	Nick, gun drawn, slowly rounds the corner to the alley:
	it's the ad hoc drugstore for the night.  Drugs going up
	and down in pails, two dozen junkies buying, shooting,
	slumped on the ground.  Everyone scatters -- the one's
	that can.

	AN ABANDONED PAIL

	swings slowly back and forth from three stories up.  Nick
	cautiously moves down the alley, holding the gun in both
	hands.  A Junkie steps out of a doorway, Nick swings his
	gun and nearly blows him away.

	NUMBER ONE

	We see his eyes first as he steps out of the darkness at
	the back of the alley.  From now on we'll call him KOBO.
	His sunglasses are on his forehead; his hands dropped
	casually at his side.  A very cool character.

	Kobo slowly raises his hand, and making a gun with his
	finger, slowly points and "shoots" at Nick... He lowers
	his hand.

					NICK
			On the ground, man.  NOW!!

	Kobo cups his hands around his ear.  He doesn't understand
	English.  Nick, keeping his gun fixed, comes up to him and
	kicks out his legs.

	Kobo falls flat on his chest.

	Nick pulls out his cuffs.  But Kobo lunges for Nick's
	ankle and yanks it toward him.  Nick stumbles backward;
	Kobo's on his feet.  Before Nick can stand, Kobo lands a
	brutal kick to the side of Nick's head.

	Nick gets up, barrels into him.  Kobo knees Nick in the
	solar plexus, then lands two more well placed kicks in
	Nick's back.  It's not that Nick's a bad fighter, it's
	that this kid is so damn fast.

	Nick slowly gets to his feet.  KOBO lands two more brutal
	shots to the side of Nick's head.  He's a bloody mess.

	TWO POLICE CARS

	stop at the end of the alley.  FOUR OFFICERS climb out.

	CHARLIE

	joins the cops as they run down the alley to find Nick
	getting pummeled.

	Charlie shoots at Kobo.  Misses.  Kobo turns to see the
	five cops, guns drawn.

	Nick, on one knee, spits out blood and a few teeth.

	Kobo calmly slips the shuto out of his coat pocket and
	drops it next to Nick.  The blade gleams in the light.
	That was next.  Nick got lucky.

	Kobo towers imperiously above Nick.  Their eyes lock.  We
	hold then...

								 FADE TO BLACK.

	FADE IN:

	NICK'S LIVING ROOM - STATEN ISLAND - MORNING

	There isn't a stick of furniture, but that's not the half
	of it.  In the middle of the room is a motorcycle on a
	centerstand.  A drop cloth is spread around it, tools
	neatly aligned.  It's a Harley -- but this one is in
	perfect condition.

	A phone RINGS insistently from off screen, then stops.

					NICK (O.S.)
			Yeah... sure, sure I'll be down.

	Nick walks in, naked.  Every muscle aches.  One side of
	his face is completely swollen.  He has a band-aid over
	his right eye; some blood caked on his earlobe.  He stops
	to twist a spark plug in with a ratchet, but it snaps.

								 CUT TO:

	INT.  EIGHT - THREE PRECINCT - DAY

	CAPT. OLIVER, early forties, walks between Charlie and
	Nick as they head toward the Medical Examiner's room.
	Oliver doesn't face Nick as he speaks; no love lost
	between these two.

					OLIVER
			How big a package we talking about?

					NICK
				(holding up his
				 hands)
			This by this...

					OLIVER
			Dope?

					NICK
			Not in that company.

					OLIVER
			The old man was a Japanese paper
			manufacturer.  Hotel room and rental
			car were full of it.

					CHARLIE
			Full of what?

					OLIVER
				(annoyed)
			Art and stationary paper.  Cavello
			had five hundred thousand in his
			attache case.

	Nick rubs the back of his neck in obvious pain.

					OLIVER
			One guy do all the damage?

					NICK
			Yeah.

					OLIVER
			Thought you knew your way around
			dark alleys, detective.

	Oliver goes through the swinging doors into the Examiner's
	room.  Charlie shoots Nick a look.  Nick let's it slide.


	INT.  MEDICAL EXAMINATION ROOM

	A TECHIE is showing the night's harvest to Charlie, Nick
	and Oliver.  They're standing over the body of the middle-
	aged Japanese man.

					TECHIE
			... The old man's suit was Japanese.
			The hitter's was Saville row.  No
			I.D.  We're doing a peel now.

	AT ANOTHER TABLE

	Another techie is carefully removing the skin from Number
	Two's fingertips.

	Charlie shuts his eyes and turns away, trying not to throw
	up.

					TECHIE
			There's something you got to see.

	He whips back the sheet, the body is nude.  A towel covers
	the genitals.  Except for the feet, hands, neck, and face,
	the body is covered with elaborate tattoos:  flowers and
	blood, dragons and snakes.

					TECHIE
			What's wrong with this picture?

					CHARLIE
				(nervously)
			I got a tattoo.  Birdie on the ball.
			We all got them when we finished
			basic at Camp Lejune.

					NICK
			Charlie.

					TECHIE
			I thought you guys were trained
			observers?

	They look up surprised.  The techie picks up a hand.  The
	third and forth fingers have been neatly amputated.

					TECHIE
			Eight fingers.
				(ironically)
			Hey, it was a trick question.

								 CUT TO:

	INT.  INTERROGATION ROOM

	ABOLOFIA is seated in chair next to his LAWYER.  Nick,
	Oliver, and a third detective are grilling him.

					ABOLOFIA
			He was with a friend, sure.  I shake
			hands with the guy and a minute
			later he's bleeding all over my
			socks.

					ATTORNEY
			Will that do officers?  My client
			has had a terrible shock.

					NICK
			Yeah, he's not used to seeing other
			people do the killing.

					ATTORNEY
			I won't tolerate harassment!

					OLIVER
			What about the package?

					ATTORNEY
			We know nothing about it.

	Silence.  Abolofia looks at Nick, then at Oliver.

					ABOLOFIA
			Hard to believe a trained police
			officer could let this kind of thing
			happen right in front of his face.

					NICK
			I did make a mistake.  I let the
			wrong guy get hit.

	Abolofia doesn't blink an eye, goes for the jugular.

					ABOLOFIA
			Cheer up, Nick.  I'm sure it's
			easier to pick a dead man's pocket.

	Nick springs from his feet.  Oliver grabs Nick before he
	can get close to Abolofia.

					ATTORNEY
			That's it, we're through!

								 CUT TO:

	KOBO

	the Japanese killer who smashed in Nick's face last night.
	He's sitting in an interrogation room an hour later with a
	DETECTIVE and a JAPANESE TRANSLATOR.  He won't talk.

	OBSERVATION ROOM

	Nick and Oliver watching through the glass.

					OLIVER
			Doesn't speak a word of English.
			And he won't speak Japanese either.
			No papers.  The Japanese embassy is
			very interested.

					NICK
			Why?

					OLIVER
			He's wanted in Japan.  They want him
			first.  Then we can have him.

					NICK
			What?

	Oliver nods.  That's the way it is.

	ON KOBO

	he turns and looks at Nick.  He can't possibly see him
	through the one way glass but he knows Nick's there.

	ON NICK

	looking at him.

	ON KOBO

	making a cutting mark across his forehead, right where
	Nick's bandage is.  It's uncanny.

								 CUT TO:

	INT.  OLIVER'S OFFICE - LATER

	Nick is sitting in front of Oliver's desk.  The sunlight
	makes him wince; wincing makes his face hurt.

					OLIVER
			Japanese embassy talks to state
			department.  State talks to police
			plaza.  They to me and me to you.
			Shit rolls down hill.

	Oliver drops a file folder on the desk.  Nick opens it:
	petty cash, vouchers and plane tickets.

					OLIVER
			You and Charlie are taking the Jap
			home, tonight.

					NICK
			What...?  What if I say no?

					OLIVER
			Check your gun before you leave.
			They're not allowed in Japan.  It's
			a nice, safe country.

					NICK
			Why me?

					OLIVER
			They said send a detective if I
			could spare one.
				(then)
			I can always spare you.

	Nick bridles at the insult.  Oliver's had a hard-on for
	Nick for years, and Nick's tired of it.

					NICK
				(soft)
			You got something to say to me,
			Captain?

	Oliver doesn't want to get into it.

					OLIVER
			Yeah.  Have a wonderful flight.

								 CUT TO:

	THE ORANGE SUN

	on the tail of a Japan Airlines 747.  A driving rain
	storm.  The plane taxies down the runway and disappears
	into the black rain.


	INT.  AIRLINER

	Kobo, handcuffed and shackled, is in the center seat.
	Nick and Charlie sit on either side.  Charlie is holding
	"Bachelors Japan" in one hand.  Nick's in a sour mood.

					CHARLIE
			... Nick, you're the one that's
			always saying you never go anywhere.

					NICK
			I was thinking the Poconos, Charlie.
			Maybe Vegas.

					CHARLIE
			What are you missing?  Riding your
			motorcycle to the nurse's house.
			That shit is sadder than Ethiopia.

					NICK
			Beats forty hours on a plane.

					CHARLIE
			They say we got to turn around and
			come right back.  That's what they
			say.  I got a plan.

	The last thing Nick wants to hear -- too late.

					CHARLIE
			I call, right?  I say I got the
			dreaded thirty six-hour Asian shits
			from some raw clam and we stretch it
			into three days.  You and I become a
			driving force on the local Geisha
			scene.

					NICK
			Not a prayer.

					CHARLIE
				(grinning)
			Hey, come on, big guy like you, cop
			from New York.  You're gonna be the
			biggest thing to hit town since
			Godzilla.

	Nick can't help but smile at this kid.  Charlie looks down
	at the guide book.

					CHARLIE
			Says here, it's very impolite to
			touch someone while you're talking
			to them...
				(nudges Kobo)
			Guess that means you can't talk and
			screw at the same time, huh, hotdog?
			What's the matter, no -- speaky-the-
			language?  Understand this:  You
			will never ever fuck with my partner
			again.

	Nothing from Kobo who is looking straight ahead.  He
	doesn't understand.

					NICK
			Shut-up, Charlie.

	A beat, then Charlie reads a Japanese phrase from the
	book.  A slight facial response from Kobo.  Charlie tries
	it again.  This time Kobo laughs openly.

					NICK
			What'd you say?

					CHARLIE
			Where is the subway station, please.

	Kobo keeps laughing; it's obviously not what Charlie said.

					NICK
			Get a new book.

								 CUT TO:

	INT.  AIRLINER - LATER

	The cabin is now darkened.  Kobo and Nick are asleep.  Not
	Charlie, he's still at his book, and listening to U2 on
	his Walkman.  Nick rolls over and opens his eyes to see
	Charlie watching him.  He shuts them hoping to avoid talk.
	Too late.

					CHARLIE
			Nick... You up?

					NICK
			No.

	Charlie removes his headphones.

					CHARLIE
			Nick, have I been a good partner?

					NICK
			Number five with a bullet.

	Nick shuts his eyes.

					CHARLIE
			I just want you to know... I mean
			anybody who says you ever took has
			got to deal with me.

					NICK
			Go to sleep, Charlie.

					CHARLIE
			You didn't take, did you...?  You
			hear things.

	Nick opens his eyes.

					NICK
			I worked the three nine in Queens,
			Charlie.

					CHARLIE
				(surprised)
			I didn't know.

					NICK
			The lieutenant was on the pad along
			with the rest of the squad.  I was
			new, didn't know shit.  When the
			feathers flew, I got called in front
			of the special prosecutor.  It's on
			the top of my personnel file.  They
			think I'm dirty or I cut a deal.
			Doesn't leave you with a lot of
			friends either way.

	Nick shuts his eyes.

					NICK
			I might as well have done something.
			I've been paying for it every
			goddamn day since I got
			transferred...

	HOLD on Nick then...

								 CUT TO:

	INT.  NARITA AIRPORT - JAPAN - DAY

	Nick and Charlie, with Kobo between them, are a strange
	sight in a sea of Japanese faces.  Kobo's hands are cuffed
	behind his back.  Nick also has Kobo cuffed to his wrist.
	The cops are rumpled, exhausted, showing two days of
	stubble.  Kobo looks sharp and wide awake.

	A pair of attractive teenage girls walks past them.

					CHARLIE
			Whoa.  Nick, we're in paradise.

	A PAIR

	of white gloved hands belonging to a Tokyo police officer
	holds up a small, hand letter sign that says:
	CONKLIN/SKLOARIS.  The man holding the sign is NAGASHIMA.
	Two other police officers in spotless tan uniforms stand
	at his side.

	Nick, holding Kobo by his arm, steps up to the police and
	show his I.D.  Nagashima bows.

					NAGASHIMA
			Officers Conklin and -- and...
				(he can't say
				 Charlie's name)
			... gentlemen, welcome.  I am
			assistant inspector Nagashima.

	They show their I.D.

					NICK
			You going to take this crap off our
			hands?

					NAGASHIMA
				(confused)
			Crap...?  Oh, the prisoner.  Yes.

	He barks some orders to the officers who immediately take
	Kobo by the arms and put cuffs on him.  Nick unfastens
	his cuff when they're through.

	In contrast to Nagashima's gentility, the cops are rough
	with the prisoner.

					CHARLIE
				(extends his hand)
			Charlie.  Kon-ich-iwa.

	Nagashima shakes his hand.  Bows.  Charlie bows back.
	Nick wouldn't bow if his life depended on it.  Nagashima
	hands Nick an official looking document.

					NAGASHIMA
			If you will please give this to the
			customs inspector he will expidate
			-- expedite you.  We have a car and
			a driver outside.

					NICK
			Right.

					CHARLIE
				(bows)
			Arigato.

	Nick grabs Charlie by the arm and starts for the customs
	line.

			Givin' you a book is like givin' a

			Hey, when in Rome --

					NICK
			In Rome, I'll bow.

								 CUT TO:

	INT.  CUSTOMS BOOTH - DAY

	NICK and CHARLIE make their way through the crowd toward
	the head of a long line.  They dump their bags on the
	counter.  The INSPECTOR, furious that they have taken cuts
	in line, barks at them in Japanese.

					NICK
			Inspector Nagashima told me to give
			you this.

	He hands the Inspector the official looking document.  The
	Inspector scans the paper.  Hands it back to them.

					INSPECTOR
				(broken English)
			You must get in line behind the
			rest.

					NICK
			We're cops.  Pol-ice-men.

	The Inspector signals a nearby POLICEMAN.  The Inspector
	says something in Japanese.  Hands the policeman the
	document.  The policeman shakes his head, amused, points
	to the end of the line.

					NICK
			Fellas, get serious.

	From off screen someone CALLS OUT:

					MAN (O.S.)
			Nick!

	Nick and Charlie turn to see KOBO, their prisoner,
	standing on the other side of the thick plastic divider.
	The handcuffs are off.  The three alleged 'policemen' are
	heading out the door behind him.  It was a set-up:  Nick
	and Charlie have been had.

					KOBO
				(perfect English)
			Thanks for the ride, detective.

	He slowly backs away from the glass as if he had all the
	time in the world, finally disappearing in the crowd.

								 CUT TO:

	NICK AND CHARLIE

	trying to shove past the customs inspectors who are
	wrestling them aside.

					NICK
			Cops!  He's our prisoner!

	Two more policemen arrive.  Nick and Charlie are thrown up

			What's going on?  We're the good

								 CUT TO:

	INT.  TOKYO POLICE HEADQUARTERS - DAY

	Fifty identical desks.  Fifty identical phones.  Fifty
	identically dressed men in white shirts and ties working
	under the fluorescent lights of this large open room.

	We GLIDE PAST the rows of desk to find INSPECTOR OHASHI,
	mid forties, sitting behind a perfectly arranged desk.
	Ohashi prides himself on order.

	Nick and Charlie are standing in front of him.

					NICK
			Get me something like an Identi-Kit
			and I'll give you a description.

	Ohashi remains poker faced.  He continues to arrange
	papers and apply his hanko (personal seal) to the bottom
	of a stack of official papers.

					CHARLIE
			There must be some witnesses from
			the airport?

	Still nothing from the good inspector.

					NICK
			What is it, tea time?

	Still nothing from Ohashi.  Finally:

					OHASHI
				(quiet rage)
			You lost a man we wanted for some
			time.  It was very incompetent on
			your part, officer.

					NICK
			Incompetent is letting people waltz
			through a secure area wearing your
			uniforms, carrying official
			documents.

	Ohashi bows slightly, we're not sure why.

					NICK
			I want a gun.

					OHASHI
			It is not allowed.

					NICK
			We're police officers.

					OHASHI
			You're foreigners.

					NICK
			Work with me.  I want your best
			detective.

	Pause.  Ohashi returns to his papers.  Nick can't believe
	it.

					NICK
			Hey, inspector, I don't intend to
			take the rap for this.

					OHASHI
				(not looking up)
			Do you know what this is?

	Ohashi holds up the document that was handed to Nick at
	the airport.

					OHASHI
			It's a laundry list.  Go home,
			detective.

	Nick studies him for a beat, then turns away.  To Charlie:

					NICK
			Let's go.

					CHARLIE
			Nick, we can't just --

					NICK
			I said let's go, Charlie.

	Reluctantly they head towards the door, passing long rows
	of bureaucrats, telephones ringing off the hook.  Nick
	stops at the door, spots a fuse box nearby.  He glances
	back to make sure no one is looking.

	Nick pulls out his handcuffs.  Charlie can't figure out
	what the hell he's doing.  Nick attaches one cuff to the
	main lever then yanks it down.

	The lights go out.  The fan's stop; so do the typewriters;
	so does the air conditioning.  Dead silence.

	Nick attaches the other cuff to a pipe, snaps it shut.
	Now it's impossible to left the main lever.

	From the far end of the room:

					OHASHI
			What are you doing?!

	Nick drops the key down the water fountain drain.

					NICK
			Your best detective, Ohashi.

								 CUT TO:

	EXT.  POLICE STATION - DAY

	Nick and Charlie cross the street.  Charlie's trying to
	read the name from the piece of paper Ohashi has given
	them.

					CHARLIE
			... Detective Ich-iro Matsu-moto.
			Hey, we're getting Mr. Moto on our
			side.

					NICK
			Let's grab some food.

					CHARLIE
			First decent idea you've had.

	Charlie pulls out his 'Footloose in Tokyo" book, flips
	through the pages.

					CHARLIE
			Food... Food, here we go.  Tokyo
			offers a wide variety of food.  It's
			best to sample the local
			specialties, including sashaimi,
			soba, and world renown Kobe beef...

	Nick goes into a restaurant.  Charlie drops the book,
	disgusted with Nick's choice.  Charlie reluctantly follows
	him in.  REVEAL it's a Shakey's Pizza restaurant.

								 CUT TO:

	EXT.  HOUSING PROJECT - SHIN OKUBO - DAY

	Rows of post-modern buildings of odd shaped windows and
	brightly painted concrete walls.  Nick and Charlie are
	searching for the Japanese cop's building.  They can't
	speak the language; they can't read the signs; and half
	the buildings don't have numbers.  It's a nightmare.

					CHARLIE
			This should be it...

					NICK
			You said that in the last two
			places.

	Charlie holds out the paper to a passing man.

					CHARLIE
			Kore?  Doku?  Kore doku?

	The man gestures toward the building Charlie was pointing
	to.

					NICK
			Okay, you were right.

	Charlie grins, satisfied.


	INT.  HOUSING DEVELOPMENT - CORRIDOR - DAY

	The boys are knocking on a door.  Nick turns the handle.
	It's unlocked.

	THE APARTMENT

	A four tatami room.  An unholy mess:  Food packages, beer
	bottles, stacks of papers and file folders.  Framed
	pictures of long dead relatives hang on the wall.

					CHARLIE
			This the right place?

					NICK
			I hope not.

	A WOMAN now appears at the door.  Middle aged, wizened
	face, in a full traditional Kimono.

					CHARLIE
			Konichiwa.  Ichiro Matsumoto?

	The woman babbles bird-like in rapid Japanese.  She bows.
	They're in the right place.

								 CUT TO:

	EXT.  SIDE STREET - MINIMAI MURAMATSU - NIGHT

	The jammed streets are barely wide enough to get a
	motorcycle down.  It's a bad neighborhood, one of the
	poorest in Tokyo.

	We spot the small kimono clad WOMAN, clip-clopping on
	wooden geta, leading Nick and Charlie through this
	labyrinth.

					CHARLIE
				(looking around)
			Getting very weird.

					NICK
			I'd feel better if we had some heat.

					CHARLIE
			Maybe we should bail?

	Seeing they've stopped, the woman gestures for them to
	hurry up, then disappears around the corner.

					NICK
				(looking at the maze
				 of streets)
			Think we could find our way back?

								 CUT TO:

	A GARISH PINK SIGN - PINK SARON BAR

	A poor man's idea of a bar.  The woman points inside,
	chirps away in Japanese, bows, then hurries off leaving
	Nick and Charlie on their own.

	INSIDE PINK SARON

	Nick and Charlie disappear into darkness as the woven
	flaps shut behind them.  A vintage wurlitzer juke box
	glows across the room.  An Enka plays.  (Haunting Japanese
	blues.)

					MAN'S VOICE (FROM THE DARKNESS)
			Big shots from New York.  I like
			your style!

	ICHIRO MATSUMOTO steps into a pool of light just inches
	from them.  He is a short overweight man looking every
	minute of his fifty-five years.  His white short sleeve
	shirt is too tight; his narrow tie spotted in the middle;
	his collar soaked in sweat.  He's not drunk yet, but he's
	been at it a while.  Call him Ich.

					ICH
				(bowing)
			Detective Ichiro Matsumoto.  I'm the
			man you're looking for.

	This is Ohashi's best man?  Well, at least he speaks
	English.

					ICH
			The man you are looking for, Kobo,
			was a member of the Samaguchi-gummi.
			A Yakuza.

	Ich nods, offers them what's left of his Sapphoro beer.
	They shake their heads.  Ich finishes it.

					NICK
			Where do we start looking for this
			guy?

					ICH
			Where would you look for the mafia?

					CHARLIE
			The back room at Lombardi's after
			the Columbus Day Parade.  Under the
			bed.  In the mayor's office.
			Everywhere.

	Ich heads for the door without saying a word.

					NICK
			Where're you going, Ichiro?

					ICH
				(stops, faces them)
			The mayor's office, under the bed,
			the back room at Lombardi's.
				(tucking in his
				 shirt tail)
			And call me Ich.

								 CUT TO:

	INT.  ICHIBANKAN BAR BUILDING - KABUKI CHO - NIGHT

	Imagine an ultra modern indoor shopping mall, except there
	aren't any stores.  The only product sold here is
	pleasure:  Bars, hostess clubs, Turkish baths.  A post-
	modern red light district with music piped in and
	automated doormen.


	INT.  LAS VEGAS WELCOME CLUB

	Hip, younger Japanese are wedged together at the long
	chrome bar.  The GUYS sport leather jackets and Raybans.
	The GIRLS are decked out in fifties American party dresses
	and short cropped hair.  Jerry Lee Lewis wails in the
	background.

	Nick, Ich and Charlie are at one end of the long bar.  Ich
	is drinking them both under the table.

					ICH
				(singing)
			"Goodness, gracious, great balls of
			fire."
				(raising glass for
				 toast)
			To the killer.  Jerry Lee Lewis.

					NICK
				(checking his watch)
			Jerry Lee Lewis, Elvis, Dinky Doo
			And The Don't's.  Let's book,
			Charlie.  If he starts on Motown,
			we'll be here all night.

					ICH
			No, this is the place for the young
			Yakuza.

					NICK
			That's what you said in the last
			three piss pots.

	Ich sets down his drink, pours more sake for Nick and
	Charlie then for himself.  He's having a great time.

					ICH
			I love you people.  The music, the
			clothes, the movies... Japanese
			respect only what is Japanese.

	Nick glances at Charlie.

					NICK
			It's incredible.  Hit him or
			something.

					CHARLIE
			I don't think he'd feel it.

					ICH
				(beginning to slur
				 his words)
			Americans change everything.  When I
			was young the city was wood and
			paper... I was ten when the bombers
			came.  I lived underground for three
			days.  When I came up, the city was
			gone... A ball of fire.

	Nick gets to his feet.  Ich grabs him by the arm, stopping
	him.

					ICH
			It began to rain, Nick.  You know
			what color the rain was?

	Ich doesn't give him a chance to answer.

					ICH
			Black... It was black from the ash.
			Very impressive.  You Americans, you
			could make black rain.

	Ich polishes off his drink.  An awkward silence.  Charlie,
	wanting to lighten the mood --

					CHARLIE
				(leaning close)
			Say Ich, between friends, where can
			I grab some squish around here?

	Nick sighs, digs in his pocket for some yen for the bill.

					ICH
			Squid?

					CHARLIE
			Pussy, ass, soft personnel.

	Ich looks up to see a picturesque, blood-haired American
	WOMEN in a tight silk blouse and skirt.  She works here
	and has obviously heard Charlie.

					ICH
			Ah, Joyce...
				(in Japanese)
			How are you tonight?

					JOYCE
				(in Japanese)
			Hello, Ich.  Johnny Walker?

	Ich nods.  Joyce's Japanese is impeccable.  She's a part-
	time bartender, translator, model.  One of Japan's western
	wanderers.  She's sliding past thirty, but only her weary
	eyes give it away.  She is about to pour Ich another
	drink.

					NICK
			Don't give him any more.

					JOYCE
			He gets as much as he wants.

	Charlie extends his hand to Joyce.  She ignores it.

					CHARLIE
			Hello hello, Charlie Skloaris.  New
			York City.

	She refills Ich's glass.

					CHARLIE
			My partner and I are cops.
				(lowering his voice)
			We're on a very big assignment here.
				(nothing from Joyce)
			When do you get off?

					JOYCE
			Right when you're being tucked into
			bed.

	Cold.

					ICH
			You should be nicer to my American
			friends, Joyce.

					JOYCE
			They wouldn't appreciate it, Ich.
			Trust me.

	She says something in Japanese to Ich as she eyes the
	cops.  Then, she walks off.

					ICH
			Joyce can be nice.

					CHARLIE
				(brightening)
			What'd she say?

					ICH
				(big smile)
			That I should let you pay for the
			drinks.
				(raising his glass)
			Kampai.

								 CUT TO:

	EXT.  ICHIBANKAN BAR BUILDING - NIGHT

	Charlie and Nick are trying to help a besotted Ich find a
	taxi, but no one will take him.  Ich is shouting half
	English, half Japanese phrases.

					ICH
			... We got to keep looking.  Track
			him down!  Great balls of fire!

					NICK
				(frustrated, to a
				 cabbie)
			What's the problem here?

	The cabbie ignores them.

					WOMAN (O.S.)
			You don't speak the language.  I'll
			drop him off.

	They turn to see Joyce standing behind them.

					ICH
			Ah, Joyce...

	The rest is slurred Japanese.  Joyce speaks to a cabbie in
	Japanese.  The rear door swings open.  She helps Ich in.
	Joyce climbs in.

					ICH
				(out the window)
			See you tomorrow!

	The taxi pulls away.  Nick and Charlie watch it go.

					NICK
			Not a prayer.

								 CUT TO:

	EXT.  STREET - FOUR A.M.

	An early morning wind jostles the red paper lantern and
	plucks at the tails of dragon-like banners hanging outside
	the shops.  Nick and Charlie are walking down this narrow
	sidestreet on the way back to their hotel.

					CHARLIE
			... He's a sorry old guy, but I like
			him.

					NICK
			He couldn't find his ass with both
			hands.

	A brand new Kawasaki 1000 motorcycle with windshield and
	full farings gleams under a street light.

					CHARLIE
			Now that's the kind of motorcycle I
			want to see you on.

					NICK
				(muttering)
			Sure, a rice burning crotch
			rocket...

					CHARLIE
			Nick, how we gonna bag this guy
			without any help?  Maybe I should
			work on that girl Joyce, she speaks
			the language.

	Nick glances over at his partner, smiles.  But before he
	can respond --

	The DULL ROAR of a half dozen motorcycles in the distance
	breaks the pre-dawn stillness.

	TWENTY BOSOZOKU (BIKERS)

	on their multi-cylinder high tech street bombers, creep
	around the corner and slowly ride toward Nick and Charlie.

	We get a better look at them:  turbo punk Elvis-samurai
	hybrids -- some wearing a slipper under their headbands,
	courtesy of their girlfriends; some in leopard skin pants.
	And tattoos...

	They head straight for Nick and Charlie, then, at the last
	moment, split and float away IN SLOW MOTION, as if the
	cops didn't exist.

	Suddenly, the street is empty again.  Silent except for
	the SOUND of the wind beating against paper lanterns,
	rustling the wind chimes...

	Hold on Nick and Charlie standing in the middle of the
	street, realizing just how far away from home they are.

								 DISSOLVE TO:

	EXT.  HOTEL - THE NEXT MORNING

	A rocket shaped building:  a mixture of Dutch Gable and
	Japanese Minka roof.  The mid-day sun beats down on a
	particular room.


	INT.  HOTEL ROOM

	Nick and Charlie are sacked out.  They never bothered to
	pull the curtains.  THE SOUND OF KNOCKING at the door.

					ICH (O.S.)
			Nick!

					NICK
			Give us a break...

					ICH (O.S.)
			It's Ichiro.  Ich.

					NICK
			Leave the rice cake outside and go
			home!

	But Ich persists.

	AT THE DOOR

	As Nick opens up.  Ich bows.  He's now clean shaven and
	has put on a clean shirt.

					ICH
			There's been a murder.  Yakuza.  You
			should come.

								 CUT TO:

	INT.  PRINTING PLANT - DAY

	The murder scene.  NO SOUND.

	A SERIES OF SHOTS:

	A BODY FROM THE WAIST DOWN in the claws of six foot
	working robotic.  The tattooed covered legs swing back and
	forth like a pendulum.

	THE TORSO is wedged in between two enormous printing
	rollers.

	THE HEAD is resting in the middle of a conveyer belt.
	It's been drenched in black printer's ink which has begun
	to congeal.

	WE SLOWLY TRACK PAST Ich, Charlie, and Nick, watching.
	Charlie has the dry heaves.

	REAL SOUND as we reveal the full crime scene.  Instead of
	the usual cigar smoke, camera flashes and radio chatter,
	there is order and quiet.  A slow underwater dance.

	INSPECTOR OHASHI

	quietly gives an order.  Someone turns off the robotic.
	The severed legs stop swinging.

	Nick, Charlie and Ich walk over to Ohashi.  Ich bows
	deeply.  Ohashi doesn't acknowledge any of them, talks to
	a man holding a tape measurer.

					NICK
			Could you fill me in?

					OHASHI
			Why don't you ask your chief
			detective?

	Ich looks down at the floor.

					NICK
			Because I want you to tell me.

					OHASHI
			The young are eating the old,
			something that usually doesn't
			happen here.

					NICK
			Can we skip the poetry, inspector?

	Ohashi pauses.  Ich looks at Nick as if to warn him he
	can't speak to Ohashi that way.

					OHASHI
			There's a war, detective, between
			two rival groups.  The man who
			escaped, Kobo, leads the younger
			group.  They did this.

					ICH
			Kobo's a wild boy.  He was a
			lieutenant in the Sammaguchi-gummi.

					OHASHI
				(in Japanese)
			Excellent, Officer Matsumoto.  How
			is your investigation going?

					ICH
				(in Japanese)
			Well, sir.  Thank you for giving me
			the opportunity to work with these
			distinguished gentlemen.

	He bows.  It's pathetic.

					POLICE LIEUTENANT
			Looking for clues in the bottom of a
			sake bottle, Matsumoto?

	Laughter all around.

					OHASHI
			He's an officer of great
			distinction.

	Another sarcastic dig.  Ich stoically stands and takes it.

					CHARLIE
			Hey, Ich has been helpful.

					OHASHI
				(ignoring him, to
				 Nick)
			Have you changed your mind and
			decided to go home, detective?

					NICK
			Not until one of us bags Kobo.
				(looking at the
				 corpse)
			And it doesn't look like you're
			doing so hot.

	Ohashi coolly flicks the ashes of his cigarette and we --

								 CUT TO:

	EXT.  PRINTING PLANT - DAY

	Ich, Nick, and Charlie are threading their way through the
	crowd toward the subway entrance.

	TWO BIKERS, their hair slicked back, watch the trio from
	the top of two different subway entrances.

	As soon as Ich, Nick and Charlie go down the steps, they
	climb off their bikes and follow.


	INT.  SUBWAY STATION

	Nick, Ich and Charlie are riding the people mover that
	stretches the length of this endless tunnel.  They're
	sandwiched between the legions of SALARYMEN (white collar
	workers) who all wear identical blue suits and white
	shirts.

	Nick looks over at Ich, who is still suffering in silence
	from the recent humiliation.

					NICK
			You know, Inspector, you take shit
			once, you take shit forever.

					ICH
				(beat)
			I don't deserve Ohashi's respect.

					NICK
			Why the hell not?

					ICH
			I don't, that's all.

	Ich looks away, obviously uncomfortable.

					CHARLIE
			You cool, Ich?

					ICH
			Cool?

					CHARLIE
			You all right?  You okay?

	Ich nods.

					CHARLIE
			What does Ichiro mean, anyway?

					ICH
				(smiling)
			What does Charlie mean?

					CHARLIE
			Hey, all right.

	Charlie slaps Ich on the back.

	NICK smiles at Charlie's remark.  He can't help but like
	this wide-eyed goofy kid.

	Something makes Nick's smile fade.

	NICK'S POV

	KOBO, their escaped prisoner, hurrying in the opposite
	direction.  His Kamali suit looks like it just came from
	the cleaners.

					NICK
			Charlie!

	Charlie spots him.  In a flash, the two men jump the
	railing and charge after him, leaving Ich in their wake.

	Ich can't possibly make it over the side.  He furiously
	shoves his way through the Salarymen, trying to get to the
	end of the walkway.

	CHASE SEQUENCE

	-- Nick barreling through the mass of faceless Salarymen.

	-- Kobo, hurrying ahead, occasionally glancing back.

	-- Charlie catching up to Nick.  They've lost him.  They
	   spin around.  A half dozen tunnels spin out in all
	   directions.

	-- Nick and Charlie spotting Kobo.  He's waiting for them
	   near the turnstile.

	Nick suddenly realizes it's a set-up.  Before he can say
	anything, Charlie sprints ahead, recklessly shoving
	people out of the way.

					NICK
				(calling after him)
			It's a set-up...!  Charlie!

	Charlie hasn't heard him.

	AT THE TURNSTILE

	Kobo hands a ticket to the turnstile guard and disappears
	onto the platform.  Charlie doesn't have a ticket.  The
	guard points to the automatic ticket machine.  Screw it.
	Charlie leaps over the turnstile.

	The GUARD blows his shrill whistle to signal the subway
	police.

	THE PLATFORM

	Charlie pushes through the crowd -- a wall of blank faces.
	Kobo is gone.

	NICK

	shoving through the crowd.  He spots Charlie.  Shouts at
	him to wait.  Charlie can't hear his partner.

	THE SUBWAY

	pulls in.  An immaculately uniformed CONDUCTOR blows his
	whistle and waves his white-gloved hands to keep the crowd
	back.

	A LEATHER JACKETED BOY shoves Charlie from behind; he
	stumbles forward toward the track.  Someone catches him at
	the last moment.  Charlie turns around to see it's Kobo.

	Kobo smiles, it's all a big joke.

	What follows happens in a flash:

	ON NICK

					NICK
			Charlie!

	Nick is close enough to see, too far to do anything.  He's
	blocked by TWO MORE LEATHER BOYS.  He tries to shove past,
	but they grab him.

	KOBO

	holding Charlie by his coat lapels.  An express train
	tears into the station.  Kobo casually glances at

	NICK

	trying to struggle free.

	KOBO

	his eyes still on Nick, drops Charlie in front of the
	speeding express as if he were a sack of laundry.

	NICK

					NICK
			NO!!

	A woman SCREAMS.

	The train barrels through the station.

	Kobo starts toward Nick.  He's next.

	A pair of SUBWAY POLICEMEN burst through the crowd
	searching for Charlie because he vaulted the turnstile.

	NICK

	manages to break free of the leatherboys holding him.
	They flee into the crowd as the police close in.

	ACROSS THE PLATFORM - KOBO

	slips into the wave of commuters being shoved into a
	train by white-gloved MEN.  It's their job to shove
	commuters into the already packed cars.

	Nick goes for Kobo, but the crowd closes in front of him.
	He can't get through.

	THE SUBWAY DOORS

	slam shut.  The train pulls out leaving Nick standing on
	the empty platform.

	THE LAST CAR

	streaks past him.  Kobo stands in the rear window, getting
	smaller and smaller until the train disappears down the
	tracks.

					ICH
			Nick!

	Ich, out of breath, is standing on the platform.  Nick
	looks at him with disgust -- where the hell was he.

	STAY on Nick, his head bowed, being surrounded by the sea
	of blue-suited commuters.

								 FADE TO WHITE.

	FADE IN:

	NICK'S FACE against a white wall.  That's all we see.
	Ohashi's voice OFF SCREEN.

					OHASHI (O.S.)
			... You ignored me.  I don't care
			about what you want.  Get on a
			plane, detective Conklin.  Go home.

	We HEAR a door open and SLAM shut off screen.  Hold on
	Nick, frozen in place, then:

								 CUT TO:

	INT.  CENTRAL SECTION - TOKYO POLICE H.Q. - DAY

	Again, the fifty desks, fifty faceless men working.
	Typewriters CLACKING, phones RINGING.  We MOVE down the
	rows to find Nick sitting behind one of the desks.  He's
	on the phone to New York.

					OLIVER (V.O.) (PHONE)
			It's not your job.

					NICK
			He was my partner.

					OLIVER (V.O.) (PHONE)
			They're blaming it on you.  Christ,
			Conklin, you didn't even tell me you
			lost the prisoner!

					NICK
			I planned on catching him, Captain.

					OLIVER (V.O.) (PHONE)
			How?  You don't know the place.  You
			don't know the language.  Get on the
			plane.

					NICK
			He killed a police officer.

					OLIVER (V.O.) (PHONE)
			Your plane's at nine a.m.  Be on it.
			That's orders.  Period.

	Oliver hangs up.  A moment of long distance hum cross
	talk.  Nick doesn't move.  Pull back through the rows of
	cops busily working... SOUND FADES.

	Charlie Parker's alto sax FADE UP as we --

								 CUT TO:

	EXT.  SHINJUKU - NIGHT

	The MUSIC continues.  The sax screams as the melody is
	abandoned.

	Nick is drunk.  Roaring angry drunk.  He doesn't know
	where he is.  He doesn't care.  He plows down the street,
	occasionally grabbing a passerby, then letting them go.

	Nick begins to laugh.  A couple is staring at him, Nick
	yells at them, but we DON'T HEAR HIM.  He stumbles on...
	drop back to find.

	ICH

	following in his wake.  He bows and apologizes to the
	offended.

								 CUT TO:

	EXT.  LAS VEGAS WELCOME BAR - NIGHT

	Nick is thrown onto the street.  He tries to reenter and
	is thrown out again.  We spot JOYCE inside watching; she
	turns back to her customers.


	EXT.  GINZA - NIGHT

	Nick is hassling a news vendor who pointedly ignores him
	and continues selling his papers.  Ich appears and
	apologizes to the news vendor.


	EXT.  STREET - TWO A.M.

	Nick's sitting on the curb, his head in his hands.  People
	step around him.

	Across the street, out of Nick's sight, Ich is watching
	his partner, feeling every barb of Nick's shame.

	Charlie Parker continues over the slow...

								 DISSOLVE TO:

	NICK --

	asleep, the futon tangled around him.  He opens his eyes.
	A woman is making tea in the kitchenette.  This is the
	kimonoed woman who led Nick and Charlie to Ich the other
	night.

	A RADIO is on softly in the background.  The Charlie
	Parker tune we've been listening to over the previous cuts
	ends, and the announcer comes on:

					RADIO
			... That was the Bird, from the Blue
			Note years.  1230 hours and 72
			degrees in central Osaka.  This is
			specialist Doug Dale, Tapestries in
			Jazz, on the Far East Network, armed
			forces radio...

	Nick slowly sits up to see

	ICH

	seated at a low table looking at him from across the room.

	Nick spots his clothes and luggage stacked in the corner.
	Nick now realizes he's in Ich's apartment.  It's spotless.
	Everything is now in its proper place.

					NICK
			What happened?

					ICH
			They made you leave your hotel...
				(looks away)
			... you caused a disturbance.

	Nick's eyes fall on Charlie's things:  his sports clothes,
	his tour book, his shoes which Ich has stacked on the
	table.

					ICH
			It may be too soon to talk about it.
			When someone we care for dies we...
				(beat)
			... keep something of their's.  A
			tie, a pen.

					NICK
			Why weren't you at the platform?

					ICH
			I couldn't keep up.  My shame is
			complete.

	Nick slowly shuts his eyes, his head pounding.

								 CUT TO:

	INT.  PUBLIC BATH - DAY

	The neighborhood bathhouse.  Thick with steam and
	neighborhood kids.

	Nick walks toward the huge pool of water.  Ich is beside
	him.  Nick's about to climb in when Ich stops him, hands
	him a pail and a washcloth and points to the faucets along
	the wall where a dozen men squat on small stools as they
	wash themselves.

								 CUT TO:

	NICK

	as he pours a pail of water over his head, it runs down
	his face in slow motion.

								 CUT TO:

	THE POOL

	Nick soaking, on one side.  Ich is soaking nearby.

					ICH
			You must leave?

					NICK
			Yeah...

					ICH
			I'll get him for you, Nick.

	Nick looks at this thick bellied, alcoholic cop.  Not a
	very reassuring thought.

	TWO MEN carrying plastic pails cross in front of the tub.
	Young, muscular Yakuza, their bodies covered with
	exquisite tattoos.  They stare openly at Nick.  One makes
	a joke.  Both laugh obscenely as they slip into the hot
	tub.

					NICK
			Yakuza?

	Ich nods.  Nick eyes them for a long beat, then climbs out
	of the tub.

								 CUT TO:

	NICK

	Nick tossing two bags into a taxi in front of Ich's
	apartment building.

	ICH

	Ich watching Nick through the window from inside his
	apartment.  He glances back and sees Charlie's "Members
	Only" coat hanging on a hook.

	When he turns back, Nick's taxi has disappeared.


	EXT.  NARITA AIRPORT

	The brightest object in the frame is a yellow forklift
	carrying a jostling aluminum coffin toward the open belly
	of the cargo plane.  Nick watches it from the edge of the

	AIRPORT CHECK IN GATE

	Nick hands the clerk his ticket.

					NICK
			... Smoking.

					CLERK
			Aisle or window?

	Nick spots a folded newspaper someone has left on the

	picture of the subway platform where Charlie was killed,
	swarming with police.  Nick continues to stare at the

			Aisle or window, sir?

			I want to cash it in.  Yen.

	Nick steps in, drops the two suitcases.

					NICK
			Ichiro?

	The woman steps out of the kitchen, babbles something in
	Japanese.  Nick doesn't have a clue.

								 CUT TO:

	INT.  LAS VEGAS WELCOME BAR - AFTERNOON

	Only a handful of patrons.  Joyce is straightening bottles
	behind the bar.

					NICK (O.S.)
			What's tricks?

	She looks up, surprised to see Nick standing in front of
	her.

					JOYCE
			Ich said you left.

					NICK
			There was a change in plans.

	Beat.

					JOYCE
			I'm sorry about your friend.

	Nick's surprised at how fast she heard.

					JOYCE
			Dead gaiijin's are big news.

					NICK
			Gaiijin?

					JOYCE
			An outside person.  A foreigner.  A
			barbarian.  You, me.
				(beat)
			More you.

					NICK
			I could use some help.  Show me
			around.  I'll pay you for your time.

					JOYCE
			I don't give tours.

	Nick smiles.

					NICK
			You can count on the truth from
			people who don't like you.

					JOYCE
			You have a helluva way of asking for
			help.

					NICK
			You have a helluva way of answering.

	Draw.

					JOYCE
			Look, you need Ich.  I've been here
			five years and I still can't read
			all the street signs.

					NICK
			Maybe I'm a quicker learner.

					JOYCE
			I don't think so.

	From OFF SCREEN:

					ICH (O.S.)
			Nicklaus-san.

	Nick turns to see Ich, leaning against the door frame.
	He's already had a few drinks too many.  He's delighted to
	see Nick.

					ICH
			I've continued working on the case!

					NICK
			I can see that.

	Ich ambles into the room, slips down into a chair.  He
	spills the contents of the large manila envelope he's been
	carrying onto the table:  a wallet, a set of keys, playing
	cards, etc.

					ICH
				(signaling to Joyce)
			Joyce... A drink please.
				(to Nick)
			Kobo has disappeared.  My superiors
			don't trust me.

	Nick walks over to the table and looks at the items.

					ICH
			Kobo's.  Taken off him when he was
			arrested in New York.

	Nick sits down.  Joyce gives Ich his scotch.

					ICH
			I knew you'd come back.  You feel
			you have a debt you can never pay.
			But you will, even if it costs you
			your life.  Giri.  Honor.

	Nick picks up various items off the table.

					NICK
			How'd you get this?

					ICH
			I stole them.

	Ich drapes his arm over Nick's shoulder.

					ICH
			Partners, Nicklaus-san?

	Ich reaches for his drink.  Nick gets there first.  He
	holds it up as if he were proposing a toast, then
	purposefully spills his drink out.

					NICK
			Partners.

	Ich has just had his last drink on duty.

								 CUT TO:

	THE TABLE - LATER

	All the contents of the envelope are spread out on the
	table:  credit cards, matchbooks from New York City,
	choice clipping from Screw magazine, sugarless gum, cuff
	links...

	Nick's holding up a series of photos.

	CLOSE ON PHOTO

	of a naked women and Kobo screwing on a Tatami mat.
	Another photo.  Then another.  Each photo is more
	pornographic than the next.

	Joyce picks them up as Nick sets them down.

					JOYCE
			Busy man.

	Nick holds out several of the same girl in various poses.

					NICK
			Know her?

					ICH
				(shaking his head)
			We can ask someone I used to work
			with.  A criminal.  Someone I pay
			money to...

					NICK
			A snitch?

								 CUT TO:

	INT.  PACHINKO PARLOR - DAY

	The largest in Tokyo.  Endless rows of men sitting in
	front of the machines (horizontal pinball games) furiously
	punching the flippers.  The NOISE from the metal balls is
	deafening.

	A MAN

	in a Hawaiian shirt, his arms covered with tattoos, is
	starting a new game.

	Ich moves up to the vacant machine beside him, puts in his
	change.  Ich doesn't face the man as they speak in
	Japanese.  The man in the Hawaiian shirt walks off.

	ON NICK

	as the man in the Hawaiian shirt walks past him.  This is
	the snitch.  Nick glances back at Ich.  Ich nods --
	they're in business.

								 CUT TO:

	A CRAMPED ROOM - REAR OF PACHINKO PARLOR

	We HEAR the clattering of the machines outside.  The man
	in the Hawaiian shirt, mid-fifties and badly in need of a
	shower, is sitting on the floor studying the photos.  Ich
	and Nick tower above him.

	The man says something to Nick in Japanese, then continues
	to study the photos.

					NICK
			What's he saying?

					ICH
				(looking up)
			He says they're very nice.  He wants
			to know if you have anymore.

	Nick sighs.

					ICH
			I'll ask him again.

	Ich asks in Japanese.  The man shrugs.

					NICK
			My turn.

	He grabs the man by his shirt collar and shoves him
	against the wall.  The photos spill to the floor.

					NICK
			Who is she?

	He bangs the man's head back against the wall.  The man
	starts babbling in Japanese.

	Ich, horrified, tries to pull Nick off him.

					ICH
			Nick, stop.

	Nick bangs the snitches head against the wall again.  Ich
	gets Nick away.  The man is terrified.

					ICH
			This man must be treated with
			respect.

	Ich bows to the man, apologizes in Japanese.

					NICK
			Aw, for Christ's sake.

	They continue speaking in Japanese.  They bow to one
	another again.  Ich gives the man a glass of water, then
	motions for him to sit down.

	Nick, impatient, starts for the guy again.  Ich stops him.
	The snitch holds up one of the photos, and starts
	babbling.

					NICK
				(to Ich)
			Now we're making progress.

								 CUT TO:

	INT.  SEIBU DEPARTMENT STORE - DAY

	CLOSE ON A SALESGIRL behind the cosmetic counter.  She is
	wearing the store uniform:  blue and white dress and white
	gloves.  A doll.  We shouldn't recognize her at first.
	Then --

	INSERT A PHOTO

	one of Kobo's porno pics.  It's the same face.

	REVEAL NICK

	holding the photo, standing in the crowded store.  Ich is
	beside him.

					NICK
			That's Kobo's girl?  He's sure?

	Ich glances back at the man in the Hawaiian shirt standing
	by the door.  The man nods.

					ICH
			He's sure.

	They watch the girl help a customer choose an eyeliner.

					ICH
			Nick, no one's seen Kobo in three
			days.  He might not even be in
			Tokyo.

					NICK
			Only one way to find out... Get her
			up in the morning and put her to bed
			at night.

								 CUT TO:

	INT.  SOBA RESTAURANT - DAY

	NICK

	is struggling with his chopsticks and bowl of noodles.
	From O.S. A LOUD SLURPING SOUND.  The sound stops, then
	starts again.  Nick can't eat.  He sets his bowl down and
	looks over at

	ICH

	slurping his noodles.  It is considered polite to slurp
	soba noodles as loud as possible.

	Ich stops.  Looks at Nick, then resumes his slurping.

					NICK
			Think you could keep it to a dull
			roar?

	They're sitting by the window across from the Seibu
	department store watching the entrance.

					ICH
			It's good manners.

	Nick nods.  Picks up his bowl.  Again the LOUD slurping
	off screen.  Nick starts to eat the noodles.  He can't
	continue with Ich slurping.  He sets the bowl down.

	Ich grins, resumes slurping and we --

								 CUT TO:

	EXT.  DEPARTMENT STORE - SIX P.M.

	The SALESGIRLS are lined up at the door bowing and
	thanking the last customers for shopping in their store.
	Standard practice.

	The GIRL whom Nick and Ich have been watching comes out
	wearing her uniform and heads down the street.

	NICK AND ICH

	waiting in the restaurant, get up to follow.

								 CUT TO:

	THE GIRL

	stepping out of the laundry carrying her wash.  She walks
	past a doorway where...

	NICK is standing.

	ICH now walks past his partner picking up the tail.  No
	acknowledgement between them.


	EXT.  STREET CAR STATION

	There are dozens of street cars waiting to pull out.  The
	girl is on one of them.  Ich has lost her.  Nick and Ich
	hurry from car to car.

					ICH
			You said you could keep up with her!
			'No problem, Nick-san.'

					NICK
				(cutting Ich off)
			No.  Don't say anything.  Don't do
			anything, and for Christ's sake,
			don't apologize!

					ICH
			Nick...

	Nick hurries toward another car to check it out.

					NICK
			What'd I tell you?

					ICH
			There she is!

	They spot the girl sitting in the window of one of the
	street cars, about to turn onto the main street.

	The two cops race for the car.  Nick leaps on.  Ich is a
	few steps behind.  Nick sticks out his hand, pulls Ich up.
	They stand looking at one another, both breathing hard,
	both out of shape.

								 CUT TO:

	NIGHTCLUB DISTRICT - NIGHT

	Narrow streets with exploding neon ideograph signs as far
	as the eye can see.

	We spot our girl hurrying down the street.  Nick, a half
	block behind, is bumping into people, trying not to lose
	her.

	She crosses the street and Ich picks her up.  Nick drops
	off.

	ON A SIDE STREET

	around the corner the girl disappears into a three story
	apartment building above an electronics store.

								 DISSOLVE TO:

	EXT.  GIRL'S APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT

	We're watching our girl inside her apartment.  She flips
	off the TV and climbs into bed.

								 CUT TO:

	A STOREROOM - NIGHT

	We've been watching the girl from a window across the
	street.  It's a storeroom full of shipping crates, not
	much else.  Ich is sitting on the floor, legs crossed,
	back erect, watching Nick.  Nick glances over.  Ich
	continues to watch him.  Nick returns to the window.

					ICH
			You dislike me.

	Nick keeps looking out the window.

					NICK
			Did I say that?

					ICH
			You toler -- yes, tolerate me.   

					NICK
			Are we getting married?

	Pause.

					ICH
			I'm a joke.  They sent you to me to
			make a fool of you.

	Nick looks over at Ich.  Ich is looking away.  Nick looks
	out the window, then back at his partner.

					NICK
			You're doing fine, Ich.  Now drop
			it, okay?

					ICH
			Sure.

	The girl switches off her light across the street.

								 DISSOLVE TO:

	THE STOREROOM - MORNING

	Ich is sleeping on his back looking like a grounded whale.

	Nick, exhausted, is sitting by the window his head resting
	against the sill.

	NICK'S POV OF THE STREET

	as the girl, dressed in her store uniform, comes out of
	the apartment and heads for work.

	NICK

	nudges the sleeping Ich with his foot.  Ich opens his
	eyes.

					NICK
			Let's book.

	Ich is groggy, nonplused.

					NICK
			Let's go.

								 CUT TO:

	INT.  HALLWAY - GIRL'S APARTMENT BUILDING

	Ich, tucking in his shirt, comes down the hall to see --

	Nick, on his knees, examining the lock on the girl's
	apartment door.  He slides his NYPD card into the jam and
	lightly raps the knob plate.

					ICH
			You can't do this.

	Nick uses his sleeve to wipe prints off the knob and jam.

					NICK
			Call a cop.

	The door swings open.  Nick walks in.

								 CUT TO:

	INT.  GIRL'S APARTMENT

	A cheesebox with a few vintage pieces of American deco
	furniture.

	Ich, very uptight, stands at the door while Nick goes over
	the place.

	Nick opens the closet.  It's packed with expensive
	dresses, pants, sweaters...

					ICH
			Nick...

					NICK
				(facing him)
			If you're gonna give me a hard time,
			wait outside.

	Nick goes through her chest of drawers:  on the top, a lot
	of high quality lingerie.

	INSERT PHOTO:  The girl and Kobo posing in a vintage
	Corvette.

	Nick replaces the picture, and carefully rearranges the
	drawer so it appears untouched.  He pulls open another
	drawer.  Then another.  Under the jeans and Mickey Mouse
	T-shirts, he finds:

	A BANK STACK OF U.S. CURRENCY

	in hundreds.  The bottom of the drawer is lined with
	stacks.  Nick holds them up for Ich to see.

					NICK
			Not too shabby for a perfume pusher.

	Ich, shocked, tries to play it cool.

					ICH
			Too bad it's not in yen.

	Nick shoves the drawer shut.

								 CUT TO:

	THE GIRL - DUSK - TWO DAYS LATER

	The GIRL buys fruit from a stand as NICK watches from one
	end of the block; ICH, listening to his transistor radio,
	waits at the other.

	THE GIRL

	suddenly turns and finds herself facing

	NICK

	a few yards away.   Nick smiles, then walks into the
	store, hoping he hasn't been made.

								 DISSOLVE TO:

	EXT.  GIRL'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

	Rain pours down.


	INT.  STOREROOM - NIGHT

	Nick, leaning against the wall, watches the girl's
	apartment across the street.  The girl walks in, turns on
	her light, then disappears into the bathroom.

	Ich walks in, exhausted, soaked to the skin.  He tosses
	his cap in the corner.  Struck out again.

					ICH
			Work, lunch, groceries, laundry...
			Fabulous...

					NICK
				(looking back out
				 the window)
			Four goddamn days.  This is going
			nowhere...

	A KNOCK at the door.

					JOYCE (O.S.)
			It's me.

	Ich opens the door.  Joyce, dressed for work, is carrying
	two odons (box dinners).  Joyce and Ich exchange greetings
	in Japanese.

					JOYCE
			What's the latest?

	Nick shrugs.

					ICH
			We'll get him, Joyce.

	Joyce peeks out the window.  The girl is getting
	undressed.

					JOYCE
			She ever pull down her shades?

					NICK
				(right back at her)
			Sure, but then I just pull out the
			photos.

	Ich opens one of the box dinners and sets it on the ledge
	in front of Nick.

					ICH
				(enthusiastically)
			Chikuwa, Hampen, Kobu, Konnayaku,
			Ganmodoki --

					NICK
			Ichiro --

					ICH
				(realizing)
			Broiled fish paste cake, Kelp roll,
			soybean curd, devils tongue --

					NICK
			Smells like Bayonne at low tide.

	Joyce hands Ich a flask of hot sake in tinfoil.

					NICK
			Whoa whoa...

	Nick grabs the flask.  Dumps it out the window.

					JOYCE
			Don't be an ass.

					NICK
			He's on duty.

					JOYCE
			I paid for that.

	Nick tosses a few thousand yen on the table.  Then,
	spotting something out the window.

					NICK
			Alley oop!

	Nick grabs his coat and goes out the door.  Joyce slips
	Ich another flask of sake.

								 CUT TO:

	EXT.  STREET - GINZA DISTRICT - NIGHT

	It's our GIRL standing alone on the corner of the street
	but you wouldn't know it at first.  She's wearing tight
	leather pants, red leather jacket, earrings, bright red
	lipstick, and she's dumped the pony-tail, allowing her
	hair to fall to her waist.

	NICK AND ICH

	watching in a doorway down the block.  Nick's shivering,
	his hands thrust in his army surplus jacket.  Ich doesn't
	mind the cold.  He's had his sake.

	THREE BOSOZOKU

	riding their bikes come around the corner drive past her,
	then circle back.

	One of the RIDERS stops to talk to her, then drives off.
	She hurries off in the opposite direction.

					ICH
			Yakuza.

					NICK
			Good.  Very good...

								 CUT TO:

	A SUBWAY STATION

	The girl waits until the last minute, then after glancing
	back, steps in the car.  The train pulls out.  The cars
	race past until we see --

	Nick and Ich standing inside of the last car.  It
	disappears into the tunnel.

								 CUT TO:

	THE SHINZOA DISTRICT - NIGHT

	The girl, on the move, pushing through the crowd.  Drop
	back to find Ich twenty yards behind.  She crosses the
	street.  Nick, pretending to be looking in a store window,
	picks her up.

	AROUND THE CORNER

	Nick has lost her.  It's a cul de sac with a dozen
	buildings.  He's standing in the middle of the street.
	Ich catches up to him.

					NICK
			She disappeared... shit!

					ICH
			You were too far behind.

	Nick does a double-take.

					ICH
				(recalling Nick's
				 words)
			Don't say anything more.  Don't do
			anything.  And, for Christ's sake,
			don't apologize!

								 DISSOLVE TO:

	EXT.  STREET - SHINZOA DISTRICT - NIGHT - LATER

	NICK

	dropping another cigarette butt to the ground.  There's a
	small pile at his feet.  He's leaning against the wall
	watching one end of the block.  TRACK over to reveal Ich,
	his back to Nick's, watching the other end.

	Ich glances back at Nick.  Nick ignores him.  Ich turns
	back.

					ICH
			Nicklaus-san!

	Nick turns to see the GIRL walk out of a bath house.
	She's wearing her ponytail again, with a black dress.  She
	climbs into a taxi.

								 CUT TO:

	EXT.  PINK SARON HOSTESS CLUB - NIGHT

	The girl climbs out of the taxi and goes inside.

	Nick and Ich are watching from across the street.


	INT.  HOSTESS CLUB

	Packed with Salarymen from the nearby brewery and
	hostesses in silk dresses selling cheap champagne at
	expensive prices.

	NICK AND ICH

	Walk in.  Everything seems normal.

	The BOUNCER in a white tux, stops them.  This is not a
	place frequented by Gaiijin.

	Ich beseeches the Bouncer to let his good friend in,
	promising that his friend will spend lots of money.

	Nick, thinking he's in, takes a step forward.  The Bouncer
	shoves him back.

					NICK
			Hey, no hands, huh?

	He bats his hands away.  Ich grabs Nick by the shoulders,
	preventing a fight.

					ICH
			You can't come in.  They don't
			want --

					NICK
			Gaiijin.

					ICH
			I'll check it out.

	Nick, unsure, turns to go, but before he does:

					NICK
			If I smell one drop of Scotch on
			your breath, my friend --

					ICH
			You can trust me.

	Nick hesitates, he's not so sure, then shoves the door
	open.


	EXT.  HOSTESS CLUB

	Nick waiting under the pink neon sign.


	INT.  HOSTESS CLUB - LATER

	Ich is sitting at the crowded bar.  A HOSTESS has her arm
	around his neck.  He checks out the room, searching for
	the girl.  He notices two THUGS standing outside a sliding
	door.  Ich finishes his drink.

					ICH
				(in Japanese)
			Let me up.

					HOSTESS
				(shoving him down)
			Sit, sweetie.
				(to bartender)
			Another Seagrams!

	Ich relents.  Then, spotting something across the room:

	WHAT HE SEES:  A rice paper door slides open, momentarily
	revealing a DOZEN men with close cropped hair sitting on
	tatami mats, playing poker.  Some have their coats off,
	revealing arms covered with tattoos.  Yakuza.

	A hostess, serving drinks, steps but leaving the door
	partially open.

	The hostess slides the door open to the adjacent room, but
	Ich CANNOT see inside.  She slides it shut.

	Ich's hostess wants him to buy another drink, but Ich
	shakes his head, gets to his feet, and pretending to be
	drunk, stumbles toward the sliding doors.

	Ich bumps into a table; slaps a stranger on the shoulder;
	then starts singing along with Frank Sinatra on the
	stereo.  He's a little too loud, a little off key.

	The bodyguards eye Ich suspiciously.  He stumbles past
	them, then grabs the sliding door and yanks it open.

	INSIDE THE ROOM

	A low table.  Kobo is at one end.  An older,
	distinguished, sliver-haired man in his seventies whom we
	will come to know as SUGAI is at the other.  Ich can't
	believe his eyes:  Sugai is the head of the largest Yakuza
	syndicate in Japan.

	A half dozen LIEUTENANTS sit on either side of the table.
	Half are older, dressed in conservative suits; the other
	half are younger wearing $700 Issy Miyake jackets.

	SUGAI AND KOBO

	are having a heated discussion.  The GIRL Ich and Nick
	have been following walks over to Kobo and sits beside
	him.  This makes Sugai even more irate.  He's on his feet,
	red faced and screaming.

	FOUR GUARDS

	seeing Ich, pull out their Beretta's.  Two more grab him
	and fling him head first against the wall.

					ICH
				(drunken, in Japanese)
			I have to piss, gentlemen... I'm so
			sorry but I have to --

	The bodyguards hurry him towards the door.


	EXT.  HOSTESS CLUB

	Nick checks his watch, it's been an hour - where the hell
	is Ich?

	Ich comes stumbling up the steps, still affecting his
	drunken, pigeon-toed walk.  Nick, of course, thinks Ich
	has gotten drunk again.  Two of the bodyguards are
	watching from inside.

					NICK
			I don't believe it...
				(grabs him)
			Son-of-a-bitch --   

	Ich, knowing they're being watched, grabs Nick by the
	sleeve and drags him off still pretending to be drunk.

					ICH
				(under his breath)
			I'm not drunk...

					NICK
			We're through.  I mean it.  This is
			the end of the line, Matsumoto.

					ICH
			Nick --

					NICK
			Shut-up.

	No longer fearing he's being watched, Ich abruptly stops
	his affected walk, and sounding very sober --

					ICH
			You shut-up!
				(then)
			Kobo is inside.  He's with Sugai,
			the head of the Summaguchi-clan.

	ACROSS THE STREET

	Ich is dialing on the police call box as he fills Nick in
	on Sugai.

					ICH
			... A Godfather.  His man was killed
			at the printing plant.

					NICK
			I want to yank Kobo.

					ICH
			Not without a small army, Nicklaus-
			san.

	Ich quickly speaks on the police phone, then hangs up,
	pleased with himself.

					NICK
			Ich, my name is Nick.  Not Nicklaus,
			not Nicklaus-san, not Nick-san.
			Nick.

					ICH
			San is an honorable title.

	Ich realizes it's better to drop it.

								 CUT TO:

	THE HOSTESS CLUB - MINUTES LATER

	Drunken Salarymen spill out the door.

	ICH AND NICK

	are standing across the street waiting for the cops to
	arrive.

	Nick freezes.

	THE GIRL

	they've been following steps out and lights a cigarette.
	TIME SLOWS.  She looks up and spots the two men through
	the traffic.  Nick turns away, afraid he's been made.
	When he looks back, she's gone back inside.

					NICK
			Shit...

	Nick races across the street toward the club.  Horns
	BLARE.

					ICH
				(doesn't understand)
			Nick?!

	IN FRONT OF THE CLUB

	Nick reaches the curb just as the front doors to the club
	BURST OPEN.  He's too late.  Three bodyguards burst out,
	checking the street.  A red and white Debonnaire pulls up.

	Sugai, surrounded by a half-dozen additional bodyguards,
	comes out and slips into the car.  It tears off down the
	street.

	SIRENS AND POLICE CARS

	from either end of the street peel around the corner.
	It's a madhouse.  The remaining lieutenants and bodyguards
	fan out, trying to elude arrest.

	Nick hurries down the steps.

	INSIDE THE CLUB

	The patrons are still in place, but the two side rooms are
	empty.

	Nick spots KOBO going out the rear entrance.  He starts
	after him but is confronted by the bouncer who stopped him
	earlier.  Nick connects to the guy's jaw before his
	adversary can raise his hands.  The bouncer staggers back.
	Nick flies out the rear door.

								 CUT TO:

	EXT.  FRONT OF CLUB - NIGHT

	Several lieutenants and bodyguards toss their guns --
	possession is a felony in Japan -- as the police close in.


	INT.  HOSTESS CLUB - NIGHT

	Ich hurries in, but Nick's long gone.


	EXT.  REAR OF HOSTESS CLUB - NEARBY STREETS - NIGHT

	SILENCE.  The narrow streets are deserted.  Nick slowly
	makes his way down the street.  The SOUND of a GUNSHOT.
	Nick ducks for cover -- it's a car BACKFIRING.  He
	continues on.

	Nick's POV of a woman giving a man a blow-job in a narrow
	alley.  The man's face is hidden by the shadow.

	Nick continues on.

					JAPANESE MAN (FROM THE DARKNESS)
			People like Charlie are a dime a
			dozen.

	Nick turns back to see Kobo as he steps into the light.

	Kobo tosses a handful of change at Nick.

					KOBO
			Keep the change.

					NICK
			I'm taking you back.

	The girl takes off down the block.

					KOBO
			Here I am.

	From across the street, a dozen bodyguards appear from
	various doorways and alleys.

					KOBO
			Charlie was a rookie...

	Kobo traces his finger across the spot where he cut Nick
	in New York.

					KOBO
			... But you can take care of
			yourself.  You're 'the biggest thing
			to hit this town since Godzilla.'

	Nick glances at the guards, then back at Kobo.  He is
	unarmed.  To make a move would be suicide.  More POLICE
	SIRENS in the b.g. closing in.

					KOBO
			What's the matter.  I'm right in
			front of you, Nick.
				(takes a step closer)
			But I was right in front of you when
			you let Charlie die.

	Kobo takes a step forward.  His face is inches from
	Nick's.

					KOBO
			Walk away again.  Maybe you'll get
			used to it.

	Nick doesn't budge.

	A LONG BEAT, then... Nick turns and slowly walk off.
	After a dozen yards Nick looks back.

	The street is empty, except for a street sweeper pushing
	his wet broom down the block.

	A half dozen bodyguards are being frisked, then shoved
	into police cars.

	Ohashi is talking to the enraged nightclub owner.  Nick
	steps up to him.  Ich hurries over.

					ICH
			Nick!

					NICK
				(to Ohashi)
			A few minutes faster, we might've
			nailed him.

	Ohashi doesn't say a word, hands Nick a document.

					NICK
			What's this?

					OHASHI
			Your visa has expired.  Be on a
			plane in twenty-four hours or you
			will be deported.

					NICK
			While you were hanging out at the
			visa office, we found the son-of-a-
			bitch.

					OHASHI
			Look.

	Ohashi directs Nick's attention across the street where a
	SURVEILLANCE VAN is parked.  The rear doors are open
	revealing a van full of surveillance equipment and cops.

					OHASHI
			You ruined an on-going investigation
			that could have gotten us more than
			one runner.
				(to Ich, in Japanese)
			I want a full report in the morning,
			officer.

	Ich bows as Ohashi walks off.

					NICK
			Maybe if you'd work with us --

	Ohashi ignores him, continues walking toward his waiting
	car.

					NICK
				(shouting)
			Hey...!
				(Ohashi keeps
				 walking)
			HEY, I'M TALKING TO YOU, INSPECTOR!

					OHASHI
				(his back toward
				 Nick)
			Twenty-four hours, detective.

	Ohashi slips into his car.  Nick storms up to the car and
	slams his fist on the window.

					NICK
			Ohashi!

	Ohashi faces straight ahead, ignoring Nick.  Nick takes
	the extradition paper and spikes it on the car antenna.

	Ich grabs Nick by his arm, pulling him back from the car.
	The car pulls away.

					ICH
			Nick, stop!

	Nick whirls, and before he realizes what he's doing,
	punches Ich below his left eye.  Ich stumbles back over
	the curb and lands on his ass.

					NICK
			Damnit, Ichiro, I'm tired of people
			telling me what I can and can't do.
			No one ever solved anything sitting
			on their ass.

	Nick, beside himself with frustration, watches Ohashi's
	car disappear down the block.

	ON ICH

	looking up at

	NICK

	who walks off without looking back at his partner.

								 CUT TO:

	INT.  ICH'S BATHROOM - SEVERAL HOURS LATER

	Nick, standing beside the tub, dumps a pail of hot water
	over his head, rinsing himself off.  He grabs a towel and
	walks out of the room.


	INT.  ICH'S APARTMENT

	Ich, holding an ice pack to his face, is lying on a tatami
	mat against the wall looking up at the ceiling.  An open
	bottle of Seagrams beside him.

	Nick stretches out on another tatami on the opposite side
	of the room and looks up at the ceiling, too.

					NICK
			The ice help?

	Nothing from Ich.

					NICK
			Where does this Sugai live?

					ICH
				(cold)
			A resort city, Beppu.

					NICK
			I want to go talk to him.

					ICH
			What...?  Why?

					NICK
			Because he knows how to get to our
			man.

					ICH
			He'll never speak to a Gaiijin.

					NICK
			I'll be a nice Gaiijin.

	Nick gets up and goes to the closet.  He slides open the
	door.  All of his and Charlie's clothes have been neatly
	hung up.

	He shoves Charlie's jacket aside.  Something's wrong with
	the way it hangs.  He pulls the jacket out, runs his hand
	over the coat, feeling something heavy in the lining.

	Nick rips the lining open.  Charlie's .32 Beretta and a
	spare clip tumble out.

					NICK
			The little bastard.  God bless him.

	Ich takes a drink from his bottle.

					ICH
			It's very small.

					NICK
			Big enough.

					ICH
			It's illegal, Nick.

					NICK
			It's a new deal.
				(putting it in his
				 waist band)
			... coming with me tomorrow?

					ICH
			Sugai's not going to be impressed
			with your gun, Nick.
				(beat)
			No.  I won't put myself in danger
			for you anymore.

	Nick picks up the liquor cap which rolled across the
	floor.  He tosses it to Ich.  Ich reaches for it, but
	misses.

					NICK
			Sure, pal.  You've got better things
			to do.

	Nick walks out shutting the door behind him.  Stay on Ich
	watching the door, then --

								 CUT TO:

	EXT.  LAS VEGAS BAR - CLOSING TIME

	The last customers find their way to the street, some with
	a little encouragement from a BOUNCER.

	Joyce steps out.  Nick comes up to her.

					NICK
			You know where I can get a decent
			cup of coffee this time of night?
			I'm buying.

					JOYCE
			Somebody must be suffering
			somewhere, you're being so nice.

	Joyce takes off down the street.  Nick watches her for a
	beat.

					NICK
			I need your help, Joyce.

					JOYCE
			Where's Ich?

					NICK
			Unavailable.

								 CUT TO:

	INT.  KARAOKE BAR - NIGHT

	On the stage, a young professional looking man is singing
	along to "SUMMERTIME" blasting from the stereo.  The
	Japanese way of letting it all hang out.

	We find Joyce and Nick at a corner table having a drink.

					JOYCE
			I've heard of Sugai.  I've also
			heard of the emperor.  They're both
			national treasures.  One's a hood.

					NICK
			I need someone to translate for me.

					JOYCE
			My Japanese isn't that hot...
			Besides, you'll never get in.

					NICK
			It's my last shot.  I have to be on
			a plane home tomorrow night.

					JOYCE
			And I'm supposed to care?

					NICK
			You could fake it.

	Joyce finishes her drink, sets it down.

								 CUT TO:

	EXT.  STREET - NIGHT

	The neon flickers on the rain slicked pavement.  Nick and
	Joyce walk down the deserted street.  She's carrying an
	umbrella.

					JOYCE
			You're wrong to sell Ich short.

					NICK
			He drinks.

					JOYCE
			He's got a reason.

	Nick shrugs, everyone's got a reason.

					JOYCE
			His son hooked up with some bikers.
			Yakuza kids.  A cop shot him running
			from a robbery.

	Nick looks over for the first time.

					JOYCE
			A father doesn't out live that kind
			of thing here, much less a police
			officer...

	Pause.

					NICK
			Where's the wife?

					JOYCE
			You met her.

	Nick looks surprised.

					JOYCE
			The woman in the apartment.  She
			won't speak to him.  But she won't
			leave either.  Japan... Nice, huh?

	Before Nick can respond, something catches his eye:  What
	he sees --

	A MAN

	partially shadowed, standing in the alley.

	Nick grabs his gun.  The man steps out zipping up his
	trousers.  It's a drunken Salaryman.  Nick lowers his gun.
	The Salaryman staggers down the street singing to himself.

					JOYCE
			Not wound too tight...

								 CUT TO:

	EXT.  JOYCE'S APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT

	A three story modern building on a quiet street.  She's
	searching for her keys.

					JOYCE
			I'd invite you up but I know you'd
			hate the incense.
				(as if to explain)
			I chant.

					NICK
			What do you chant?

					JOYCE
			'Nam oyo ranged kyo.'  You think
			it's dumb of course.

					NICK
			Not if it works.
				(holding the door
				 open for her)
			I'll meet you at the train?

					JOYCE
			I don't remember saying yes.

					NICK
			I don't remember you saying no.

	Joyce smiles, heads inside.

								 CUT TO:

	INT.  ICH'S APARTMENT - DAWN

	Ich is sleeping.

	Nick slips into his leather motorcycle jacket.  He drops
	Charlie's gun into his pocket.  He glances down at Ich,
	seeing if he's awake.  He's not.  Nick walks out.

	Ich opens his eyes.  He's been awake the whole time.

								 CUT TO:

	THE YANAKA CEMETERY - DAY

	Ich, wearing a blue suit, is pouring water over a simple
	stone with a wooden dipper.  Next, he places incense in a
	holder and folds his hands in prayer.

	The photo on the stone is of a young man wearing a school
	uniform.  Ich's son.

								 DISSOLVE TO:

	A BULLET TRAIN - DAY

	It's bull's-eye nose cone scuds across the endless rice
	paddies west of Tokyo.  Women in straw hats stand in the
	knee deep water pruning the rice by hand.  Old Japan
	rubbing shoulders with the new.


	INT.  TRAIN - DAY

	CLOSE ON NICK looking out the window as the countryside
	shoots past at 140 mph.  From O.S. several children
	chanting:  "Harrow, Harrow."

	Nick looks over to see three uniformed school children
	thrusting their notebooks and pens at him.

	JOYCE

	is sitting across from Nick.

					JOYCE
			They want your autograph.

					NICK
			Who am I supposed to be?

					JOYCE
			This little guy thinks you're Robert
			Redford... the other one thinks
			you're Charles Bronson...

					NICK
			Tell them I'm not.

	She does, but the kids insist.

					JOYCE
			They'll never go away.

	Nick, reluctantly signs.  Joyce takes one of the kid's
	notebooks before passing it back.

					JOYCE
			Mick Jagger?

	Joyce smiles, surprised at his choice.  Then, she looks up
	shocked to see --

	ICH

	carrying a gift wrapped package under his arm.  He's
	wearing his hat, blue suit and tie.

	Ich sits ACROSS the aisle from Nick and Joyce.  He doesn't
	say a word.  Faces straight ahead.

	Nick looks at Joyce, then back at Ich.

					NICK
			I'm sorry, Ichiro.  I lost it last
			night.  I shouldn't have hit you.

	Still nothing from Ich.

					NICK
			What's in the box?

					ICH
				(still not facing
				 him)
			For Sugai.  Caviar, French cheese,
			ham... If you come to apologize for
			interrupting his meeting, Sugai may
			feel obligated to see you.

					NICK
			So I bring some cheese?

					JOYCE
			Gifts are expected here.

	Nick nods, looks back out the window.  He'll never
	understand this country.  He looks back to see --

	Joyce looking annoyed at him.  Nick gets the message.

					NICK
			Hey, Ich... Thanks.  I'm glad you're
			here.  I mean it.

	Ich still won't acknowledge Nick.


	EXT.  BULLET TRAIN

	The Bullet Train disappearing into the foothills.


	EXT.  BEPPU - DAWN

	Plumes of white steam spindle skyward from every street
	corner.  If you didn't know it was steam, you'd think the
	city was on fire.  Beppu is a resort famous for it's
	geothermal baths.


	EXT.  SUGAI'S HOUSE

	The only traditional house we'll see in our story.  It's
	surrounded by a pool of blood red steaming water from the
	hot springs.

	AT THE GATE

	CLOSE ON A 1000 yen bill as it is dropped on the ground.
	A pair of dice rolls over it.  A handful of GUARDS wearing
	suits and ties are playing craps.

	OUTSIDE THE GATE

	Ich is sitting on the ground leaning against the wall,
	sound asleep.  Nick is standing nearby.  He checks his
	watch.  Tired of waiting, he walks over to --

	JOYCE

	reading the Manichi Daily.

					NICK
				(impatiently)
			They took the gift an hour ago.

	The phone rings inside the gate.  A guard picks it up.

					JOYCE
				(certain it's bad
				 news)
			All's not lost.  There's a famous
			temple here.  We could chant.

	The guard hangs up, calls out to Joyce.  Joyce responds in
	Japanese.  The guard opens the gate.

					NICK
			We're in?

					JOYCE
			The cheese...


	INT.  A ROOM IN SUGAI'S HOUSE

	A vast, austere, traditional room with sliding rice paper
	doors and tatami mats on the floor.

	Ich and Joyce, drinking tea, are sitting with their feet
	beneath them in the traditional manor.

	Nick, smoking, is in a semi-sprawl; using his tea cup as
	an ashtray.

	A LIEUTENANT enters.  He says something and beckons.  They
	all rise.  He says something else.

					JOYCE
				(to Nick)
			Just you.


	INT.  ANOTHER ROOM - SUGAI'S HOUSE

	Nick enters, ducking his head in the low doorway.  the
	shoji slides shut behind him.

	The furnishings are minimal but elegant.  There's a
	butsudan, a tokonoma, and a low, long table in the middle
	of the room.  No chairs.  Nick sits on the floor.

	A door slides open at the far end of the room.  Sugai,
	wearing a kimono over western style suit, walks in.  Nick
	stands up to shake his hand.  Sugai ignores it, and sits
	in the traditional position:  feet tucked beneath him.

					SUGAI
			I'll spare you the ritual.

	He tosses him a palm sized bundle.  Nick catches it.
	Inside, are brand new greenbacks:  hundreds.

					NICK
			This supposed to impress me?

	He sets it down.

					SUGAI
			Pick it up.  Look at it.

	Nick hesitates, then picks it up again.  He runs his
	fingers over the face of the bill and snaps the paper.

					SUGAI
			Seven years work by the finest
			engraver.  Mass produced,
			sequentially numbered.  The best
			there has ever been, Mr. Conklin.

					NICK
			I'm impressed.  But let's use the
			short form.  I'm looking for --

					SUGAI
			-- Kobo... I know.  He killed two of
			my partners.  One in New York, one
			at the printing plant.

	Sugai fills a cup of tea for Nick and hands it to him.

					NICK
			I don't drink tea.

	Sugai hands it to him anyway.

					SUGAI
			I took Kobo from the street.  I gave
			him a home, a future... But my ways
			were too slow for him... I served
			seven years in prison for my boss
			when I was a young man.  Kobo
			wouldn't serve seven minutes for his
			Oyabun.
				(sipping his tea)
			He was supposed to take over this
			syndicate when I retired.

					NICK
			I want him.

					SUGAI
			He'll be dealt with.

	Sugai sets a plastic wrapped object on a table before
	Nick.  Nick recognizes it from the restaurant massacre in
	New York.

	CLOSE UP:  Nick's fingers tear at the plastic.  A block of
	black iridescent polymer.  The negative image of a $100.00
	bill.  A printing plate.

					SUGAI
			Our associates in New York were
			close to closing a deal with us.

					NICK
			The families who control the
			casinos?

					SUGAI
			Yes.  Unlike our syndicates, your
			criminals don't understand the words
			'honor' and 'duty'... We can't
			afford not to deal with them.

	Sugai takes the plate back.

					SUGAI
			Imagine if your families could pay
			their gambling and drug debts with
			perfect counterfeit bought for cents
			on the dollar.

					NICK
			The Feds would be onto you in a
			month.

					SUGAI
			Not with these bills.  And even if
			it only took them six months, do you
			know what our profit margin would
			be?

	Nick looks at a child playing near one of the hot pools in
	Sugai's garden.

					NICK
			Why tell me this?

					SUGAI
			The other plate is currently in New
			York, in the hands of Kobo's man.
			Find it for me.

					NICK
			You trust me?

					SUGAI
			I'll pay you.

	Nick laughs at Sugai's audaciousness.

					NICK
				(indicating the
				 counterfeit bills)
			With these?

					SUGAI
			Swiss bank deposit.  Gold bullion.
			Whatever you want.  You know the
			city and the police.

					NICK
			If I say no?

					SUGAI
			You're smarter than Kobo.  You know
			the price of deceit.  Think about
			it.

					NICK
			I don't have to.

	Sugai cools.  Without a word he gets to his feet and
	starts toward the door.

					NICK
			I have ten hours to grab my man.

	ON SUGAI

	still walking with his back to Nick.

					NICK (O.S.)
			You won't get hurt.

	Sugai turns to see Nick, across the room, pointing the
	Beretta at his head.

								 CUT TO:

	INT.  ROOM - SUGAI'S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

	The room where Ich and Joyce are waiting.  Sugai enters.
	Their surprise turns to shock when they see Nick behind
	him holding a gun to the old man's head.

					ICH
			No...

					NICK
			Let's go.  Him first.

					ICH
			Nick, you can't do this.

					NICK
			It's done.
				(to Joyce)
			You don't have to come.

	She hasn't moved a muscle.


	INT SUGAI'S HOUSE - ENTRANCE WAY

	Sugai watches calmly as Nick, Ich, and Joyce put their
	shoes on.  Nick keeps the gun on him.

								 CUT TO:

	EXT.  SUGAI'S COURTYARD

	Nick steps out of the house.  He now has one end of a wire
	coat hanger loosely wrapped around Sugai's neck, the other
	end around his wrist.  His gun is pressed just beneath
	Sugai's ear.  If nick gets shot, so does Sugai.

	A handful of guards stand in the courtyard, one is
	polishing Sugai's Debonnaire car.  They spot Nick and
	Sugai coming, and immediately pull their guns.

					NICK
			Explain to them.  They shoot me,
			they kill you.
				(Sugai hesitates)
			DO IT!

	Sugai explains to his lieutenants.  They stand helpless as
	Nick walks Sugai toward the car.

					NICK
			Grab the keys, Ich, and get inside.

					ICH
			No.

					NICK
			Not now, man, okay, not now.  Work
			with me.

	Ich takes the keys from the man polishing the car.  He
	gets inside.  Joyce hurries in bedside him.

					ICH
			You don't know what you're doing.

	Nick slides Sugai in the back seat, carefully reaches over
	and shuts the door.

					NICK
			Start it.

					ICH
				(terrified)
			I can't...

					JOYCE
			Slide over.

	Joyce, furious at Nick, starts the car, gets behind the
	wheel.  Ich gets in on the other side.

	She spins the car around.  The gate opens.  They tear off.

								 CUT TO:

	EXT.  STREET - BEPPU - DAY

	The car bursts through the funnels of steam from the hot-
	springs beneath the street.  It tears down the narrow
	block dodging traffic.  Joyce is concentrating hard on the
	road.

					NICK
				(to Ich)
			Where's somewhere safe?

	Nothing from Ich.  He's still apoplectic.

					JOYCE
				(angrily)
			You came up with the first part.

								 CUT TO:

	EXT.  KUDAN LOVE HOTEL - BEPPU

	A four story concrete hotel, strictly for making love.
	"Love Hotels" exist all over Japan.  Each have various
	themes:  western, fifties drive in, Star Wars, etc., each
	complete with music and lighting effects.


	INT.  HOTEL ROOM

	Western style.  Plastic five foot cacti in front of the
	western vista on the walls.  A hitching post at the head
	of the bed.  Cowboy hats and boots at the other end.

	Sugai hangs up the phone and turns to Nick and Joyce who
	are sitting nearby.  Ich hangs up the extension.

					SUGAI
			Kobo will meet me here tomorrow.
			Ten a.m.

	Ich nods, confirming that what Sugai says is true.

					NICK
			Good.

					SUGAI
			He'll find out you took me.  I'm
			unprotected.  He'll kill us.  All of
			us.  You don't stand a chance.

	Ich, knowing Sugai is right, looks at Nick.  Nick flips
	Ich the gun.

					NICK
			Not if we're careful.

	Ich checks to make sure the gun is loaded, then watches as
	Nick escorts Joyce out of the room.

								 CUT TO:

	A HOTEL ROOM ACROSS THE HALL

	Fifties theme.  The front end of a pink chevy curves
	around the bed.  A "Drive-In" movie screen along one wall.

	Nick is dropping change into the vintage Wurlitzer.  Joyce
	steps in, leaving the door open.

					JOYCE
			You're out of your mind.  I'm
			leaving.

	Nick doesn't respond.

					JOYCE
			You'll get Ich killed.

					NICK
			No one's keeping him here.

					JOYCE
			Bullshit, Nick.  And don't tell me
			this is all just about Charlie.
			It's not.

					NICK
			Why would you care?

	That pushes her over the line.

					JOYCE
			Bastard...

	She moves toward him, enraged.  Nick grabs her arm.

					JOYCE
			Let go.

	He won't.

					JOYCE
			You're out of your mind.

	He grips her tighter.

								 CUT TO:

	THE ROOM - LATER

	Nick and Joyce, only partially undressed, are making love
	on the floor.  The Drifters singing "Under The Boardwalk"
	can be heard on the Wurlitzer.  The fifties decor, the
	music, it's all pretty incongruous.

								 CUT TO:

	EXT.  LOVE HOTEL - DAWN

	Nick is putting Joyce in a taxi.  He shuts the door.

					JOYCE
			I still think you're a bastard.

					NICK
			What if I chant?

					JOYCE
			Wouldn't help.
				(beat)
			Watch out for Ich.

	He nods.  The cab drives off.  Nick watches her taxi until
	it is out of sight, around a corner, then heads inside.

								 CUT TO:

	NICK - LATER

	walking into Sugai's room.  Sugai's asleep on the bed.
	Ich is vigilantly sitting awake in the corner, the gun
	resting on the table in front of him.

					NICK
			Better wake him up.

								 CUT TO:

	EXT.  LOVE HOTEL - LATER

	Quiet.  The wind twirls a discarded newspaper in the
	parking lot.

	INSIDE THE LOVE HOTEL - HALLWAY

	A YOUNG GIGGLING COUPLE step out of a door, arm in arm,
	and disappear down the hall.  STAR WARS MUSIC from one
	room.  HAWAIIAN MUSIC from another.

	THE CAMERA FINDS the closed elevator door.  It opens, Kobo
	steps out, followed by a half-dozen more men all carrying
	Sig-Saur assault rifles -- very heavy artillery.

								 CUT TO:

	SUGAI

	wearing his hat and coat is sitting on the couch, his back
	to us, facing out the window.

	Drop down to --

	THE ROOM BENEATH HIM

	A couple are making love in the Hawaiian theme room.

	The door burst open.  Two men, cradling Sig-Saur rifles in
	their arms, step in.  They aim at the ceiling, blasting
	into Sugai's room above.

	THE GIRL

	starts screaming.  The men ignore her and continue to pump
	bullets into the ceiling.

	KOBO AND HIS MEN

	stop in front of every door long enough to blast into the
	room.  They make their way down the hall.

	A naked man steps into the hallway and is matter-of-factly
	gunned down.

	Kobo and his men stop in front of Sugai's room.


	INT.  SUGAI'S ROOM

	Sugai, wearing his hat, is slumped down on the couch which
	has been splintered by the bullets from below.

	OUTSIDE THE ROOM

	Kobo signals the men.  All six open-up through the door.

	INSIDE THE ROOM

	The door, what's left of it, is kicked open.  The six men
	step in, shooting in all directions:  into the bathroom
	door, into the closet... Windows shatter, mirrors fall,
	total destruction.  They stop.  SILENCE.

	Kobo walks up to Sugai who is slumped on the couch.  He
	lifts up his hat.  It's a cowboy mannequin wearing Sugai's
	clothes.

	THE ELEVATOR DOOR

	opens.  A DOZEN of Sugai's men carrying machine pistols
	come out.

	THE OUTSIDE BALCONY

	Nick and Ich lie on their bellies, guns out.

	INSIDE THE ROOM

	Kobo's men turn.  Sugai's men open-up.  Three of Kobo's
	hitters go down.  The others try to flee into the
	adjoining room.

	Kobo goes for the balcony.

	THE BALCONY

	as Kobo steps out.  He steps right into --

	NICK

	who slams the side of Kobo's head with the butt of his
	gun.

	THE ROOM   

	Nick and Ich drag Kobo in by his jacket collar.  Sugai,
	very much alive, walks in from the hallway.  Nothing is
	said.  Sugai looks at Kobo for a long beat, then walks
	out.

								 CUT TO:

	INT.  SUGAI'S HOUSE - DAY

	KOBO

	standing alone in the middle of a tatami room.  His face
	is badly beaten.  His hands are bound.  Two guards stand
	near the wall.  Nick and Ich stand across the room.

	SUGAI

	wearing a western suit, is asking Kobo questions in
	Japanese.  Sugai barks at him again.  Kobo refuses to
	answer.  Sugai pulls up a shuto -- an 18 inch knife --
	from it's scabbard.

					SUGAI
				(in Japanese)
			Contact your associate in New York
			and tell him to hand my plate over
			to Abolofia.

	Nothing from Kobo.

					SUGAI
			You have betrayed the syndicate and
			personally dishonored me.  I would
			rather the deal fell through than...

	The guards walk over and turn Kobo around.  His back is to
	Sugai.  Sugai runs the sword across the nape of Kobo's
	neck drawing blood.  The guards tighten their grip on
	Kobo's arms.

	NICK

	can't believe Sugai's going to kill him.  Nick starts to
	get up, Ich stops him.

	Kobo realizes Sugai isn't just threatening him.

					KOBO
			No... I'll arrange it.

								 DISSOLVE TO:

	THE ROOM - LATER

	Kobo is led back into the room by two guards.  The guards
	shove him down to the floor.  His hands are still bound.

	Nick walks over and stands above him.  He doesn't say a
	word.  Just stands above him.  Then, Nick pulls spare
	change from his pocket and slowly drops the coins, one by
	one, in front of Kobo's face, like Kobo did to him.  He
	walks away.

	Sugai steps in.

					SUGAI
			Abolofia's person has received the
			plate.  It's done.

	A door opens at the far end of the room.  It's Kobo's
	girlfriend, the one Nick and Ich had been following.

	She starts toward Kobo; a lieutenant intercepts her.

					SUGAI
				(in Japanese)
			I wanted you to see him like this.

					GIRL
				(in Japanese)
			Let him go, father.

	ON ICH

	realizing she's Sugai's daughter.

					GIRL
				(in Japanese)
			You're too old...

					SUGAI
				(in Japanese)
			That's enough.

	Sugai turns away and picks up the sword.  The guards
	clutch Kobo.  Sugai's going to kill Kobo after all.

	The girl screams at him to stop.  Sugai's oblivious.

					NICK (O.S.)
			That wasn't our deal.

					SUGAI
			You want him dead too.

					NICK
			After a court convicts him.  He
			belongs to me.

	There's a long pause.  Then, something unusual happens.
	Sugai tells the lieutenant to unfasten Kobo's wrist.  When
	he does, Sugai hands Kobo the sword and demands that he
	cut off his finger.

	This is Yubitsume:  the ritual act within the Yakuza of
	slicing the joint of the little finger to atone for a
	mistake.

	Kobo, not believing in this ancient tradition, refuses.
	Sugai nods to a guard who places Kobo's finger on the
	table.

	KOBO

	stares defiantly at Sugai.  He doesn't even wince as the
	blade slices off his finger.  The guard hands Sugai the
	finger in a handkerchief.

					SUGAI
				(looking at Nick)
			If anything happens to Abolofia or
			my plate, detective...

	HOLD on Nick then --

								 CUT TO:

	EXT.  TRAIN - DAY

	as it bursts out of a tunnel on it's way to Tokyo.


	INT.  TRAIN - DAY

	Kobo is sitting by the window, his hands cuffed in front
	of him.  Another pair of cuffs chain him to the arm rest.

	Nick pours a drink from an airline-sized bottle of Scotch.
	He holds it out to... Ich.  It's his first drink in a
	week.

					NICK
			Just one, compadre... Kampai.

					ICH
			Kampai.

	They clink glasses.  Ich drinks it down.

					NICK
			It took 12 years to make it, you
			could take five minutes to drink it.

	Ich slows down.

					NICK
			You did great, Ichiro.

					ICH
			I called Ohashi, he'll be waiting.
				(smiling)
			I like him waiting.

	Ich gets up.

					ICH
			Needs ice.

	He heads for the bar car, leaving Kobo and Nick alone.

	Kobo looks out the window at the people working the rice
	paddies, then back down the aisle at the Salarymen in
	their identical suits, then at the women separated from
	them.

					KOBO
			Ugly... A couple of thousand years
			they've been bound by these little
			rules.  Looking in.  Always afraid.
			Ugly little lives...

					NICK
			Save it, I already took the tour.

					KOBO
			You are a lucky man.  Where you come
			from a man can stand out.  It's
			expected.  Here a man is made to
			look a fool for standing out.

	Nick isn't paying much attention.

					KOBO
			I like your friend, Joyce.  You're
			lucky.

					NICK
			Guess I'm on a roll.

					KOBO
			She's such a long way home for you.

					NICK
			Time, I've got plenty of.

	A raucous SALARYMAN comes down the aisle, singing an Enka,
	swaying with the train, bumping into seats.  A common
	enough sight and ignored by the rest of the passengers.
	The Salaryman stumbles and falls across Nick's lap.

					NICK
				(helping him up)
			Hey, hey, come on, blow...

	The Salaryman bows deep.  Nick ignores it.  The man moves
	on.  Kobo looks out the window, the train begins to SLOW
	as it approaches the next station.

					KOBO
				(matter-of-factly)
			This is my stop.

					NICK
			I'm amused.

					KOBO
			Don't be.

	Nick looks up to see Kobo calmly fingering a lock of blond
	hair tied with black ribbon.  Joyce's ribbon.  Joyce's
	hair.

					KOBO
			I have her.

	Nick looks down the car.  The drunk Salaryman who stumbled
	over Nick is quite sober.  He made the hand-off to Kobo.
	Kobo holds out his wrists.  Nick hesitates.

					KOBO
				(matter-of-factly)
			I'll kill her.

	Nick, reluctantly, unlocks both sets of cuffs.  The train
	pulls into the station.

					KOBO
			I want the plate from your pal,
			Sugai.  When you get it, you get
			her.

	Kobo gets up, starts down the aisle.

					NICK
			Sugai won't give it to me, you know
			that.

					KOBO
			Then take it from him.

	Kobo gets off the train.

	NICK

	follows him to the door.

	THE STATION

	Kobo get into a waiting Jaguar.  Four guards nearby.

	INSIDE THE TRAIN

	Nick runs down the length of the car trying to keep the
	Jaguar in sight as the train pulls out... the car is gone.

	NICK

	bursts into the packed bar car.

					NICK
			Ichiro?!

	Everyone turns around.  No Ich.

								 CUT TO:

	EXT.  TRAIN - TRAIN STATION - TOKYO

	It slows into the station.


	INT.  TRAIN

	Nick shoves past the passengers lined up in the vestibule,
	ignoring a conductor's angry shouts.


	INT.  TERMINAL - MOMENTS LATER

	The train stops.  Nick flies out and starts running,
	dodging the crowd.

	Three uniformed policemen, including Ohashi's assistant,
	hurry toward him; they're dismayed to find that Kobo is
	gone.

					NICK
			Where's Ohashi?

	Instead of offering him help, the policemen grab him and
	slap a pair of handcuffs on Nick's wrists.

					NICK
			What the hell are you doing?!

								 CUT TO:

	HOLDING CELL - TOKYO POLICE STATION

	Nick, waiting alone in the cell.  It's been hours.  A door
	at the end of the hall opens.

	Ohashi stops in front of his cell.

					OHASHI
			Your plane leaves at six.  Two
			officers will escort you.

					NICK
			For God's sake, Ohashi, I need your
			help.  Let me out of here!

					OHASHI
			You had my help, detective.

					NICK
			If anything happens to her while I'm
			here --

					OHASHI
			-- Do you know where she is,
			detective?  Do you know how to find
			her?  Even where to start?  We will
			find them.

					NICK
			I have to get to Sugai.

					OHASHI
			Goodbye, officer.

	Ohashi keeps walking.

					NICK
			OHASHI!

	The LOUD clank of metal on metal.  Ohashi's gone.

					NICK
				(yelling at the top
				 of his lungs)
			OHASHI!!

	HOLD on Nick, his fingers squeezing the bars in rage,
	then --

								 CUT TO:

	EXT.  ROAD - DAY

	Flood rice paddies stretch to the distance on either side
	of the road.  We PAN over to Kobo at a phone kiosk outside
	a gas station.

					KOBO
				(in Japanese)
			Yes.  Do it.


	INT.  SUGAI'S HOUSE - AT THAT MOMENT

	Kobo's girl, Sugai's daughter, hangs up the phone.  She's
	been on the other end of the line.


	INT.  SUGAI'S ROOM

	The door swings open.  Sugai is sitting on the floor.  The
	girl is carrying a tray of tea.  Beneath the tray, we spot
	something else -- the butt of a short-bladed tanto.

								 CUT TO:

	EXT.  NARITA AIRPORT - TOKYO - DAY

	A police car rolls through the service gate.  We see Nick
	inside the car along with two police guards.


	INT.  HOLDING ROOM - NARITA AIRPORT

	A white room.  No chairs.  Jet engines can be HEARD
	through the walls.  Nick is sitting on the floor,
	defeated.  He doesn't look up when he hears someone enter.

					ICH (O.S.)
			I'll tell you one thing.  You can't
			solve a thing sitting on your ass.

	Nick looks up.  Ich is in uniform.  A revolver and batton
	hang from his white web gear.  His undershirt bulges
	through his khaki shirt.  He looks ridiculous.  Nick has
	never seen a more beautiful sight.

								 CUT TO:

	INT.  POLICE CAR

	Ich is driving.  Nick is seated behind a cage in the back
	seat.  His hands are cuffed.  Ich is driving through the
	freight area towards a perimeter guard.

					NICK
			I was ready to have your ass for
			taking off on me.

					ICH
			I followed them.  An hour from the
			train station.

					NICK
			How many men?

					ICH
			I couldn't tell.

					NICK
			Joyce?

					ICH
			I don't know.

					NICK
			We need the plate to negotiate with.

	Ich nods.


	EXT.  AT THE GATE - TOKYO AIRPORT

	The car slows.  Ich speaks rapidly to the guard showing
	him his papers.  The guard takes a good hard look at Nick.
	Time stands still... He waves them through.  Nick can
	breath again.

					NICK
			You know, Ichiro, you just burned
			your bridges.

	Ich is silent for a moment.  He hands Nick's Beretta back
	through the partition.  So it goes.

					ICH
			Rest.

	Nick looks for Ich's eyes in the rearview mirror.  The
	little cop keeps driving, his eyes on the road.

								 DISSOLVE TO:

	EXT.  STREET - BEPUKU - DAY

	Nick and Ich are standing outside their car.  The Police
	radio crackles from inside.

	WHAT THEY SEE:

	A large crowd gathered outside of Sugai's estate.  Police
	have cordoned off the area.  An empty ambulance is parked
	out front with various other cars:  Debonnaire's,
	Cadillac's... A boy in shorts is endlessly bouncing a ball
	against the compound wall.  Whatever happened is long
	over.

	Ich flips off the radio.

					ICH
			Someone attacked him.

					NICK
			Now we've got nothing to negotiate
			with.

								 CUT TO:

	EXT.  ROAD - DUSK

	The police car streaks across endless fields.

	INSIDE THE CAR

	Nick is at the wheel.  He rubs the sleep from his eyes.
	Ich is slumped down in the seat watching the road.

	Ich pulls out a cigarette.  Nick lights it for him.

					NICK
			Joyce told me about your family.
			It's tough...

	Ich looks up surprised.

					ICH
			Thank you.
				(beat)
			You have one?

					NICK
			A wife.  She left.

					ICH
			I'm sorry.

					NICK
			Me too.

	Ich glances over at Nick, then back at the road.

	Nicks rubs out his cigarette and presses down on the
	accelerator.

								 DISSOLVE TO:

	EXT.  KOBO'S HIDEOUT - DAWN

	A small, contemporary house perched on a dry piece of
	land.  A paved road, lined with dense foliage runs on a
	berm between the flooded rice paddies.

	ON NICK AND ICH

	sitting in the car watching from a hillside turnoff.
	There's no easy way in.

					NICK
			Let's go.

	Ich hands Charlie his shuto -- an 18 inch long knife.

					NICK
			What's that for?

					ICH
			Luck.

	Nick tucks the shuto inside his jacket.

					NICK
			Thanks.

	Nick opens up his door and climbs out.

					ICH
			You know, Nick, we can't lose.

					NICK
				(stopping)
			Why's that?

					ICH
			Because we're the biggest things to
			hit this town since Godzilla.

								 CUT TO:

	THE DIRT ROAD

	leading to the house lined with foliage.  The rice paddies
	on either side.

								 CUT TO:

	NICK AND ICH

	making their way through the waist high water.

	TWO WORKERS

	with their hoes make their way into the water.  They don't
	see our cops.

	OUR COPS

	making their way along the edge of the road.  The SOUND of
	a motorcycle coming.

	THE MOTORCYCLE RIDER

	slows and drops a gear as he turns off the main road and
	onto the dirt berm toward the house.  He's one of Kobo's
	Bosozoku -- a long way from the streets of Tokyo.

	The rider comes around the bend to see --

	A COP

	standing in a uniform.  Ich.  For a moment he doesn't know
	what to do.  Then, he draws a pistol from his belt and
	accelerates toward Ich.

	ICH

	stands his ground as the bike closes in.  The biker takes
	aim.

	Ich drops off to the side as --

	NICK

	rises from a ditch and swings a hoe at the rider as he
	passes, catching the man across the face.  The rider drops
	like a swatted fly.  The biker's momentum carries it a few
	yards before it falls and skids to a halt.

	Nick hurries to the bike.

	Ich drags the biker off the road, then catches up to his
	partner.

	NICK AND ICH

	raise the heavy bike.  Nick mounts.  He takes the riders
	helmet and goggles from Ich, and puts them on.

					ICH
			What are you going to do?

	Nick doesn't know exactly.  He taps the bike into gear, it
	torques like a mule.  There's a lot more juice here
	than he's used to.

	Nick fishtails for a minute, then gets the hang of it.

	Ich heads off taking another route.


	INT.  HOUSE

	KOBO AND SUGAI'S DAUGHTER

	are putting the last of their belongings into a suitcase.
	She hands him the plate -- Sugai's plate.

	Kobo kisses her as he slips it into his breast pocket.
	The SOUND of a motorcycle approaching from outside.


	EXT.  THE HOUSE

	Kobo steps out, and not recognizing Nick, raises his hand
	to greet what he thinks is one of his men.

	ON NICK

	bearing down on Kobo.

	ON KOBO

	as Nick keeps coming.  He is unable to see clearly until
	Nick is almost on top of him.

	NICK

	dumps the bike at the foot of the stairs and leaps on
	Kobo.

	Nick and Kobo roll off the narrow porch.  Nick breaks
	free.  He isn't fighting fair this time.  He slams his
	foot into Kobo's face and ribs.  Kobo tries to get up, but
	Nick knees him in the chin.

	A woman cries out in Japanese.  Nick turns to see

	JOYCE

	standing at the top of the steps.  A biker is pressing the
	muzzle of a Sig-Saur assault rifle on her.  Kobo's girl is
	beside them holding a small pistol.

	KOBO

	gets to his feet.  The biker tosses Kobo the rifle.  Kobo
	works the charging lever and holds the weapon at his side.
	He has all the time in the world.

	Kobo whirls and kicks Nick in the groin.  Nick falls to
	his knees in agony.

	Kobo towers above Nick as he did in the alley in New York.

					KOBO
			Still on your knees, Nick?

	Kobo walks off, his back to Nick.

					KOBO
			There's nothing you can do for me
			anymore.  I have the plate.  Sugai's
			dead.  No there is something.

	He walks up to the steps to Joyce.

					KOBO
			You can tell me who I should shoot
			first.

	Nick struggles to get to his feet.  Kobo turns and faces
	Nick at the foot of the steps.

	ICH

	appears behind Kobo and takes him down with an amazing
	display of baton work that shows a lifetime of training.

	He grabs the gun.  A biker bursts out of the door.  Ich
	fires, hitting him in the thigh.  He drops his gun.

	SUGAI'S DAUGHTER

	grabs the gun.

	NICK

	tackles her, and wrestles the gun away.  She grabs for it.
	Nick slugs her.

	A GUN BLAST

	Ich is hit in the back of his shoulder, falls onto the
	porch.

	KOBO

	the shooter, is holding a pistol -- a Glock 17 automatic.
	He fires at

	NICK AND JOYCE

	who scramble for cover.

	KOBO

	continues firing as he climbs onto a motorcycle.  He pops
	the clutch and flies off down the road.  Nick fires after
	him, but Kobo's gone.

					NICK
				(to Ich)
			You all right?

					ICH
			Yes...

					NICK
				(to Joyce)
			Call for help.

	Nick mounts the other bike, and puts the turbo charged
	rocket into gear.

	THE ROAD

	Rain pours down as Kobo turns onto the main road.  He
	opens up the throttle, and in less than a second, he's a
	screaming dot in the distance.

	NICK

	comes around the same corner.  His bike fishtails and
	slides out from under him.

	FURTHER DOWN THE ROAD

	Kobo tears past a police car.  The police car takes off
	after him.

	THE FOOTHILLS

	A series of steep switchbacks traverse the steep, densely
	forested hills.

	Kobo's bike flies up the road.  The police car can't keep
	up, begins losing ground.

	THE POLICE CAR

	going flat out, falling further and further behind.
	Kobo's going to escape.

	SUDDENLY

	Nick, bent low, shoots past the cop car.  His left arm is
	scraped and bloody.

	ON KOBO

	glancing back, to see Nick gaining on him.  Kobo's
	pleased.  He gives it more gas.

	NICK

	pulling eight-five... ninety... one hundred.  The rain
	stings his face.  It's hard to keep his eye open.

	THE FOOTHILLS

	Kobo leaning into one of the steep turns, climbing higher
	and higher toward the clouds clinging to the top of the
	peak.

	NICK

	is gaining on him.  He HEARS something coming up behind
	him.

	A BOSOZOKU

	the one Ich shot in the leg, is closing fast on his tail.

	ON NICK

	as the biker draws even.

	THE BIKER

	pulls out his long knife and slashes at Nick's shoulder.

	Nick drops back causing him to miss.  The biker drops
	back.  Nick tries to speed up, but the biker sticks with
	him.  He's a good rider, this boy.  Very, very good.

	The biker moves in again, blade drawn.

	NICK SEES

	something the biker doesn't.

	A TRUCK

	coming around the corner.

	NICK

	swerves to avoid it at the last moment.  The biker reacts
	too late and runs --

	INTO THE GLEAMING

	radiator of the two ton truck, and disappears beneath its
	wheels.

	ON KOBO

	around the bend, glancing back.  Empty road.  He eases up
	on the throttle -- a free man... He circles back only to
	see

	NICK

	burst around the corner charging toward him at a hundred-
	and-twenty miles per hour, in the driving rain.

	KOBO

	waits and waits.  Nick draws closer.  Then, Kobo tears off
	back down the mountain, shooting past Nick.

	Nick brakes... He slows down, and starts to turn, but the
	wheels whirl on the gravel and the bike goes into a skid,
	heading right for the edge of the road.

								 CUT TO:

	NICK'S MOTORCYCLE

	flying over the edge of the road, and down the cliff.

								 CUT TO:

	THE EDGE OF THE ROAD

	Nick, lying on his stomach at the edge of the cliff, his
	arm is probably broken.

	He tries to get up with a one arm push up.  It's hopeless.
	His head falls into a puddle of water.

	The WHINE of an approaching motorcycle.  Kobo has come
	back for him.

	Nick, in excruciating pain, struggles for his gun.

	KOBO

	bearing down on Nick.

	NICK

	struggling to get his gun.  Finally he does.  But it's
	caked in mud.  If the barrel is stuffed it will explode.
	Nick has to take the chance.

	ON KOBO

	Closer and closer.

	NICK

	aims as best he can and fires.  The mud caked gun explodes
	in his hand.  Nick screams in agony.

	KOBO

	pulls his bike up inches in front of Nick's head.  Nick
	seems to be bleeding everywhere:  his hand, his nose, his
	mouth, the side of his head...

	Kobo's face and neck is caked in blood from when Nick beat
	him.

	The rain pours down.

	He picks up the gun.  Points it at Nick, squeezes the
	trigger.

					KOBO
				(slowly)
			Bang... bang...

	He tosses the gun in front of Nick's face.

					KOBO
			... You're dead.

	The sound of approaching Police SIRENS.

	Kobo swings the bike around, goes a hundred yards down the
	road, then swings back.

	Kobo guns the engine.  He gain speed... thirty, thirty-
	five.

	NICK

	struggles to get up.  He can't.

	KOBO

	opening the throttle.

	NICK

	crawling a few inches, that's it.

	KOBO

	twenty yards away.

	NICK

	reaches into his coat and pulls Ich's 18 inch shuto out.

	He rolls away at the last moment, slashing Kobo's ankle as
	he races past.

	KOBO

	screams in pain.  He tries to stop too suddenly.  The bike
	flips over.  Kobo flies into the air then hits the
	pavement on his side and rolls a few yards down the road.
	He stops on his back.  It's lucky he's alive.

	The SOUND of fast approaching police SIRENS.

	THE PLATE

	has fallen out of Kobo's jacket.  It rests in the road,
	halfway between the two men.

	KOBO

	crawls toward it on his belly.

	NICK

	mustering all his strength, struggles across the road on
	all fours.

	KOBO

	crawling snake-like.

	NICK

	still moving, his arms and legs feel like lead.

	KOBO'S FINGERS

	as they reach for the plate.

	NICK

	grabs Kobo's wrist forcing him to drop the plate.  Nick
	picks up a rock.  It looks as if he's going to smash
	Kobo's head.  Instead, he brings it down on the plate,
	shattering it in a half-dozen pieces.

	Nick tosses the pieces in front of Kobo's face.

					NICK
			Keep the change.

	Nick, exhausted, slowly falls onto his back.  He looks
	over at Kobo, their faces are inches apart.  Nick makes a
	slashing mark with his index finger above his eyebrows.
	The same gesture Kobo made to Nick through the two-way
	mirror in New York.

	Nick passes out.  His eyes shut... the screen...

								FADES TO BLACK.

	BLACK SCREEN

	The SOUND of three police cars screeching to a halt.  The
	SOUNDS of the police SIRENS winding down.

	The SIRENS get softer mixing with the SOUND of RINGING
	phones, CLACKING typewriters, VOICES...


	FADE IN:

	Fifty identical desks.  Fifty identically dressed men in

	Suddenly, the lights go out.  The fan's stop, so do the
	electric typewriters.

	Ohashi looks up to see --

	ICH

	walking toward him down the long aisle, his left arm is
	bandaged, his right hand handcuffed to Kobo on crutches.

	Ich silently leads the captured man down the long aisle to
	Ohashi's desk.

	ICH

	stops in front of the desk and snaps to attention.

					ICH
			Constable Ichiro Matsumoto presents
			captured prisoner Kobo, Chief
			Inspector Ohashi.

	Ich salutes.

					OHASHI
			Inspector Ohashi will take charge of
			the prisoner.

	Ich uncuffs Kobo and steps aside to reveal --

	NICK

	standing at the far end of the room by the fuse box.  He's
	also bandaged and on crutches.

	Nick looks at Ohashi without saying a word, then flips the
	main switch up.  The lights and fans start working.

	He turns and walks out the door.

			Last time you asked me to come along

					NICK
			Might be different in New York.

					JOYCE
			Maybe.  If I come visit, we can find

					NICK
			I'd like that.

	Ich sits down with two fresh bowls of soba noodles.  Nick
	hesitates.

					ICH
			You can do it.

	Nick picks up his chopsticks with his good hand.  He
	begins to slurp the noodles.

					ICH
			Louder, pal, louder.

					NICK
			Joyce, give the assistant Chief
			Inspector a drink, would you?

	As Joyce refills all their cups we...

								 SLOWLY DISSOLVE TO:

					OLIVER
			... Remember, counterfeiting is the

			You I.D. the other plate, he does

					NICK
			Right.

	Reveal Nick sitting in front of Oliver's desk, his one arm
	is still in a sling.  Nick gets to his feet.

					OLIVER
				(still not facing

			You know, Nick, if you'd held on to

	Oliver turns to face Nick.  Nick just looks at him, then:

			Never crossed my mind.

	Oliver nods; he believes him.

			Be careful on the run.

	In contrast to the Japanese police station -- it's chaos.

	THE RAIDING PARTY

	a dozen men in all, are donning flak jackets and

	back.

	NICK

	sitting at a desk, thumbing through a Frommer's guide to
	New York City.  Nick drops one of the vests on the desk.
	It lands like a ton of bricks.  Ich continues to read.

	A Sergeant walks in.

					SERGEANT
			Saddle up.  Hard team in the first
			unit.  Conklin, your RMP awaits.

	The cops and treasury men, grabbing their gear, head for
	the door.

	Nick is struggling to get into his vest using one arm.

					NICK
			Sure you want to come?  Probably
			better than the Greyline Tour.

	Ich stands up, shoves the guidebook in his back pocket.
	He helps Nick fasten the strap in back.

					ICH
			You wouldn't make it without me.

	Nick smiles, takes the Frommer's out of Ich's pocket and
	tosses it into the trash.

	Nick hands him a shotgun, takes another one off the rack
	for himself.

	We watch from behind as the two men head down the long
	hallway toward the exit.

					ICH
			Think we'll get him, Nick?

					NICK
			We can't lose.

					ICH
			How can you be so sure?

	Nick opens the door at the far end of the hallway.  They
	step out into the sunlit rain.

					NICK
			Cause you're the biggest thing to
			hit this town since...

	Before Nick can finish his line, the door SLAMS SHUT
	behind them.

								 FADE TO BLACK.

					THE END
THE BLING RING

1   EXT. HOLLYWOOD HILLS MANSION - NIGHT                             1

    A Toyota parks and five teenagers get out and walk towards
    us, down a quiet residential street in the Hollywood Hills.

    One of them, a slightly drunk girl in a pale blue Juicy sweat
    suit stumbles.

                        DRUNK GIRL (NICKI)
                        (laughing)
              Shit.

                        GIRL 1 (REBECCA)
              C'mon. Hurry up.

    They come to a gated home. A girl that seems to be the
    leader, leans down and pulls on an unraveling part of the
    bottom of the chain link fence.

    She rolls under, and the others follow.

    A loud song kicks in as they put their sweatshirt hoods up in
    unison and turn around and walk backwards toward the house.

    They've done this before, they have it down.

    One checks under the mat of the front door, we follow them as
    they go around to the back, checking doors, and find a back
    window open.

    A guy gives Girl 1 a lift up, we see her bright underwear as
    she climbs inside into a laundry room.

    She runs around to open a side door for the rest, and they
    slip inside.
    Once inside, we follow REBECCA into a bedroom dressing area.
    She is the 17 yr-old Korean-American ring-leader, who is
    totally cool and composed.

    She looks over her shoulder at the others with a raised eye-
    brow.

                        REBECCA
              Let's go shopping!

    And she pulls open the closet door.

    CLOSE UP: grabbing Louis Vuitton bags.

    A drawer opens with a few Rolexes, that are scooped in to a
    Louis Vuitton duffle bag.

     An underwear drawer is opened, and picked through.

     A medicine cabinet is opened, a hand grabs bottles of
     prescription pills and dumps them in a bag.

     We see the other kids grabbing things and loading up bags.

     Rebecca puts on a hat she finds and looks at herself in a
     mirror posing, then gets back to it.

     The kids exit with their hoods up, carrying out the Louis
     Vuitton bags and other loot, as much as they can carry.

     One girl, NICKI leans over and throws-up on their way out.

     They get into the Toyota and peel out.

     CLOSE UP: flashbulbs go off.

     Titles intercut with montage of Mug shots of attractive
     teenagers and news clips.

     We see a clip of black & white video surveillance of the
     kids' approach to the house walking backwards with hoods up.
     Pan across a row of Louboutin platform heels.

     We see the glittery view of Hollywood at night.

     CLOSE UP: a Facebook page of a party photo of Rebecca in the
     hat we saw her try on earlier.

     Pan across a pile of quilted Chanel bags.

     T.V. image of a starlet on the red carpet posing for

               learning lesson for me to grow and
               expand as a spiritual human being.
               I see myself being like an Angelina
               Jolie, but even stronger, pushing
               even harder for the universe and
               peace and for the health of the

     Nicki and Sam, also pretty, slutty and 17, are waking up in a
     messy teenage bedroom.

     Clothes are all over the floor, a knot of duvet covers part
     of a girl, with legs sticking out, we can see a lotus blossom
     tattoo.

    Sam struggles to sit up, she's in a tight tank with bed head.
    She rolls her eyes.

                        SAM
              Oh my lord, you were so out of
              control last night.

                        NICKI
              What about you! You were all over
              that old guy, the manager...

    Sam laughs.

                        SAM
              Oh yeah. He was totally perving
              out.

    She starts to slip into skinny jeans.


4   INT. KITCHEN - DAY                                            4

    Laurie, Nicki's mom, pretty ex-playboy model in her 40's in
    Juicy sweatpants and a tank top, gets breakfast ready.

    She opens a cabinet as she calls up to them. A little Yorkie
    nips at her heels.

                        LAURIE
              Girls! Time for your aderall! Let's
              go!

    Emily, 13, sleepily sits down for some cereal.
                        EMILY
              Mom, they got home so late last
              night.

    Laurie with wide eyes and a forced calm voice answers her.

                         LAURIE
              That's none of your concern, I'll
              handle it.

    She calls up to them again.

                         LAURIE (CONT'D)
              Girls!

    Nicki and Sam wander down to breakfast, disheveled.

              What time did you get home last
              night?

                           SAM
              Uh...late.

                        LAURIE
              You know it's a school night.

                           NICKI
              We know...

    Laurie tries to sound cheerful and in control.

                        LAURIE
              Let's have our morning prayer and
              then we'll meet in the living room
              at eight to start today's lesson on
              the laws of attraction, OK?


    They join hands as Laurie enthusiastically leads them in her
    prayer.

                        LAURIE (CONT'D)
              My chief aim in life is to
              continually strive to express my
              greatest potential as a spiritual
              human being and contributor to the
              greater good for our planet and all
              those who live on it. I know that
              I have the ability to reach my aim
              in life, by persistent action and
              that the thoughts of my mind will
              reproduce themselves in outward
              physical reality.
              I will channel my energy towards my
              aim in life with graciousness and
              loving kindness to myself and
              others.

               Yeah. Ok, thanks, Mom.

     He heads in to school.

     As he walks up, he can feel kids looking at him.

     He sees bunches of kids in groups checking him out.

              I can't believe it, someone hacked
              into my account and changed my

     Music is playing. Kids roam around with beers.
     Some kid is smoking out of a big bong, and singing along to a
     hip hop chorus.

     In a bedroom, Rebecca's older sister SARAH, 19, is selling
     little baggies of coke.

                         SARAH
               It's Fifty.

     There's a bulletin board of fashion tears and pictures of
     young starlets- Rachel Bilson, Lindsay Lohan, Audrina
     Patridge, some Victoria Secret models.

     Rebecca smokes a cigarette, while she and Marc flip through
     magazines. They look at pages of starlets in gowns on the red
     carpet.
     In the background, the TV is on with random celebrity culture
     playing

     There's a page of `Tweets of the Week' including a picture of
     Demi Moore posing in a bikini in her bathroom.

                         REBECCA
               I can't wait to get out of here.

     Marc and Rebecca are on an affluent suburban street.

     They walk down the sidewalk casually under the street lights.

     Rebecca checks to see if a car's door is open. It's not, she
     goes on to another. She opens the door of a Lexus, and finds
     a small purse in door side pocket, she takes it.

                         REBECCA
               Sweet. C'mon.
     They keep walking and she tries another few cars, until she
     finds another open door. She looks around and finds some cash
     and a credit card.

     And they head back casually, and cut off into some bushes.

     patrol car drive by, and jump in some bushes.

     The patrol car stops and flashes a light around the bushes.

     Rebecca and Marc freeze in their hiding spot. Marc is
     freaking out, he thinks this is it for him. He tries to
     breath quietly. Rebecca calmly waits.

     Finally the flashing lights stop, and the car moves on.

     Marc and Rebecca sit in the dark, Marc breaths again.

     Sam blows smoke from a joint out the window.

     Nicki is entranced with herself as she puts lip gloss on in

     does a runway look with it coming around a corner, pulling
     the suitcase in heels and a scarf like a `60s Pan Am

     Rebecca notices something on the far wall of the closet and

     Rebecca and Marc drive around singing along to their favorite
     song, high, having the best time of their lives. When the
     song ends, they play it again...and again.

     They take bumps and keep going.

     The music fades down and off (we still see them singing their
     hearts out).

               New York, he's there with Miranda
               Kerr.

     There's a picture of the actor and model on the red carpet.

     Then we see typed in: Orlando Bloom's address.
     A map comes up.

               I want to get some Victoria Secret

     The gang of them approach a fence, there's some wire fence at
     the bottom that's unraveling, they pull on it and it opens
     enough for them to squeeze through.

     They approach the house and scatter around to find a way in.

     Rebecca opens the front door, it's unlocked.

                           REBECCA
               You guys.

     They follow her in.

     They sneak into the bedroom and start looking through stuff.

     The girls go through a woman's closet, trying on clothes,
     grabbing stuff.

     Marc opens a drawer in a closet, and finds seven Rolex
     watches and a thick stack of hundred dollar bills. He scoops
     them into a bag.

     CLOSE UP: a girl's hand goes through a drawer of lingerie.

     We see a high-tech security camera globe in ceiling, a red
     light turns on.

     Rebecca hangs out on a sofa smoking a cigarette, while she
     looks through a box of photos and trinkets, as if she's at
     home.

     As they're headed out with all of their loot, Rebecca grabs a
     piece of art off the wall.

                         MARC
               What the fuck are you doing?

                         REBECCA
               I've got a new room at my Dad's in
               Vegas, I need some stuff to
               decorate it, I might stay with him
               a while...here, hold this.

     She hands him the art off the wall, and rolls up a little rug
     on the floor.

                         MARC
               Are you fucking serious?

     Rebecca gives him a nonchalant look, and takes it out with
     her under her arm, carrying a big bag on her other side.

     Marc watches her and follows her out.

     headlights illuminating their way. It's quiet in the car.

                         MARC
               If I ever became not your friend
               anymore, would you rob me?

                         REBECCA
               I would never do that to you.

     it's filled with designer clothes and bags. He just looks at
     it all and touches it.

     We see him lying on the bed, with a fur vest as a pillow, and
     stuff out, wearing Paris Hilton's pink patent leather heels.

     There's a knock at the door.

     It's dinner at their house- with Laurie saying grace. Her
     boyfriend, HENRY sits next to her and Sam, Nicki and Emily

               We look to the universe and Divine
               Spirit to show us the way. I am so

               So, how did your audition go?

                         RICKY
               Where'd you get them?

                         MARC
               Uh...I found them.

                            RICKY
               I see.

     He enjoys dragging this out, making Marc squirm.

                         MARC
               What do you think, can you take
               them?

                         RICKY
               I don't know...I can see...tell you
               what, I'll give you five grand for
               them.

                         MARC
               Aren't they worth more?

                         RICKY
               Not stolen ones.

                         MARC
               Ok, yeah. Thanks.

     He smiles and goes to his safe.

     Marc and the girls dance in slightly slow-motion.

     We hear dreamy, almost ominous tonal music as they dance
     instead of the club music. They sway in a dreamy trance,
     light gleaming around them, outlining their hair.

                         MARC (O.S.)
               When we went out, we got in
               everywhere and everyone loved
               us...and we had so many beautiful,
               gorgeous things.

     Marc is stashing a bunch of his loot in a basement.

     We see him take a last look at a Louis Vuitton suitcase
     packed full of luxury bags and designer fashion.

     Quilted Chanel bags in every color, Louboutin patent leather
     platform heels, Marc Jacobs crisp shirts.

     He touches them, and makes sure they're all tucked away
     carefully, before closing it up.

     We see there are several Louis Vuitton suitcases, he slides
     this one away next to them, and pulls a tarp over them in the
     corner and leaves them by some old Christmas decorations.

     The girls are wearing Paris' jewelry and they're hanging out,
     making drinks as if they live there. One of them's in a fur

     Rob opens drawers, until he finds a box full of jewelry. He
     pulls out some diamond necklaces.

     footage of them from a surveillance camera sneaking into

               That's so cute.

     They load up bags, try on shoes.

     Rebecca closes the bathroom door.

               Are you fucking crazy? How are you
               so relaxed?

     We hear the toilet flush, and Rebecca comes out casually with
     some stuff with her.

     She looks around the closet.

     Some headlights flash, as a car pulls up outside.

     They quickly head out a window onto the roof, as we hear
     someone entering the house.

     Over the empty room, with stuff all over the floor, we hear
     someone calling from entrance.

     She walks off, and the rest of them sit on the curb. Marc and
     Nicki smoke cigarettes.

     Rebecca pulls up in her car and they get in and drive off.

                         MARC (O.S.)
               I think the biggest problem was
               after the Audrina thing-nothing
               happened-it gave Rebecca that self-
               boost that, oh, this is okay. I can
               get away with this. And I think
               her projecting that onto me made me
               think that it was going to be okay.

                March 23rd when her house was
                burglarized. Comparing the clips,
                it looks like these are the same
                burglars as in the Audrina Patridge                     *

      Two small white dogs lay at her mother's feet as she drinks a

127   INT. NICKI'S LIVING ROOM - DAY                             127

      Laurie sits next to Nicki as she speaks to KATE, a polished
      journalist from N.Y. A tape recorder sits in front of Nicki.

      Nicki's two lawyers, SHANNON a brunette in her early 40's, in
      a suit and pearls and ADAM, middle-aged lawyer-type, sit with
      them.

               My mom does a lot of things, she's
               a minister, she's been a masseuse,
               she's an energy healer...My dad is
               a director of photography on T.V.
               shows, he's been in the industry
               forever....

               And how is Sam related?

                         NICKI
               We've adopted her, we met in ballet
               class when we were little.

                         LAURIE
               I was friends with her mother--

                         NICKI
               Mom, this is my interview. I met
               her when my parents divorced. Now
               she lives with us, my mom's home
               schooled us all for a while.

                         LAURIE
               The philosophy of `The Secret',
               it's based on the law of
               attraction, but my great-
               grandmother and grandmother both
               studied this philosophy. It's man's
               relationship to the Divine, that's
               what energy science means.

                         NICKI
               Since I was young I learned about
               every religion.
                         KATE
               So, Sam was in your ballet class,
               did she have parents?

                         NICKI
               She had a dysfunctional background,
               we both did...

                         LAURIE
               And I met her mom--

                         NICKI
               Can I talk please?! The reason we
               related so well is my dad is a
               recovering alcoholic and Sam's mom
               is..

               And then she went off the deep end,
               she was on the verge--

                         NICKI
               Please! I told you that if you're
               going to be here you had to be
               quiet! That's why I didn't want you
               here because you talk!

                         KATE
               So, basically you took her in.

                         NICKI
               Yes, we took her in about 6 years
               ago.

                         SHANNON
               But let's get back to Nicki.

                         KATE
               So Adam here told me you do charity
               work.

                         NICKI
               Yes, we do a lot of stuff through
               our church, it's Agape Church.
                         LAURIE
               It's the religious science
               philosophy being taught at Agape
               Church.

                         NICKI
               My other sister, Gabby is on a trip
               with them now helping build homes.
               And they do a yearly trip to Africa
               where they build wells and schools
               for kids.

                         KATE

                Uh, I can't remember exactly which
                country... We do bake sales and
                feeding the homeless, that kind of
                stuff.

                          KATE
                Ok, so it's a little bit of a
                disconnect with these positive
                pursuits and what's happening now.

                          ADAM
                Nicki, I don't want you to answer
                that comment.

                          NICKI
                I think that I'm a firm... I have a
                good statement to say.

                          KATE
                She can speak generally.

                          NICKI
                I'm not gonna speak about the case,
                what I was going to say is that I'm
                a firm believer in karma and I
                think this situation was attracted
                into my life as a huge learning
                lesson for me to grow and expand as
                a spiritual human being.

      Nicki is getting emotional as she speaks, her voice quivers.

                          NICKI (CONT'D)
                I don't think the universe chose a
                better person than me because from
                this it's not just affecting me,
                it's affecting the media and
                everyone and I think I'm meant to
                bring truth to all this....I
                believe that I am an old soul.

                          LAURIE
                Yes, she is.

                           SHANNON
                We have gotten to know Nicki and
                her family and we feel Nicki is an
                extremely focused, honest person

                And we agree that there hasn't been
                a disconnect, that there were
                circumstances that happened but
                Nicki herself continued to stay on
                her plane despite the tumultuous

                leader and push for peace and for
                the health of our planet--

      Nicki starts to get teary eyed.

                Nicki has expressed to me a lot of
                her humanitarianism.

                          NICKI
                It's my main goal. God didn't give
                me these talents and what I look
                like to sit around and just be a
                model or famous. I want to do
                something people notice, that's why
                I'm studying business, so I can be
                a leader and take a stand for
                people.

                Hills, I went there because I had a
                lot of absences. I didn't want to
                go to school, I had a lot of self-
                loathing and anxiety issues, I felt
                that I was ugly...

                 created a fan page for me. If it

                 to help the community or benefit

                 just kind of awkward for me that
                 these people are loving me for
                 something that's looked down on in
                 society... It's kinda showing that
                 America has some sick fascination
                 with a Bonnie and Clyde kind of
                 thing.

      Nicki, dressed as a sexy school girl walks up with her mother
      and sisters. Her lawyer, Shannon, is dressed for success.

      They are flanked by paparazzi and video camera crews.

      Nicki stops to make a statement. Shannon stands by her side,
      getting in the shot.

                          NICKI
                This is a very difficult time for
                myself and my family. Thank you for
                respecting my privacy, I look
                forward to my day in court.
      She does a flirtatious eye roll and saunters past the cameras
      in her kitten heels.

                We're here with Nicki Moore, who
                just served 30 days for her
                involvement in the Bling Ring, and
                shared a cell block with one of the
                victims- Lindsay Lohan. There were
                reports that Lindsay was crying,
                with you being next to her, did you
                actually hear any of this?
                          NICKI
                I could hear her crying the first
                day, which is hard when you're
                trying to be strong, I just tried
                to really keep to myself..., I just
                tried to get through the day , the
                days are so long you're woken up at

               Were you nervous you were next to
               her because you were accused of
               being a part of that group that
               allegedly robbed her house.

                         NICKI
               Yeah, it was hard for me there were
               tabloids and on T.V.s in there
               people were watching the story and
               they were showing the surveillance
               video and stuff... and little do
               people know that when that video
               came out I was actually in contact
               with her manager to tell her who I
               believed the people were who robbed
               her house... and eventually when
               I'm able to tell my story people
               will know the truth.

                         INTERVIEWER
               So that's nerve wracking she could
               think you robbed her house.

                         NICKI
               She could've, but you
               know...yeah...Anyway, you can

                                                   SECOND DRAFT

                                              DECEMBER 12, 1994



          FADE IN:


          A PAIR OF HANDS
          men's hands, nicely groomed, hold a small white terry
          towel spoiled by blood-red spots. The hands rinse the
          towel in a copper bar sink. The stains soften but stay.
          A tan jacket sleeve, spotted the same way, moves INTO
          FRAM. The hands dab the wet towel at the spots, with no
          more success, and throw it into the sink. It falls half
          in, still dripping the stains a drop at a time to the
          floor.

          ALL IN CLOSEUP
          The owner of the hands walks to a wine rack, opens a
          bottle of white wine, drizzles the wine on the jacket
          sleeve. The stains disappear. He hangs his jacket on a
          hook and walks from

                         THE CELLAR
          and up the narrow stairs. His FOOTFALLS ECHO against the
          unadorned cement block walls. We see his shape, mid-
          forties, powerful, his shirt pulled out. He's carrying
          the open bottle by the neck.

          2 INT. WINE STORE - NIGHT

          Still seen from behind, the man emerges from the cellar
          into a contrastingly elegant space with a wood-beamed.
          ceiling, vaguely European. He walks along a narrow aisle
          of wooden diamond bins. As the space widens his foot hits
          something in his path. He bends to find a shoe. He
          glances about nervously. There are shutters on the
          storefront windows. Shoe in hand, he tightens the
          shutters. We see his profile, a good-looking man.
          He walks toward a brighter room at the back of the store,
          the Tasting Room. Now he retrieves a pair of women's
          trousers from the floor, and as he straightens up we see
          his entire face, genial, venial, redeemed by his smile.
          ALEX GATES. He speaks nonchalantly toward the room.

                         ALEX
          Twenty people tonight. I got a
          South Beach widow, a plastic surgeon --
          they actually came together.

                         (A BEAT)
          These people -- all they really want
          is something to brag about at dinner
          parties.
          He swigs from the bottle of white wine, grimaces, detours
          behind the counter, and spits the mouthful into the
          plastic lined wastebasket. He throws the bottle away.

          There's a basket of baguettes on the counter. Alex breaks
          off an end and chews it to rid his mouth of the taste of
          the wine. Still chewing, he walks toward the tasting
          room.

                         ALEX
          There I was, passing the wine,
          passing the bread, I suddenly felt
          like the priest at Masst Or maybe
          Mass started out as a wine tasting,
          and Jesus was a salesman. what do
          you think?
          He goes into

          THE TASTING ROOM
          It seems empty except for a large wooden table, folding
          chairs in disarray, open bottles clustered at one end of
          the table. A chalkboard on the wall has CHATEAU
          BEYCHEVELLE written across it at the top, vintages listed
          underneath. The woman's voice that replies is
          Gabriella's.

          GABRIELLA (0.S.)
          (with a throaty laugh)
          Maybe I should get dressed.
          Leaning against the corner is a woman wearing only her
          panties and a shirt. In her mid-twenties she has striking
          South American looks. GABRIELLA VASQUEZ. She's sipping
          red wine from a plastic glass.

                         GABRIETM
          I don't want to spoil a religious
          experience.

                         ALEX
          -- Ever heard of Georges Duboeuf?
          He throws away some of the glasses.

                         ALEX
          Duboeuf has a nose and a palate --
          like a gift from God. He can taste
          a single grape before the harvest...
          and describe the beaujolais it's
          going to produce.
          She laughs.

                         GABRIELLA
          Oh, you have competition.

          He bends down to pick up the chunks of baguette strewn on
          the floor. He doesn't see her slip off her panties.
          She walks behind him, twirling them into a tight band.
          She whips them over his eyes. He laughs.

                         GABRIELLA
          Okay. Show me.

          She passes her glass under his nose.

                         ALEX
          Gabriella, I picked these wines.

                         GABRIELLA
          So what is it?

                         ALEX
          All I can smell is your perfume.
          She laughs.

                         GABRIELLA
          I'm not wearing any.

                         ALEX
          I even bought it for you.
          She opens her shirt. She's not wearing a bra. She lowers
          her breast to the glass and then to his mouth.

                         GABRIELLA

          Alex is unlocking the door for Gabriella. Dressed, she
          looks younger. They're awkward with each other.

                         GABRIELLA
          Don't think you have to say it
          because .1 say it, Alex.

          Alex lets out a breath.

                         ALEX
          Oh, yeah... We're pretty good.
          He kisses her goodbye, unlocks the door. She goes out to
          her Honda Civic. Alex doesn't wait to see her drive off
          before he heads back to finish cleaning up the tasting
          room.

          Alex straightens the last chair and starts to extract air

          a revolver. ze thumbs the safety off. The NOISES RECUR,
          like someone trying to break in through the back door from
          the parking lot. Alex slings his jacket casually over the
          gun.

          Alex throws open the back door; he's counting on the
          element of surprise.

                         HIS POV
          His red Cadillac convertible is idling nose.to the chain
          locked across the parking lot. A MAN in his twenties,
          whose tropical shirt fairly glows under the security
          lights, is using a pair of bolt cutters on the chain.

                         ALEX

                         (ADVANCING)
          You think you're gonna steal my car,
          asshole?
          The younger man whirls around.

                         YOUNG MAN
          You scared me, man.
          A middle-aged man, a REPO MAN, calls out lazily from
          behind the wheel.

                         REPO MAN
          This is not your car, sir. This car
          belongs to the Star Leasing Company.
          Alex buries the gun in the rear of his waistband as though
          he's rubbing his stiff back and cranks his smile to a
          higher wattage than the security lights.

                         REPO MAN
          I can collect either the money or
          the car. Given how much you owe, I
          figure it's the car.
          The younger man has almost hacked through the chain.

          We inventory the property at the
          yard.
          He keeps his eye on the chain, ready to gun the engine as
          soon as the exit is clear.

                         ALEX
          I just want to show you something.
          Worked by the combination of natural curiosity and Alex's
          charm; the repo man pops the trunk and gets out of the
          still-running car.

          The repo man ignores him and looks in the trunk.

          So are you. Drink it with the kid.
          Teach him what smooth is. Enjoy

          The bolt cutters clip through. The chain falls.

          cruises by.

          Alex turns into the garage of an expensive condominium
          building before the gate has slid all the way open. The

          hair, is filing barbs off a pile of fishing hooks on the
          center island. He looks harder and wiser than his years.
          Tackle is strewn everywhere. Some spaghetti remains in
          the pot it was cooked in and Jason's knife is standing
          upright in it. Alex walks into the kitchen. He makes an
          effort to be pleasant, although he's irritated by the
          mess, by the motorcycle.

                         SUZANNE
          is a pretty young woman in her late thirties with a sense
          of humor and irony. She's chemically relaxed, but not
          stupefied. She pulls a robe around herself, modest in
          front of her son; and although her body's not spectacular,
          like Gabriella's, she has a trim. athletic build.

                         JASON
          It's not an argument.

                         ALEX

          He hangs his towel on a doorknob, slides into bed, starts
          the tape, which begins with sweat-slick dancing girls at
          Carnival. To Suzanne's astonishment, it turns out to be
          a travelog.

          I've been so busy. We could sneak
          away for a week.. Would you like
          that?

          The beaches -- I thought we had a
          beach. I read how the hotels keep
          spotters on the roof with scopes, to
          keep thieves away from the guests.
          They can look at every inch of your
          body through the scope.
          (with a low laugh)
          Do you mind that I like that? Alex?
          He has fallen asleep. Tenderly she draws the sheet to his
          shoulder and settles down to watch the rest of the tape.

          14 EXT. BOAT - DAWN 14

          On the flying bridge of an old fishing boat, Jason eases
          the throttle to idle speed. The engine quiets down. The
          SWELLS SLAP harder against the wooden sides. The boat
          dips and dances to the music of the water.
          Jason swings down the ladder. He sets up his linis to
          troll. The starry dome of the sky is starting to brighten
          around its rim. Jason leans on the transom and stares at
          the flat, silvery wedge of wake. He breathes out a word.

          Nothing happens. He doesn't move. Then the top of one of
          the rods shivers slightly, goes still. Jason delicately
          fingers the rod like a blind man reading Braille, to feel
          for vibration. A smile pulls at his mouth. He steps
          behind the rod. The fish hits.

          Time to go to work, man! C'mon.
           A tall, black drifter appears from-below, still yawning,
          scratching. HENRY, 33. He wears a red Panama hat that's
           weathered his head for some time.

                         HENRY
          Who we got?

                         JASON
          Let's find out.
          He hauls back on the rod, the line rises from the ocean,
          they both recognize the fish at the end.

                         HENRY
          Fucking sharks. Miami's fished out
          of the good stuff. Damn.
          He spits over the side. Jason grins.

                         JASON
          This one's got more to worry about
          than you do.
          He starts to reel in the fish. Henry moves to the wheel.-

                         HENRY
          Just shoot 'Jaws' in the water. I
          want to know the sucker's good and
          dead 'fore he sets a fin in my boat.
          You got a barb on that hook? .

          And what makes you think fifty-fifty

          see the negotiation from a distance.

          17 EXT. DOCK - DAY (MINUTES LATE) 17

          Jason and Henry walk through the hubbub.

          The Chinese CHEF in the busy, steamy kitchen is inspecting
          the shark fins Jason has brought him. Jason is anxious to
          finish business and go.

                         CHEF
          You no like my company? Fine. Who
          cares. Bring me more fin, you
          retire. You no want to retire?
          Good. Don't charge starving Chinese
          so much for these things.

                         JASON
          You ever caught a shark?

          Lemme -- lemme show you something.
          Jason pulls up the sleeve of his denim jacket to display
          a fresh gash across his arm.

                         JASON
          He was already gaffed onto the side
          of the boat, good as dead. Two
          hours dead! And I was still too
          close to the mouth. Revenge is the
          last instinct to go, did you know
          that?
          The chef shrugs and shows his thumb, missing a joint.

                         CHEF
          -- Work's a dangerous thing.

          He tosses the fins in a cauldron of boiling water, slaps
          the CASH REGISTER on the side. It RINGS.

          Jason has fallen asleep while Alex drives. Alex picks up
          Jason's hand. Jerking awake, Jason tries to pull away,
          but his reflexes are sleep-slowed. Alex sniffs Jason's
          fingers, wrinkles his nose, lets Jason have his hand back.

                         ALEX
          You stink.

                         JASON

          Jason opens the compartment, finds the packets, opens one,
          rubs his hands.

                         ALEX
          ... I'm trying here, Jason -- I
          really am. When you didn't want to
          go to college, I took your side, I
          said fine -- I mean, I -didn't finish
          college, and I've done all right.
          I gave you a job', a steady check,
          which is more than anybody else has
          done. And what do I get back?
          Shit. I've tried to teach you the
          business -- the care, the finesse...

          A sleek, ocean-going yacht is tied up at the dock, the
          crew unobtrusively at work. FRANK REESE, a powerful,
          confidant man in his mid-sixties, is sitting with his
          INSURANCE AGENT at a table on deck where policies are
          spread out next to a jewelry box. Reese's expensive 35-
          year-old wife DINA has turned her chair to sun her legs
          while she plays with the BABY.

                         DINA
          -- what's the point of having it, if
          I can't wear it, Frank?

          Mrs. Reese -- except out of the
          country.
          Gabriella leads Alex and Jason aboard. Frank likes Alex
          and is glad to see him. Alex can't help glancing at
          Dina's long legs.. She smiles.

                         AGENT
          How much wine are we talking about?
          Jason follows Gabriella down below, the VOICES on the deck
          fading.

          DINA (O.S.)
          Why bother insuring it? Let's drink
          it instead.

          It's quiet inside, not tasteful but impressive, like
          everything else of the Reeses. Jason takes a stab at
          conversation.

                         JASON
          Big boat.
          Gabriella laughs and looks over her shoulder at him.
          They're both kids.

                         GABRIELLA
          ugly, isn't it.
          He grins and relaxes, looks around.

                         JASON
          The fittings are definitely -- yeah
          on the ugly side. But damn, she's
          solid.

                         GABRIELLA
          Oh, a boat type.

                         JASON
          (proud, defensive)
          I like.boats.
          Gabriella shows him the climatized, built-in wine closet
          next to the galley. He starts to rack the bottles while
          she watches. He talks to stop her from leaving.

                         JASON
          So where you headed?

                         GABRIELLA
          I'm not going, 'I can't go.

                         JASON
          They don't want to take the baby.

                         GABRIELLA
          Iâ¢don't have a green card, I can't
          leave the country. Baby goes with
          an American nurse. I house-sit.
          It's fine.

                         JASON
          You don't like them.
          Gabriella laughs.

          like working for people, but that's
          life.
          He chafes under authority the same way she does.

                         JASON
          Doesn't have to be.

                         GABRIELLA
          Maybe not with a rich stepfather.
          He laughs.

                         JASON
          Worst kind.

                         GABRIELLA

                         (CORRECTIVELY)
          No.

                         (A BEAT)
          You don't appreciate what you have,
          Jason. It's very poor where I came
          from.

                         JASON
          Where's that?

                         GABRIELLA
          Venezuela. Do I look it?

                         JASON
          I don't know, I never been there.

                         GABRIELLA
          Well, I don't. My mother's Indian.
          The India kind of Indian.

                         (LAUGHS)
          Imagine a house where the father
          asks 'What's for dinner' in Spanish,
          and the mother answers 'Curry' in
          Hindi. 'Que hay para cenar' she
          says, 'Murgee, masala, ghaal.' He
          says, 'No es importante.' No wonder
          I'm nuts.

                         JASON
          You don't seem too nuts.
          She laughs.

          29 EXT. BOAT, THE DECK - DAY

           The agent is putting a magnificent diamond necklace in a
          velvet pouch that he fastidiously cinches and ties.
          Alex looks away from it to take a bottle out of the
          remaining case on deck.

                         AGENT
          -- so back to the safe it goes --
          Dina lifts up the baby and smells its bottom.

                         FRANK
          Dina, that's disgusting.

                         DINA
          The alternative is using your
          fingers, Frank. which offends you
          more?
          Alex laughs. Frank pushes back his chair.

                         FRANK
          Don't encourage her, Alex. Her
          mouth is big enough.
          Dina is hurt.

                         FRANK
          (to the agent)
          I'll show you that painting in our
          stateroom.
          The agent follows him away.

                         ALEX
          (kindly; to Dina)
          Do you want to see the label?
          She hides her hurt by not looking at him.

                         DINA
          Just open the bottle, Alex. Pour us
          both a glass. I'm not allowed to
          drink alone.
          When she turns her head and looks at him, she's flirting.

          30 INT. BOAT - DAY

          Jason has almost finished storing the wine. Gabriella is
          sitting on a bar stool at the galley,. listening to him,
          snared by the quiet passion in his voice.

                         JASON
          -- when you're skimming along the
          water, nothing between you and the
          bottom of the sea but a layer of
          wood, your thoughts... end. All
          that noise inside your head?
          Gabriella nods, understanding exactly.

                         JASON
          . . . Stops.
          Dina's VOICE booms over the INTERCOM, startling both of
          them. The BABY is FUSSING. Gabriella makes a gesture of
          apology to Jason.

          DINA (V.O.)
          Gabriella? Are you down there?

                         GABRIELLA
          Yes, Mrs. Reese.

          DINA (V.0.)
          The baby needs you. And bring a
          pacifier for Frank.

                         GABRIELLA
          Right there.
          She slides off the stool.

                         JASON
          You should come out with me
          sometime.
          She smiles without answering and goes topside. His eyes
          follow her. A Deckhand comes down the ladder with the
          remaining case of wine for him to stock.

          31 EXT. BOAT - DAY 31

          Gabriella. lifts the fussy baby from Dina, her hands sure
          and calming. She coos nonsense to his little ear as she-
          reaches for the diaper bag and slings it over her arm.

                         GABRIELLA
          He.'s ready for his nap.

          Frank and the agent return from another section of the
          boat.

                         FRANK
          You doing up to the house,
          Gabriella?
          (off her nod)
          Want to take this with you?
          He sweeps the policies into a large manila envelope, drops
          the 'pouch in with them, ties the string, hands it to her.

                         FRANK
          Put it on my desk.
          He looks at his wife with her glass, Alex with his glass,
          and doesn't like it. His voice hardens slightly.

                         FRANK
          Are we all set, Alex?

                         ALEX
          I'm going to check the storage room,
          see what else'll travel. I know I
          put some vintage Armagnac in there,
          maybe some Porto?
          He heads down the gangplank.

                         FRANK
          He's a vendor, Dina. It's like
          drinking with the help.

                         DINA

                         (DISARMING HIM)
          Did you pick the wine, sweetie?
          It's lovely.
          Frank grins, pleased. His hand curves around her
          shoulder. He has forgotten about the other vendor
          present, the agent.

                         AGENT

                         (AWKWARDLY)
          So I'll messenger over the rider for
          your signature --
          Frank laughs out loud, in a better mood:

                         FRANK
          -- You still here?
          Dina laughs, too.

          Gabriella settles the baby on his side, the only Reese she
          likes. She starts to close the shutters. Lullaby MUSIC
          is playing on the baby's TAPE DECK.

          IN THE HALLWAY
          She closes the nursery door as softly as possible. A
          man's hands go around her throat. Her gasp dies
          stillborn. It's Alex, kissing her.ear, holding Dina's
          diamond necklace to her neck.

                         ALEX

                         (MURMURING)
          Did he ever come on to you?

                         GABRIELLA

                         (ANGRY)
          Don't sneak up on me that way!

                         ALEX
          Look how beautiful you are. He's an
          idiot if he didn't.
          Now she sees the necklace.

                         GABRIELLA
          What are you doing?
          She snatches the necklace away from him and fairly runs
          down the hall to Frank's study.

          IN THE STUDY
          She tries td stuff it in the pouch. Alex is right behind
          her.

                         GABRIELLA
          You're going to get me fired and
          deported.

                         ALEX
          Just put it on for a minute. Look
          at yourself.
          She slaps at his hands half-heartedly, but it's so
          tempting.

                         ALEX
          See what you deserve.

                         GABRIELLA

          Alex moves her hair away. She lets him hook the necklace
          around her neck. He reaches over to open the closet door,
          fitted out now as a file cabinet, but with the original
          closet mirror still in place. The safe is visible.
          Gabriella stares at her reflection, Alex behind her,
          watching her. The necklace changes her posture. She
          angles her chin slightly, twists back her hair. Diamonds
          suit her.

                         GABRIELLA

                         (TITILLATED)

          Not against your skin.
          He starts to pleat her T-shirt loose from her jeans. She
          doesn't resist. They watch each other in the mirror.

          JASON (O.S.)
          -- Alex? They're waiting for you!
          Alex blows out a frustrated breath.

                         ALEX
          Ah... shit...
          He hurriedly unhooks the necklace and puts it back in the
          pouch, gathers up the insurance papers and Polaroids that
          had spilled and slides them back in the envelope with the
          pouch.' Gabriella is tucking in her T-shirt. She closes
          the closet door.
          Jason's VOICE is closer, more impatient, at the bottom of
          the stairs.

          JASON (O.S.)

          Alex appears at the top of the stairs, surprising Jason.

                         ALEX
          I was in the bathroom.
          He walks down the stairs. A wooden case of liquor is by
          the terrace doors, where he left it.

                         ALEX
          Give me a hand, will you? I'm not

          He goes out the door ahead of Jason, leaving him to carry
          the case. Jason hears a DOOR CLOSE upstairs as he lifts
          the case. He looks up.

                         HIS POV
          Reflected in the tall entry mirror, Gabriella's back as
          she walks away down the hall.

          A poker game is breaking up. Five players, Alex among
          them. He's done all right. DAVE -- an older man -- has
          lost. He tosses down his cards.

                         DAVE

          Dave. So do I. Or else why get up
          in the morning.
          VICTOR SPANSKY neatly stacks his modest winnings. He's
          tall, thick-shouldered, 55, with a gray crew-cut, tinted
          glasses, and a smoker's cough. He does nothing in a
          hurry.

          sits down at the table with a
          loser's attitude... loses even if he

          He pushes his cash forward into a pot with Alex's. Alex

          He pulls a card -- he has good hands -- and turns it up.
          A king of spades. A smile tugs at his mouth.

          slowly reaches out and picks it up.

                         VICTOR
          Very pretty. I remember when it
          was the cover of the auction
          catalogue. The Duchess of Windsor's
          baubles. Bought for a young wife,
          I remember. Who I'm sure worked
          just as hard as the Duchess.

          Are you coming?

          Alex climbs the open stairs, heads down the cantilevered
          walkway, knocks at Victor's door.
          For an instant Alex doesn't recognize the uniformed
          repairman who opens it: Victor, disguised.

                         VICTOR

                         (TICKLED)

          45 INT. APARTMENT - DAY

          By daylight the apartment looks shabby.

                         VICTOR
          I think I look younger, don't you?

                         ALEX
          You look ridiculous.

                         VICTOR
          Fine. I don't have an ego.

          Victor opens the front door.-

                         VICTOR
          After you.
          As Alex walks toward the door, he catches sight of a free-
          standing hospital respirator in the bedroom. He looks at
          Victor, who waits for him with an unchanging smile. They
          go out together.

          stops him, opens the driver's door.

          48 EXT. GATE - DAY 48

          Alex goes into the booth, finds the appointment board,
          checks off "Gates Wine -- Repair," and presses a button
          that opens the gate.

          49 INT. CADILLAC - DAY 49

          Alex slides back behind the wheel. Victor is resting his
          head on the back of the seat.

                         VICTOR
          Brilliant, Alex. We've violated the
          law before we even get started.

          There's no answer. Alex rings it again.

                         VICTOR
          Tell me we're at the wrong house.
          Alex raises a hand to wave, Victor turns.

          Don't flip the gate like that.

                         ALEX
          I was helping you out. I checked
          off the appointment, didn't you see
          it?
          He rings the doorbell again.

                         MIKE
          They sailed out this morning.

                         ALEX
          I know., but the nanny's supposed to
          be here --
          Victor rolls his eyes, unseen. The nanny.

                         MIKE
          -- The Venezuelan? They fired her.
          (with a snigger)
          Don't pay to be too good-looking in
          these jobs.
          Victor interrupts the gossip. He -sounds exactly like a
          repairman.

                         VICTOR
          I got a schedule to keep, Mr_ Gates.

          You don't have papers, they don't

          What are you doing?

          His uniform is crisp, and his nature is alert and
          suspicious.

                         MIKE
          The valve's stuck.

                         GUARD
          That's the sprinkler valve.
          Mike climbs out of the bushes with injured dignity.

                         MIKE
          Okay, you do it.

          59 INT. FRANK'S OFFICE - DAY

          Victor, wearing surgical gloves, is in the file closet
          cracking the safe. He has re-wired the alarm wire with
          electrical clips to avoid breaking the circuit. He smears
          the sweat off his forehead and leans back in close to the
          dial, rotating it carefully back and forth until the
          tumblers fall. It opens. victor sifts through papers,
          foreign currency.

          ALEX (O.S.)

                         (CALLING OUT)
          Harold?
          Victor hears the FOOTSTEPS coming up the stairs. He keeps
          searching, but the pressure tells, and his breathing
          becomes a wheeze.

                         60

          60 INT. LANDING - DAY

          The new guard follows Alex onto the landing. They hear a
          DOOR SHUT. The guard instinctively touches his gun.

                         ALEX
          Down there, wasn't it?
          The guard doesn't let him change direction.

          victor drops down onto the stepstool in front of them as
          they round the corner.

                         (BREEZILY)
          You can turn the water back on.
          It's not the pipes.
          Wearing work gloves, he repositions the hatch cover.

                         GUARD
          Nobody's supposed to be in the house
          unaccompanied.

                         ALEX
          Is that our fault?

                         GUARD

                         (GRUDGINGLY)
          No.

                         ALEX
          All right, then.
          The guard glances up at the hatch. In that moment victor
          winks at Alex; he scored.

          62 EXT. HENRY'S BOAT-- DAY 62

          Jason drops anchor in turquoise waters off a sand bar, no
          other boats around. Gabriella takes in the idyllic
          surroundings.

                         JASON
          You can learn on the fish around
          here, but you can't eat 'em.
          They're junk fish.

                         GABRIELLA
          Will you teach me?
          He laughs.

                         JASON
          Oh, you think you're ready for that
          kind of commitment?

          I'm only investing an afternoon.
          She takes in the landscape, breathing in the lovely
          isolation.

                         GABRIELLA
          Where are we?

                         JASON
          My father used to bring me here.
          She hears something in his tone.

                         (GENTLY)
          No more?
          Jason concentrates on securing the boat.

                         JASON
          He's dead. He drowned in a storm.
          She shivers involuntarily.

                         JASON
          He was a fisherman.

                         GABRIELLA
          I don't know if I would like boats
          after that.
          He smiles.

                         JASON
          I feel close to him when I'm on the
          water.

                         GABRIELLA
          How old were you?

                         JASON
          -- Eight. I'd just turned eight.
          She takes his hand. He tightens his fingers through hers
          and looks out at the horizon, trying to control the
          emotions her sympathy has roiled. Gabriella senses this.
          She puts her arms around him, kisses him on the cheek.
          They stand, holding each other. Then Jason, on impulse,
          kisses her on the lips.

          The KEY is heard in the LOCK, the door opens, Victor and
          Alex come in, giddy with success. Reverentially, Victor
          unpacks-the necklace and holds it up for them both to
          admire; the object of desire.

                         VICTOR

          the fire. Hold it up to the light.
          He hands the necklace to Alex, who lifts it up to look at
          it. Victor reaches into a drawer. In itHttheeree'ss a gun

          I always take a photograph of the
          goods. To avoid any disagreement in
          the sale. The insurance photo is
          hopeless. You ask yourself how do
          they stay in business.
          Alex advances on him.

                         ALEX

          Alex is closing on him. His voice is low and menacing.

          Give me the film, Victor._
          victor's hand glides into the drawer. Alex sensibly stops
          short.

          ticket, which he gives to Alex.

          Jason is standing behind Gabriella, helping her cast. His
          arm grazes her breast.

                         ONTO
          He reels the line out of the water. Gabriella climbs
          the rail. She's barefoot. The breeze blows her thin
          dress against her legs.

                         HEY

          The store is closed. Robert has gone home. Alex opens
          the cash drawer and takes out all the money, fattens his
          wallet. He spies the message from Gabriella. He reads
          it, picks up the phone, punches in the number she wrote.

                         ALEX
          ... May I speak with Gabriella?
          Puedo hablar con Gabriella?

          Jason is sprawled half across Gabriella on the deck of the-
          boat, a seat cushion under her head. He has his hand in
          her panties. She clutches his wrist and pulls his hand
          back into sight. He lifts his head to look at her.

          No, you're not.
          She scrambles to her feet.

          He stands up and moves to the helm, his legs stiff with
          injured dignity.
          Gabriella sits down on the bench, the cushion clutched in
          front of her.
          Jason sneaks a look back at her. With her hair wet and
          her makeup washed away, she looks younger than he does.
          She's resting her chin on the edge of the cushion.
          He switches on the engine and eases the boat forward over
          the anchor, engages the power winch. The CHAIN starts to

          CLANK.

                         JASON
          I'm sorry.
          She turns her head toward him.

          The dinner hour. The table in the mean little house is
          too crowded and too noisy; the television on the buffet
          can hardly be heard. Gabriella's Cousin and her Husband
          are arguing in Spanish, in a good-natured marital way, the
          Kids too busy teasing each other to notice. One Kid gets
          up to raise the volume on the TV set even louder.
          Gabriella carries her plate into the kitchen to escape the
          noise. The Husband makes a gesture to his Wife that says
          Gabriella's snooty.

          I got your note. Fuck the
          Reeses. We're taking a trip, honey.
          Pack a bag. I'll pick you up in an

          The tension drains from her face; rescued.

                         GABRIELLA
          Where are we going?

          ALEX (V.O.)
          Does it matter?

          Ohio.

                         GABRIELLA
          Sure.

          ALEX (V.0.)
          Don't worry, it's not Ohio.
          She laughs.

          72 INT. SUZANNE'S CAR - NIGHT 72

          Suzanne turns onto their street, pulls into the garage.
          She sees Alex's Cadillac already parked.

          73 EXT. CAR - NIGHT 73

          She locks her car and walks toward the elevator, carrying
          a department store shopping bag. The garage is darker
          than she likes. Her HEELS ECHO against the cement walls.
          She walks a little faster.

          74 INT. CONDO - NIGHT 74

          Suzanne lets herself in. Alex didn't set the alarm. She
          sets the bag on the couch, next to his jacket. She's been
          a wife too long not to tidy up after him. She picks up
          the jacket to brush it and hang it correctly, and glimpses
          the airline tickets tucked in the inside pocket. Suzanne
          smiles, moved. The tickets to Rio. She takes a peek to
          see the dates. Her face changes. She drops the jacket in
          a heap on the floor. She hears ALEX MOVING around in the
          bedroom above and starts up the stairs, her rage climbing
          with every riser. She can hear him HUMMING.

          75 INT. MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT 75

          Alex zips his passport into an outside compartment where
          he can reach it. He has almost finished packing. As he
          reaches for his underwear, he startles. Suzanne is
          leaning against the door frame.

                         SUZANNE

                         (CONTROLLED)
          Where are you going?
          Alex recovers quickly.

                         ALEX
          Napa. I got a problem with a
          supplier. Boutique wineries --
          they're all owned by ex-lawyers.

                         SUZANNE
          Via New York?
          She holds up the tickets.

                         ALEX
          I need to see the wholesaler.

                         SUZANNE
          You're amazing, you really are. Now
          how are you going to explain 'Miss
          Vasquez?'

                         ALEX
          Honey, I don't have to. I will, out
          of courtesy. It's Mrs., and she's
          fifty years old, Suzanne. She's the
          agent.

                         SUZANNE
          God, I could even believe you, if I
          wanted to.

                         ALEX

                         (HARDER)
          I don't want to fight with you on my
          way out the door. I don't have time
          for this.
          Yanking the tickets out of her hand before she can react,
          he pushes past her with his bag. She follows him down the
          stairs.

                         SUZANNE
          I put Terry's life insurance money
          into that store -- and you spend it
          on your goddamn girlfriends while my
          checks bounce.
          Alex whirls around at the bottom of the stairs.

                         ALEX
          I worked my ass off for you with
          that store. Eight years of twelve-
          hour days and one-day weekends! So
          don't tell me I haven't treated you
          well.

          He picks his jacket up off the floor and shrugs it on.
          Suzanne snatches his car keys off the coffee table.
          Infuriated, he grabs for his keys, but she holds them away
          behind her back.

                         SUZANNE
          -- You're going to talk to me!

                         ALEX
          When I get back.

                         SUZANNE
          With more of your fucking lies! I
          hate you! Wasting my
          (slapping at his arm
          with her free hand)
          -- life!

                         ALEX
          Sssh, calm down --
          She tries to slap him again, but he gets hold of her hand.

                         ALEX
          -- Give me my keys, I need my keys.
          I don't want to hurt you.

                         SUZANNE
          That's all you ever do!
          He twists her hand up behind her back, forcing her onto
          the sofa.

                         SUZANNE
          Go to hell!
          He smothers her into the cushion and twists her hand up
          and up. She grips his keys tighter.

                         ALEX
          (breathless from the

                         STRUGGLE)
          Open your hand, Suzanne.
          Pinning her down, he painfully pries open her fingers.
          She drives her elbow into his face.

                         SUZANNE
          You sonofabitch!
          He hits her back, her nose starts to gush, the keys drop
          to the-floor. He bends to pick them up. Suzanne seizes
          a standing metal ashtray and savagely swipes him across
          the temple.

          The blow sends him sprawling to the floor; he doesn't
          move. She is stunned by what she has done. In a panic
          she races up the stairs, the heel of her hand to her nose
          to staunch the bleeding.

                         76

          76 INT. MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT

          Suzanne spills everything out of Alex's suitcase and
          starts throwing in her own clothes, blood-spotting them in
          her haste.

                         77

          77 INT. JASON'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

          Suzanne jerks out his drawers so fast that she dumps them
          on the floor. She pulls his suit out of the closet along
          with an armful of other clothes.

          78 INT. CONDO, STAIRS - NIGHT 78

          Suzanne drags two suitcases clattering down the stairs.

                         ALEX
          hasn't moved. Suzanne drops to her knees beside him and
          squeamishly lifts his wallet out of his pocket, snatches
          the cash, lets the wallet fall back beside him. Her
          breathing is so rapid and shallow it sounds like whimpers.

          79 EXT. CONDO - NIGHT 79

          Suzanne backs out the door pulling the suitcases, right
          into Jason. She cries out in fright.

                         JASON
          -- Hey, hey.

          80 INT. CONDO - NIGHT 80

          Ready to kill, Jason is shocked to see the job apparently
          already done for him. He bends over Alex to see if he's
          dead, and is equally sorry and relieved to find out he
          isn't.

          SUZANNE (O.S.)
          I won't wait for you!
          Jason takes the stairs two at a time.

          81 INT. JASON'S ROOM - NIGHT 81

          He yanks his map of the Gulf off the wall and grabs his
          fishing gear.

          82 INT. CONDO, DOWNSTAIRS - NIGHT 82

          Alex's unconscious body blocks the closet. door. Jason
          tries to open it anyway, but Alex is 'too heavy. Seizing
          hold of him, Jason drags him away from the door. The
          jewelry pouch spills out of Alex's pocket. Jason doesn't
          see it. The HORN BLARES, outside. Jason pulls his rod out
          of the closet. As he steps over Alex, he spots the pouch,
          the drawstring loose enough to let the necklace protrude.
          The HORN BLASTS again. Jason swoops up the pouch.

          83 EXT. CONDO.- NIGHT 83

          Jason runs for the car with his gear and climbs in.
          Suzanne peels away before the door is completely closed.

          84 INT. CAR - NIGHT (TRAVELING) - 84

          Jason and Suzanne. She can't look at him. She
          concentrates on her driving.

                         JASON
          What the hell happened in there?

                         SUZANNE
          Is he dead?

          He's already walking away. Concern and exasperation
          cancel each other; she goes inside.

          93 INT. JEWELRY STORE - DAY 93

          Jason approaches the cheerful, elderly JEWELER repairing
          an earring behind the case. The man puts away his smile.
          Jason's long hair and leather jacket offend him.

                         JASON
          My grandmother asked me to bring in
          a necklace of hers --
          Jason takes the velvet pouch out of his pocket, unlaces
          it, spreads out the necklace on the counter. He leans
          forward on his elbows while the jeweler examines it with
          a loupe. When the jeweler looks up, he's angry.

                         93 CONTINUED: 93

                         JEWELER
          Your grandmother lets you carry
          around a million dollars worth of
          jewelry? Go put it back where you
          found it.
          The jeweler pours the necklace back in the pouch, cinches
          it closed, slaps it on top of the case.

                         JASON
          -- Those aren't real diamonds.

                         JEWELER
          Tell your grandmother to bring it
          in.
          The jeweler BUZZES the door to release it. Jason grabs
          the velvet pouch, strides out.

          94 INT. RESTAURANT - DAY 94

          The WAITRESS unloads plate after plate on the table where
          Suzanne is waiting for Jason.

                         WAITRESS
          -- pan san, strawberry waffle, eggs
          over, side of wheat toast, ham
          steak, hash browns, fruit cup, two
          O.J.'s,, coffee, milk --

          Jason returns.

                         JASON
          We'll starve.
          The waitress laughs as she strolls away.

                         SUZANNE
          I'm hungry.
          He's worried about the jeweler.

                         JASON
          Let's pack it up, picnic on the
          beach someplace.

                         SUZANNE
          (with a grin)
          What a romantic.

          95 EXT. CAR - DAY 95

          As Jason and Suzanne reach the car, he sees the jeweler on
          the sidewalk now, outside the store, gesticulating to a
          sign painter.

                         JASON

                         MOM --
          He wants to tell her he took the necklace.

                         SUZANNE

                         (BREEZILY)
          -- No, 1111 drive.
          The jeweler happens to glance in their direction. Jason
          ducks into the car, unnoticed.

          96 EXT. PIER - DAY 96

          Jason and Suzanne are sitting on a small, rickety pier,
          eating from the takeout boxes open on their laps.

                         SUZANNE
          -- I feel... exhilarated.

                         JASON
          Adrenalin does that.

                         SUZANNE
          -- It ain't adrenalin, it's freedom.
          And she slips her wedding ring off her finger and hurls it
          overhand as far as she can. It drops into the sea.

                         SUZANNE

                         (EXULTANT)
          I don't want one goddamn thing of

                         HISS
          She eats with gusto. Jason is staring at the water.

                         JASON
          I can't believe you did that.

          97 INT. CAR - LATE DAY (TRAVEL?NG) 97

          Suzanne is driving now. She glances over at Jason
          sprawled low in the seat.

                         SUZANNE
          You're quiet.
          She doesn't think he's going to answer her.

          I didn't even say goodbye.

                         SUZANNE
          It'll work itself out. People
          manage. We're here. This is what
          you always wanted.

                         JASON
          -- How much money do we have?
          Suzanne doesn't reply.

          98 EXT. MOTEL - LATE DAY 98

          At the reception window Suzanne is checking in with the
          MOTEL OWNER, a solidly-built, ruddy woman in her fifties
          who shouldn't wear sleeveless blouses. Suzanne has her
          wallet open. Her fingers hesitate at the credit card.

                         OWNER
          There's a cash discount. Ten
          percent.

                         SUZANNE

                         (SMILING)
          Sounds like cash.
          She starts to count it out.

          99 EXT. MOTEL POOL - LATE DAY 99

          Ensconced at a table under an umbrella, Jason is writing
          on a paper towel.

          JASON (V.O.)
          Dear Gabriella. I don't know if
          you'll get this letter. I don't
          know if I'll send it. All I know is
          that for some reason I need to write
          it...

          SUZANNE AND THE OWNER
          cross the parking lot.

                         SUZANNE

                         (CALLING)
          Jase!
          He crumples the paper towel. She holds up the keys for
          him to see.

          I should have given you the king-
          size.
          Suzanne isn't offended.

                         SUZANNE
          He's my son.
          The owner gives her a startled glance.

                         OWNER
          You look great!
          Suzanne laughs.

          100 EXT. MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT 100

          Jason is sitting on the lawn chair outside the room door,
          working on his letter again under the yellow bug light.
          The Coke MACHINE HUMS noisily next to him.

          JASON (V.0.)
          That day on the boat made me realize
          I understand the sea better than I
          do the world.

          101 INT. MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT 101

          Suzanne stirs awake, disoriented, spooked.

                         SUZANNE
          Jason?
          She sits up in bed. Jason comes in from outside.

                         JASON
          I'm right here.
          Suzanne shoves her fingers through her damp hair, swallows
          to clear her voice.

                         SUZANNE
          ... I dreamed I was in jail. You'd
          come to see me, you were on the
          other side of the plastic -- like at
          the bank?. And you were talking, but
          I couldn't hear you. I put my ear
          to the holes and I couldn't hear
          you, but your mouth was moving.

          And then I realized you couldn't

          cords, like that dog next door.

                         JASON
          What dog?
          She lies down again.

                         SUZANNE-

          The. car speeds north. Alongside, the Gulf shimmers under
          the mirror of the sky.

          JASON (V.O.)
          -- I know what lure to use to catch
          any fish in the water, but what's
          the lure for a woman? Truth? Lies?

          A tint combed through her hair, the plastic cap tied in a
          rakish bow, Suzanne lays out what remains of her cash by
          denomination. She records the amount in a pocket notebook
          she's using as a ledger.

          Jason is fishing.

          JASON (V.0.)
          -- I caught a fish that had three
          hooks grown through his lips. Three
          times he'd gotten away. He kept
          taking the hook.

          Jason is gutting and skinning his catch.

          JASON (V.0.)
          It occurs to me that you're the
          fisherman, not me. I can feel the
          tension of the line. I've taken the
          hook just like he did.

                         CUT TO:

          A MAP OF THE GULF 106
          Coastal towns have been crossed out, one after the other.

          107 INT. MOTEL ROOM - DAY 107

          Alex, stitches in his head, pores over the map while
          Victor talks on the phone. He circles a new town on the
          Gulf, farther north.

          No, I'm consulting for the
          insurance company, isn't life
          strange? -- Love and kisses.
          He hangs up. His cheeriness vanishes. He coughs, more
          like a gag, and heads for the bathroom.

          108 INT. BATHROOM - DAY 108

          Victor spits blood in the sink. Then, after catching his
          breath, squirts medicine down his throat with his inhaler,
          exits.

          chocolate on the pillows. My

          That's not fair. The plan was for
          you to move the necklace. I
          wouldn't have had the goddamn thing.
          Come on... sit down... try to relax.
          He reaches for victor's cigarettes and crumples the
          package in his fist. Victor looks at his ruined smokes.

          114 INT. STORE - DAY 114

          Jason scans the case as he approaches the JEWELER.

          JEWELER.
          Help you?

                         JASON
          Do you buy estate diamonds?

                         JEWELER
          Sure.
          Jason takes out a zip-lock bag and lays it on the counter,
          one of the diamonds inside. The jeweler takes it out with
          respect and holds it under his loupe. If Jason's nervous,
          it doesn't show.

                         JASON
          It belonged to my mother.
          The jeweler's heard every version. He doesn't care.

                         JEWELER -
          .Price is the same. I can give you
          eighty-five hundred.

          115 EXT. BEACH - DAY 115

          The classified section already folded and marked beside
          her, Suzanne has propped herself on her elbows. She's
          looking out to sea. Talking heads bob like buoys, the
          waders. She notices, some distance away, a man in a suit
          walking along the beach. The image amuses her. He's
          moving in her direction. She finally recognizes Jason and
          raises her hand.

                         SUZANNE

                         (CALLING OUT)
          Hey, sailor...
          She puts on her hat to cut the glare. From under the brim
          she admires his approach.

                         SUZANNE
          (as he reaches her)
          ... Look at you. What's the
          occasion?
          Jason squats down beside her and balls up the classifieds.

                         JASON
          You don't need another grab-ass job.
          I been out talking to peoplel

          There's charter outfits a coupla
          towns up the coast. (NAMES OF
          TOWNS). They need skippers, they
          need crews.
          She stands up, brushes off the sand, rolls up her towel.

                         SUZANNE
          So we're packing.
          They start walking together. From the water a MAN calls
          out to Suzanne.

                         MAN
          Hey, I thought you were coming back
          in.
          She smiles and waves goodbye.

                         SUZANNE
          ... Too bad. I kinda liked that

                         GUY-
          She and Jason keep walking. He no longer looks like a
          boy.

          116 INT. BAR - NIGHT

          Alex is smelling his brandy in a booth. He looks
          defeated. Victor swings onto a bar stool. He takes out
          a wallet photo of Suzanne and Jason and passes it across
          to the BARTENDER.

                         VICTOR
          Seen them, by any chance?

                         BARTENDER
          Why are you asking?

                         VICTOR
          My wife and son. He's been selling
          fish around these parts.
          He's totally believable. The bartender feels for his pain
          and takes another look at the photo, shakes his head no.

                         BARTENDER
          She's a little classier than our
          usual clientele, y'know?

                         VICTOR
          Maybe you could pass it down anyway.

          The bartender takes the photo.

                         BARTENDER
          Sure, man.

                         VICTOR
          joins Alex in the booth. Victor raises his hand. Alex
          instinctively pulls his head back.

                         VICTOR
          Don't move.
          He leans across the table and plucks the last stitch out
          of Alex's wound. Alex winces.

                         VICTOR
          It's been irritating me all day.
          Did I hurt you?
          Threat implied. Alex stares him down.

          MALE VOICE (O.S.)
          Hey, I know this kid --
          Alex and victor glance over to the bar and see Henry.
          He's looking at the photo Victor passed around.

                         HENRY
          Hunches a catch like a depth finder.
          Victor is already out of the booth.

          VICTOR AND HENRY
          Henry senses money to be made.

                         HENRY
          Who are you?

                         VICTOR
          His father.

                         HENRY
          I thought his father was dead.
          (shaking his head)
          Well, you look bad all right, but
          not dead.

                         VICTOR

                         (DEFENSIVELY)
          Hungover, that's all. I'm his
          stepfather.

                         HENRY
          (with a chuckle)
          Oh, man, now I see why he blew town.
          victor's insulted enough to lose his patience and his
          poise.

                         VICTOR
          The question before us is where did
          he go.
          Henry says nothing. He wants to be paid. Victor whips
          out a fifty-dollar bill from his top pocket. Henry
          reaches for it, but victor holds it back, wanting an
          answer first.

                         HENRY
          He wouldn't be on the Gulf. He
          hated the Gulf.
          Alex has moved up to the bar to listen behind him,
          unnoticed. He shakes his head at victor.

                         HENRY
          He's down in the Keys somewhere.
          Victor puts the fifty back in his own pocket. Henry
          stands aggressively.

                         HENRY
          That ain't cool in my book!
          In a swift, unexpected move, victor jams Henry back down
          on his bar stool. The bartender starts toward them. Alex
          slips out the door. The stool and Henry are toppling
          over. Victor catches them both, sets Henry upright.

                         VICTOR

                         (EVENLY)
          Now sit there,. and calm down.
          Victor is ill, but not weak. Henry looks away, the
          classic signal of submission.

                         VICTOR
          Thank you.

          Victor stares at him.

                         VICTOR
          I never understand your optimism.

                         ALEX
          Or he wouldn't have lied.

          HENRY (O.S.)

                         (TO VICTOR)
          I think you made a friend.
          Victor turns around, Alex keeps walking.

                         HENRY
          is in the doorway to the bar.

          Victor smiles.

          118 EXT. DRYDOCK - LONG SHOT - DAY 118

           From a distance we see Jason follow a beefy, jeans-wearing
           salesman into the building.

          119 ' INT. DRYDOCK - LONG SHOT - DAY 119

          The Salesman walks Jason past the vertical rows of boats,
          stacked from ceiling to floor, extolling the virtues of
          his stock. Jason inspects a modest boat, takes out cash.

          120 EXT. GULF - BOAT - DAY 120

          Jason is helming a classic wooden fishing boat, THE
          HERCULES II, old and not too big, but with good lines.
          He's purely happy.

          121 EXT. WATER - DAY

          Jason steers toward the beach and drops anchor. There's
          a cabin among the palmettos. No car.

                         122

          122 INT. CABIN - DAY

          Jason comes into the cabin.

                         JASON
          (just to be sure)
          Mom?
          The cabin is silent. He uses his fishing knife to pop
          loose a section of the cheap wall paneling. Behind it, a
          square of sheet rock has been sliced away between the
          studs to accommodate the pouch. He drops the pouch in his
          tackle box. A CAR is heard pulling up. Jason frantically
          starts to jam the paneling back in place. It won't hold.

                         123

          123 EXT. CABIN - DAY

          Suzanne takes a flat of geraniums out of the trunk and
          sets them on the porch. She opens the door.

                         124

          124 INT. CABIN - DAY

          Just as Suzanne steps through the screen door, Jason sees
          that his tackle box is open, the velvet pouch in plain
          sight. He kicks the top closed, bends to lock it.

                         SUZANNE

                         (CASUALLY)
          They'll think you stole it.
          He looks up at her, caught. She's walking toward the
          kitchen sink to wash the nursery dirt off her hands. She
          looks out the window at the boat again.

                         SUZANNE
          Nice boat.
          (over her shoulder)
          Are you allowed just to run around
          with it?
          'His tension ebbs. He picks up his tackle box.

                         JASON
          I forgot my tackle box.

                         SUZANNE

          Alex is sitting on the bed, dialing a number. He can see
          Victor shirtless in the bathroom. (His scars surprise

          She's greedily grateful to hear Alex's voice.

                         GABRIELLA
          -- Hi! I saw on the news there's
          rain in San Francisco. Are you wet

          Victor comes out of the bathroom. He's waiting for news.

          128 INT. CONDO - NIGHT 128

          She leans on the counter, flirting with his voice.

          ALEX (V.0.)

          Happy? Satisfied? I'm working.

          130 INT. CONDO - NIGHT 130

          His harsh tone unsettles her.

          I miss you.

          ALEX (V.O.)
          Are there any messages?
          She carries the phone to the counter where she keeps mail
          and any messages and starts to leaf through the stack.
          Her eye falls on a crumpled light blue envelope; she moves
          it out from the pile. It has been forwarded several
          times. And it's addressed to her.

                         GABRIELLA
          It's lonely here.
          There's no return address. She slits it open with her
          thumbnail. A trickle of sand falls out.

          ALEX (V.O.)
          What about the messages?

                         GABRIELLA

          She puts down the letter and quickly- finds the message
          memo.

                         GABRIELLA
          Here it is. Mr. Raines called from
          (NAME OF TOWN). He said you-Id know
          what it was about. Do you,- need the
          number?

          131 INT. MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT 131

          Sitting up, Alex signals success to Victor and writes down
          the number.

                         ALEX
          Thanks, honey. I'll call-you
          tomorrow. G'd'night .
          He hangs up, excited. Victor has already started to pack.

                         ALEX

                         (TO VICTOR)
          And you had no faith..

                         VICTOR
          I'll save the party hats until it's
          in our hands.

          132 INT. CONDO - NIGHT 132

          Gabriella is reading the second page of Jason's letter.

          JASON (V.0.)
          I look out at the flat blue sea, and
          the darker bl ue where the Gulf
          deepens and I want you next to me.
          â¢I want to walk across the. sugar sand
          and wade into the water with you
          until the current lifts us and
          floats us, nothing weighting us down --
          as'light and thoughtless as fish.
          Will I ever see you?... Love,:
          Jason.

          134 INT. CAR - DAY

          Victor and Alex kid each other without rancor for the
          moment.

                         ALEX -
          I miss the Cadillac. Top down. Air
          on.

                         VICTOR

                         (LAUGHING)
          You have pimp's tastes, Alex. At
          least my car's inconspicuous.
          Alex starts to get out. Victor doesn't.

                         ALEX
          You all right?

                         VICTOR
          A lot of these jewelers might know
          my face. It's risky.

                         ALEX
          How about for me?
          Victor takes out the photo of Alex with the necklace and
          holds it up for him.

                         VICTOR
          Nobody's seen this yet.

                         ALEX
          You're sick. I'll do it.
          Alex throws open the door and barrels out of the car.

          investigator.

          A seventeen-year-old kid waltzes in

          toenail, and you don't wonder?? You
          shouldn't have touched iti You know

          Victor and Alex are having a beer near the wide-screen TV.
          A game is on.

                         ALEX
          Smart lady. She lets Jason make the
          sale. They get caught, he's
          underage, and she don't know a
          thing. I gotta give her credit.

                         VICTOR
          You have interesting taste in women.
          Alex's gaze wanders to the game, but he can't get
          interested.

          138 INT. CAR - DAY (TRAVELING)

          Victor is driving, Alex reading the map. He circles a
          town name. Victor cranes to see it.

                         139

          139 EXT. DOCKS - LATE DAY

          A storm is blowing in, and Jason walks quickly along the
          docks to his boat and swings aboard.

          140 EXT. BOAT - LATE DAY

          The waves have already started to slap against the sides
          of the boat. Jason tosses over his fenders and secures
          them to protect the boat from the pilings. He starts
          toward the cabin. The lock has been popped. The door is
          slightly ajar. He hears a NOISE inside. He draws his
          knife.

                         141

          141 INT. CABIN - LATE DAY

          Jason throws open the door. A figure is bent over in the
          galley. It turns, and by the light of the refrigerator
          Jason recognizes Henry.

                         JASON
          Jesus, Henry... What the hell you
          doing?... How'd you know this was my
          boat??

                         HENRY
          I saw you cast off. Good little
          sport boat you got, too. Oh, whoa --
          hear that?

                         JASON

                         (PARANOID)
          Where -- what??
          Henry rubs his stomach.

                         HENRY
          Right here, man. I ain't been
          eating my share since my fishing
          partner ran off. Without so much as
          goodbye/good luck.
          Jason blows out a breath.

                         JASON
          It's complicated.

                         HENRY

                         (NODDING)
          Always is.
          The boat is rockirg now. The WIND has picked up. They
          hear the CLANKING and RUBBING of the other boats. Jason
          starts checking all the hasps and latches while Henry eats
          the sandwich he made.

                         JASON
          So why are you on the Gulf?

                         HENRY
          My baby finally sank on me. Right
          at the dock. I thought I'd work
          charter for awhile.
          (moving to help Jason
          with the latches)
          -- Need a crew?

                         JASON
          I don't know. Maybe.

                         HENRY
          That's not why I came looking for
          you.
          Jason is checking the engine. Out of Henry's sight, he
          surreptitiously reaches inside a hidden compartment.

                         HIS HAND
          wraps around the concealed pouch and withdraws, reassured.

                         JASON
          secures the engine hatch.

                         HENRY
          A guy offered me fifty bucks to tell
          him where you were. Sick old
          motherfucker. Big as God. Tried to
          say he was your stepfather.

                         JASON

                         (CAREFULLY)
          Maybe it was.

                         HENRY
          No, no, no, no -- this guy was not
          any kind of family man, if you know
          what I mean. So you're in some deep
          shit, because he wasn't a cop
          neither.

                         JASON
          -- What'd you tell him?
          Henry chuckles.

                         HENRY
          Lots of ways to make fifty bucks.
          Misunderstanding, Jason shoves him up against the counter.

          You gonna lean on me, Henry?? Is
          that the plan?
          Henry is hurt and offended.

                         HENRY

                         (WITH DIGNITY)
          No, man, I wouldn't stoop that low.
          And if I'd taken the fifty, I
          wouldn't have to be eating your
          shitbag sandwich neither.
          Jason steps back, ashamed of himself. He sits down to
          recover. Henry looks at him with a friend's concern.

                         HENRY
          You -- um -- you moving contraband,
          Jason?
          Jason shakes his head no.

                         HENRY
          This guy struck me as a serious
          problem.
          A few raindrops spatter the windows. Jason makes for the
          cabin door.

                         JASON
          Take care of the boat?

          Working behind the counter, Suzanne leans on her elbows,
          chatting up a customer. Jason comes through the back
          door. She turns.

                         JASON
          -- Mom, come on.
          He catches her hand and tows her toward the back door.

          leans back to see around the snack rack that blocked our
          view of him.
          It's Victor. A paper bag under his arm, he goes out the

           The rain is sheeting down. Cars fishtail slightly on the
           grease not yet washed from the streets.

                         VICTOR

          Suzanne is driving. 'Jason has told her. He glances at
          her sideways. She takes a long breath. The rain speeds
          up. She switches on the wipers.

                         SUZANNE
          ... I should have gone through his
          pockets myself. It didn't occur to
          me. I was in such a panic. If I'd
          found the necklace, Jason? I'd have

          -- I'm sorry.
          She glances in the rear view mirror. Headlights.

                         SUZANNE
          It's okay. I'm the one who hit the
          bastard.

                         HER POV
          A small bridge ahead is almost ready to pivot to let a
          boat pass. She stamps down on the gas pedal. The car

          opens.

          He brakes and calmly reverses in the rain.

          I just need to talk to her.

          The headlights turn onto the road.

                         SUZANNE
           hears his silence and looks back herself just as he looks

          truck HORN BLASTS.

                         SUZANNE
          -- Shit!
          She 'spins the wheel to avoid a head-on, but in so doing
          she clips the curb and loses control. She throws an arm
          across Jason to protect him.
           The car rolls onto its top, scraping across the road.

          153 EXT. SUZANNE'S CAR - NIGHT

          The upside-down car rips through a fence, slides down off
          the road. The engine dies. The only SOUND is the
          SPINNING back TIRE and the WINDSHIELD that now caves in.

                         154

          154 EXT. ROAD - NIGHT

          Victor swerves to the side of the road. Alex leaps out of
          the car and runs toward the wreck. Victor follows at a
          slower pace, opening his umbrella. He's still eating his
          apple. He sees a neighboring house light come on in
          response to the crash.

          AT THE WRECK
          Alex is trying to open the jammed door when Victor reaches
          him.

                         VICTOR
          We don't have much time.
          Through the window they can see Suzanne and Jason, both
          unconscious, limbs entangled, covered in glass. Suzanne
          is hemorrhaging from a gash in her side. Her leg twitches
          in spasm.
          Car headlights pass by on the road.

                         ALEX
          We need to get some help!

                         VICTOR

          slithers into the car. Victor calls in after him.

                         VICTOR
          Open the trunk, please.
           He walks toward the back.

          156 EXT. CAR - NIGHT

          The car is rocked far enough forward on its hood to enable
          the trunk to open. The contents cascade onto Victor. He
          starts his search, the apple gripped between his teeth.

          His own breathing noisy and shallow, Alex brushes the
          glass away from Suzanne's face.

                         ALEX
          -- Oh, Christ...
          He lifts her shirt to see how badly she's cut and presses
          the heel of his hand against the gash to try to stop the
          bleeding. Her blood spurts through his fingers. With his
          other hand he pats down her body.

                         (BARELY CONSCIOUS)

          same time.

                         ALEX
          I think he's okay, Suzanne. Just'
          tell me where it is.
          She can't answer. He opens the glove compartment and
          feels inside. He goes through her purse.

                         ALEX
          Goddammit!
          Leaning over the seat, he fumbles with her clothes. He's
          trying to make her comfortable.

          She whispers something. He leans in close.

                         ALEX
           What? --
          â¢ She mumbles something indecipherable. He puts his ear
          close to her mouth. The SIRENS are bearing down.

          Alex's feet pop out through the window. He's trying to
          shimmy himself backward out of the car, harder than going
          in, the principle of a lobster trap.

          163 INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY

          Jason resurfaces. Alex is half-asleep in the chair, his
          bloody clothes changed. The newspaper droops from his
          fingers. Jason's voice cracks from disuse.

                         JASON
          what are you...
          He swallows painfully. Alex smiles and gets up from the

          throws up his arm protectively. Jason tackles Alex under
          his guard, smashing him into the metal dresser. Alex's
          head snaps backward, cracking the mirror.

                         JASON

          Victor lays his cheek along the living room wall to

          He pops the paneling loose. His smile collapses. The
          niche carved between the'studs is empty. He rests his

          The room is empty, the bed stripped.
          Alex barrels out of the room to confront the tired young
          DOCTOR he sees walking down the hall.

          It was only a concussion. He's
          fine. He said you were in the

          The lights are off. He closes the door and starts up the
          stairs.

          IN THE HALLWAY
          His hand goes into his pocket as he advances on the master
          bedroom. He takes out his knife.

          He moves toward the bed.

                         JASON
          Wake up, Alex. I want to see your
          face.
          The sheets stir. Jason raises his knife to strike. But
          it isn't Alex in the bed, it's Gabriella. She lets out a
          strangled scream. He whips the sheet off her with his
          other hand. She's naked.

                         GABRIELLA
          Jason!
          (her eyes on his knife)
          -- Don't hurt me. Please.

                         JASON
          Where is he?

                         GABRIELLA
          He went to get you! He's not coming
          back until tomorrow.
          She timidly pulls the sheet over her body. Jason yanks it
          off her so hard it flaps loose from the corners. He
          touches her belly with the length of his knife, the blade
          â¢ flat to her skin. She freezes.

                         JASON
          His car's here.

                         GABRIELLA
          It's been here since he went to
          Napa.

                         JASON
          I keep hearing about Napa. Did you
          ever call him there?
          She shakes her head.

                         JASON
          You don't know where he was.

          the knife.

          GABRIELLA.
          Why would he lie to me?
          Ever so lightly Jason's fingertips find her skin.

                         JASON
          You didn't waste any time,. did you.
          You moved right in.

          GABRIELLA.
          You don't need the knife.. Put. the
          knife down.
          She knows men and children well enough to demand, not beg.
          Jason has almost forgotten he still. has the knife against
          her. He lifts it and folds it and puts it away.

                         JASON
          I'm going to wait for him, and. I'm
          going to kill him.
          His hand drifts along her body. She doesn't resist.

                         GABRIELLA
          They'll lock you up.

                         JASON
          Yeah.

                         GABRIELLA
          'Away from the sky and the air and
          the sea and the current running
          against the wind?' That was a very
          beautiful letter.
          Jason moves onto the bed, on his knees. beside her.

                         JASON
          Did you show it to him? You two
          have a laugh about it?

                         GABRIELLA
          I never mentioned itl
          Jason's hand curves around her throat,. a, caress, a threat.

                         JASON
          Did you tell him how to find: us-?
          Gabriella knocks his hand away from her throat.

                         JASON
          Sure, he did.

                         GABRIELLA
          He was glad she left.
          Jason lies down alongside her.

                         JASON
          He had us followed.

                         GABRIELLA
          W-why?
          He shrugs; he doesn't trust her.

                         GABRIELLA
          How do you know?
          She thinks grief has driven him crazy, and he sees that.

                         JASON
          I'm not crazy.
          Gabriella lays her hand over his on the bed, to comfort
          him.

                         GABRIELLA
          ... I'm so very sorry about what
          happened to your mother.
          His hand skitters away and lights on her ribs.

                         JASON
          Her loss, your gain.
          Furious, Gabriella forgets her caution. She slaps him
          hard enough to throw his head sideways. Jason rolls on
          top of her and pins her down.

                         JASON
          Her home, her bed -- her life.
          He lowers his mouth to Gabriella's neck. His kiss is
          surprisingly gentle. His knee works her legs apart.

                         GABRIELLA
          . Don't do this for revenge.

          Slowly, he kisses her. She lets her mouth respond: a
          sweet kiss, in spite of the circumstances.
          His fingers scissor her nipple.

                         JASON
          Just don't tell me that you love me.
          He peels off his T-shirt.

                         GABRIELLA
          (in a whisper)
          I love you.
          He gives her a hard look. She holds his gaze and pushes
          his jeans down until he finally kicks them off and they're
          both naked. They begin to make love.

                         GABRIELLA
          Wait.
          Jason doesn't understand. She gently pushes him back.

                         GABRIELLA
          This way.
          She turns on her stomach and guides him back into her.
          Jason moves now rapidly.

                         GABRIELLA
          Slowly.
          Her hand on his ass guides the pace. She hasn't had a
          young man in a long time.

                         GABRIELLA

                         (IN SPANISH)
          What are you doing to me?

                         (IN ENGLISH)
          Don't come, not yet.
          They move as one, their passion enveloping them.
          He makes her come first. Then, when her boay flattens, he
          also comes and he's lying on top of her, his face
          alongside hers, their breath gentling. Finally, they lie
          side.by side.

                         GABRIELLA

          While he runs the water to'warm it, he looks at himself
          naked in the mirror. His face crumples. He no longer
          knows what he's doing.

          He brings the towel back to Gabriella, who wipes herself.
          Her mood, too, has sobered.

          You'll have to. I'll know. I'll be
          a witness. I'll know you planned
          it.

                         JASON

          don't know how we live there.
          She pulls the pillow in front of her to hide her
          nakedness. He touches her shoulder; she shrugs him away.

          She stares at him. His face is set. She can't persuade

          (noticing her mouth)
          -- What happened to your mouth?
          Gabriella's hand jumps to her lip.

                         GABRIELLA
          Oh. -I bit my lip.
          He takes her lip between his and nuzzles it.

                         (TENDERLY)
          Where? Here?... Better?
          She tries to laugh and nods. He holds her close.

          184 INT. CONDO WEIGHT ROOM - DAY

          Jason is working out alone in the little gym when in the
          mirror he sees Alex come through the door. He keeps
          lifting. Alex sits down on the bench beside him. Jason
          ignores him.

                         ALEX
          You have something that belongs to
          .me, Jason -- and I want it back.

                         JASON
          It's not yours.

                         ALEX

                         (HARDER)
          Either way.
          Jason continues to lift. Finally:

                         JASON
          Did you know the thing's worth over
          a million dollars? What a fucking
          stupid way to spend money.

                         ALEX
          I was holding it for someone. These
          are dangerous people.

          The bar wobbles with Jason's laugh.. Alex moves behind and
          spots him, unnecessarily.

                         ALEX
          Don't screw around with me, Jason.
          He's in a position to crush Jason's windpipe. Jason
          shoves the barbell up in his face, finishing the set and
          re-racking. He reaches for his towel and wipes his face,
          his expression hidden.

                         JASON
          I don't know where it is anymore.
          You killed the only person who did.

                         ALEX
          It was an accident! What did I have
          to do with it?
          Jason wads up his towel and throws it at Alex.

                         JASON
          There was a car following us!

                         ALEX
          Did you see who was in it?
          Jason shakes his head no.

                         ALEX
          I met one of these guys. Tall,
          weird-looking fucker with.a gray
          crew-cut.
          (letting out a breath)
          These people you don't steal from.
          Whoever was following Suzanne is
          going to come after you, too.
          Haven't you figured that out?
          For the first time Jason wavers.; it's a plausible
          alternative, but one that makes him guilty instead.

                         JASON
          Who are they?
          Alex fastidiously drops the towel in the hamper.

                         ALEX
          Doesn't matter. Give the necklace
          back to me, and we'll split the
          handling commission.
          His ingratiating smile offends Jason. He doesn't trust
          Alex. He shakes his head.

          She never told me where she kept it.
          Alex doesn't believe him either. His hand. rests on a
          dumbbell, and for a murderous instant he's about to pick
          it up and use it on Jason. He lifts his hand away.

          Victor is lying on his bed, the respirator beside him,
          while he talks on the phone to Alex. He looks dreadful.

                         VICTOR
          Nice boy like that, the money means
          diddlyshit. And, personally, I
          suspect he'd rather die than tell
          you. So get a blowtorch, and use it
          on the girl until he cooperates.

          VICTOR (V.0.)
          .. Just as an example, Alex.

                         ALEX
          He's gonna make a move.

          VICTOR (V.0.)
          When he does, I'll be there.

                         ALEX

          He hangs up and rocks back in his chair.

           Victor attaches his mask, breathes in oxygen. He turns

          Gabriella has already gone to bed. The lights are off.
          Alex slides into bed beside her with a soft groan. He

          Wake up.
          She realizes he isn't going away. She rolls onto her
          back. Her arms go around him.- Alex kisses her, long and
          deep.

                         GABRIELLA
          Can he hear us?
          Alex's tone turns. Jason is causing him another problem.

                         ALEX
          I think he's probably figured out
          why we sleep in the same bed, Gabby.

                         Â¢ GABRIELLA
          He misses his mother.

          I wish she was alive and happy and

          against him. He tries again to interest her body.

          We need to go somewhere, just us.

          No.
          Alex scoots down next to her, his hand takes possession of
          her ass.

                         ALEX
          We'll stay at the Ritz, we'll eat

          restaurant in town -- a new dress
          every night -- would you like that?
          Gabriella laughs in wonder and turns onto her side to face
          him. They fit themselves together like an old married
          couple.

          They have tables at the casino where

          at a hundred bucks.

          You won't be able to afford it.

          the table to cover your bet, like
          James Bond.

          James had an expense account.
          He rolls onto his back, she lays her cheek on his graying
          chest. He no longer wants to make love.

          Fishermen he knows call out greetings. He hops onto a

          The reason I know is because I stole
          it from him.
          Her eyes widen.

                         VICTOR
          his face concealed among the candles is trying to figure
          out what drama is going on between Jason and Gabriella.
          He can read their faces, but not their lips.

          JASON AND GABRIELLA

                         GABRIELLA
          ... The sonofabitch. That's why he
          went out with me. He was trying to
          use me!
          (the thought hits her)
          They'll think I'm part of it! The
          maid who got fired??

                         JASON
          You weren't a maid.

                         GABRIELLA
          What difference does it make??

                         JASON

          199 EXT. MARKETPLACE - DAY

           Jason guns the motorcycle into the street, Gabriella holds
          him tight.
           Victor's car merges into traffic several cars behind them.

          victor is enjoying himself a bit. He fiddles with the
          RADIO, finds MUSIC he likes.

          Jason checks in his mirrors.

          IN THE MIRROR-
          He catches sight of victor's car, the same one that was
          following his mother.

                         JASON
          accelerates. Gabriella nuzzles his neck.

          203 INT. CAR - DAY (TRAVELING) 203

          Victor makes a face; he thinks he has been spotted. Jason
          is getting harder to follow. The music ends; An
          ANNOUNCER describes what it was, gives the time. There's
          a BEEP. The NEWS THEME starts up. "On the hour every
          hour, we give you all the news you need..." The announcer
          continues with the lead stories, including the recently-
          discovered jewel theft.

          Jason jams the motorcycle TOWARD us, PAST us. Behind,
          Victor's car suddenly squeals through a U-turn.

                         JASON
          looks back.

          205 INT. CONDO, LIVING ROOM - DAY 205

          The shutters have been closed, Alex is lying on the couch
          in the dark, having a nap. He's awakened by a nasty
          wheeze. Victor is standing over him.

                         ALEX
          A man with your breeding usually
          rings the doorbell.

          You heard the news.
          Victor pulls one of Alex's golf clubs out of the bag as
          though to admire it.

                         VICTOR
          I know you keep money here
          somewhere.

                         (A BEAT)
          Your stash. Give it to me.
          Alex spreads out his hands.

                         AALEX
          Vic, Vic --
          The golf club catches him in the midsection. Alex cries
          out. The blow folds him forward onto his knees.

                         VICTOR
          The. cops are about to drive up your
          street.
          He brings the club down on Alex's bare foot.

                         ALEX
          (through teeth clenched

                         WITH PAIN)
          There's nothing here to.give you.

                         VICTOR
          Where is it?
          He clips Alex on the other leg as he tries to crawl away.
          The physical effort shortens Victor's breathing. His
          cough sprays blood. He tightens his grip on the club.

                         ALEX "
          Believe me -- I swear to God, I

                         DON'T --
          Victor raises the club over Alex's head, and brings it
          down on the coffee table instead. The glass-explodes. He
          has to push the words out through aâ¢coughing spasm.

                         VICTOR
          I refuse to die in a fucking prison
          clinic!
          Alex staggers to his feet. Victor is struggling for
          breath. Alex jerks the golf club away from him and tosses
          it on the floor.

          He puts his arm around victor's waist and helps him to the
          sofa.

                         ALEX
          Come on, this is pitiful.
          Victor drops onto the sofa. He gags on the blood in his
          throat and desperately draws in air.

                         ALEX
          What a mess.
          He picks up a sofa pillow to arrange it for him. Victor
          gives him a grateful smile. Alex presses the pillow down
          over his face before he can react. His feet flail. Alex
          has to lie on top of him to hold him down. A couple
          making out on the couch. The GUN THUMPS to the floor.
          Victor's movements slow, and stop. Alex takes no chances.
          He keeps the pillow jammed down until there's no
          possibility of trickery. Satisfied, he rolls Victor's
          dead body onto the floor, steps over it, and with steady
          hands he opens a bottle of very expensive wine. He pours
          a glass.

                         ALEX

                         (QUIETLY)
          At least you got to die in your own
          clothes, Vic. That's something.

          206 EXT. TRUCK STOP - NIGHT

          A few Truckers make remarks as Gabriella walks toward the
          bank of phones. "Hey, pretty lady." "Possibility?"
          "She's not your type." She doesn't mind swinging her hips
          a little for their benefit.

          207 INT. CONDO - NIGHT

          The PHONE is RINGING. Alex sits in a chair in the dark.
          Then he crosses to the phone, picks it up and waits for
          the caller to speak.

          He has a boat, Alex! It's on the
          boat. The dumb shit wants to turn
          it over to the cops. You know
          what'll happen to me.
          Alex is taking his passport out of his desk.

                         ALEX

           He opens another drawer. There's a gun inside.

          209 INT. TRUCK STOP - NIGHT

          Jason comes out of the men's room. He doesn't see
          Gabriella for a moment. A couple of truckers block his
          view. Now he catches sight of her. She's coming from the
          direction of the phones, a can of soda in her hand. Their
          eyes meet. She smiles and waves the can, hurries to meet
          h1m.

          210 EXT. HIGHWAY - NIGHT

           The motorcycle cruises up the coast road. The surf glows
           with plankton.

                          GABRIELLA
           presses her cheek against Jason's back.

          Jason secures the motorcycle. He puts his arm around
          Gabriella, they walk down the dock to his boat. He helps
          her aboard.

          Gabriella and Jason tenderly make love in the swaying
          cabin.

          213 EXT. BOAT - NIGHT 213

          On watch, Henry finds his gaze sliding to the NOISY
          dockside BAR, its beer sign beacon-bright. The SOUNDS
          BELOW embarrass him. He makes up his mind. He swings off
          the boat and heads toward the bar. He doesn't notice
          Alex's Cadillac idling in the alley. The headlights click
          off, the motor goes silent. The BOATS CREAK against the
          slips.

          214 INT. BOAT - DAY 214

          Jason wakes up with a start. He senses something. He
          slides out from under the sleeping weight of Gabriella's
          arm and pulls on his jeans, reaches up to open the cabin
          hatch.

                         HIS POV
          Alex's foot swinging. More of him comes INTO SIGHT as
          Jason climbs to deck. The financial pages open on his
          lap, he's drinking a Styrofoam cup of coffee and eating a
          donut; the rest of the bag of donuts is next to him.

                         ALEX
          Good morning! I brought donuts.
          Jason is struck silent. He sits down on the side of the
          boat, his arms around his ribs.

                         ALEX
          Oh, it's not as bad as all that.

                         JASON

          Which I didn't expect either.
          Jason moves to the helm, switches on the engine. Alex
          quickly finishes his donut. He brushes off his fingers.

                         ALEX
          Where are we going?

                         JASON
          I'm going fishing. Get off if you
          want.

          No, it's a beautiful day for a boat
          ride. Give us a chance to talk.
          He makes himself comfortable.

                         JASON
          Then make yourself useful and cast
          off the stern line.
          Alex moves to the stern while Jason casts off the bow
          line.

                         ALEX
          This one?

                         JASON
          There's not a lot of choice.
          Alex casts off. Jason backs the-boat into position. He
          sees Henry asleep in the doorway of the marine supplies
          store next to the shuttered bar. Alex rejoins him.

                         ALEX
          -- If we could manage to ignore the
          personal history here, I think we
          could work something out between us.
          Jason turns the boat toward the open sea.

                         ALEX
          You want Gabriella? This is the way
          to have her. Life costs, Jason.
          Love costs. And you love her more
          than I do.

          He's feeling like you let him down.
          .She gives Alex a look that silences him. He reaches for

          hitting the waves substitute for conversation.

          He sits down beside a pole and looks over at Gabriella,
          who has put on a hat. She's staring out to sea.

          We're giving you a hard choice,
          Gabby. Two rich men.
          Gabriella swivels her head slowly.

                         GABRIELLA
          I don't want either one of you.
          A line quivers. Jason reels in a little.

                          JASON
           Something's going to bite, just

                          ABOUT --
           (his biceps tightening)
           -- now.
          And the bait is taken at the moment he said. The line
          reels out very, very fast. He lets the fish run with it.
          Gabriella has turned around to watch. Now Jason reels in
          a little, making the line taut, testing the weight.
          He yanks back. The line rises from the ocean, bringing to
          the surface a big, dark green fish. _

                         ALEX
          Jesus! What the hell is that?

                         JASON
          Hammerhead. Young. Male.
          Jason plays the shark until it's close to the boat and
          thrashing for its life. Gabriella's scared.

                         GABRIELLA
          Help him, Alex.

                         ALEX
          I'd just get in his way.
          His hand comes to rest on her shoulder as Jason expertly
          reels in the bucking hammerhead. She shrugs away from his
          hand. Jason has hooked a ten-foot, three-finned sea beast
          with a spade-shaped head and black eyes on each side. He
          attaches the line to a winch and winds it up onto the
          deck. It twists wildly, knocking things over until it
          slows down and finally lies very still. His chest heaving
          with the effort, Jason looks around. Alex has disappeared
          without either of them noticing.

          216 INT. CABIN - DAY 216

          Alex is searching frantically.

          JASON (O.S.)
          No luck?
          Alex whirls around. His gun materializes in his hand.
          Jason retreats a step.

                         JASON
          Is this your backup plan?

                         (CONTINUED)

          No.

                         JASON
          You want it so bad, it's yours.
          He pulls out the necklace and hurls it away from Alex.

                         ALEX

                         (MOANING)
          You little prick.

          217 INT./EXT. CABIN - THE NECKLACE

          skitters along the deck. The shark's body stops it from
          dropping out the open gate in the transom.

                         ALEX
          scrambles toward the necklace.

                         GABRIELLA
          Don't let him have it! He'll kill

                         USL
          Jason grabs her-and holds her with both arms to keep her
          from going any closer. Alex turns his head, puzzled,
          warned. Too late. The shark suddenly thrashes, its jaws
          snapping around him. Gabriella screams with Alex. He
          FIRES his GUN over and over until it's empty. The shark
          continues to tear at him.

                         ALEX
          Help me, help.mel!
          Gabriella runs down into the cabin. Much as he hates
          Alex, Jason can't let him die. like this. He charges.
          forward and straddles the shark, jams the blade of his
          knife into the primordial brain. He twists the handle
          once. The shark dies instantly. Trembling with
          adrenalin, Jason gets off its back. With his elbows Alex
          drags himself out of the jaws. He's badly mangled.. The
          shark slowly changes color to a dull brown.

                         ALEX
          You knew it wasn't dead.
          Jason squats down beside him to access his injuries.

                         JASON
          Mom didn't take the necklace.
          did.

                         (CONTINUED)

                         217 CONTINUED: 217
          Alex struggles to stay conscious.

                         ALEX
          Then you killed her yourself.
          Jason slowly nods.

                         JASON
          And you were in the car behind us.
          Gabriella drops down beside them. She has a flare gun, no
          longer needed, and sheets from the cabin to stop the
          bleeding. She starts to tear them up. She's crying
          slightly.

                         GABRIELLA
          We were supposed to turn him ini I
          didn't think you were going to kill
          him!

                         JASON
          Well, I didn't.
          Alex manages to laugh.

                         ALEX
          Jesus. You set me up. You had her
          call me.

                         (TO GABRIELLA)
          Shit... I believed you.
          Jason pushes to his feet and heads for the cockpit.

                         JASON
          I'll get on the radio.
          Gabriella wraps the strips of sheet tightly around what's
          left of Alex to bandage. She smears away the tears so she
          can see and leaves blood tracked across her face. She
          looks down to see his bloody hand clutching the necklace.
          They look at each other.

                         JASON
          has the microphone in his hand. He's setting course.
          Gabriella appears behind him. She's holding the flare
          gun. She puts it back where she found it, and steps
          beside him and puts her arm around his waist. He lays his
          arm over her shoulders and holds her close while he uses
          the radio.

                         JASON
          This is Hercules II, calling the
          Harbormaster...

           The boat heads back to port.

          219 EXT. DOCK - DAY

          At an unused pier Gabriella leans back against the line to
          hold the boat in place. Henry and Jason carry Alex off
          the boat and lay him on the planks. SIRENS can be faintly
          heard. Jason leaps back on the boat. Henry pushes them
          off.

                         CLOSER ANGLE

                         HENRY
          You cool?

                         JASON
          I will be.

                         HENRY
          See ya.
          He and Jason wave goodbye. The boat moves out. Henry is
          left with Alex.

                         ALEX
          (weakly; to Henry)
          What's your name?

                         HENRY
          No way --

                         ALEX
          (still the salesman)
          -- No, listen, listen -- this is
          worth a fortune.
          (thrusting the necklace

                         TOWARD HIM)
          Play the possibilities.

                         HENRY
          Yeah. Good advice.
          And he walks away fast.

                         ALEX
          Wait, don't go! Come back here.
          Come on back!

          Henry's gone. Alex rolls onto his belly and starts
          dragging himself down the dock, too much of an optimist to
          give up hope in a hopeless situation.

 ON BLACK: 
 "A MAN MUST LOOK AT HIS LIFE AND THINK LUXURY." 
 FADE IN: 
 EXT. GUARJIRA, COLOMBIA - 1989 - DAY 
	A majestic panorama of the lush green slopes that are the
	Columbian highlands.  A faint chopping sound IS HEARD and
	then another.  WHOOSH.  WHOOSH.  The view changes and tiny
	dots appear on the hillside vegetation.  WHOOSH.

 CLOSER 
	We realize the dots are people.  Workers swinging long steel
	machetes in slow methodical rhythm.  WHOOSH.  WHOOSH.  WE SEE
	the South American Indian MEN clearly now.  Their tar stained
	teeth.  Their gaunt faces riddled with crow's feet.  Their
	jaws chewing away on huge wads of coca leaves as they collect
	the harvest.

 EXT. DIRT ROAD - COLOMBIA - DAY 
	Old rickety trucks carrying the huge green tractor-sized
	bales speed along the narrow road.

 EXT. CLEARING - COLOMBIA - DAY 
	The bundles are undone and Columbian women separate out the
	leaves.  Tribes of underweight workers carry armload after
	armload of the harvest and ritualistically dump them into a
	gigantic cannibal pot which sits on top of a raging bonfire.
	The leaves are being boiled down and a huge plume of smoke
	streaks the sky.  Wizened Indios brave the heat and shovel
	ashes into the pot to cool the solution.

 INT. JUNGLE - COLOMBIA - DAY 
	A primitive but enormous makeshift lab contains all the
	equipment.  The machinery.  The solutions.  The over-sized
	vats.  Dark-skinned bandoleros smoke cigarettes and sport
	automatic weapons at all the points of entry.  The coca is
	now a "basuco" paste and is being sent in for a wash.

 INT. LABORATORY - COLOMBIA - 1989 - DAY 
	A conveyor belt pours out brick after brick of pure cocaine
	hydrochloride.  The bricks are wrapped, tied up, weighed, and
	stamped with a "P" before being thrown into duffel bags.

 EXT. JUNGLE AIRSTRIP - COLOMBIA - DAY 
	A small twin-engine Cessna is loaded with dozens of duffel
	bags and the plane takes off.

 EXT. VERO BEACH AIRFIELD - NIGHT 
	The Cessna touches down.

 EXT. WORKSITE - WEYMOUTH - 1966 - DAY 
	The worksite is busy.  George is amongst other workers,
	working a summer job.  As George is taking five, he looks
	across the sight to Fred, who is sweeping up debris.  A long
	way from being the boss.

 INT. COLLEGE ADMISSIONS OFFICE - WEYMOUTH - 1966 - DAY 
	George stands in line to register for college, wearing his
	Brooks Brothers suit, bowtie, and freshly Bryllcreamed hair.
	The room is crowded and the line is long.  Bob Dylan's
	"Subterranean Homesick Blues" blares out of one of the kid's
	transistor radios.  George looks around the room.  He is
	uncomfortable.  He catches his reflection in the shiny glass
	partition and stops.  He doesn't like what he sees.
	Something is not right.  He looks like everyone else.  Same
	cookie-cutter hair, same cookie-cutter clothes, same cookie
	cutter faces.  He's a carbon copy.

 REGISTRATION WOMAN 		Next.

	It's George's turn but he doesn't hear it.  "Twenty years of
	schooling and they put you on a day shift."  The words hit
	him like a tone of bricks as he continues to stare at his own
	reflection.

 GEORGE (V.O.) 		I was standing there, and it was like
		the outside of me and the inside of me
		didn't match, you know?  And then I
		looked around the room and it hit me.  I
		saw my whole life.  Where I was gonna
		live, what type of car I'd drive, who my
		neighbors would be.  I saw it all and I
		didn't want it.  Not that life.

 EXT. CONSTRUCTION SITE - WEYMOUTH - 1966 - DAY 
	George sits with Fred.  It's breaktime and Fred eats from a
	lunch box.

 GEORGE 		There's something out there for me, Dad.
		Something different.  Something free
		form, you know?  Something for me, and
		college just isn't it.

 FRED 		That's too bad.  You would have been the
		first one in the family.

 GEORGE 		I know.

 FRED 		Alright.  You want me to get your old
		job back?  Because I could, you know, I
		could put in that word.

 GEORGE 		No, Dad.  I don't want to...I mean, I
		just don't want...

	It's obvious to Fred that his son doesn't want to be like
	him.

 FRED 		What are you going to do?

 GEORGE 		I'm going to California.

 EXT. BELMONT SHORES APARTMENT - 1968 - DAY 
 SUPERIMPOSE: MANHATTAN BEACH, CALIFORNIA 1968 
	George and Tuna, now 21-years old, struggle with their bags.
	Their new place is a tackily furnished, two-story apartment
	with small balconies and a view of the ocean.  As George and
	Tuna struggle with the bags, two California beauties appear
	on the balcony next door: BARBARA BUCKLEY, 20, and MARIA
 GONZALES, 21. 
 GIRLS 		You guys need some help?

	George and Tuna share a look.

 TUNA 		I don't know about you, but I think
		we're gonna like it here.

 EXT. MANHATTAN BEACH - 1968 - DAY 
 SERIES OF SHOTS 
	Barbara and Maria introduce George and Tuna around to the
	Manhattan Beach regulars.  They are immediately accepted
	despite their ill fitting shorts and Tuna's unhip black
	socks.  The beach scene is one big party.  Lots of beer,
	music, bikinis, and good times.  By the end of the day,
	George and Tuna have a hundred new friends.

 GEORGE (V.O.) 		California was like nothing I'd ever
		experienced.  The people were liberated
		and independent and full of new ideas.

 GEORGE (V.O.) (CONT'D) 		They used words like "right on,"
		"groovy," and "solid."  The women are
		all beautiful and seemed to share the
		same occupation.

 WOMAN #1 		I'm a flight attendant.

 WOMAN #2 		I'm a flight attendant.

 WOMAN #3 		I'm a flight attendant.

	The weed comes out and is passed around.  Pipes.  Joints.
	Bongs.  In SLOW MOTION, Barbara takes a huge hit of grass,
	grabs George's face, french kissing him, and giving him a
	huge shotgun.

 INT. BELMONT SHORES APARTMENT - 1968 - DAY 
	George and Barbara are sleeping late.  Their bodies
	intertwined beneath the sheets.  A slam of the front door
	wakes them up.  It's Tuna.

 TUNA 		Hey, wake up.  Come on, you two
		lovebirds.  Hurry, I want to show you
		something.

	George and Barbara shake cobwebs out and stumble into the
	kitchen to find Tuna holding a brown paper shopping bag.

 TUNA (CONT'D) 		Figured it out.

 GEORGE 		Figured what out?

 TUNA 		You know how we were wondering what we
		were going to do for money?  Being how
		we don't want to get jobs and whatnot?
		Well, check this out.

	Tuna takes the paper bag and empties its contents on the
	kitchen table.  It's a grey mound of stocky, seedy marijuana.

	Barbara examines the reefer.

 BARBARA 		Tuna, this is crap.

 TUNA 		I know it's not the greatest.  It's
		commercial.

 BARBARA 		It's garbage.

 GEORGE 		It's oregano.  You got ripped off, pal.
		What are you gonna do with all this?

 TUNA 		We sell it.  I got it all figured out.
		We make three finger lids and sell them
		on the beach.  We move all of it.  We've
		made ourselves a hundred bucks.  Or a
		lot of weed for our head.  What do you
		think?  Not bad, huh?  I got the baggies
		and everything.

 BARBARA 		You can't sell this to your friends.

 TUNA 		Man.  Fuck you guys.  I have this great
		idea and you guys have to be all
		skeptical.

 BARBARA 		Look, if you really wanna score some
		dope, I got the guy.

 EXT. THE WHIPPING POST - MANHATTAN BEACH - 1968 - DAY 
	George, Barbara and Tuna stop outside the front door.

 GEORGE 		Are you sure this guy is cool?

 BARBARA 		You'll see for yourself.

 TUNA 		A beauty parlor for men?  Sounds pretty
		queer.

	They walk in.

 INT. THE WHIPPING POST - MANHATTAN BEACH - 1968 - CONTINUOUS 
	George, Tuna and Barbara enter.  The Whipping Post is
	California's first male hair salon.  George looks around at
	the customer's being pampered.  Haircuts, pedicures,
	manicures.

 GEORGE 		Nothing like this back home.

 BARBARA 		Derek!

	DEREK FOREAL is a curious man.  Daringly effeminate,
	especially for the sixties, he is always surrounded by
	beautiful women.  As he sees Barbara, he stops his haircut
	and runs to embrace her.

 DEREK 		Barbie!

	Derek's female entourage rush over as well.  Kisses all
	around.

 DEREK (CONT'D) 		So, this is the new man, huh?  He's
		cute!

	George and Tuna stick out there hands.

 GEORGE 		George.

 TUNA 		Tuna.

 DEREK 		Tuna, oh my.  Enchante, George.  Barbie,
		he's yummy.  He looks like a Ken doll.
		Oooh, Ken and Barbie.  It's perfect.
		Alright, girls, give me five minutes.

	Derek makes dismissing gestures and the girls scatter.

 DEREK (CONT'D) 		Everyone, shoo!  You, too, Barbie.  I
		want to talk to the boys alone.

	After the girls leave, Derek closes the partition and his
	playful demeanor changes.  He's all business now.

 DEREK (CONT'D) 		What can I do for you guys?

 GEORGE 		We want some grass.

 DEREK 		I know what you want.  But, first of
		all, are you cops?

 GEORGE 		No.

 DEREK 		Because if you are, you have to tell me.
		If not, it's entrapment.

 GEORGE 		We're not cops.  We're from
		Massachusettes.  I mean, does he look
		like a cop?

 DEREK 		I guess not.  Okay.  You know, you're
		very lucky you're friends of Barbie's.
		If you weren't, I'd never talk to you.

	Derek pulls a television-sized brick of quality marijuana out
	from under a sink and sets it down in front of George.

 GEORGE 		What the fuck is that?

 DEREK 		It's your grass.

 TUNA 		Wow.  That's more than we had in mind.

 DEREK 		I don't nickel and dime.  You want it or
		not?

	George and Tuna look at each other.

 GEORGE 		We'll take it.

 EXT. MANHATTAN BEACH - 1968 - DAY

	Summer on the beach.  It's one big party.  George and Tuna

	George and Barbara sit by the water, watching the waves crash
	into the sand.  The sky is streaked with purple and red.

 GEORGE 		This is it for me.

 BARBARA 		What is?

 GEORGE 		Just everything.  You.  California.  The

 GEORGE (V.O.) 		I was standing there, and it was like
		the outside of me and the inside of me
		didn't match, you know?  And then I
		looked around the room and it hit me.  I
		saw my whole life.  Where I was gonna
		live, what type of car I'd drive, who my
		neighbors would be.  I saw it all and I
		didn't want it.  Not that life.

 EXT. CONSTRUCTION SITE - WEYMOUTH - 1966 - DAY 
	George sits with Fred.  It's breaktime and Fred eats from a
	lunch box.

 GEORGE 		There's something out there for me, Dad.
		Something different.  Something free
		form, you know?  Something for me, and
		college just isn't it.

 FRED 		That's too bad.  You would have been the
		first one in the family.

 GEORGE 		I know.

 FRED 		Alright.  You want me to get your old
		job back?  Because I could, you know, I
		could put in that word.

 GEORGE 		No, Dad.  I don't want to...I mean, I
		just don't want...

	It's obvious to Fred that his son doesn't want to be like
	him.

 FRED 		What are you going to do?

 GEORGE 		I'm going to California.

 EXT. BELMONT SHORES APARTMENT - 1968 - DAY 
 SUPERIMPOSE: MANHATTAN BEACH, CALIFORNIA 1968 
	George and Tuna, now 21-years old, struggle with their bags.
	Their new place is a tackily furnished, two-story apartment
	with small balconies and a view of the ocean.  As George and
	Tuna struggle with the bags, two California beauties appear
	on the balcony next door: BARBARA BUCKLEY, 20, and MARIA
 GONZALES, 21. 
 GIRLS 		You guys need some help?

	George and Tuna share a look.

 TUNA 		I don't know about you, but I think
		we're gonna like it here.

 EXT. MANHATTAN BEACH - 1968 - DAY 
 SERIES OF SHOTS 
	Barbara and Maria introduce George and Tuna around to the
	Manhattan Beach regulars.  They are immediately accepted
	despite their ill fitting shorts and Tuna's unhip black
	socks.  The beach scene is one big party.  Lots of beer,
	music, bikinis, and good times.  By the end of the day,
	George and Tuna have a hundred new friends.

 GEORGE (V.O.) 		California was like nothing I'd ever
		experienced.  The people were liberated
		and independent and full of new ideas.

 GEORGE (V.O.) (CONT'D) 		They used words like "right on,"
		"groovy," and "solid."  The women are
		all beautiful and seemed to share the
		same occupation.

 WOMAN #1 		I'm a flight attendant.

 WOMAN #2 		I'm a flight attendant.

 WOMAN #3 		I'm a flight attendant.

	The weed comes out and is passed around.  Pipes.  Joints.
	Bongs.  In SLOW MOTION, Barbara takes a huge hit of grass,
	grabs George's face, french kissing him, and giving him a
	huge shotgun.

 INT. BELMONT SHORES APARTMENT - 1968 - DAY 
	George and Barbara are sleeping late.  Their bodies
	intertwined beneath the sheets.  A slam of the front door
	wakes them up.  It's Tuna.

 TUNA 		Hey, wake up.  Come on, you two
		lovebirds.  Hurry, I want to show you
		something.

	George and Barbara shake cobwebs out and stumble into the
	kitchen to find Tuna holding a brown paper shopping bag.

 TUNA (CONT'D) 		Figured it out.

 GEORGE 		Figured what out?

 TUNA 		You know how we were wondering what we
		were going to do for money?  Being how
		we don't want to get jobs and whatnot?
		Well, check this out.

	Tuna takes the paper bag and empties its contents on the
	kitchen table.  It's a grey mound of stocky, seedy marijuana.

	Barbara examines the reefer.

 BARBARA 		Tuna, this is crap.

 TUNA 		I know it's not the greatest.  It's
		commercial.

 BARBARA 		It's garbage.

 GEORGE 		It's oregano.  You got ripped off, pal.
		What are you gonna do with all this?

 TUNA 		We sell it.  I got it all figured out.
		We make three finger lids and sell them
		on the beach.  We move all of it.  We've
		made ourselves a hundred bucks.  Or a
		lot of weed for our head.  What do you
		think?  Not bad, huh?  I got the baggies
		and everything.

 BARBARA 		You can't sell this to your friends.

 TUNA 		Man.  Fuck you guys.  I have this great
		idea and you guys have to be all
		skeptical.

 BARBARA 		Look, if you really wanna score some
		dope, I got the guy.

 EXT. THE WHIPPING POST - MANHATTAN BEACH - 1968 - DAY 
	George, Barbara and Tuna stop outside the front door.

 GEORGE 		Are you sure this guy is cool?

 BARBARA 		You'll see for yourself.

 TUNA 		A beauty parlor for men?  Sounds pretty
		queer.

	They walk in.

 INT. THE WHIPPING POST - MANHATTAN BEACH - 1968 - CONTINUOUS 
	George, Tuna and Barbara enter.  The Whipping Post is
	California's first male hair salon.  George looks around at
	the customer's being pampered.  Haircuts, pedicures,
	manicures.

 GEORGE 		Nothing like this back home.

 BARBARA 		Derek!

	DEREK FOREAL is a curious man.  Daringly effeminate,
	especially for the sixties, he is always surrounded by
	beautiful women.  As he sees Barbara, he stops his haircut
	and runs to embrace her.

 DEREK 		Barbie!

	Derek's female entourage rush over as well.  Kisses all
	around.

 DEREK (CONT'D) 		So, this is the new man, huh?  He's
		cute!

	George and Tuna stick out there hands.

 GEORGE 		George.

 TUNA 		Tuna.

 DEREK 		Tuna, oh my.  Enchante, George.  Barbie,
		he's yummy.  He looks like a Ken doll.
		Oooh, Ken and Barbie.  It's perfect.
		Alright, girls, give me five minutes.

	Derek makes dismissing gestures and the girls scatter.

 DEREK (CONT'D) 		Everyone, shoo!  You, too, Barbie.  I
		want to talk to the boys alone.

	After the girls leave, Derek closes the partition and his
	playful demeanor changes.  He's all business now.

 DEREK (CONT'D) 		What can I do for you guys?

 GEORGE 		We want some grass.

 DEREK 		I know what you want.  But, first of
		all, are you cops?

 GEORGE 		No.

 DEREK 		Because if you are, you have to tell me.
		If not, it's entrapment.

 GEORGE 		We're not cops.  We're from
		Massachusettes.  I mean, does he look
		like a cop?

 DEREK 		I guess not.  Okay.  You know, you're
		very lucky you're friends of Barbie's.
		If you weren't, I'd never talk to you.

	Derek pulls a television-sized brick of quality marijuana out
	from under a sink and sets it down in front of George.

 GEORGE 		What the fuck is that?

 DEREK 		It's your grass.

 TUNA 		Wow.  That's more than we had in mind.

 DEREK 		I don't nickel and dime.  You want it or
		not?

	George and Tuna look at each other.

 GEORGE 		We'll take it.

	into the sand.  The sky is streaked with purple and red.

 GEORGE 		This is it for me.

 BARBARA 		What is?

 GEORGE 		Just everything.  You.  California.  The
		beach.  This spot right here.  I feel
		like I belong here, you know?  It just
		feels right.

 BARBARA 		You happy, baby?

 GEORGE 		Yeah.  I am.

 INT. BELMONT SHORES APARTMENT - 1968 - DAY 
	George walks in to find Tuna and Maria sitting with KEVIN
	DULLI, an old friend from back east.  He's sitting in front
	of a water pipe and coughing his ass off.

 TUNA 		Look what the cat dragged in.

 GEORGE 		Holy shit, Dulli.  What the hell are you
		doing here?

 KEVIN 		Well, I'll tell you.  I was walking down
		the beach, minding my business, when who
		did I see but this fucking guy.  I
		didn't know you guys were living in
		California.

 GEORGE 		Yeah, but what are you doing out here?

 KEVIN 		I'm on vacation.  On my way back to
		school.

 GEORGE 		This calls for a joint.  You want to do
		the honors?

 KEVIN 		No, man.  I'm too fucked up.

 TUNA 		Nice weed, huh?

 KEVIN 		Fuck yeah.  I never seen nothing like
		it.  I'm fucking wasted.

 GEORGE 		Right on.

 KEVIN 		G-d, I'm stoned.  I'm stoned.  I'm
		really...

 GEORGE 		Stoned?

 KEVIN 		I wish there was shit like this back
		home.

 GEORGE 		Yeah?

 KEVIN 		Shit, yeah.  Do you know how much money
		I could make if I had this stuff back
		east?

 TUNA 		No shit, Kevin?

 KEVIN 		That's right.

 GEORGE 		Yeah?

 KEVIN 		When there's something to move, it's too
		easy not to.  Do you know how many
		colleges are in a twenty mile radius?
		U. Mass, Amherst, B.U....

 TUNA 		Smith.  Hampshire....

 KEVIN 		Right.  And Holyoke.  There are a
		hundred thousand rich kids with their
		parents' money to spend, but there's
		never anything available.  Nothing good,
		anyway.  I'm paying four hundred dollars
		for shit.

 INT. THE WHIPPING POST - MANHATTAN BEACH - 1968 - DAY 
	Derek, George and Barbara sit around.  The blinds are drawn.

 GEORGE 		The way we figure it, Barbara flies to
		Boston twice a week.  Two bags per
		flight.  Twenty-five pounds in each bag.

 DEREK 		You're kidding, right?  That's a hundred
		pounds a week.

 GEORGE 		Yeah, I know, it's a lot of weight.

 BARBARA 		We're gonna call it California
		sinsemilla.  Sounds exotic.

 GEORGE 		I'm telling you, Derek, it will sell.

 DEREK 		I don't know...

 GEORGE 		Here's the best part.  We can charge
		five-hundred a pound.

 DEREK 		Come on, George, no one is going to pay
		that.

 GEORGE 		It's already been negotiated.  It's
		done.  The money is there waiting.

	Derek looks at Barbara.  She nods.

 DEREK 		Goodness.

 GEORGE 		Goodness is right.  If you do the math,
		that's over thirty grand a week profit.
		I want you to be my partner on this,
		Derek.  Fifty-fifty.  That's fifteen
		thousand a week for you, my friend.  In
		your pocket, free and clear.

 DEREK 		And I only deal with you?

 GEORGE 		Barbara and me.  No one else.

	Derek thinks about it.

 BARBARA 		It's gonna work, Derek.

 DEREK 		I don't know.  East coast.  Airplanes.
		It all sounds pretty risky.

 GEORGE 		She's a flight attendant.  They don't
		check her bags.

 EXT. LOS ANGELES INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT - 1968 - DAY

 INT. LOGAN AIRPORT - GATE - BOSTON - 1968 
	The same scene repeated, same things changed again; now Kevin
	is definitely dressed a little better.

 KEVIN 		I need more.

 BARBARA 		What do you want me to do?  I can only
		take two bags, and I can't fly back here
		everyday.

 KEVIN 		I know, but I've got a feeding frenzy on

	It's stacked in piles all over the table.

 KEVIN 		Twenty, forty, sixty, eighty, nine.
		Twenty, forty, sixty, eighty, a

 TUNA 		Jesus Christ, I'm getting a boner just

	But George isn't paying attention.  His wheels are turning.

 KEVIN 		What's the matter, George?  Something
		wrong?  You look like you just fucked
		your mother.

 TUNA 		Cheer up, man.  Half this money is ours.
		We're fucking rich.

 GEORGE 		It's not enough.

 KEVIN 		What?

 TUNA 		What the fuck are you talking about,
		man?

 GEORGE 		The set-up is wrong.  We're doing all
		the legwork, and at the end of the day,
		we're still paying retail.  We're
		getting middled.

 KEVIN 		So?

 GEORGE 		So, we need to get to the source.

 TUNA 		Source?  What about Derek?

 GEORGE 		He's getting middled, too.  And Derek's

 DEREK 		I don't think so.

 GEORGE 		You guys are such babies.  You want to

 RADA 		Georgie, we're gonna get busted if we

 SANTIAGO 		For instance, something like this?

 GEORGE 		Very nice.  I'll take it.

 SANTIAGO 		Ha ha ha.  You are funny.   Really, how

 GEORGE 		All of it.  As much as you've got.  A
		couples thousand pounds.  I'll be back
		in a week with a plane.

 SANTIAGO 		Listen, Americano, it is very nice to
		meet you, but maybe we are going too
		fast.  You take a little and then come
		back.

 GEORGE 		I don't need a little.  I need a lot.

 SANTIAGO 		Marijuana is illegal in my country, and
		I believe in yours, as well.  We must be
		careful.

 GEORGE 		What if I brought you, let's say, fifty

 GEORGE 		Alright, pull back the throttle...

	The engine screams.

 GEORGE (CONT'D) 		Not that far, only halfway.  You sure

 ERMINE 		Yes.  Of course.  But, I'm talking about

 ERMINE 		What is that, two carats?  That's got to

 JUDGE 		George Jung, you have been accused of

 GEORGE (V.O.) 		Rule two: plead not guilty and get
		bailed out of jail.

 GEORGE (CONT'D) 		Your honor, I'd like to say a few words
		to the court.

	The court appointed attorney puts his head in his hands.

 JUDGE 		By all means.

 GEORGE 		In all honesty, I don't feel like what
		I've done is a crime and I think it's
		illogical and irresponsible for you to
		sentence me to prison.  None of the real
		criminals of the world ever end up
		behind bars.  I mean, when you think
		about it, what did I really do?  Cross
		an imaginary line with a bunch of
		plants?  You say that I'm an outlaw, you
		say that I'm a thief, but where's the
		Christmas dinner for the people on
		relief?

	George stops when his attorney stamps on his foot.  The court
	officers roll their eyes and the judge smiles.

 JUDGE 		Those are very interesting concepts you
		have, Mr. Jung.
		Unfortunately for you, the imaginary
		line you crossed is real, the plants you
		brought with you are illegal, and what
		you did constitutes a crime.

	The judge slams his gavel.

 JUDGE (CONT'D) 		Bail is set at twenty-thousand dollars.

 EXT. COOK COUNTY COURTHOUSE - CHICAGO - 1972 - NIGHT 
	George walks out, free on bond, to find Barbara waiting for
	him.  She doesn't look so good.

 BARBARA 		Surprise.

 GEORGE 		Baby, you didn't have to come.

 BARBARA 		What, and miss all the fun?  C'mon, not
		a chance.  So, what's the verdict?

 GEORGE 		Lawyer says he can plead it down to five
		years.  I'll serve two.

 BARBARA 		Two years.  George, I can't wait that
		long.

 GEORGE 		What?  You're not going to wait for me?

 BARBARA 		George, I went to the doctor.  I don't
		have two years.

 GEORGE (V.O.) 		Which brings me to rule number three:
		which says, fuck rules one and two, skip
		bail and take off.

 EXT. RENT-A-CAR - 1972 - DAY 
	George hits the gas and the car screams down the road.

 EXT. VILLA - PUERTO VALLARTA - 1973 - GOLDEN HOUR 
	George and Barbara sit on the veranda drinking champagne and
	watching the sun go down over the Pacific.  Barbara is
	completely bald.  Rail thin, eyes sunken.
	But it doesn't matter.  They're having a great time.  They
	laugh and hold hands and laugh some more.

 EXT. CEMETERY - PUERTO VALLARTA - 1973 - DAY 
	Everyone is there.  All in black.  Barbara's casket is
	lowered into the ground and George climbs to his knees to
	push the first dirt on the grave.

 GEORGE (V.O.) 		Time is such a funny thing.  I look at
		where I am now, and in here, time inches
		along.  So slow, it hardly seems like it
		moves.  But back then, time went fast.

 EXT. OTISVILLE F.C.I. - NEW YORK - 1999 - DAY 
	George pushes dirt along the edge of a flower root.  Still
	planting those sunflowers, he presses down firmly, standing
	before him is Barbara, still beautiful and young with flowing
	locks.  George raises his hand and makes a small wave.
	Barbara opens and closes her hand.  Bye bye.

 GEORGE 		It went too fast.

	George looks down and Barbara is gone.  No Barbara.

 EXT. JUNG HOUSE - BACKYARD - WEYMOUTH - 1973 - NIGHT 
	George hops the fence like he did when he was a boy and goes
	in the back door.

 INT. JUNG HOUSE - KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS 
	Ermine looks at George blankly.

 GEORGE 		Hi, Mom.

	Ermine just keeps looking at him.

 GEORGE (CONT'D) 		Surprised to see me?

 ERMINE 		Take your boots off.  You're tan.

 GEORGE 		Mexico.

 ERMINE 		Yeah.  We heard all about it.  I want
		you to know I'm deeply sorry about your
		girlfriend.

 GEORGE 		Barbara.

 ERMINE 		Yes, Barbara.  She was very pretty.

 GEORGE 		Thank you.  Have you been getting the
		money I sent you?

 ERMINE 		You mean the drug money?  Yes, I got it.

	Ermine's hands are trembling.  She is emotional.  She hugs
	George ferociously, not letting go.

 ERMINE (CONT'D) 		G-d, son.

 GEORGE 		Okay, Mom.  It's okay.  Where's Dad?

	George turns around to see Fred's beaming face.

 INT. JUNG HOUSE - KITCHEN - LATER 
	George and Fred sit at the table, a bottle of Scotch sits
	between them.  The glasses are raised.

 GEORGE 		May the wind always be at your back and
		the sun always upon your face...

 FRED 		...and the winds of destiny carry you
		aloft...

 BOTH 		...to dance with the stars.

	The glasses clink and the drinks are sucked down.

 INT. JUNG HOUSE - LATER 
	The bottle is dwindling.  George and Fred are feeling it.

 FRED 		You alright?

	George nods.

 GEORGE 		Just low.

 FRED 		You loved her, didn't you?  You really
		loved her.

 GEORGE 		Yeah, Dad.  I really did.  What am I
		gonna do?

 FRED 		Tough spot.

	The glasses are refilled.

 GEORGE 		You mad at me?

 FRED 		Not mad.

 GEORGE 		Yeah, you are.  I can tell by the way
		you look at me.

 FRED 		I just don't know what you're thinking.
		I don't understand your choices.  You
		know, the police are looking for you.

 GEORGE 		I know.  I'm great at what I do, Dad.  I
		mean, I'm really great.

 FRED 		Let me tell you something, son.  You
		would have been great at anything.

	Something outside catches George's eye.  A light.  A
	reflection.  A movement.  George is up and on the move.

 FRED (CONT'D) 		Where are you going?

 EXT. JUNG HOUSE - NIGHT 
	The front door opens and FEDERAL AGENTS pour into the house.

 INT. JUNG HOUSE - CONTINUOUS 
	George is up the stairs in a flash.

 ERMINE 		George!

 INT. GEORGE'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS 
	George slams the door behind him, moves over to the window,
	and opens it.  Cops everywhere.  He's trapped.  Out of
	options, he folds.  He moves to the corner and sits down,
	turns on the train set.  A KNOCK on the door is heard.  FBI
	Agent, JAMES T. TROUT.

 TROUT 		George Jung, you are under arrest.

 FRED 		Open the door, son.

 EXT. JUNG HOUSE - LATER 
	They lead George outside in handcuffs.  Ermine and Fred
	watch.

 ERMINE 		I had no choice.

	George stops and looks at his mother, for the first time
	realizing her betrayal.

 ERMINE (CONT'D) 		Don't look at me like that.  What was I
		supposed to do?  You're in our house.
		What, was I supposed to be an
		accomplice?

	As George is led to the police car, Ermine follows.

 ERMINE (CONT'D) 		You don't think people know you're a
		drug dealer?  Everyone knows.  It's no
		secret.  How do you think that reflects
		on me?  Every time I go out, I'm
		humiliated.  I see the stares.  I hear
		the whispers.  How do you think that
		makes me feel?  Did you ever once stop
		and think of me?

	George's head is pushed down as he is put in the squad car.
	He looks up at his mother.

 ERMINE (CONT'D) 		So you go to jail.  It's for your own
		good.  You need to straighten your life
		out.

 INT. DANBURY F.C.I. - 1974 - DAY 
 SUPERIMPOSE: 
	George is being led through a series of gated corridors.

 GUARD 		Prisoner in.

	As he walks, he takes in the faces of the other inmates.  He
	arrives at his cell and notices he has a ROOMMATE.

 GUARD (CONT'D) 		Prisoner in.

	The cell door opens and George steps inside.  There are books
	and papers spread out over both bunk beds.  George watches as
	his cellmate quickly clears everything off the top bunk.
	Apparently, the papers are private.  George puts his things
	down and the little man proffers his hand.  He is dark,
	polite and Colombian.

 DIEGO DELGADO 		My name is Diego Delgado.  How do you
		do?

 INT. DANBURY F.C.I. - MESS HALL - 1974 - DAY 
	George pushes his tray through the cafeteria line.  Diego is
	behind him.

 DIEGO 		If you don't mind me asking, what is the
		reason you are in this place?

 GEORGE 		What?

 DIEGO 		Your offense?  Why are you here?

 GEORGE 		I don't want to talk about it.

 DIEGO 		Intriguing.  I see.  Would you like to
		know my crime?

 GEORGE 		Not really, no.

 DIEGO 		No?

 GEORGE 		I don't like a lot of conversation,
		Diego.

 DIEGO 		Me, too.  Too much blah, blah, blah,
		blah is no good.  But we are roommates,
		okay?  And we must talk to each other.
		I am arrested for stealing cars.  For
		the grand theft auto.  Okay?  So, now it
		is your turn.  Now you will tell me,
		okay?  You will tell me why you are
		here?

	George says nothing.  He keeps eating his food.

 DIEGO (CONT'D) 		Oh, come on, George.  If we are to be
		friends, we must trust each other.

 GEORGE 		Murder.

 DIEGO 		Ah, yes.  The murder.

 INT. DANBURY F.C.I. - GEORGE'S CELL - NIGHT 
	George lays on his bunk, smoking.  Diego is on the bottom
	bunk, furiously writing on a notepad.  He flips through his
	books and rustles his papers.  George peeks over the side to
	see what Diego is doing.

 GEORGE 		What do you got there, Diego?

 DIEGO 		Nothing.  Just a little project.

 GEORGE 		What kind of project?

 DIEGO 		Never mind.  Not for you to worry.

 GEORGE 		I thought you said we were roommates.
		That we should talk about everything.

 DIEGO 		You have your intrigues.  I have mine.
		This is a happy day for me, George.
		Nine months from today, I will be in
		Medellin sipping champagne.  In nine
		months, I am free.  How much time do you
		have?

 GEORGE 		Twenty-six months.

 DIEGO 		Twenty-six months?  For murder?  I must
		be your lawyer.

 GEORGE 		I've got to get out of here, Diego.

 DIEGO 		Only two ways I know to leave here
		early.  One is to escape.

 GEORGE 		What's the other one?

 INT. DANBURY F.C.I. - CLASSROOM - DAY 
	George is trying to teach basic education to the inmates.
	The room, mostly black and hispanic, is hostile.  They don't
	want to learn.

 GEORGE 		Alright, let's open our books.

 INMATE #1 		Man, fuck you.

 INMATE #2 		We ain't opening shit.

 INMATE #1 		You just the warden's boy.  We on to
		you.  You just trying to knock some time
		off, asskissing motherfucker.

	Diego watches as the room reacts with laughter.  This ain't
	going to be easy.

 GEORGE 		Alright.  You're right.  I want to get
		out of this shithole as fast as I can.
		And I don't want to do this any more
		than you do.  But for me to walk early,
		some of you have to graduate.  You,
		forget about it.  You're hopeless, go to
		sleep.

	The room laughs again.

 INMATE #3 		Damn, homeboy, you got ruined.

 GEORGE 		But the rest of you could get diplomas
		and get jobs when you're on the outside.

	The room looks at him.  They ain't buying it.

 INMATE #1 		Shit, I'm in for life.

 INMATE #2 		I'm a criminal.  I ain't getting no
		motherfucking job.

 GEORGE 		We can learn some criminal shit, too.
		Alright, I'll make you a deal.  What if
		half the time, we learn about George
		Washington, and the other half, I'll
		teach you how to smuggle drugs?

 INMATE #2 		Man, you don't know dick about smuggling
		no drugs.

 GEORGE 		I was arrested in Chicago with six
		hundred and sixty pounds of grass.  I
		think that qualifies me.

	Diego looks up from his desk, suddenly very interested.

 INMATE #1 		How did you get a hold of six-hundred
		and sixty pounds of dope?

 GEORGE 		Flew it in from Mexico on a single
		engine Cessna.  Now, do we have a deal
		or not?

	They react.  They're in.

 GEORGE (CONT'D) 		Alright, the first thing you need to
		know about smuggling drugs is that it's
		easy.  The DEA are a bunch of losers.
		They couldn't find their dicks in a
		whorehouse.  They don't know what the
		fuck they're doing...

	Diego watches George winning over the room.  He listens
	intently to George's every word.  His wheels are turning.

 INT. DANBURY F.C.I. - GEORGE'S CELL - NIGHT 
	Lights out.  Diego and George lay in their cots.  George is
	tired.  Diego is not.

 DIEGO 		George?  Hey, George?  I listen to what
		you say to the class today about the
		smuggling.  You are a magico, ah?

	George doesn't respond.

 DIEGO (CONT'D) 		I never believed you were a murderer.  I
		knew.  I knew you are a magico.  I have
		seen it in you.  It's in your spirit.

 GEORGE 		I'm tired, Diego.  Go to bed.

 DIEGO 		You like to make the boundaries
		disappear.  It's not only the money, is
		it, George?  The adventure is part of
		the victory.  It's the thrill, ah?

 GEORGE 		Good night.

 DIEGO 		In my country, I am a magico.  A man
		with a dream.  A man on the rise.  To
		take nothing and make it something,
		okay?  I have failed my dream, but I
		will accomplish.  That is why I am in
		your country.  Yes, I lose my freedom.
		But they do not take my dream.  Do you
		have a dream, George?

 GEORGE 		I would if I could get some sleep.

 DIEGO 		Yes, you have a dream.  And maybe you
		accomplish your dream.  But yet you
		failed.  Why?

 GEORGE 		Because I got caught.

 DIEGO 		No, my brother.

 GEORGE 		Because they caught me?

 DIEGO 		You failed because you had the wrong
		dream.

	Diego climbs off his bunk and looks George square in the eye.

 DIEGO (CONT'D) 		George?  What do you know about cocaine?

 INT. DANBURY F.C.I. - MESS HALL - DAY 
 GEORGE 		I don't know, Diego.  I've got a good
		thing going already.  Everybody smokes
		pot.  It's easy.  Cocaine is a rich
		man's drug.  It's too expensive.

 DIEGO 		No, no.  That is where you are wrong.
		For us, it is cheap.  In Medellin, we
		buy for six-thousand dollars a kilo.  IN
		Miami, we sell for sixty.

	George's interest is piqued.

 GEORGE 		That's over fifty-thousand dollars
		profit per kilo.

 DIEGO 		And that's wholesale.  Cut it a few
		times and retail, you're looking at two,
		three-hundred thousand.

 GEORGE 		Oh my G-d.

 DIEGO 		Yes.  And a kilo of coca is smaller than
		a kilo of your precious marijuana.
		Everything is the same, George, except
		instead of thousands, you are making
		millions.

 GEORGE 		Jesus Christ.  Jesus fucking Christ.

 DIEGO 		Now do you see what I am saying?

 GEORGE 		Getting it here is no problem.  Trust
		me.  I'll fly it in myself if I have to.
		What about supply?  How much can we get?

 DIEGO 		Don't worry.  We will talk of
		everything.  We have the time.  You
		arrive here with a Bachelor of
		Marijuana, but you will leave with a
		Doctorate of Cocaine.

 INT. DANBURY F.C.I. - GEORGE'S CELL - NIGHT 
	Diego and George pouring over Diego's plans.  Discussing,
	planning, plotting.

 DIEGO 		What type of planes do you have?

 GEORGE 		Four passenger, single engine Cessna.

 DIEGO 		How many kilos can we fit in these
		planes?

 GEORGE 		I don't know.  A hundred, hundred and
		fifty.  How many miles is it from
		Colombia to Miami?

 DIEGO 		Fifteen hundred.  We'll have to stop
		somewhere to refuel.

 GEORGE 		We'll refuel in the Bahamas.  I know
		someone there.

 DIEGO 		Great.  I love the Bahamas.

 EXT. LIQUOR STORE - WEYMOUTH - 1976 
 SUPERIMPOSE: JULY, 1976. 
	George is at a payphone.  He drops in about a million
	quarters until he is finally connected.

 GEORGE 		Diego Delgado, please?

 DIEGO 		Allo?

 GEORGE 		Diego?  It's George.

 DIEGO 		George, hallo!  Today is the day, ah?
		Are you out?

 GEORGE 		Yeah, I'm out.

 DIEGO 		Congratulations, brother.  I've been
		waiting for you.

 GEORGE 		How are we doing?

 DIEGO 		Perfect, George.  Perfect.  Everything
		is fine down here.  Everything is all
		set up.

 GEORGE 		Do we need a plane?  How does this work?
		When do I see you?

 DIEGO 		Slow down, George.  Slow down.

	Fred exits the liquor store carrying two bottles of Dom
	Perignon.  As he catches George's eye, he lifts the bottles
	showing them off.  George holds up his finger, indicating
	he'll be just a second.

 DIEGO (CONT'D) 		You need to come down here, everybody
		meets everybody.  Ho ho ho.  Ha ha ha.
		We do one for good faith and then we
		talk about airplanes.

 GEORGE 		I can't go anywhere, Diego.  I'm on
		parole.  I can't leave the state.

 DIEGO 		But you must.  It's the only way.

 GEORGE 		I just got released five minutes ago.

 DIEGO 		George, are we gonna do this or not?

 EXT. BASSETERRE HOTEL - ANTIGUA - POOLSIDE - 1976 - DAY 
	George steps outside and spots Diego.  Their eyes meet.
	Diego looks different, relaxed.  He wears a straw hat,
	shorts, and sports a healthy tan.  The two men embrace.

 GEORGE 		Good to see you, Diego.

 DIEGO 		Yes.  Look around you.  The sun.  The
		water.  The women.  It's better than
		Danbury, no?  Come on.  I have some
		friends I would like you to meet.

 EXT. BASSETERRE HOTEL - ANTIGUA - POOLSIDE - 1976 - DAY 
	Diego and George sit with five other Colombians, most
	notably, a man named CESAR ROZA.  The mood is not friendly.

 DIEGO 		Fifteen kilos.  Seven and a half in each
		suitcase.  You receive a hundred
		thousand dollars upon delivery.

 GEORGE 		Okay.

 CESAR 		Not so fast.  I would like to go over
		the details.

 GEORGE 		What details?  I put the coke in the
		false bottoms and take it through
		customs.

 CESAR 		Tell me about the suitcases.  What is
		the make and the color?

 DIEGO 		Samsonites.  Red.  No tags.

	Cesar thinks about it.

 CESAR 		Hmm.  I see.  Will there be clothes in
		the suitcase?

 GEORGE 		What?  Yeah, sure.

 CESAR 		Whose cloths?  Your clothes?

 GEORGE 		My clothes, your clothes.  What does it
		matter?

 CESAR 		I would like to know the contents.
		Every detail is important.

 GEORGE 		What are we doing here, Diego?  This
		guy's a clown.  He's talking about
		clothes.

 CESAR 		I demand to know everything.  I do not
		trust six-hundred thousand dollars of
		coca to someone I don't know.

 GEORGE 		It's a lousy fifteen kilos.  I piss
		fifteen kilos.

 CESAR 		The coca is my responsibility!

 GEORGE 		You're a fucking amateur!

 DIEGO 		Gentlemen, please.  There is no need to
		be impolite.  Cesar, this will be fine.
		You have my word.  George, Cesar is just
		being thorough.  That's all.

 CESAR 		Very well.  But just remember, Mr. Jung.
		I will be with you the whole way.  And I
		will be watching.

 INT. LOGAN AIRPORT - CUSTOMS - 1976 - DAY 
	George carries the two Samsonites over to customs
	inspections.  It's a long walk.  George's heart beats hard.
	The sound is audible and grows with every beat.  BA-BUMP.  BA
	BUMP.  Cesar lurks at the baggage carousel.

 GEORGE (V.O.) 		When you're carrying drugs across the
		border, the idea is to remain calm.  The
		way I do it is to think of something
		pleasant, a fun party, a moment of
		triumph.  A sexual encounter.  I
		actually project myself to that place.
		Anything to keep your mind off the fact
		that you're going to jail for a very
		long time if they find the fifteen kilos
		of cocaine in your suitcases.

	George stands in front of the customs agent.  He tries his
	best to look relaxed as the agent reviews his documents.

 CUSTOMS AGENT 		On vacation?

 GEORGE 		Yes.

 CUSTOMS AGENT 		On vacation for only one day?

	BA-BUMP.  BA-BUMP.  The heartbeats are very loud.

 GEORGE 		    (weak smile)
		My brother's wedding.  Imagine that,
		huh?

	George's breathing is labored and his swallowing reflex
	doesn't seem to be working.  Cesar passes through, eyeballing
	George the whole time.

 CUSTOMS AGENT 		Open your bags, please.

	George opens the Samsonites.  Super dry mouth.  BA-BUMP.  BA
	BUMP.  The beats are deafening now.  Cesar nervously monitors
	the situation from the payphones.

 CUSTOMS AGENT (CONT'D) 		Whose clothes are these?

 GEORGE 		Mine.

	The customs agent holds up a woman's undergarment.  Cesar
	throws up his hands in frustration.

 CUSTOMS AGENT 		And this?

 GEORGE 		What can I tell you?  Different strokes.

	George winks at the customs agent, who shakes his head before
	finishing the inspection.

 CUSTOMS AGENT 		Alright, go ahead.

 EXT. LOGAN AIRPORT - PAYPHONES - CONTINUOUS 
	George moves to the payphones, sets down the two suitcases,
	and pretends to make a call.  Not inconspicuously, Cesar
	grabs the bags and walks quickly out of the terminal.

 INT. BASSETERRE HOTEL - ANTIGUA - 1976 - DAY 
	Diego, Cesar, George and JACK STEVENS, a silver haired
	executive type, lounge around the mini-suite.  Cesar still
	has that crazy look in his eye.

 DIEGO 		Three-hundred kilos it is, then.

	A beautiful Latin woman enters and kisses both Diego and
	Cesar.  Her name is INEZ, and friendly she is not.

 DIEGO (CONT'D) 		Has everyone met Inez?  This is George.
		I've told you about him.  And this is
		friend, Jack Stevens.

	The men proffer their hands, but she just looks at them like
	ants before sitting down next to Diego.

 DIEGO (CONT'D) 		Try to be more respectful, darling.  My
		apologies.  But she is mistrustful of
		Americans.  Shall we proceed?  Let's
		hear it again, Mr. Stevens.

 STEVENS 		I'll fly down on a Friday, refuel in the
		Bahamas, and then to Medellin.

 INEZ 		Friday?

	Inez addresses Diego and Cesar only.  She speaks in Spanish.
	The conversation is about "Why Friday?"  Inez has some
	problem with it.  Diego explains.  And Inez is reassured.

 DIEGO 		Please, continue.

 GEORGE 		We make the pick-up, refuel once more in
		the Bahamas, and fly back on Sunday with
		the mom and pop traffic.

 CESAR 		Why are you speaking?

 GEORGE 		Excuse me?

 CESAR 		You.  Your responsibility is over.  You
		do not fly.  You are not a pilot.  You
		are not a distributor.  You introduced
		us to Mr. Stevens and the use of his
		airplane.  That is all.  You make a
		percentage.  A generous one.  And you're
		lucky to get that.

 GEORGE 		I see.  How much?

 CESAR 		Padrino will pay ten-thousand per kilo.
		For everyone.  For you, and you, and
		you.

	He indicates George, Diego and Jack Stevens.

 CESAR (CONT'D) 		There is no negotiation.  Three-million
		dollars.  That is all.

 STEVENS 		I want two.

 GEORGE 		Gee, Jack, a million each had such a
		nice ring to it.

 STEVENS 		No way.  I'm doing all the work.  Taking
		all the risk, and it's my plane.

	Diego and George look at each other.

 STEVENS (CONT'D) 		Hey, you guys don't have to do shit.
		Just sit back and collect your money.

 GEORGE 		You good with this?

	Diego nods.

 GEORGE (CONT'D) 		Alright.

	This is too much for Inez to handle.  She starts screaming
	machine gun Spanish.  Something about a "lousy two-hundred
	and fifty-thousand dollars," and how Diego is "such a coward"
	to give away all his money.  Diego is embarrassed but tries
	to remain calm.

 DIEGO 		You will watch what you say.  Especially
		around George.  He is my brother and he
		speaks as good Spanish as you.

	But Inez is wild.  She starts in again, a log of "Putos
	(SOB's)", and "Cojones" and "Maricones (gay/sissys)."  Even
	Cesar is uncomfortable.  Diego stands.

 DIEGO (CONT'D) 		Okay.  That's enough.

 INEZ 		Get your hands off me.

	Inez takes a swing at Diego and catches him full across the
	face.  Time stops in the room.  Question.  What will Diego
	do?  Answer: SMACK!  Diego swings back and a full scale is
	on.  Cesar continues the conversation.  It's surreal.  As if
	Diego and Inez weren't beating the shit out of each other
	right in front of them.

 CESAR 		Do you have pictures of your kids?

 STEVENS 		What?

 CESAR 		I'll need to see them.  Also need their
		names and the names of their schools.
		We are trusting you with ninety million
		dollars worth of coca, Mr. Stevens.
		Without your children, there is no deal.

	Stevens thinks about it.  Kids as collateral.  Inez and Diego
	are still duking it out.  But Diego finally gets the upper
	hand and drags her into the bedroom.

 STEVENS 		Fine.  So if that's all, I'll be leaving
		now.

	Cesar walks him to the door.

 CESAR 		Don't forget the pictures.

	Diego calls from the other room.

 DIEGO (O.S.) 		George.  George, come in here.


 INT. LA BELLE MER - BEDROOM - LATER 
	Diego has put Inez in the bathroom and is holding the door
	closed.  She pounds and kicks and screams in frustration, but
	he pays no attention.

 DIEGO 		What's the matter, George?

 GEORGE 		What's the matter?  We're moving three
		hundred fucking kilos and we're making
		dogshit.

 DIEGO 		A million dollars for our first run is
		not bad, George.

 GEORGE 		It is bad.  It's chump change.  We might
		as well be hauling suitcases across the
		border.  We're getting screwed.

 DIEGO 		I know.

 GEORGE 		And what happens when these guys stop
		paying?  Sooner or later, these guys are
		going to cut us out.  Then where are we?

 DIEGO 		That's my George, always thinking.

	The door is yanked open to reveal Inez.  She is in a rage.
	Diego slams it in her face.

 DIEGO (CONT'D) 		This is only part of the business,
		George.  A very small part.  Don't
		worry, there is so much more to do.
		Which reminds me, I need a favor from
		you.  I must go to Colombia.

 GEORGE 		What is it, George?  Because I have to
		get home.  I've got a parole officer
		waiting for me.

 DIEGO 		I need you to go to Miami.

 EXT. VENETIAN KING APTS. - MIAMI - 1977 - DAY 
	George gets out of a taxi to find SEVERAL COLOMBIAN MEN
	hanging around outside an apartment.  He checks the address
	and moves over to the men.

 GEORGE 		I'm George.  Friend of Diego's?

	The Colombian men are not impressed.  They grab George and
	pull him inside.

 INT. VENETIAN KING APTS. - CONTINUOUS 
	George is pinned against the wall and the Colombian men all
	start screaming at him in Spanish.  There seems to be a
	problem.  A man, ALESSANDRO, steps forward.  He is the one
	who speaks English.

 ALESSANDRO 		QUIET!  Callate!  Where's Diego?

 GEORGE 		I don't know.  He sent me.  I'm George.

 ALESSANDRO 		Oh, I see.  George.  Well, that explains
		everything.  Open your mouth, George.

	George's puzzled look is replaced by a gun barrel in his
	face.  Alessandro presses it against George's front teeth.

 ALESSANDRO (CONT'D) 		Now, you listen to me.  Are you hearing
		me?

	George nods.

 ALESSANDRO (CONT'D) 		You see this?

	He indicates two duffel bags stuffed with fifty kilos of
	cocaine.

 ALESSANDRO (CONT'D) 		I've been holding this shit for him for
		three weeks.  You tell Diego I don't
		appreciate it.  You tell him I want my
		money by Friday.  Can you do that?

 GEORGE 		Um-hmm.

 INT. JUNG HOUSE - GEORGE'S ROOM - DAY 
	George sits on his bed, reading.  Two duffel bags are tucked
	away in the closet.  Ermine pokes her head in.

 ERMINE 		You have a phone call.

	George picks up the phone.

 DIEGO (O.S.) 		George.

 GEORGE 		Jesus Christ, Diego, where are you?
		It's been eleven days and these guys
		want their fucking money.

 DIEGO (O.S.) 		Bad news, George.  I'm in Colombia.

 GEORGE 		Well, you better get here fast.  I'm
		sitting on...

	George notices Ermine is loitering in the hallway,
	eavesdropping.

 GEORGE (CONT'D) 		Hi, Mom.

	George acknowledges her before shutting the door in her face.

 GEORGE (CONT'D) 		I'm sitting on fifty fucking keys.  Get
		your ass up here.

 INT. CARCEL DE VARONES - MEDELLIN, COLOMBIA - CONTINUOUS 
	It's a South American prison.  Diego is on the pay phone.

 DIEGO 		It's a little hard to get away right
		now.  I'm afraid you're on your own.

 INT. FOREAL'S HOUSE - MANHATTAN BEACH - 1977 - NIGHT 
	George and Derek sit in the living room with MR. T, a hippie
	ish looking professor.  On the table sits various
	paraphernalia.  Scales, beakers, test tubes, and a hot box.
	George and Derek watch as Mr. T scoops some of George's
	cocaine and sets it onto the two-inch metal plate.

 MR. T 		What we're doing is measuring the
		purity.  Pure coke melts out a hundred
		and eighty-five, a hundred and ninety
		degrees.  Cutting agents melt much
		lower.  About a hundred degrees.
		Quality product starts melting at a
		hundred and forty degrees.  That's what
		I'm hoping for.

	Mr. T turns the dial.  120.  130.  140.

 MR. T (CONT'D) 		Good.

 150. 160. 
 MR. T (CONT'D) 		Jesus Christ.

 170. 180. 
 MR. T (CONT'D) 		Holy fucking Mary!  Jesus, fuck me
		running!  Where did you get this shit!

	At one-hundred and eighty-seven degrees, the white powder
	dribbles off the hotplate and melts away.

 MR. T (CONT'D) 		Damn!  Can I do a fucking line?!

	Mr. T puts his nose in the powder.  George pulls Foreal
	aside.

 GEORGE 		What did I tell you?

 DEREK 		It's great and everything, but what am I
		going to do with all this?

 GEORGE 		Sell it?

 DIEGO 		Jesus Christ, George, I don't see you in
		two years, and you show up at my door
		with a hundred and ten pounds of
		cocaine?

 GEORGE 		Just sell it, Derek.

 DEREK 		Alright, but it's gonna take me a year.

 INT. THE WHIPPING POST - MANHATTAN BEACH - 1977 - NIGHT 
	Money everywhere.  All over the floor, the counters, the
	chairs, and even in the sinks.  George and Derek count the
	money patiently, writing the dollar amount in yellow high
	lighter on the top of each stack, before wrapping it with a
	rubber band.

 DIEGO 		Thirty-six hours.  I can't believe it.
		Everything is gone in thirty-six hours.

 GEORGE 		I think it's fair to say you
		underestimated the market there, Derek.

 DIEGO 		Touche.

 GEORGE 		But to the victor belong the spoils.

	George divides the money.  There's a hell of a lot.

 GEORGE (CONT'D) 		Half a million for you.  Half a million
		for me.  One-point-three five for the
		Colombians.

 DEREK 		Nice doing business with you, George.

 GEORGE 		Not bad for a weekend's work, huh?

 INT. AIRPORT - MIAMI - DAY 
	Immaculate in his white turtleneck and sunglasses, George
	walks with two aluminum cases.  He is greeted by Alessandro
	and his thugs.

 ALESSANDRO 		Greetings, Mr. George.

 GEORGE 		Where do you guys want to count?

 ALESSANDRO 		On the plane.

 GEORGE 		What plane?  We going someplace?  Where
		we headed?  You have your money.  It's
		all there.  What the fuck is going on?

	They usher him away.

 EXT. OLAYA HERRERA AIRPORT - MEDELLIN - DAY 
 SUPERIMPOSE: MEDELLIN, COLOMBIA 
	The lear jet lands.

 EXT. DESERTED SUGAR FACTORY - LOS RIOS, COLOMBIA - DAY 
	The blazer pulls into a long driveway.  They approach a gate
	where SHIRTLESS TEENAGERS with MAC-10's stand guard.  The
	gate opens.  YOUNG SOLDIERS open the door for George and
	roughly usher him over to a Jeep within the confine.  They
	frisk him top to bottom.  Diego is leaning against another
	Jeep and waits for George to be released.

 DIEGO 		George, good to see you, my brother.

 GEORGE 		What the fuck is going on?  When did you
		get out of jail?

 DIEGO 		Pablo used his influence.  Now, George,
		watch what you say.  Everybody hears
		everything.  A lot of things get said
		and done that, well, let's just say this
		isn't America.  Life is cheap here, you
		know?  No offense, but you know what I'm
		saying?

 GEORGE 		Yeah.  Keep my mouth shut and let you do
		the talking.

 DIEGO 		Right.  Now who is the person in
		California?  The connection?

 GEORGE 		Just a friend.

 DIEGO 		Who?  I need to know.  Ah, never mind.
		We'll talk about it later.

 GEORGE 		Yeah.  You do the talking.

	The sound of a young man, a MALETON, struggling can be heard
	in the distance.  From another area, PABLO ESCOBAR emerges.
	He is singular in purpose.  He is handed a pistol and moves
	quickly over to the man and quietly speaks a few words.  And
	then, without emotion, he shoots the maleton in the head.
	George and Diego, who is visibly shaken, watch.  Escobar is
	handed a towel, and he wipes the splattered blood off his
	hands, as he moves back.

 LARGE COLOMBIAN MAN 		He will see you now.
		    (to Diego)
		Not you.

 DIEGO 		There must be some kind of mistake.

 LARGE COLOMBIAN MAN 		No mistake.  Mr. Escobar will see Mr.
		Jung alone.  You are to wait here.

	George hesitates.

 DIEGO 		It's alright, George.  You go.

 LARGE COLOMBIAN MAN 		This way, please.

	The large Colombian man escorts George towards the area where
	the maleton was just shot.  George looks back at Diego as he
	is led away.

 ESCOBAR 		So, this is the man who takes fifty
		kilos and makes them disappear in one
		day?

 GEORGE 		Actually, it was three.

 ESCOBAR 		The man who gives us the airplanes.  The
		man from America.  The mafia.  Chicago.
		Boom boom.  Hollywood.  You are going to
		open for us the gates of Hollywood,
		George?

 GEORGE 		It would be my pleasure.

 ESCOBAR 		Good.  Very good.  Welcome, my friend.
		Welcome to my country.

	Escobar moves over to embrace George.  George returns it, and
	their hands come together.  George can't help it.  He
	reflexively looks at his hands.  Escobar understands.

 ESCOBAR (CONT'D) 		The man in the garden.  He was full of
		courage.

 GEORGE 		Un sapo?

 ESCOBAR 		Un rata - no good.  But he could have
		run, fled the country.  Gone to the
		policia.  But then his wife, his
		children, his parents, his friends, many
		people would die.

 GEORGE 		Yes.

 ESCOBAR 		But, never mind.  I am thinking we can
		do much together.  This problem with
		Diego, the stolen car, the jail, is very
		silly business.  To release him from the
		carcel, it causes me much inconvenience.
		The fifty kilos could have been a big
		problem.  And I don't like problems.

 GEORGE 		With all respect, Padrino.  Diego is my
		partner.  I do not do business without
		him.

	Escobar looks at him with a cold stare.  But George doesn't
	flinch.  His face reveals nothing.  Finally, a smile breaks
	across Pablo's lips.

 ESCOBAR 		I like you, George.  You are loyal.
		That is good.  That is rare.  Maybe
		crazy.  Yes.  I can tell already.  You
		are like me.  I look at you and I see
		myself.  It's in the eyes, no, George?

 GEORGE 		Yes, it is.

 ESCOBAR 		So, you are wanting to sell the cocaine
		for me in your country, George?

 GEORGE 		Yes, sir.  As much as you can give me.

 ESCOBAR 		As much as I can give you?  Ha ha.  Very
		good.  I like that.  Come, George.  Let
		us drive.  We have much to talk about.

	Diego watches the two men walk outside.  Escobar throws an
	arm around George's shoulder.  Pablo hops into a Jeep and
	motions for George.  The bodyguards come running.  But Pablo
	waves them away.

 EXT. MOUNTAINSIDE - COLOMBIA - DAY 
	Escobar pulls the Jeep off the road and parks it.  Before
	them is a stunning panorama.

 ESCOBAR 		I like to come up here.  To make the
		decisions.  To be one with nature.

 GEORGE 		It's beautiful.

 ESCOBAR 		People tell me that I am crazy.  That my
		business will never work in your
		country.  What do you think, George?

	Escobar looks out over the vista, allowing George the time to
	respond in full.

 GEORGE 		What do I think?  I don't want my answer
		to be influenced by what I want, so I'm
		going to have to say I don't know.

 ESCOBAR 		Yes.  I do not know, either.  What do
		you want, George?

 GEORGE 		I want money.

 ESCOBAR 		Yes.  Money.  Which is what, George?

 GEORGE 		Freedom.

 ESCOBAR 		Power?

 GEORGE 		Yeah, maybe.

 ESCOBAR 		Family.

 GEORGE 		Sure.

 ESCOBAR 		Beautiful girls?

 GEORGE 		Keep them coming.

 ESCOBAR 		Keep them coming?  Ah, yes.  Ha ha.  You
		are right.  But money.

 GEORGE 		Money.

 ESCOBAR 		And Diego?

 GEORGE 		Diego is my brother.

	Escobar looks at George a long time.  He's inscrutable.

 ESCOBAR 		Good.  Take care of him, George.  I'm
		fond of him, but he is sometimes like a
		baby.  Keep an eye on him, okay?

 EXT. DESERTED SUGAR FACTORY - ENTRANCE - DAY 
	Diego is a little pissed off for being left for so long.  He
	taps his foot and picks at his fingernails.  Escobar and
	George pull up in the Jeep.  Diego leaps to his feet.

 DIEGO 		Padrino.

	Escobar wraps his arms around Diego in an embrace.

 ESCOBAR 		Diego, mijo.  I've made a decision.  We
		are going into business and I would like
		to start right away.

 MONTAGE - GEORGE AND DIEGO TAKING OVER THE WORLD 
	The following images are overlaid with snow falling and money
	dropping through frame.  CLOSE SHOTS of George and Diego on
	the phone, wheeling and dealing, hands counting cash, and
	lines being drawn off mirrors.  The effect is surreal and
	dreamy.

 INT. WAREHOUSE - DAY 
	A duffel bag is unzipped, revealing bricks and bricks of
	cocaine.  Each marked with a "P."  A knife punctures one of
	the bricks.  A mound of white powder is brought up to a man's
	nose.  It's George who samples, and then it is sampled by the
	man he is doing business with.  The shot widens TO REVEAL all
	the participants and dozens and dozens of duffel bags.  A
	handshake seals the deal.

 INT. MIAMI HOUSE - NIGHT 
	George and Diego count.  It's ridiculous how much money there
	is.  The stacks are now waist high and spill into other
	rooms.  Inez is there, pacing the floor and rapid-fire
	talking on the phone.

 MORE STILL PHOTOS 
	George and Diego, the Banditos.  Cigars.  Champagne.  Arms
	around each other in camaraderie.  In Diego's yellow Ferrari.
	With Inez, sunning on a yacht.  More coke and more
	transactions.  When the deals are with Derek Foreal, Diego is
	always notably absent.

 INT. MIAMI HOUSE - NIGHT 
	The money is so high, it almost reaches the ceiling.  There
	is nowhere to put it.  George and Diego sit at the coffee
	table, dwarfed by the stacks of bills.  There is a
	discrepancy in the count.

 GEORGE 		Three million.  I counted it twice.

 DIEGO 		It's two-point-five, George.  I am sure.

	George starts to pick up the money.

 GEORGE 		I'm calling it three.

 DIEGO 		We're half a million off.

 GEORGE 		Fuck it.  I'm not counting it again.

 DIEGO 		Weight it.  If it's sixty pounds, it's
		three.  If it's fifty, it's two-point
		five.

 GEORGE 		I don't give a shit.  Close enough.

	George moves down the hall looking for a place to stack the
	money, but there is no more room.

 GEORGE (CONT'D) 		Where do I put this!?

 DIEGO 		Try the back bedroom.

	George opens the back bedroom door to find wall-to-wall
	money.  It's packed.

 GEORGE 		There's no room.

 DIEGO 		Try the closet.

	No luck there, either.  George drops the money on the floor
	and moves back into the living room.

 GEORGE 		We've got to do something about this.

 INT. BANCO DE FEDERALE - PANAMA CITY - DAY 
 SUPERIMPOSE: PANAMA CITY, PANAMA 
	George and Diego watch as their money is hauled into a huge
	wall safe.  Armed Panamanian soldiers stand guard.  The
	Panamanian officials and the BANK PRESIDENT oversee the
	proceedings.

 GEORGE 		Are you comfortable with this?

 DIEGO 		George, we've got sixty-one million
		dollars.  It's either here or someplace
		else.  We've got to put it somewhere.
		Unless you want to launder it.

 GEORGE 		And keep only forty-percent?  No thanks.

 DIEGO 		Then relax.  It's a federal bank.
		Guaranteed by the government.  And Senor
		Noriega has very lenient banking
		principles.  No questions.  No problems.
		All the pesados keep their money here.
		Even El Padrino.  What do you worry?
		Everyone knows we are with Escobar.  Who
		is going to fuck with us?

 INT. BANCO DE FEDERALE - PRESIDENT'S OFFICE - DAY 
	George and Diego sign papers.  The bank president
	congratulates them and hands them documentation.

 GEORGE 		I love it.

 BANK PRESIDENT 		I'm sorry.

 GEORGE 		I give you thirty-million dollars and
		you give me this little book.

 INT. BILTMORE HOTEL - BALLROOM - NIGHT 
	A huge reception.  All the pomp and circumstance Colombian
	money can buy.  Politicians.  Policemen.  And every smuggler
	north of Colombia.  George sits with Diego and Inez at the
	table of honor.  Inez is opening presents.  Diego's tipsiness
	is a little out of character, but hey, it's his wedding day
	and a little champagne never hurt anyone.  He drunkenly
	throws his arm around George's shoulder.

 DIEGO 		I'm married, George.  Me.  I can't
		believe it.  Can you believe I'm
		married, George?

 GEORGE 		You're a lucky man, Diego.

 DIEGO 		I love you, my brother, do you know
		that?

 GEORGE 		I love you too, man.

	George notices MIRTHA showing teeth across the room.

 GEORGE (CONT'D) 		I'll be right back, Diego.

 INEZ 		Look, honey, a power boat.

 DIEGO 		Great, baby, great!

	They kiss.  George walks across the dance floor directly
	towards Mirtha.

 GEORGE 		Hello.

 MIRTHA 		Hello.

 GEORGE 		Do I know you?

 MIRTHA 		I don't think so.

 GEORGE 		Why are you smiling?

 MIRTHA 		Why are you smiling?

 GEORGE 		I don't know.  My name is George.

 MIRTHA 		I know who you are, El Americano.
		Mister George.

 GEORGE 		What is your name?

	Cesar arrives.

 CESAR 		Mr. Jung, I see you've met my fiancee,
		Mirtha.

	He kisses her.

 GEORGE 		Mirtha.

 CESAR 		Diego needs to see you right away,
		please.  Excuse us, Amorcito.

	They leave.  George looks back, Mirtha is giving him more
	teeth.  George arrives at the table.  Various greetings.

 AUGUSTO 		Pleased to meet you finally, George.  I
		am Augusto Oliveras.

 GEORGE 		My pleasure, Augusto.  Diego has told me
		much about you.

 RAMON OCHOA 		Congratulations on your conquest of the
		West Coast.   How much bigger can we
		get?

 GEORGE 		Sky's the limit.  We're just beginning
		to tap the market.  If it's accepted by
		actors and musicians, the rest will
		follow.

	They all agree.  Mirtha still gives George the teeth from
	across the room.  Diego returns to the table.

 AUGUSTO 		We are talking about George's West Coast
		operation.

 DIEGO 		Ah, George's mystery man.

 RAFAEL OJEDA 		Yes, where is this man?  When do we meet
		him?

 DIEGO 		You don't meet him.  George keeps this a
		secret.  He's here meeting everyone,
		goes to Colombia and meets Pablo, but
		still keeps his secrets.  Even from his
		brother.

 JUAN CARLOS "THE GUAPO" 		Come on, George, we're all in this

 ERMINE 		It's all so beautiful.

 MIRTHA 		What do you think, Dad?

 FRED 		Yeah.  Nice.

 ERMINE 		Look at this credenza.  If you don't
		mind me asking, how much is something
		like that?  It's got to cost a fortune.

 GEORGE 		    (quickly)
		It's a family heirloom.

 ERMINE 		I've seen those in magazines.  They're
		not cheap.

 GEORGE 		Mirtha comes from a very wealthy family.

 ERMINE 		Oh, I see.

 MIRTHA 		Come on.  I'll show you the rest of the

 FRED 		Don't bullshit me, George.  I don't see
		you very much, I don't want to waste the
		time.

	They move along the rear of the house.  Classic cars line the
	driveway.

 FRED (CONT'D) 		You come from my body, remember?  You're
		my baby boy.  The same kid who would
		jump off a mountain if someone told him
		he couldn't do it.  You haven't changed
		much.  I know the things you do.  Not
		everything.  But I get the picture and I
		don't care.  I don't like it.  It's not
		what I would have chosen for you, but
		it's your life.  It doesn't have
		anything to do with me.

	He turns and looks at his boy.

 FRED (CONT'D) 		You're like your mother.  You love
		money.

 GEORGE 		Dad.

 FRED 		No, it's good.  You have a family.  It's

 GEORGE 		Yeah, Dad.  I'm happy right now.

 INT. HOLIDAY MOTEL - LITTLE HAVANA - 1978 - DAY 
	Diego puts a straw in his nose and snorts a big gakker.  His
	eyes are wide, his pupils dilated, and a weapon sticks out of
	the back of his pants.  He knocks the dust off his nose
	before moving outside.  George is on the porch, smoking a
	cigarette.

 DIEGO 		Three years.  How long have we been in
		business?  Three years.  Does she get to
		meet your connection?  Was she good
		enough?

 GEORGE 		Shut up, Diego.  They're going to be
		here any minute.  I'm trying to
		concentrate.

 DIEGO 		I'm very angry with you, George.  Very
		angry.  You don't take me to California,
		but you take your bitch wife?  A woman?
		I understand you love her, but it was
		you and me who started this.  You and
		me.

 GEORGE 		What do you need my connection for,
		Diego?  What are you going to do with
		it?

 DIEGO 		What do I do with it?  Nothing.  It's
		for peace of mind.  It's for the
		principle.

	George doesn't have time for this.  He checks the cylinders
	on his weapon and runs over possible scenarios in his mind.
	But Diego won't get off the soap box.

 GEORGE 		Jesus fucking Christ, Diego.  I ain't
		telling you.  It's just business.  Now,
		shut up.  You're driving me crazy.

 DIEGO 		I'm driving you crazy?  No.  You're
		driving me crazy.  We had a dream.  What
		happened to our dream?

	A black sedan pulls up and FIVE PUERTO RICAN MEN approach the
	room.  George and Diego greet them and lead them inside.
	It's game time.  The atmosphere is charged with danger and
	everyone is acutely aware of everything.  The guys sit down,
	their guns bulging through the inside of their suits.  The
	suitcases are opened.  The rules are the same.  No English.
	No raising voices.  No sudden movements.  George offers their
	leader, TONY, beers for his men, and is politely declined.
	The count starts.  George and Diego riff through ten thousand
	dollar bundles.  Diego is still acting pissy.  He's mumbling
	to himself, making faces, slamming the money all around.  The
	guys keep a close eye on him.  Diego finishes a stack, throws
	one of the bags on the ground.  The conversation is in
	Spanish unless otherwise indicated.

 TONY 		Algun problema?

 GEORGE 		No no no... no problema, amigo.  El
		dinero esta todo aqui.
		Lleves las "llaves" y mas tarde lo
		contaremos.  Okay?  No problem.

 TONY 		Que problema?  Nosotros esperamos.

	The pressure is getting to one of the hoods.  His name is
	BENNY.  He's got a crazy eye and he seems ready to snap.
	George resumes the count, but Diego won't get off it.

 DIEGO 		    (English)
		You embarrassed me, George.  You make me
		look very bad.

 BENNY 		Que esta diciendo?

 GEORGE 		Nothing.  Todo esta bien.

 DIEGO 		    (English)
		Everything is not alright.  I bring you
		in, and you slap my fucking face!

 GEORGE 		This is not the time, Diego.

	The men all reach for their pieces and all hell starts to
	break loose.

 TONY 		Hay algun problema?  Hablame!

 DIEGO 		    (English)
		You fucked me in front of my whole
		family!

 GEORGE 		Fuck you...I didn't fuck you.

 BENNY 		Maldita sea, que diablos esta diciendo?

 GEORGE 		Esta todo aqui, amigo...take the keys.
		Take 'em and go.

 TONY 		Que esta pasando aqui, jefe?

 DIEGO 		Sientese ye no se meta en lo que no le
		importa.

	The guns are out and pointed.  It's out of control now.

 GEORGE 		Take it easy!  Everything's okay!

 DIEGO 		Que es lo que quieren de me, hijueputas
		campesinos?

	George steps forward with the keys.

 GEORGE 		Take the fucking keys!

	BLAM!  Courtesy of Benny, George is hit.  The shoulder, the
	collarbone.  It's hard to tell.

 GEORGE (CONT'D) 		Estoy bien, okay?  Everything is
		alright.  There's no problem.  Okay?
		This never happened.  No one has to know
		anything about this.  Diego, I want you
		to calmly tell them where the fucking
		coke is.  Do it now.

 DIEGO 		Es un Ford blanco junto a una pick-up.

	Tony very carefully takes the car keys.

 GEORGE 		No problem, gentlemen.  Goodbye.

	The men slowly back out the door.  George looks at Diego.

 GEORGE (CONT'D) 		Derek Foreal.

 DIEGO 		What?

 GEORGE 		Derek Foreal.  Derek Foreal.  Derek
		fucking Foreal.  Alright?  The answer to
		all your dreams.  Are you happy now?

 EXT. LOS ANGELES INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT - DAY 
	George and Diego exit the terminal.  George's arm is in a
	sling.  The familiar sight of Derek Foreal is Lincoln
	Continental.

	The three men come together, and Diego and Derek are
	introduced.  The men's hands come together and the FRAME
	FREEZES on their handshake.

 EXT. EASTHAM HOUSE - UPSTAIRS - DAY 
	Fred pulls into the driveway in his new car and honks the
	horn.  Fred and Ermine get out of the car.

 FRED 		Hello, hello.

 INT. OLIVEROS MANSION - MIAMI - NIGHT 
	It's a New Year's Eve party.  A lavish Colombian celebration.
	George and a very pregnant Mirtha move through the crowd to
	find Augusto.

 AUGUSTO 		I'm so glad you two could make it.
		Mirtha, look at you.  So beautiful.  You
		look like you're about to burst.

 MIRTHA 		Thanks.  I am.  Where's Martha?

 AUGUSTO 		I don't know.  Drunk somewhere.  Try the
		bar.  And if you find her, tell her to
		come, it's almost midnight.

	As Mirtha leaves, Augusto throws his arm around George's
	shoulder.

 AUGUSTO (CONT'D) 		It's good you came down, George.  We
		need to discuss a few things.

 DIEGO 		Where's Diego?

 AUGUSTO 		He's not here, George.

 GEORGE 		Yeah, well where is he?  And who is this
		Norman K. guy?  That's all anyone is
		talking about.  Norman K.  Norman K.  Do
		I know him?

	Augusto lets out a big laugh.

 AUGUSTO 		Norman Cay is not a person.  He is an
		island, George.  In the Bahamas.  From
		what they say, it is free and it's
		Diego's new home.

 GEORGE 		What?

	Augusto throws an arm around George's shoulder.

 AUGUSTO 		Let us walk.  From what I understand,
		Diego has bought a hundred and sixty
		acres, a marina, a hotel, and an
		airstrip.

 GEORGE 		Motherfucker works fast.

 AUGUSTO 		The word is that soon he is to be king
		of the middle empire.  He is doing
		multiple runs right now and using the
		island as a jump-off point.

 GEORGE 		He what?

 AUGUSTO 		Yes.  Jack Stevens is already a very
		busy man.  Along with many others.  You
		shouldn't stay away so long.

 GEORGE 		That's impossible.  We can't be up and
		running.  Who's distributing?

	Augusto says nothing.  But the ball is dropping in Times
	Square.  10, 9, 8, 7...

 GEORGE (CONT'D) 		Oh, no.

	Happy New Year.  Streamers, confetti, and champagne.  George
	marches through the kissing guests and over to a phone.  He's
	steaming.  The music is up, so he has to scream.

 GEORGE (CONT'D) 		Hello, Derek?  This is George.  Am I
		wearing lipstick?
		I said, am I wearing lipstick?  Because
		when I'm getting fucked, I want to make
		sure my face is pretty.  You're buying
		directly from Diego, aren't you, you son
		of a bitch?

 INTERCUT 
	Derek Foreal in full New Year's regalia, complete with party
	hat.

 DEREK 		I don't want to get caught in the middle
		of this.  That's between you and Diego.

	George's face scrinches in pain.

 DEREK (CONT'D) 		It's nothing personal, George.  Just
		business.

 GEORGE 		Yeah.  I understand.  Just business.
		Right.  Fuck you.

	The song ends, and George is left standing there screaming.

 GEORGE (CONT'D) 		I bring you in, and this is how you
		repay me?  You little homo!  Hey, Derek?
		Derek?

 INT. OLIVEROS MANSION - DINING ROOM - 1979 - LATER 
	It's late.  The family is all there.  Fifteen, twenty strong.
	Cuban coffees all around.

 MIRTHA 		Que va hacer?

 AUGUSTO 		Que queres decir.  Que es lo que el va
		hacer?  Pues, no va hacer nada.

 MARIA 		Alguna cosa tiene que hacer.

 FAMILY MEMBER #2 		De otra manera, es un marica.

 FAMILY MEMBER #3 		Un hijueputa

 FAMILY MEMBER #1 		Maricon.

 FAMILY MEMBER #2 		Mira, vos sos responsable por el exito
		de Diego.

 FAMILY MEMBER #3 		El se esta burlando de vos.  Debes hacer
		algo, hombre.

 MARIA 		No Puedes hacer ni un culo.

 AUGUSTO 		El no va hacer nada.  Hay un problema.
		Aqui, hubo un error y nosotros lo vamos
		ha arreglar.

 BLANCA 		No le escusches a mi yerno.  A el solo
		le importa la plata.

	Blanca reaches into her purse, pulls out an ice pick folded
	in a piece of linen cloth, and puts it down in front of
	George.

 BLANCA (CONT'D) 		Vos lo tenes que matar, ahorita mismo.
		De lo contrario vas a quedar como un
		marica sin horror.

 FAMILY MEMBER #3 		Mejor dicho vos sos un aculillado.

 FAMILY MEMBER #1 		Maricon.

 BLANCA 		Sabes que, vos no tenes pantalones.
		Nadie te va a respetar.  Usa esto.  Deja
		solo un huequito tan pequeno, que ni
		sangre le va a salir a ese malparido del
		Diego.

 AUGUSTO 		Blanca, por favor.

 MIRTHA 		Mama, vos sos bien antigua.  Como lo va
		a matar con un picahielo.  Eso era en su
		tiempo, estamos casi ya en los ochenta.
		El lo va a meter un tiro, lo va a volar,
		le va a hechar un hijueputa carro
		encima.

 AUGUSTO 		Dejen la maricada pues!  No jodan!
		Nadie va a matar a nadie!  George,
		debemos hablarle al Patron, es la unica
		manera, mano.

 GEORGE 		No, no, no, no yo puedo arregarlo solo.

 EXT. NORMAN CAY - BAHAMAS - 1979 - DUSK 
	George cruises through the turqoise water of the Caribbean in
	a sport fisherman.  Before him is Norman Cay.  White sand
	beaches.  Beautiful.  Pristine.

 EXT. NORMAN CAY - DOCKS - DUSK 
	Waiting for him is Cesar.

 CESAR 		Good to see you, George.  It's been a
		long time.

 INT. THE YACHT CLUB - SUNSET 
	The Yacht Club is a tavern style bar that juts out over the
	water.  The crimson sky streaks the windows.  Diego looks
	like Che Guavera.  His hair is long, and a graying beard
	sticks through his gaunt face.  The bar has been taken over
	by Diego's BANDITOS.  Automatic weapons and PROSTITUTES
	accent this drunken setting.  George is escorted through the
	door by Cesar, and the room quiets.  All eyes on Diego and
	George.  Diego rises.

 DIEGO 		George, I am happy to see you.  How are
		you, my brother?

 GEORGE 		No more brothers, Diego.

 DIEGO 		Of course we are brothers.  Why do you
		say that?   You hurt me, George.

 GEORGE 		You fucked me, Diego.

 DIEGO 		I did not.

 GEORGE 		You went behind my back and you cut me
		out.

 DIEGO 		No, I never.  I would not do that,
		George.  Never.

 GEORGE 		I talked to Foreal, Diego.

	There is a pause.  Diego's goons ready their weapons as Diego
	scoops up a cringer with his pinky and sniffs.

 DIEGO 		Maybe you are right.  I did betray you a
		little bit.

	One of the men says something in Spanish and everyone laughs.
	George is furious.  He starts to tremble and his face turns
	red.

 DIEGO (CONT'D) 		Oh, boo hoo, boo hoo.  So sad, George.
		I stole your California connection.  So
		what?  Who introduced you to Pablo
		Escobar?  Me.  Who introduced you to
		your fucking Colombian wife?  Me.  Who
		protected you when my friend Cesar Roza
		wanted to slice your fucking throat,
		huh?  Who mad you millions and millions
		of dollars?  Me.  And what do I get in
		return?  This?  Accusations?  I have
		always given you everything, George, but
		that is over now.  This is my operation.
		My dream.  So go home, George.  Go back
		to your stupid little life.  You can
		sell half grams to your fucking
		relatives for all I care.  Because you
		are out!

	George lunges at Diego and is immediately grabbed.

 GEORGE 		You'd better kill me now, Diego, because
		you're a dead man.

 DIEGO 		George, don't be so emotional.  This is
		business.  Besides, I can't kill you,
		you are my brother.

	They lead him away.

 EXT. YACHT CLUB - CONTINUOUS 
	George is getting the shit kicked out of him.  His teeth
	broken, kicked in the head, the body, the groin.  His arm
	stomped.  Blood and broken bones.  It's a king size beating.
	The men prop him up and Cesar reaches back and hits him with
	a haymaker.  CRACK.  George's nose is broken.  Blood spurts
	everywhere.  George is dropped to the ground, spit on, and
	left for dead.

 CESAR 		Say "hi" to your pretty wife for me.

 EXT. HACIENDA LOS NAPOLES - COLOMBIA - POOL - DAY 
	A beautiful, sprawling estate.  A family barbecue, Colombian
	style, is in full swing.  Kids play soccer.  Zoo animals run
	wild together.

	George is led outside by TWO OVER-ARMED BODYGUARDS.  Pablo
	sees him and gives George a big hug.

 ESCOBAR 		George, you look terrible.

 GEORGE 		Yeah, well...

 ESCOBAR 		Diego?

 GEORGE 		Yeah.

 ESCOBAR 		Please.  Sit down.  We'll drink some
		scotch.

 GEORGE 		I didn't come here to drink scotch.

 ESCOBAR 		I see.  I'm sorry about this, George.
		I'm not happy about this situation.
		It's bad.  You now know who your Brutus
		is.

 GEORGE 		You know why I'm here.  You know what I
		have to do.  I came here for permission.
		Out of respect, Pablo.  This is
		bullshit, he's making me look like a
		punk.

 ESCOBAR 		It is very difficult.  Diego makes me a
		lot of money.  If Diego goes so does the
		money.  You were an excellent teacher,
		George.  When the student has learned
		well, the teacher is no longer
		necessary.  We must remember we have
		wives, friends, familia.  Even familia
		that has not been born.  But sometimes,
		we must forget as well.  I am like you.
		I must teach the lesson.  We want to
		teach the lesson.  But we cannot.  We
		must remember that life is the teacher.

 GEORGE 		You're saying life will take care of
		Diego?

 ESCOBAR 		Life will take care of everybody.
		Diego, me, you.  It is the teacher.

 GEORGE 		I get it.   I'm really pissed, Pablo.
		You know the DEA knows about Norman's
		Cay.  For Chrissakes, Diego worships
		Adolf Hitler and John Lennon, that's
		fucked up!

 ESCOBAR 		I'm sorry, George.

 GEORGE 		Yeah, well, what are you gonna do?  You
		and me, Pablo?  Are we good?

 ESCOBAR 		Of course, George.  We are beautiful.
		We are brothers.  Real brothers.  Not
		like Diego.  We started this, George.

	Escobar embraces George for a moment, and then George starts
	to move away.

 ESCOBAR (CONT'D) 		And, George?  The vengance?  It is best
		served cold.

 INT. EASTHAM HOUSE - GEORGE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT 
	Mirtha is sleeping.  She's so big, she looks like she's gonna
	explode.  George sits on the bed and rests his hand on
	Mirtha's face.  He looks like the Elephant Man.

 MIRTHA 		George.  Oh, Jesus Christ, George.  Look
		at you.

 GEORGE 		Shhh, honey, never mind.  It's alright.
		It's over.  I quit the business.  I'm
		out.

 MIRTHA 		Pablo said no?

 GEORGE 		Pablo said no.  It's all over.  And I'm
		never going back.  I have you.  We have
		the baby.  And there's nothing else.
		It's just the family now.  Shhh.  Sleep
		now.

 EXT. EASTHAM HOUSE - DAY 
	Fred, Ermine and Mirth are waiting for George in the car.
	Mirtha's water has broken.  Ermine honks the horn from the
	back seat and screams out the window.

 ERMINE 		George, it's time!  George!  George!

 INT. HOUSE - CONTINUOUS 
	George is high and in a panic.  He races around, trying to
	get a suitcase packed and find his keys.

 GEORGE 		Coming!

	He finally gets it together, but before he runs out the door,
	he does one last blast.

 INT. CAPE COD HOSPITAL - HYANNIS - MATERNITY - DAY 
	Mirtha is on the birthing table and screaming in pain.  She's
	crowning.  George wears hospital scrubs and a surgical mask.
	He and his saucer pupils hold Mirtha's hand in comfort.  The
	baby comes, and DOCTOR MICK BAY slaps it's behind and cuts
	the cord.  Tough ass Mirtha breaks down and sobs
	hysterically.  But something is wrong with George.  The color
	drains from his face.  He grabs his chest and falls over onto
	the floor.  The MEDICAL STAFF attends to him.

 GEORGE (V.O.) 		Watching my baby girl born did something
		to me.
		They talk about religious experiences, I
		didn't believe in religion.  But when
		Kristina Sunshine Jung came into this
		world, something in me changed.  I
		looked at her and I knew right then that
		I could never love anything but my
		daughter ever again.  It sounds sappy,
		but it was like, click, I knew what I
		was put on this planet for.  It was the
		greatest feeling I ever had followed by
		the worst feeling I ever had.

 NURSE 		He fainted.

 MIRTHA 		George!

	The doctor grabs George's wrist.

 DR. BAY 		He's in tachycardia.  George, your heart
		is racing.  Have you been using drugs?

 GEORGE 		Coke.

 DR. BAY 		Cocaine?  How much?

 GEORGE 		I don't know.  Maybe eighteen grams.

 DR. BAY 		In how long?  A week?

 GEORGE 		Today.

 DR. BAY 		Oh, Jesus, Get me a 12-lead e.k.g. and
		start an i.v. stat!  This man is having
		a heart attack.

 INT. CAPE COD HOSPITAL - HYANNIS - LATER 
	George lies in the recovery room, sedated, tubes everywhere.
	He's hooked up to IV's, monitors, and machines.  Dr. Bay
	enters.

 DR. BAY 		I've reviewed your toxicology report
		three times, George.  I've never seen
		anything like it.  Eighteen grams.
		The lethal dose is a gram and a half.
		You should be in the Guiness Book.

	George cracks a faint smile.

 DR. BAY (CONT'D) 		It's not funny, George.  You should be
		dead right now.  Absolutely.  I cannot
		come up with one logical explanation for
		why you're still breathing.  I'm not
		here to give you lectures, I've got no
		moral interest in what you do.  But,
		take it easy, George.  Stay with us a
		while.  You've got a daughter now.

 INT. EASTHAM HOUSE - DAY 
	Kristina is crying.  Daddy George to the rescue.  He picks
	her up, cuddles her.  Gives her a bottle and she quiets.

 EXT. EASTHAM HOUSE - FRONT YARD - 1980 - DAY 
	A one-year-old Kristina is being coaxed by George to take her
	first steps.

 GEORGE 		Come on.  Come on, honey.  You can do
		it.  Come to Daddy.

	Kristina tries, stumbles.  Gets up again.  She looks like a
	drunk, but she's doing it.

 GEORGE (CONT'D) 		Good girl!

	Mirtha enters.  She's all pinned out, dressed in Ungaro,
	Cartier, and dark sunglasses.

 GEORGE (CONT'D) 		Look, Mirtha.  She's walking.

 MIRTHA 		She did that before.

 GEORGE 		No.  These are her first steps.  Watch
		her.

 MIRTHA 		Yeah.  I know.  She did that before.

 GEORGE 		But this is...

 MIRTHA 		I said, I've seen it before.

 GEORGE 		Alright.

 MIRTHA 		Can you lift the furnace.  I need money.

 GEORGE 		Where are you going?

 MIRTHA 		Out.

 MONTAGE - SERIES OF SHOTS - 1980-85 
 HOME MOVIE STYLE & PHOTOGRAPHS 
	The years go by and they are SUPERIMPOSED as they pass.
	George, clean and sober, enjoying family life.  Healthy and
	happy.  Mr. Mom.  Mirtha looks worse and worse as her habit
	becomes bigger and bigger.  As George and Kristina grow
	closer and closer, Mirtha is stepping out on the town.
	Blowing money right and left.  Shopping with Mirtha, buying
	clothes, furs, and diamonds.  As Kristina gets older, WE SEE
	her birthday parties.  George and Kristina wearing paper hats
	and eating ice cream.  She's two years old, she's three,
	four, five, six...

 INT. EASTHAM HOUSE - 1985 - NIGHT 
	The Eastham house is all done up for a party deluxe.  Fully
	catered, with bartenders, waiters, music, the works.  And of
	course the three c's, champagne, caviar and Colombians.
	George is laughing with Augusto and Martha Oliveros, but when
	Derek Foreal appears in the doorway, George excuses himself
	and walks over.

 DEREK 		Happy Birthday, George.  Mirtha invited
		me.

 GEORGE 		Yeah.  She told me.

 DEREK 		Look, I'm sorry about everything.  I
		feel like an idiot.  You were right.  I
		did fuck you.  And then Diego fucked me.
		Cut me out, too.

 GEORGE 		I heard.

 DEREK 		I lost sight of everything.  Forgot who
		my friends were.

 GEORGE 		It's in the past.  I'm out of the
		business now, so forget about it.  No
		hard feelings.  We need to move on.  And
		besides, I'm sorry, too.

 DEREK 		You?

 GEORGE 		For calling you a homo.

 DEREK 		That was out of line.

	George throws his arm around Derek's shoulder.

 GEORGE 		Good to see you, Derek.

	Mirtha runs in with a giant crystal punch bowl filled with
	mother of pearl.  She holds it over her head triumphantly.

 MIRTHA 		Now let's fucking party, motherfuckers!
		Let's have some fucking fun.

 DEREK 		Jesus, is that Mirtha!?

	A very underweight Mirtha nervously runs around the party,
	shoving coke up everyone's noses.  She is gakked to the gills
	and out of control.  Her pupils a mile wide.

 DEREK (CONT'D) 		Christ almighty, George.  Feed her a
		cheeseburger or something.  What does
		she weight, eighty pounds?

 GEORGE 		I know.  She needs to slow down.  She's
		going to blow an O-ring.

	Singing.  The birthday cake is brought in, the candles are
	blown out and everyone cheers.
	Mirtha runs over to her husband, still holding the cocaine.
	She's sweaty, her hair matted down on one side.

 MIRTHA 		Happy birthday, baby.  Do a line.

	She tries to push a line up his nose.

 GEORGE 		No, that's alright.

 MIRTHA 		Oh fucking relax.  Let your hair down
		for once.  It's your fucking birthday,
		for Chrissakes.  You're such a fucking
		pussy.  I swear to G-d, I married this
		big time drug dealer and wound up with
		the maid.

	Mirtha's loud now and making a scene.  He thinks about it.

 GEORGE 		No honey, I'm alright.

 AUGUSTO 		A toast!  To Mister George Jung.  Mr. I
		95, north and south.  My brother-in-law.
		Happy birthday!

	Everyone raises their glasses.

 EVERYONE 		To George!

	A party guest comes running inside.

 PARTY GUEST 		Cops!  They're all over the place.

	The WAITERS, in their white jackets, exchange knowing looks.
	The BARTENDER comes out from behind the bar.

 BARTENDER 		Freeze!

	In an instant, all of the waiters' guns are out.

 WAITER 		Massachusetts State Police Department!
		Everybody on the floor!

 EXT. EASTHAM HOUSE - LATER 
	Police cars everywhere.  All the party guests are filed out
	the door, and are being led away.  Mirtha is dragged out,
	spitting and screaming.  George, in handcuffs, is pushed to a
	squad car.  He looks through the window to see a FEMALE
	POLICE OFFICER escorting Kristina out of the house.

 INT. M.P.D. - INTERROGATION ROOM - NIGHT 
	George, still dressed in his party clothes, sits at a desk.
	TWO DETECTIVES set a confession in front of him.

 GEORGE 		What's this?

 DETECTIVE #2 		It's your statement.  How it was all
		yours, the pound of coke was for
		personal use and none of the guests had
		any idea it was there, yeah, right.

	George looks through the papers.

 GEORGE 		I want my kid out of protective custody.
		Now.  No fucking around.  My wife and my
		kid on a plane tonight.  I sign when
		they call me safe and sound.

 DETECTIVE #1 		No fucking way.

 GEORGE 		Fuck you, then.  I sign nothing.

	The detectives ponder.

 DETECTIVE #2 		Do it.

	Detective #1 walks to the door.

 DETECTIVE #1 		George?  You better get yourself a good
		lawyer this time.  We're gonna nail your
		ass to the wall on this one.

 GEORGE 		Oh hey, one more thing?

 DETECTIVE #1 		What's that?

 GEORGE 		Get me a six pack.

 EXT. EASTHAM HOUSE - GARAGE - NIGHT 
	It's the middle of the night.  George walks through a dark
	and lonely house.  He goes to the furnace, opens it up and
	sees that there are only five stacks left.

 GEORGE 		Fuck.

 EXT. JUNG HOUSE - WEYMOUTH - PORCH - MORNING 
	George pulls up to the front.

 GEORGE 		Hi.

 FRED 		I heard.  Ermine, your son is here.

 ERMINE (O.S.) 		Tell him I don't want to see him.  Tell
		him he's not welcome here.

 GEORGE 		Mom.

	Ermine's back is to George.  She won't look at him.

 ERMINE 		Don't you dare step one foot in this
		house.  You're not my son, you hear me?
		I don't have a son anymore.

	She disappears into the house.  The sound of a door slamming.

 FRED 		She's angry.  It's all over the news.

 GEORGE 		Yeah.  Listen.  I'm going to be going
		away for awhile.

 FRED 		You're not going to trial?

 GEORGE 		No.

 FRED 		Good.

	They stand there and look at each other for a while.  There's
	a lot to say but nothing's coming out.  George hands Fred a
	gym bag.

 GEORGE 		Give this to Mom, will you?

 FRED 		Money.  You and your mother.  All the
		time chasing it.  I never understood it.

 GEORGE 		Give it to her, Dad.  It'll make her
		happy.

 FRED 		Yeah, I know.  This is it, isn't it?

	The two men throw their arms around each other and hold on to
	one another in the doorway of the old house.

 GEORGE 		Tell Mom, you know...

 FRED 		I'll tell her.

	George breaks away and moves to the T-bird.

 FRED (CONT'D) 		Take care of yourself.

 INT. BANCO DE FEDERALE - PANAMA CITY - 1985 - DAY 
	George walks through the bank.

 INT. BANCO DE FEDERALE - PANAMA CITY - CONTINUOUS 
	George sits at a desk in front of a Panamanian BANK EMPLOYEE.
	He slides his bank book across the table.

 GEORGE 		I'd like to make a withdrawal.

	The employee opens the book and gets a funny look on his
	face.  Nervous.

 BANK EMPLOYEE 		Excuse me, please.

	He gets up and moves to the BANK MANAGER.  They move to
	another MANAGER TYPE.  And another.
	And then everyone disappears behind closed doors.  Finally,
	the BANK PRESIDENT emerges and moves over to George.

 BANK PRESIDENT 		I'm afraid there is a problem, Mr. Jung.
		The banks have gone through a change, a
		nationalization.  I'm afraid your funds
		have been appropriated by the Panamanian
		Government...

	George starts to shake.  The bank president tries to explain,
	but whatever he says is unimportant.  George is paralyzed.

 INT. APARTMENT - LIBERTY CITY, FLORIDA - NIGHT 
	An inexpensive one-bedroom furnished apartment.  It ain't
	much, but it's home.  Mirtha has just received the news and
	is losing her mind.  Clara Blanca is cooking dinner.

 MIRTHA 		What are we going to do?!  What are we
		going to use for money?!

 GEORGE 		Please, Mirtha.  I'll start working for
		Augusto.  I'll talk to him tonight.
		I'll do something.

 MIRTHA 		Don't touch me.  Tell me.  Just answer
		the question.  What do I spend?  What?
		How will we live?

	Kristina sits there.  She hears everything, so does Clara
	Blanca.

 GEORGE 		Not in front of the kid.

 MIRTHA 		Don't give me that shit.  You just
		better do something.

	She storms into the bedroom and slams the door.  George
	stands there.  Awkward silence.  George goes to Kristina.

 GEORGE 		Everything's gonna be okay, sweetheart.
		Don't be upset.

 KRISTINA 		What's happening to us?

	Tough question to answer.

 GEORGE 		I don't know.

 KRISTINA 		Are we gonna split up?

 GEORGE 		No, never.  Don't even think about that,
		it's impossible.  I love your mother.
		And you are my heart.  Could I live
		without my heart?  Could I?

	Kristina nods "no."  They embrace.

 INT. GEORGE'S THUNDERBIRD - MIAMI - NIGHT 
	The car moves along I-95.  George is driving while a jacked
	up Mirtha does a speed bump.  A cop is following in the
	distance.  It is not okay.

 GEORGE 		There's a fucking cop behind us, Mirtha.
		Be cool, will ya.

 MIRTHA 		Fuck you, George, just fucking drive.

 GEORGE 		Hey, why don't you just put a "I'm doing
		cocaine" sign on the car.  What is your
		fucking problem?

 MIRTHA 		My problem?  We're broke, that's my
		fucking problem.  And you're a fucking
		spy.

 GEORGE 		What?

 MIRTHA 		That's right.  Always spying, always
		judging.  Everyone's laughing at you,
		you fucking pussy.  You let Diego fuck
		you in the ass.  Maybe you are a fucking
		faggot.  You must be fucking Diego
		because you're not fucking me.

	Mirtha grabs nuts.

 GEORGE 		Those are my nuts!

	George tries to fend her off.  The car swerves all over the
	road.  It's turned into a full scale fist fight.  The red
	lights of Florida's finest come up behind them and George is
	pulled over.

 EXT. I-95 - CONTINUOUS 
	Mirtha leaps out of the car, teary eyed, crazed and bloodied.
	The policemen step from their car.

 MIRTHA 		He's a fugitive and a fucking cocaine
		dealer!  There's a kilo in his trunk
		right now!  Take this sorry motherfucker
		to jail!

	George sits behind the wheel.  He knows it's over.

 INT. M.C.I. WALPOLE - VISITING AREA - 1989 - DAY 
 SUPERIMPOSE: FOUR YEARS LATER 
	Visiting day.  Inmates sit across from their families.
	Mirtha is sitting at the glass.  George walks to his seat.

 MIRTHA 		I'm divorcing you, George.  I'm getting
		custody of Kristina.  And when you get
		out next week, you're going to pay
		support and that's the end of it.
		Alright?  There's someone else.  I'm
		sorry.

	George just looks at her.  His face is stone.  But he is
	moved.

 MIRTHA (CONT'D) 		You should have taken better care of me,
		you know?  You've been away a long time.
		Four years.  Say something.

 GEORGE 		What do you want me to say?  I'm in
		prison.  You should know.  You put me
		here.

 MIRTHA 		Fuck you, George.  I knew you'd say
		something like that.  Always thinking
		about yourself.

	She moves away and drags nine-year old Kristina into the
	room.
	Kristina yanks her arm away and they get into a heated
	argument.  Through the glass, George can't hear the words but
	it's clear that Kristina doesn't want to be here.

 GEORGE 		My baby.  She's so big.

	Mirtha forces Kristina over to the glass and keeps showing
	her, prompting her to talk.  Kristina stares at George
	through the glass.  Cool.  Defiant.  Angry.  She picks up the
	phone and speaks, every word an accusation.

 KRISTINA 		I thought you couldn't live without your
		heart.

	She drops the phone, walks away, and doesn't look back.

 INT. PHONE BOOTH - MIAMI STREETS - DAY 
	George puts in the quarters.

 GEORGE 		Hello, Derek?  It's George.  Yeah.
		Yeah, I am.  I'm in Miami.  I'm looking
		to do something.  I want to put together
		a crew.  Do you know anybody?  Leon?  I
		don't know him.  What's his last name?
		Alright.  Give me the number.

 EXT. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - MIAMI - DAY 
	Nine-year old Kristina Jung leaves school.  George, fresh out
	of prison, moves across the street to meet her.

 KRISTINA 		What are you doing here?

 GEORGE 		Nothing.  I just wanted you to know I
		was out.  I just wanted to see you.

 KRISTINA 		Well, here I am.  See?

 GEORGE 		How are you doing?

 KRISTINA 		George, you just can't show up, tell me
		you love me, and have everything be
		okay.

 GEORGE 		Dad.

 KRISTINA 		What?

 GEORGE 		You can call me Dad if you want.

 KRISTINA 		I don't want, alright?  It's not funny.
		I'm really pissed off, George.  You blew
		it, now leave me alone.

 GEORGE 		Kristina, c'mon, I'm sorry.  I'm going
		to make this right.  I've got a few
		things going on...

 KRISTINA 		What do you want from me?

 GEORGE 		Just to walk with you.  I want to be
		your dad again.

 KRISTINA 		Do what you want, it's a free country.

	She walks away.  He follows.

 INT. THE PALM LOUNGE - MIAMI - DAY 
	George sits at the bar with a man named LEON MINGHELLA.

 LEON 		It's a four-man operation.  Two on the
		ground.  Two in the air.

 GEORGE 		Who's the co-pilot?

 LEON 		You're looking at him.  We provide the
		plane, transportation cost, U.S. landing
		spot, and take it to wherever you want
		it to go.  You provide the pick up point
		in South America, and are responsible
		for payment.  You assume all the bust
		risks.  We take sixty-five percent of
		all transportation fees, ten percent of
		the gross, plus our expenses.
		This is not a negotiation, so if this is
		okay with you, we can talk further.  If
		not, we can forget we had this
		conversation.

 GEORGE 		Sounds fine.  I'll need to meet
		everybody.

 LEON 		They're over at the booth.

	Leon leads George over.

 LEON (CONT'D) 		Gentlemen, this is George.  George, this
		is Ben, G.G. and...

	George's eyes widen as he looks at the last man.  It's Kevin
	Dulli.

 GEORGE 		Holy shit, Dulli!

 KEVIN 		Georgie, oh man, hold the mayo!

 GEORGE (V.O.) 		That was it.  Seeing Dulli after
		fourteen years sealed the deal for me.
		The rest was just details.  My end was
		roughly five-hundred thousand.  Kristina
		and I could have a good life for five
		hundred grand.  Start over somewhere.
		One final score.  That's all I needed.

 INT. OLIVEROS MANSION - MIAMI - DAY 
 AUGUSTO 		Three-hundred kilos is a very big load,
		Georgie.  Why don't we start small?

 GEORGE 		No.  I have the space.  I figured it
		out.  This is what I want to do.

 AUGUSTO 		Alright.  I'll ask Pablo, tell him it's
		for you.  I don't think there will be a
		problem.

 GEORGE 		Five-thousand per kilo.

 AUGUSTO 		Ha ha.  That's too much, Georgie.  Those
		days are over.  The rate is one-thousand
		dollars.  Inflation, you know?

 GEORGE 		This is a one time thing, Gusto.  One
		and I'm out.  Give me a good price for
		old time's sake.  What do you think?

 EXT. RESIDENTIAL STREET - MIAMI - DAY 
	George and Kristina walk through the neighborhood.  He
	carries her books.

 GEORGE 		Let me ask you something.  If you could
		go anywhere in the world, anywhere,
		where would you want to go?

 KRISTINA 		You mean, like a trip?

 GEORGE 		Yeah, sure, whatever.

	Kristina thinks about it.

 KRISTINA 		I don't know.  Maybe California.

	George is amused by her answer.

 GEORGE 		California?  You can go anywhere in the
		world.  India.  Tibet.  Australia.
		Paris.  And you choose California?

 KRISTINA 		Yeah.

 GEORGE 		What is it?  A Disneyland thing?

 KRISTINA 		No.  I just kind of like the sound of
		it.

 GEORGE 		California, huh?

 KRISTINA 		California.

	They turn a corner and arrive at Kristina's house.  Mirtha is
	standing in the doorway.

 GEORGE 		Go on inside now.  I want to talk to
		your mom alone.

	He kisses his daughter goodbye.

 KRISTINA 		Bye, Dad.  See you in the morning, okay?

 GEORGE 		I'll be here.

	George moves over to Mirtha.  It's been a while.

 MIRTHA 		What do you want?

 GEORGE 		You knew I was seeing Kristina, right?

 MIRTHA 		Yeah.  She told me.  You walk her to
		school.

 GEORGE 		Yeah, so I've been thinking.  I love
		her, y'know?  I kind of want to have
		her.  I've been away for so long.  Make
		up for the missed time, you know?

 MIRTHA 		I haven't seen one dollar from you.  You
		haven't paid me one cent in child
		support, alimony.

 GEORGE 		Yeah, well.  I'm working on that.  I've
		got something going.

 MIRTHA 		Yeah?  I better see some money out of
		it.

 GEORGE 		Yeah, you will.  Of course.

	Mirtha looks at her ex-husband.  It's not all bad.

 MIRTHA 		Hey, look.  You start paying, who knows
		what will happen.  You're a good father,
		George.  I always gave you that.  But
		you've got to talk to her.

 GEORGE 		Yeah.

 MIRTHA 		She's getting big.  Getting her own
		ideas.

 GEORGE 		I know.  Well, that's all I really
		wanted to say.  So, okay, then.

	He moves down the steps and heads for the sidewalk.

 MIRTHA 		Hey, George.  You okay?

 GEORGE 		Yeah.  I'm fine.  I'm good.

 INT. THE PALM LOUNGE - DAY 
	The restaurant is filled with the team.  They discuss, argue,
	re-examine every little detail.

 KEVIN 		We take off from Lauderdale, Sunday,
		refuel, and be in Medellin by Monday.

 LEON 		Overnight, refuel, and back Wednesday
		night.

 GEORGE 		Where are you coming in?

 BEN 		Vero Beach.

 G.G. 		It's good.  It's small.

 LEON 		Then we drive it to the Lauderdale house
		where it stays until pick up and payment
		the next morning.  You want to go over
		it again?

 GEORGE 		No.  All set.  Piece of cake.

 INT. GEORGE'S STUDIO APARTMENT - MIAMI - NIGHT 
	George is cooking dinner for Kristina.  He's only got a hot
	plate so it's slow.  The table is set with plasticware.
	Kristina chops the salad.

 GEORGE 		I'm thinking about getting out of town
		this week.  You want to come with me?

 KRISTINA 		Where are you going?

 GEORGE 		I don't know.  Maybe California.

 KRISTINA 		You swear?

 GEORGE 		Yeah.  Go out there, check it out, see
		what it's like.  I've got some stuff to
		do this week, but I'm thinking maybe
		Thursday.  Thursday after school.

 KRISTINA 		You know I can't.  Mom will never let me
		go.

 GEORGE 		You let me take care of your mother.
		You just pack your bags.

 KRISTINA 		But I've got school.

 GEORGE 		There's schools in California.

 KRISTINA 		You swear?

 GEORGE 		That's right.  Three o'clock.  Thursday.
		At your mother's.  You and me.  It's a
		date.

 KRISTINA 		I don't believe you.

 GEORGE 		I swear.  On my life.

 KRISTINA 		Swear on my life.

 GEORGE 		I swear on your life.

 EXT. VERO BEACH AIRFIELD - DUSK 
	George, Ben and G.G. wait on the tarmac.  George is pacing.
	The sound of a Cessna is heard and soon it is dropping out of
	the sky.  The plane lands and taxis over.

	Kevin and Leon stick their fists out of the airplane in
	triumph.  The men quickly unload the plane into the trunks of
	two Broncos and the back of a truck.

 INT. FT. LAUDERDALE HOUSE - NIGHT 
	WE FOLLOW the duffel bags out of the Bronco into the house.
	The boys sit around as George samples the product.

 KEVIN 		Are we good?

 GEORGE 		Are we good?  Yeah, we're good.  We're
		beautiful.  We're perfect.  This is A
		grade, one-hundred percent pure
		Colombian cocaine, Ladies and Gentlemen.
		Disco shit.  Pure as the driven snow.
		Good riddance.

	He looks the boys over.

 GEORGE (CONT'D) 		You saved my life, Dulli.  You'll never
		fucking know.  All you guys.  Everyone
		just got a raise.  Instead of ten
		percent, you get fifteen.

 LEON 		Jesus, George, fifteen percent.  That's
		an extra two-hundred large.

 GEORGE 		I don't give a shit.  Split it up.  Have
		a great life.  I'm done.  I'm out.
		Starting over.  Cheers.

	They clank.  George gets up and does the Snoopy Dance to the
	bathroom.

 GEORGE (CONT'D) 		Yeah!  Unbelievable.  Dulli, pour us
		another round.  I gotta hit the head.

	George leaves the room.  The camera slowly pans back to the
	guys.  Something doesn't look right.  They have not moved.
	They look bummed.  Leon looks at G.G.

 LEON 		What?

 G.G. 		I feel bad.

 BEN 		Me too.  He's not such a bad guy.

 KEVIN 		Fuck you guys.  All of you.  I've known
		him for thirty fucking years.  Fucking
		George.

 LEON 		Yeah, I like him, too.  But what's done
		is done.  So let's not get all
		sentimental about it, okay?

	The CAMERA PANS BACK SLOWLY to the bathroom door, George
	comes back into the room, dancing.  He goes and sits down
	with the guys.

 GEORGE 		    (laughing)
		Dulli, I was just thinking about that
		time we landed in Mexico.  You've gotten
		a lot better since then, huh pal?
		Remember that fucking landing strip?
		Huh?

	George is the only one smiling.  No one is looking at him.

 GEORGE (CONT'D) 		Hey, what's wrong fellas?  Why the long
		faces?

	He looks at each one.  He slowly realizes something's up.  He
	looks to Dulli finally.

 GEORGE (CONT'D) 		    (defeated)
		No.  C'mon, Dulli.

	The front door busts down, agents pour in.  The CAMERA SWISH
	PANS to George.  Lights out.  Slow motion.  Slow dolly into
 XCU.

 GEORGE 		Oh, no.

 INT. FT. LAUDERDALE HOUSE - 1989 - DAY 
	The voices from the bust can be heard as the CAMERA PUSHES
	SLOWLY into George's face.  Surreal.

 GEORGE (V.O.) 		I was busted.  Set up by the FBI and the

	George is led into a small room and greeted by his lawyer,
 ARCHIE ZIGMOND. 
 ZIGMOND 		Here's the deal, George.  You're not
		getting out.  I tried to get you
		furloughed, but your mother squashed it.
		Said it would only upset him.  I'm
		sorry.

	George takes it in.  Blinks.  The years have not been kind.

 GEORGE 		How's he doing?

 ZIGMOND 		Well, he's out of the hospital, but
		there's not much anyone can do for him.
		It's just a matter of time.  Listen, I
		brought a tape recorder in case you
		wanted to say something to him.  That
		way he could hear your voice.

 GEORGE 		Right.

	Zigmond sets the tape recorder down and leaves the room.
	George stares long at the machine.  He pushes the record
	button and looks at the red light.

 GEORGE (CONT'D) 		Hello, Dad...

 EXT. JUNG HOUSE - DAY

	George's eyes well up and he sparks a cigarette, as he keeps
	trying to tell his father goodbye.

 GEORGE (V.O.) 		And that time you told me that money

 GEORGE 		I guess I kind of lost sight of things.
		"May the wind always be at your back and
		the sun always upon your face, and the
		winds of destiny carry you aloft to
		dance with the stars."  Love, George.

 FRED 		That was a beautiful message.

 GEORGE 		I meant every word of it.

 FRED 		Did you know I died two weeks after you

 INT. OTISVILLE F.C.I. - NEW YORK - 1990 - DAY 
	George is led into the room where THREE FBI MEN await him.
	One of them is named FRED GARCIA.

 GARCIA 		How are you doing, George?

 GEORGE 		What do you guys want?

 GARCIA 		You hear about your old friend, Diego?

 GEORGE 		What about him?

	Garcia tosses a newspaper onto the table.  The Miami Herald.
	Inside is a full page letter addressed from Diego Delgado to
	Vice President George Bush.  In the letter, Diego offers to
	make a deal.  In exchange for immunity, Diego will rat out
	the entire cocaine business.  Americans, Colombians, Noriega,
	Escobar, everybody.  Just let him free.

 GEORGE (CONT'D) 		What the fuck?  Is he going to walk?

 GARCIA 		He's going down, George.  It's election
		year.  We're not making any deals.

 FBI GUY #1 		He's never getting out.  Orders from the
		top.

 GARCIA 		So, how would you like to help us put
		him away?

 FBI GUY #2 		We've done our homework.  We know you
		hate this motherfucker.

 GEORGE 		I don't think so.

 GARCIA 		Don't be stupid, George.  We've got him.
		We've got him dead to rights.  But like
		I said, this is top priority so we're
		handing out free passes on this one.
		And the first one's got your name on it.
		Cut your sentence in half, maybe more.

 GEORGE 		No thanks, fellas.  You've got the wrong
		fucking guy.  I'm not a rat.

 GEORGE 		Mirtha, what's going on?  Everything
		okay with Kristina?

 MIRTHA 		Kristina's fine.

 GEORGE 		Is she here?  Is she coming?

 MIRTHA 		Is she here?  George, Kristina hates
		you.  You fucked her over one too many
		times.  And I'm not here to socialize.
		Did you hear about Diego?

 GEORGE 		Yeah.

 MIRTHA 		Well, I got a call from Pablo.  He said
		this thing with Diego is a disaster.
		He's giving up lab locations, names,
		bank accounts, he was very pissed off.
		Pablo said to take him down.  His exact
		words were "Fuck Diego."

 GEORGE 		He wants me to testify?  Is that what
		he's asking me to do?

 MIRTHA 		George, he wasn't asking.

	Mirtha gets up and starts to move away.

 GEORGE 		Mirtha, how are you doing?

 INT. COURTHOUSE HALLWAY - JACKSONVILLE - 1990 - DAY 
	George, Archie Zigmond and two armed guards walk down the

		us get a cocktail after this is all
		over?

 ZIGMOND 		I'll see what I can do, George.

 GEORGE 		Thanks, Arch.

	They walk into the crowded courtroom.

 INT. COURTHOUSE HALLWAY - JACKSONVILLE - 1990 - DAY 
	Packed.  Nuts.  Standing room only.  The courtroom buzzes as
	George is led down the center aisle and is handed off to the
	bailiff.  Over this we hear...

 CLERK 		Sir, please state your name.

 GEORGE 		I'm George Jung.  Spelled J-U-N-G.

 CLERK 		Thank you.

 PROSECUTOR 		Mr. Jung, do you know Diego Delgado?

 GEORGE 		Yes, I do.

 PROSECUTOR 		Do you see him here in the courtroom?

 GEORGE 		Yes, he's sitting right there at the end
		of the table.

 PROSECUTOR 		Let the record state the witness has
		identified, Diego Delgado.

	The following sound bytes are dissolved together in montage
	style...

 PROSECUTOR (CONT'D) 		Mr. Jung, can you describe the
		circumstances of how you began talking
		about cocaine with Mr. Delgado?

 GEORGE 		Shortly after I arrived at Danbury
		Federal Correctional Institute I related
		to Diego that the crime I was in for was
		smuggling marijuana.
		Diego told me he had high level
		connections in Colombia and they needed
		to find someone to help them transport
		cocaine into America...

 GEORGE (CONT'D) 		The first run was fifteen kilos, which
		we smuggled into Logan Airport in hard
		shelled suitcases.

 GEORGE (CONT'D) 		We wrapped the cocaine in kitchen
		cabinet paper, and duct tape, that way
		if there were any dogs in customs...

 GEORGE (CONT'D) 		I introduced Diego to a pilot named Jack
		Stevens, who helped us fly 300 kilos of
		cocaine per week into the United States
		via twin-engine Cessnas.  Jack would fly
		into North Carolina, we'd meet him there
		and drive it down to different
		distribution points...

 GEORGE (CONT'D) 		I never met Pablo Escobar.  Diego
		Delgado was my only connection to
		cocaine from Colombia...

 GEORGE (CONT'D) 		Diego convinced me to keep most of my
		money in a Panamanian bank.  Diego had a
		close relationship with Manuel Noriega.
		In exchange for allowing us to keep our
		money there, we paid him a percentage.

 GEORGE (CONT'D) 		There was an 85% chance that if you
		snorted cocaine between 1977-1984, it
		was ours. Initially with my LA
		connections, we invented the
		marketplace.  In 1977, there was no
		other real competition.

 GEORGE (CONT'D) 		The first year we made about 100 million
		dollars between us.  It was an expensive
		operation.  Eventually we built up to
		three different pilots doing multiple
		runs per week, connections on both
		coasts, everything was running smooth.
		We were like a corporation...

 GEORGE (CONT'D) 		he was very anti-government.  He talked
		about revolution, forming his own
		country or island, he was looking for
		power as well as money.  I was just
		looking for money.

 GEORGE (CONT'D) 		He disliked the United States, thought
		it was a police state.  He hoped that by
		flooding the country with cocaine, it
		would disrupt the political system and
		tear down the morality of the country.

 GEORGE (CONT'D) 		Well, yes, Derek Foreal was my
		connection, I met him back in 1968 when
		I first moved to Manhattan Beach.  It
		was Foreal's marijuana connections that
		kicked off our cocaine market.

 GEORGE (CONT'D) 		Yes, it was my idea to bring the kilos
		to Los Angeles.  When Diego finally got
		Derek Foreal's name from me, it was only
		a matter of months before he'd cut me
		out.

 GEORGE (CONT'D) 		I'm not sure how my relationship with my
		daughter and ex-wife have anything to do
		with this trial.  I mean we're here to
		talk about Diego Delgado, aren't we?

 CALIBANOS 		Yes, we are Mr. Jung.

	We come out of the montage, the defense attorney Diego
	Delgado, Joe Calibanos, a sleazy-Greek-like-ex-basketball
	weight lifter guy is now doing the questioning.

 CALIBANOS (CONT'D) 		Mr. Jung, you're a convicted felon,
		correct?

 GEORGE 		Yes, I am.

 CALIBANOS 		Do you have any agreement or
		understanding whatsoever with the United
		States government in regards to your
		testimony?

 GEORGE 		No, I cam here out of my own volition.

 CALIBANOS 		Excuse me?

 GEORGE 		Something about vengance being best
		served cold.

 CALIBANOS 		Really.  Are you getting paid, Mr. Jung?

 GEORGE 		Excuse me?

 CALIBANOS 		Mr. Jung, don't you have an agreement or
		understanding with the United States
		Government in connection with your
		testimony in this case?

 GEORGE 		I'm doing sixty years at Otisville, no
		chance of parole.  Even if they cut my
		sentence in half I'll be seventy-three
		years old.  That's some fucking deal.  I
		don't know if the parole board, the
		judge, the pope or Jesus Christ himself
		can get me out of here.  I have a really
		bad record, I'm not sure what's going to
		happen.

 CALIBANOS 		So you do have an agreement with the
		United States Government, Mr. Jung,
		correct?

	George can't respond.  Looks to Diego.  Looks from the jury,
	the judge, George is on the spotlight and it's uncomfortable.
	He feels suddenly sleazy.

 CALIBANOS (CONT'D) 		I thought so.  No more questions.

	Silence.  The judge tells George he can step down.  Calibanos
	laughs quietly with associates.  George is bummed.  He walks
	by Diego.  They look at each other.

 GEORGE 		You shouldn't have taken the 30 million,
		Diego, I was out.

	George is lead away.

 CLERK 		The court calls Mr. Jack Stevens.

	Jack Stevens is lead to the stand.  WE SLOWLY DISSOLVE TO:

 INT. CAR - 1999 - DAY 
	The green of the New York State countryside drifts by as a
	brown Mazda moves along Highway 19.  Behind the wheel is a
	beautiful 20 year old woman wearing dark sunglasses.  She
	drives absently, her mind somewhere else.

 INT. OTISVILLE F.C.I. - VISITOR'S ENTRANCE - 1999 - DAY 
	The woman is buzzed through the double doors.  She moves to
	the MAN behind the desk and takes off her sunglasses.

 KRISTINA 		I'm here to see my father.

 ADMISSIONS OFFICER 		Name?

 KRISTINA 		Kristina Sunshine Jung.

 EXT. OTISVILLE F.C.I. - LATE AFTERNOON 
	The GUARDS are rounding up the other prisoners and escorting
	them inside, but George is still planting sunflowers.

 GUARD 		Hey, George, five more minutes, buddy.

 INT. VISITOR'S ENTRANCE - CONTINUOUS 
	The admissions officer looks up from his paperwork.

 ADMISSIONS OFFICER 		Jung.

	Kristina grabs her papers and moves to the counter.

 ADMISSIONS OFFICER (CONT'D) 		Belongings in here.

	Kristina empties her pockets and deposits her possessions
	into a locker box.  She is handed a key.

 ADMISSIONS OFFICER (CONT'D) 		Feet on the blue line.

	Kristina stands on a blue piece of tape and the admissions
	officer buzzes open the giant metal door.  But Kristina
	doesn't move.

 ADMISSIONS OFFICER (CONT'D) 		Miss?

	He presses the buzzer again, but she just stands there.

 ADMISSIONS OFFICER (CONT'D) 		Miss?  Something wrong?

 EXT. OTISVILLE F.C.I. - CONTINUOUS 
	George turns around as a GUARD taps him on the shoulder.

 GUARD 		George?  George, come on.  You've got a
		visitor.

	George looks up to find Kristina being buzzed through the
	gate.  She moves through the open area and onto the grass
	quickly.  SLOW MOTION: Father and daughter come together at
	last in a long embrace.

 GEORGE 		I'm sorry, baby.  I'm so sorry.

 KRISTINA 		It's alright, Dad.

 GEORGE 		I didn't mean to...

 KRISTINA 		I know, Dad.  I know...

	He hugs her hard.

 GEORGE 		I fucked up.

 KRISTINA 		Shhhh.

 GEORGE 		I love you.  I love you so much.  You've
		got to know that.  You've got to know.

 KRISTINA 		I know, Dad.  I love you too.

 GEORGE 		After everything.  After everything, the
		only thing left out of my whole life is
		you.

	Kristina looks at her father, smiles, and disappears.  There
	was no Kristina.  The guard continues to tap.

 GUARD 		George?  George, come on.  It's getting
		dark.

	George looks up to find a prison guard.  His name is GUS, and
	he helps George to his feet.

 GEORGE 		But I have a visitor.

 GUS 		Not today, George.  Time to go back.

 GEORGE 		But I want to put her name on the list
		for tomorrow.  My daughter.

 GUS 		Okay, George.

 GEORGE 		Because she's visiting me.

 GUS 		We'll do that tomorrow, okay?  It's
		lockdown time.

	The shadows grow long, and Gus leads George down a cement
	path that cuts through the grass.  The huge structure of
	Otisville looms dark against the sky, and Gus and George take
	the long walk back.

 EXT. OTISVILLE F.C.I. - NEW YORK - DUSK 
	Standing outside the fences, Kristina smokes a cigarette as
	she watches her father being led away.  After a few moments,
	she turns around, walks to her car and gets in.  Time to go
	home.  And as the brown Mazda pulls out of the driveway, the
	taillights turn red, growing smaller and smaller, until they
	finally disappear.

 THE END.
ON BLACK: 
 "A MAN MUST LOOK AT HIS LIFE AND THINK LUXURY." 
 FADE IN: 
 EXT. GUARJIRA, COLOMBIA - 1989 - DAY 
	A majestic panorama of the lush green slopes that are the
	Columbian highlands.  A faint chopping sound IS HEARD and
	then another.  WHOOSH.  WHOOSH.  The view changes and tiny
	dots appear on the hillside vegetation.  WHOOSH.

 CLOSER 
	We realize the dots are people.  Workers swinging long steel
	machetes in slow methodical rhythm.  WHOOSH.  WHOOSH.  WE SEE
	the South American Indian MEN clearly now.  Their tar stained
	teeth.  Their gaunt faces riddled with crow's feet.  Their
	jaws chewing away on huge wads of coca leaves as they collect
	the harvest.

 EXT. DIRT ROAD - COLOMBIA - DAY 
	Old rickety trucks carrying the huge green tractor-sized
	bales speed along the narrow road.

 EXT. CLEARING - COLOMBIA - DAY 
	The bundles are undone and Columbian women separate out the
	leaves.  Tribes of underweight workers carry armload after
	armload of the harvest and ritualistically dump them into a
	gigantic cannibal pot which sits on top of a raging bonfire.
	The leaves are being boiled down and a huge plume of smoke
	streaks the sky.  Wizened Indios brave the heat and shovel
	ashes into the pot to cool the solution.

 INT. JUNGLE - COLOMBIA - DAY 
	A primitive but enormous makeshift lab contains all the
	equipment.  The machinery.  The solutions.  The over-sized
	vats.  Dark-skinned bandoleros smoke cigarettes and sport
	automatic weapons at all the points of entry.  The coca is
	now a "basuco" paste and is being sent in for a wash.

 INT. LABORATORY - COLOMBIA - 1989 - DAY 
	A conveyor belt pours out brick after brick of pure cocaine
	hydrochloride.  The bricks are wrapped, tied up, weighed, and
	stamped with a "P" before being thrown into duffel bags.

 EXT. JUNGLE AIRSTRIP - COLOMBIA - DAY 
	A small twin-engine Cessna is loaded with dozens of duffel
	bags and the plane takes off.

 EXT. VERO BEACH AIRFIELD - NIGHT 
	The Cessna touches down.

 EXT. WORKSITE - WEYMOUTH - 1966 - DAY 
	The worksite is busy.  George is amongst other workers,
	working a summer job.  As George is taking five, he looks
	across the sight to Fred, who is sweeping up debris.  A long
	way from being the boss.

 INT. COLLEGE ADMISSIONS OFFICE - WEYMOUTH - 1966 - DAY 
	George stands in line to register for college, wearing his
	Brooks Brothers suit, bowtie, and freshly Bryllcreamed hair.
	The room is crowded and the line is long.  Bob Dylan's
	"Subterranean Homesick Blues" blares out of one of the kid's
	transistor radios.  George looks around the room.  He is
	uncomfortable.  He catches his reflection in the shiny glass
	partition and stops.  He doesn't like what he sees.
	Something is not right.  He looks like everyone else.  Same
	cookie-cutter hair, same cookie-cutter clothes, same cookie
	cutter faces.  He's a carbon copy.

 REGISTRATION WOMAN 		Next.

	It's George's turn but he doesn't hear it.  "Twenty years of
	schooling and they put you on a day shift."  The words hit
	him like a tone of bricks as he continues to stare at his own
	reflection.

 GEORGE (V.O.) 		I was standing there, and it was like
		the outside of me and the inside of me
		didn't match, you know?  And then I
		looked around the room and it hit me.  I
		saw my whole life.  Where I was gonna
		live, what type of car I'd drive, who my
		neighbors would be.  I saw it all and I
		didn't want it.  Not that life.

 EXT. CONSTRUCTION SITE - WEYMOUTH - 1966 - DAY 
	George sits with Fred.  It's breaktime and Fred eats from a
	lunch box.

 GEORGE 		There's something out there for me, Dad.
		Something different.  Something free
		form, you know?  Something for me, and
		college just isn't it.

 FRED 		That's too bad.  You would have been the
		first one in the family.

 GEORGE 		I know.

 FRED 		Alright.  You want me to get your old
		job back?  Because I could, you know, I
		could put in that word.

 GEORGE 		No, Dad.  I don't want to...I mean, I
		just don't want...

	It's obvious to Fred that his son doesn't want to be like
	him.

 FRED 		What are you going to do?

 GEORGE 		I'm going to California.

 EXT. BELMONT SHORES APARTMENT - 1968 - DAY 
 SUPERIMPOSE: MANHATTAN BEACH, CALIFORNIA 1968 
	George and Tuna, now 21-years old, struggle with their bags.
	Their new place is a tackily furnished, two-story apartment
	with small balconies and a view of the ocean.  As George and
	Tuna struggle with the bags, two California beauties appear
	on the balcony next door: BARBARA BUCKLEY, 20, and MARIA
 GONZALES, 21. 
 GIRLS 		You guys need some help?

	George and Tuna share a look.

 TUNA 		I don't know about you, but I think
		we're gonna like it here.

 EXT. MANHATTAN BEACH - 1968 - DAY 
 SERIES OF SHOTS 
	Barbara and Maria introduce George and Tuna around to the
	Manhattan Beach regulars.  They are immediately accepted
	despite their ill fitting shorts and Tuna's unhip black
	socks.  The beach scene is one big party.  Lots of beer,
	music, bikinis, and good times.  By the end of the day,
	George and Tuna have a hundred new friends.

 GEORGE (V.O.) 		California was like nothing I'd ever
		experienced.  The people were liberated
		and independent and full of new ideas.

 GEORGE (V.O.) (CONT'D) 		They used words like "right on,"
		"groovy," and "solid."  The women are
		all beautiful and seemed to share the
		same occupation.

 WOMAN #1 		I'm a flight attendant.

 WOMAN #2 		I'm a flight attendant.

 WOMAN #3 		I'm a flight attendant.

	The weed comes out and is passed around.  Pipes.  Joints.
	Bongs.  In SLOW MOTION, Barbara takes a huge hit of grass,
	grabs George's face, french kissing him, and giving him a
	huge shotgun.

 INT. BELMONT SHORES APARTMENT - 1968 - DAY 
	George and Barbara are sleeping late.  Their bodies
	intertwined beneath the sheets.  A slam of the front door
	wakes them up.  It's Tuna.

 TUNA 		Hey, wake up.  Come on, you two
		lovebirds.  Hurry, I want to show you
		something.

	George and Barbara shake cobwebs out and stumble into the
	kitchen to find Tuna holding a brown paper shopping bag.

 TUNA (CONT'D) 		Figured it out.

 GEORGE 		Figured what out?

 TUNA 		You know how we were wondering what we
		were going to do for money?  Being how
		we don't want to get jobs and whatnot?
		Well, check this out.

	Tuna takes the paper bag and empties its contents on the
	kitchen table.  It's a grey mound of stocky, seedy marijuana.

	Barbara examines the reefer.

 BARBARA 		Tuna, this is crap.

 TUNA 		I know it's not the greatest.  It's
		commercial.

 BARBARA 		It's garbage.

 GEORGE 		It's oregano.  You got ripped off, pal.
		What are you gonna do with all this?

 TUNA 		We sell it.  I got it all figured out.
		We make three finger lids and sell them
		on the beach.  We move all of it.  We've
		made ourselves a hundred bucks.  Or a
		lot of weed for our head.  What do you
		think?  Not bad, huh?  I got the baggies
		and everything.

 BARBARA 		You can't sell this to your friends.

 TUNA 		Man.  Fuck you guys.  I have this great
		idea and you guys have to be all
		skeptical.

 BARBARA 		Look, if you really wanna score some
		dope, I got the guy.

 EXT. THE WHIPPING POST - MANHATTAN BEACH - 1968 - DAY 
	George, Barbara and Tuna stop outside the front door.

 GEORGE 		Are you sure this guy is cool?

 BARBARA 		You'll see for yourself.

 TUNA 		A beauty parlor for men?  Sounds pretty
		queer.

	They walk in.

 INT. THE WHIPPING POST - MANHATTAN BEACH - 1968 - CONTINUOUS 
	George, Tuna and Barbara enter.  The Whipping Post is
	California's first male hair salon.  George looks around at
	the customer's being pampered.  Haircuts, pedicures,
	manicures.

 GEORGE 		Nothing like this back home.

 BARBARA 		Derek!

	DEREK FOREAL is a curious man.  Daringly effeminate,
	especially for the sixties, he is always surrounded by
	beautiful women.  As he sees Barbara, he stops his haircut
	and runs to embrace her.

 DEREK 		Barbie!

	Derek's female entourage rush over as well.  Kisses all
	around.

 DEREK (CONT'D) 		So, this is the new man, huh?  He's
		cute!

	George and Tuna stick out there hands.

 GEORGE 		George.

 TUNA 		Tuna.

 DEREK 		Tuna, oh my.  Enchante, George.  Barbie,
		he's yummy.  He looks like a Ken doll.
		Oooh, Ken and Barbie.  It's perfect.
		Alright, girls, give me five minutes.

	Derek makes dismissing gestures and the girls scatter.

 DEREK (CONT'D) 		Everyone, shoo!  You, too, Barbie.  I
		want to talk to the boys alone.

	After the girls leave, Derek closes the partition and his
	playful demeanor changes.  He's all business now.

 DEREK (CONT'D) 		What can I do for you guys?

 GEORGE 		We want some grass.

 DEREK 		I know what you want.  But, first of
		all, are you cops?

 GEORGE 		No.

 DEREK 		Because if you are, you have to tell me.
		If not, it's entrapment.

 GEORGE 		We're not cops.  We're from
		Massachusettes.  I mean, does he look
		like a cop?

 DEREK 		I guess not.  Okay.  You know, you're
		very lucky you're friends of Barbie's.
		If you weren't, I'd never talk to you.

	Derek pulls a television-sized brick of quality marijuana out
	from under a sink and sets it down in front of George.

 GEORGE 		What the fuck is that?

 DEREK 		It's your grass.

 TUNA 		Wow.  That's more than we had in mind.

 DEREK 		I don't nickel and dime.  You want it or

	George and Tuna look at each other.

 GEORGE 		We'll take it.

 KEVIN 		Shit, yeah.  Do you know how much money
		I could make if I had this stuff back
		east?

 TUNA 		No shit, Kevin?

 KEVIN 		That's right.

 GEORGE 		Yeah?

 KEVIN 		When there's something to move, it's too
		easy not to.  Do you know how many
		colleges are in a twenty mile radius?
		U. Mass, Amherst, B.U....

 TUNA 		Smith.  Hampshire....

 KEVIN 		Right.  And Holyoke.  There are a
		hundred thousand rich kids with their
		parents' money to spend, but there's
		never anything available.  Nothing good,
		anyway.  I'm paying four hundred dollars
		for shit.

 INT. THE WHIPPING POST - MANHATTAN BEACH - 1968 - DAY 
	Derek, George and Barbara sit around.  The blinds are drawn.

 GEORGE 		The way we figure it, Barbara flies to
		Boston twice a week.  Two bags per
		flight.  Twenty-five pounds in each bag.

 DEREK 		You're kidding, right?  That's a hundred
		pounds a week.

 GEORGE 		Yeah, I know, it's a lot of weight.

 BARBARA 		We're gonna call it California
		sinsemilla.  Sounds exotic.

 GEORGE 		I'm telling you, Derek, it will sell.

 DEREK 		I don't know...

 GEORGE 		Here's the best part.  We can charge
		five-hundred a pound.

 DEREK 		Come on, George, no one is going to pay
		that.

 GEORGE 		It's already been negotiated.  It's
		done.  The money is there waiting.

	Derek looks at Barbara.  She nods.

 DEREK 		Goodness.

 GEORGE 		Goodness is right.  If you do the math,
		that's over thirty grand a week profit.
		I want you to be my partner on this,
		Derek.  Fifty-fifty.  That's fifteen
		thousand a week for you, my friend.  In
		your pocket, free and clear.

 DEREK 		And I only deal with you?

 GEORGE 		Barbara and me.  No one else.

	Derek thinks about it.

 BARBARA 		It's gonna work, Derek.

 DEREK 		I don't know.  East coast.  Airplanes.
		It all sounds pretty risky.

 GEORGE 		She's a flight attendant.  They don't
		check her bags.

 EXT. LOS ANGELES INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT - 1968 - DAY 
	George drops Barbara off in her uniform curbside.  They kiss
	and she walks away with two big, red Samsonites.  She checks
	them with a SKYCAP and tips him.

 EXT. SKY - 1968 - DAY 
	A huge jet goes right to left through frame.

 INT. LOGAN AIRPORT - GATE - BOSTON - 1968 - DAY

 BARBARA 		Any message?

 KEVIN 		Keep it coming.

 INT. LOGAN AIRPORT - BAGGAGE CLAIM - BOSTON - 1968 
	We see Barbara's two red Samsonites being taken off the belt
	by Kevin.

 INT. LOGAN AIRPORT - GATE - BOSTON - 1968 
	Same scene repeated, except different clothes on all.  Maybe
	Kevin is dressed a little better.

 KEVIN 		More.

 INT. LOGAN AIRPORT - GATE - BOSTON - 1968 
	The same scene repeated, same things changed again; now Kevin
	is definitely dressed a little better.

 KEVIN 		I need more.

 BARBARA 		What do you want me to do?  I can only
		take two bags, and I can't fly back here
		everyday.

 KEVIN 		I know, but I've got a feeding frenzy on
		my hands.  Tell George this is small
		potatoes.  We're missing out on some
		serious cash.  You tell George.  He'll
		think of something.

 EXT. WINNEBAGO - 1968 - DAY 
 MUSIC CUE: 
	Tuna drives the big Winny.  Maria rides shotgun.  Barrelling
	cross-country, it's a party on wheels.

 EXT. WHITE OAK LODGE - AMHERST - 1968 - NIGHT 
	Kevin and his girl, RADA, are the welcoming committee as the
	RV pulls into the parking lot.  They wave, slap the sides of
	the Winnebago, and greet the prodigal sons with hugs and
	handshakes.

 INT. WHITE OAK LODGE - AMHERST - 1968 - LATER 
	George's room is rustic and plush.  A log fire burns and
	empty champagne bottles adorn the surroundings.  The girls
	have taken to each other.  The music is loud, and they dance
	while the boys do business.  Kevin counts out the money.
	It's stacked in piles all over the table.

 KEVIN 		Twenty, forty, sixty, eighty, nine.
		Twenty, forty, sixty, eighty, a
		thousand.  It's all there.  Wow.  A
		hundred and twenty-eight thousand
		dollars.

 TUNA 		Jesus Christ, I'm getting a boner just
		looking at it.

	But George isn't paying attention.  His wheels are turning.

 KEVIN 		What's the matter, George?  Something
		wrong?  You look like you just fucked
		your mother.

 TUNA 		Cheer up, man.  Half this money is ours.
		We're fucking rich.

 GEORGE 		It's not enough.

 KEVIN 		What?

 TUNA 		What the fuck are you talking about,
		man?

 GEORGE 		The set-up is wrong.  We're doing all
		the legwork, and at the end of the day,
		we're still paying retail.  We're
		getting middled.

 KEVIN 		So?

 GEORGE 		So, we need to get to the source.

 TUNA 		Source?  What about Derek?

 GEORGE 		He's getting middled, too.  And Derek's
		our partner.  What's good for us is good
		for him.

 KEVIN 		Okay.  So we need a source.  Where do we
		start?

 GEORGE 		Who speaks Spanish?

 EXT. OCEANA BAR - PUERTO VALLARTA - 1968 - DAY 
 TUNA 		This is bullshit, George.  We're never
		going to find anything down there.

 KEVIN 		You know, he's got a point.  We're
		fucking Americans.  We stick out like
		sore thumbs.

 DEREK 		I don't think so.

 GEORGE 		You guys are such babies.  You want to
		go home, go.  Me, I'm not going to stop
		until I find the fucking motherlode.

 RADA 		Georgie, we're gonna get busted if we
		keep this up.

 GEORGE 		We're not gonna get busted.

 KEVIN 		George, we'll wind up in a Mexican
		prison getting fucked up the ass by one
		of Maria's relatives.

 MARIA 		Hey, fuck you, Dulli.  I'm not Mexican.
		I'm Italian.

 BARBARA 		You're Italian?

 KEVIN 		Yeah, right.  Gonzales.  What is that,
		Sicilian?

 TUNA 		As far as I'm concerned, we're on
		fucking vacation.

	He grabs Maria, runs and does a huge belly-flop into the
	water.  They all laugh.

 SERIES OF SHOTS. 
	George and Barbara with local musicians on the beach.

	George talks with a bellboy in the lobby of a local hotel.

 INT. COCOS FRIOS BAR - PUERTO VALLARTA - 1968 - DAY 
	George, Barbara, Tuna, Derek, Maria, Kevin, and Rada are at

	Fields and Farms.  The V.W. bug pulls up to an old ranch.
	They get out of the bug and are greeted by SANTIAGO and his
 THREE SONS. 
 SANTIAGO 		Ramon tells me you are looking for some
		mota.

 GEORGE 		Yes, I am.

	Santiago moves to a tarp and pulls it back to reveal many
	bales of green, seedless sinsemilla.

 SANTIAGO 		For instance, something like this?

 GEORGE 		Very nice.  I'll take it.

 SANTIAGO 		Ha ha ha.  You are funny.   Really, how
		much will you be needing?

 GEORGE 		All of it.  As much as you've got.  A
		couples thousand pounds.  I'll be back
		in a week with a plane.

 SANTIAGO 		Listen, Americano, it is very nice to
		meet you, but maybe we are going too
		fast.  You take a little and then come
		back.

 GEORGE 		I don't need a little.  I need a lot.

 SANTIAGO 		Marijuana is illegal in my country, and
		I believe in yours, as well.  We must be
		careful.

 GEORGE 		What if I brought you, let's say, fifty
		thousand dollars?  Would that eliminate
		some of your concerns?

 SANTIAGO 		Amigo, you bring me fifty-thousand
		dollars, and I have no more concerns.

 EXT. SANTA MONICA AIRPORT - 1968 - DAY 
	A pair of boltcutters snaps the chain off a single-engine
	Cessna.

 TUNA 		I can't believe we're stealing a plane.

 KEVIN 		Don't be such a pussy.

 GEORGE 		It's fine.  We're not stealing it.
		We're borrowing it.  And try to look
		natural.  We've got company.

	A MECHANIC working on the adjacent plane is giving them the
	hairy eyeball.

 GEORGE (CONT'D) 		Be cool.

	The three boys nod their heads in acknowledgement and give a
	small wave.  The mechanic smiles and waves back.

 INT. CESSNA - 1968 - DAY 
	The engine is on and the propeller is spinning.  Kevin is at
	the controls.  Tuna is not making the trip.  He pokes his
	head in before shutting the cockpit.

 TUNA 		You guys are fucking insane.

	George reads from a flight manual.

 GEORGE 		Alright, pull back the throttle...

	The engine screams.

 GEORGE (CONT'D) 		Not that far, only halfway.  You sure
		you know what you're doing?

 KEVIN 		Relax.  I've flown with my old man a
		million times.  And he always told me,
		the taking off part is easy, it's the
		landing you've got to worry about.

 EXT. SANTIAGO FARM - MEXICO - 1968 - DAY 
	The plane tries to land.  It's a clumsy one.  The Cessna is
	tipping and touching, first one wheel, then another, almost
	sideways before straightening out and stopping.  George and
	Kevin hop out of the plane.  They are greeted by Santiago and
	the Mexican contingency.

 AMIGOS 		Hola, George!  Bienvenido!

	George hands out presents to everyone.  He's like Santa
	Claus, giving gifts to every man, woman and child.  They love
	him.  Santiago pumps George's hand.

 SANTIAGO 		Good to see you, Jorge.  You are a man
		of your word.

 GEORGE 		Actually, I've got some news.  That
		fifty thousand I promised you, I
		couldn't get it.

	George throws Santiago a duffel bag.

 GEORGE (CONT'D) 		So I brought you sixty.

 EXT. DRY LAKE BEDS - TWENTY-NINE PALMS, CA. - 1968 - DUSK 
	Rada sits in the Winnebago and keeps flashing the headlights.
	Barbara, Tuna, and Maria stand on top of the Winnebago waving
	big, white towels.  The plane descends from the sky and
	touches down, making another extremely shaky landing.

 INT. FOREAL'S HOUSE - MANHATTAN BEACH - 1968 - NIGHT 
	It's on the water and beautiful.  The furnishings are
	distinctly Derek Foreal.  It's a surreal scene.
	The holiday decorations are up, TOPLESS WOMEN in elf outfits
	sip champagne, and a thousand pounds of cannabis lays on the
	living room floor.

 GEORGE 		Are you sure you want to do this in
		front of everyone?

 DEREK 		Don't be ridiculous, these are my
		babies.

	George empties the pot all over the floor.

 DEREK (CONT'D) 		George, you're a genius.  We're rich.
		Come, children.

	The girls dive on top of Derek, caressing and kissing him.

 DEREK (CONT'D) 		George, get my camera.

	Derek poses with a load of marijuana like it's a new fur.

 DEREK (CONT'D) 		Take a picture of me, George.  Take a

		It'll be a fabulous Christmas card.

 INT. VILLA - PUERTO VALLARATA - 1970 - DAY 
	A Mexican Real Estate Agent shows Barbara and George a

 GEORGE 		Should we buy it?

 BARBARA 		Are you kidding?

 GEORGE 		We'll take it.

 EXT. VILLA - PUERTO VALLARATA - 1970 - MAGIC HOUR 
	The team is there.  All of them.  George, Barbara, Kevin,

	friends.  They all wear identical Mexican sombreros.  A
	MEXICAN BOY approaches them with a camera.

 MEXICAN BOY 		Picture?

	They pose, their arms thrown around each other in
	camaraderie, and FLASH.  The picture freezes and WE DISSOLVE.

 INT. THE BUGGY WHIP - WEYMOUTH - 1972 - NIGHT 
	George is taking Barbara and his parents out to dinner.  The
	Buggy Whip is Ermine's favorite.

 ERMINE 		I just can't get over the size of that
		ring.  I just love it.  Fred, look at
		it.  Tell me you don't love that ring.

 FRED 		I'm just happy that George has found
		someone he cares for.

 ERMINE 		Yes.  Of course.  But, I'm talking about
		that ring.  It's something else.  Let me
		tell you.

 BARBARA 		George has exquisite taste.

 ERMINE 		What is that, two carats?  That's got to
		be two carats.

 BARBARA 		I don't know.

 ERMINE 		Yes.  It's at least two carats, darling.
		Treasure it.

 FRED 		Hard to imagine being able to afford a
		ring like that on a construction salary.

	All eyes turn to George, who fumbles.

 GEORGE 		Well, you know.  It's um...

 ERMINE 		Oh, shut up, Fred.  Shut your big fat
		mouth.  You don't buy it all at once.
		It's called layaway.

 FRED 		Layaway shmayaway.

 ERMINE 		That's right.  Layaway.  Something you
		wouldn't know anything about, you
		cheapskate.

 FRED 		Who's the cheapskate?

 ERMINE 		You, you big old tightwad.  He still has
		his communion money.  Tell him, George.
		Tell your father about layaway.

 GEORGE 		Yeah, layaway.

 ERMINE 		The boy is happy, Fred.  Don't be such a
		killjoy.

 FRED 		Killjoy?

	George looks to Barbara, whose nose is bleeding.

 GEORGE 		Honey, your nose!

 BARBARA 		Oh my G-d, I'm so sorry.

 ERMINE 		Barbara, here, take my napkin.

 BARBARA 		Thanks.  I'll be okay.

 GEORGE 		You wanna split?

 BARBARA 		Yeah, I don't feel so well.

 GEORGE 		Okay, guys, we're gonna leave.  Let's
		get the check.

 EXT. THE BUGGY WHIP - WEYMOUTH - 1972 - LATER 
	George and Barbara exit the restaurant.

 GEORGE 		Are you sure you're okay?  You're pale.

 BARBARA 		I feel like shit.  Me and my frigging
		nosebleeds.

 GEORGE 		I'm taking you to the doctor when we get
		home, and I don't want to hear any
		arguments.

 BARBARA 		Would you be bummed out if I didn't go
		to Chicago with you?

 GEORGE 		No, not at all.  Sure.  You're right.
		You fly home and get some rest.

 BARBARA 		Nice first impression.  A nose bleed in
		front of your parents.

 GEORGE 		Oh my G-d, how embarrassing were they?
		I wanted to shoot myself.

 BARBARA 		Oh, they weren't that bad.  I mean, they
		were kind of cute.

 GEORGE 		Promise me that we'll never be like
		them.  I don't want to wind up like
		that.

 BARBARA 		Relax, baby.  We're going to wind up
		like us.

 INT. POLICE STATION - CHICAGO - 1972 - DAY 
 SUPERIMPOSE 
	MUG SHOTS of George.  Left, right, center.  George sits
	handcuffed to a chair.  Piles of marijuana bricks roll past
	him.

 GEORGE (V.O.) 		I had a little problem in Chicago.
		Something about trying to sell a
		truckload of dope to an undercover
		officer.  So I applied the three rules
		of the game under if and when arrested.

 INT. COOK COUNTY COURTHOUSE - CHICAGO - 1972 - DAY 
	George and his COURT APPOINTED ATTORNEY stand before the
	JUDGE at the arraignment.

 GEORGE (V.O.) 		Rule one: don't fight.  A trial will
		cost you a fortune in lawyer's fees and
		the jury will chop off your balls and
		hand them to you on a platter.

 JUDGE 		George Jung, you have been accused of
		possession of six-hundred and sixty
		pounds of marijuana with intent to
		distribute.  How do you plead?

 GEORGE (V.O.) 		Rule two: plead not guilty and get
		bailed out of jail.

 GEORGE (CONT'D) 		Your honor, I'd like to say a few words
		to the court.

	The court appointed attorney puts his head in his hands.

 JUDGE 		By all means.

 GEORGE 		In all honesty, I don't feel like what
		I've done is a crime and I think it's
		illogical and irresponsible for you to
		sentence me to prison.  None of the real
		criminals of the world ever end up
		behind bars.  I mean, when you think
		about it, what did I really do?  Cross
		an imaginary line with a bunch of
		plants?  You say that I'm an outlaw, you
		say that I'm a thief, but where's the
		Christmas dinner for the people on
		relief?

	George stops when his attorney stamps on his foot.  The court
	officers roll their eyes and the judge smiles.

 JUDGE 		Those are very interesting concepts you
		have, Mr. Jung.
		Unfortunately for you, the imaginary
		line you crossed is real, the plants you
		brought with you are illegal, and what
		you did constitutes a crime.

	The judge slams his gavel.

 JUDGE (CONT'D) 		Bail is set at twenty-thousand dollars.

 EXT. COOK COUNTY COURTHOUSE - CHICAGO - 1972 - NIGHT 
	George walks out, free on bond, to find Barbara waiting for
	him.  She doesn't look so good.

 BARBARA 		Surprise.

 GEORGE 		Baby, you didn't have to come.

 BARBARA 		What, and miss all the fun?  C'mon, not
		a chance.  So, what's the verdict?

 GEORGE 		Lawyer says he can plead it down to five
		years.  I'll serve two.

 BARBARA 		Two years.  George, I can't wait that
		long.

 GEORGE 		What?  You're not going to wait for me?

 BARBARA 		George, I went to the doctor.  I don't
		have two years.

 GEORGE (V.O.) 		Which brings me to rule number three:
		which says, fuck rules one and two, skip
		bail and take off.

 EXT. RENT-A-CAR - 1972 - DAY 
	George hits the gas and the car screams down the road.

 EXT. VILLA - PUERTO VALLARTA - 1973 - GOLDEN HOUR 
	George and Barbara sit on the veranda drinking champagne and
	watching the sun go down over the Pacific.  Barbara is
	completely bald.  Rail thin, eyes sunken.
	But it doesn't matter.  They're having a great time.  They
	laugh and hold hands and laugh some more.

 EXT. CEMETERY - PUERTO VALLARTA - 1973 - DAY 
	Everyone is there.  All in black.  Barbara's casket is
	lowered into the ground and George climbs to his knees to
	push the first dirt on the grave.

 GEORGE (V.O.) 		Time is such a funny thing.  I look at
		where I am now, and in here, time inches
		along.  So slow, it hardly seems like it
		moves.  But back then, time went fast.

 EXT. OTISVILLE F.C.I. - NEW YORK - 1999 - DAY 
	George pushes dirt along the edge of a flower root.  Still
	planting those sunflowers, he presses down firmly, standing
	before him is Barbara, still beautiful and young with flowing
	locks.  George raises his hand and makes a small wave.
	Barbara opens and closes her hand.  Bye bye.

 GEORGE 		It went too fast.

	George looks down and Barbara is gone.  No Barbara.

 EXT. JUNG HOUSE - BACKYARD - WEYMOUTH - 1973 - NIGHT 
	George hops the fence like he did when he was a boy and goes
	in the back door.

 INT. JUNG HOUSE - KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS 
	Ermine looks at George blankly.

 GEORGE 		Hi, Mom.

	Ermine just keeps looking at him.

 GEORGE (CONT'D) 		Surprised to see me?

 ERMINE 		Take your boots off.  You're tan.

 GEORGE 		Mexico.

 ERMINE 		Yeah.  We heard all about it.  I want
		you to know I'm deeply sorry about your
		girlfriend.

 GEORGE 		Barbara.

 ERMINE 		Yes, Barbara.  She was very pretty.

 GEORGE 		Thank you.  Have you been getting the
		money I sent you?

 ERMINE 		You mean the drug money?  Yes, I got it.

	Ermine's hands are trembling.  She is emotional.  She hugs
	George ferociously, not letting go.

 ERMINE (CONT'D) 		G-d, son.

 GEORGE 		Okay, Mom.  It's okay.  Where's Dad?

	George turns around to see Fred's beaming face.

 INT. JUNG HOUSE - KITCHEN - LATER 
	George and Fred sit at the table, a bottle of Scotch sits
	between them.  The glasses are raised.

 GEORGE 		May the wind always be at your back and
		the sun always upon your face...

 FRED 		...and the winds of destiny carry you
		aloft...

 BOTH 		...to dance with the stars.

	The glasses clink and the drinks are sucked down.

 INT. JUNG HOUSE - LATER 
	The bottle is dwindling.  George and Fred are feeling it.

 FRED 		You alright?

	George nods.

 GEORGE 		Just low.

 FRED 		You loved her, didn't you?  You really
		loved her.

 GEORGE 		Yeah, Dad.  I really did.  What am I
		gonna do?

 FRED 		Tough spot.

	The glasses are refilled.

 GEORGE 		You mad at me?

 FRED 		Not mad.

 GEORGE 		Yeah, you are.  I can tell by the way
		you look at me.

 FRED 		I just don't know what you're thinking.
		I don't understand your choices.  You
		know, the police are looking for you.

 GEORGE 		I know.  I'm great at what I do, Dad.  I
		mean, I'm really great.

 FRED 		Let me tell you something, son.  You
		would have been great at anything.

	Something outside catches George's eye.  A light.  A
	reflection.  A movement.  George is up and on the move.

 FRED (CONT'D) 		Where are you going?

 EXT. JUNG HOUSE - NIGHT 
	The front door opens and FEDERAL AGENTS pour into the house.

 INT. JUNG HOUSE - CONTINUOUS 
	George is up the stairs in a flash.

 ERMINE 		George!

 INT. GEORGE'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS 
	George slams the door behind him, moves over to the window,
	and opens it.  Cops everywhere.  He's trapped.  Out of
	options, he folds.  He moves to the corner and sits down,
	turns on the train set.  A KNOCK on the door is heard.  FBI
	Agent, JAMES T. TROUT.

 TROUT 		George Jung, you are under arrest.

 FRED 		Open the door, son.

 EXT. JUNG HOUSE - LATER 
	They lead George outside in handcuffs.  Ermine and Fred
	watch.

 ERMINE 		I had no choice.

	George stops and looks at his mother, for the first time
	realizing her betrayal.

 ERMINE (CONT'D) 		Don't look at me like that.  What was I
		supposed to do?  You're in our house.
		What, was I supposed to be an
		accomplice?

	As George is led to the police car, Ermine follows.

 ERMINE (CONT'D) 		You don't think people know you're a
		drug dealer?  Everyone knows.  It's no
		secret.  How do you think that reflects
		on me?  Every time I go out, I'm
		humiliated.  I see the stares.  I hear
		the whispers.  How do you think that
		makes me feel?  Did you ever once stop
		and think of me?

	George's head is pushed down as he is put in the squad car.
	He looks up at his mother.

 ERMINE (CONT'D) 		So you go to jail.  It's for your own
		good.  You need to straighten your life
		out.

 INT. DANBURY F.C.I. - 1974 - DAY 
 SUPERIMPOSE: 
	George is being led through a series of gated corridors.

 GUARD 		Prisoner in.

	As he walks, he takes in the faces of the other inmates.  He
	arrives at his cell and notices he has a ROOMMATE.

 GUARD (CONT'D) 		Prisoner in.

	The cell door opens and George steps inside.  There are books
	and papers spread out over both bunk beds.  George watches as
	his cellmate quickly clears everything off the top bunk.
	Apparently, the papers are private.  George puts his things
	down and the little man proffers his hand.  He is dark,
	polite and Colombian.

 DIEGO DELGADO 		My name is Diego Delgado.  How do you
		do?

 INT. DANBURY F.C.I. - MESS HALL - 1974 - DAY 
	George pushes his tray through the cafeteria line.  Diego is
	behind him.

 DIEGO 		If you don't mind me asking, what is the
		reason you are in this place?

 GEORGE 		What?

 DIEGO 		Your offense?  Why are you here?

 GEORGE 		I don't want to talk about it.

 DIEGO 		Intriguing.  I see.  Would you like to
		know my crime?

 GEORGE 		Not really, no.

 DIEGO 		No?

 GEORGE 		I don't like a lot of conversation,
		Diego.

 DIEGO 		Me, too.  Too much blah, blah, blah,
		blah is no good.  But we are roommates,
		okay?  And we must talk to each other.
		I am arrested for stealing cars.  For
		the grand theft auto.  Okay?  So, now it
		is your turn.  Now you will tell me,
		okay?  You will tell me why you are
		here?

	George says nothing.  He keeps eating his food.

 DIEGO (CONT'D) 		Oh, come on, George.  If we are to be
		friends, we must trust each other.

 GEORGE 		Murder.

 DIEGO 		Ah, yes.  The murder.

 INT. DANBURY F.C.I. - GEORGE'S CELL - NIGHT 
	George lays on his bunk, smoking.  Diego is on the bottom
	bunk, furiously writing on a notepad.  He flips through his
	books and rustles his papers.  George peeks over the side to
	see what Diego is doing.

 GEORGE 		What do you got there, Diego?

 DIEGO 		Nothing.  Just a little project.

 GEORGE 		What kind of project?

 DIEGO 		Never mind.  Not for you to worry.

 GEORGE 		I thought you said we were roommates.
		That we should talk about everything.

 DIEGO 		You have your intrigues.  I have mine.
		This is a happy day for me, George.
		Nine months from today, I will be in
		Medellin sipping champagne.  In nine
		months, I am free.  How much time do you
		have?

 GEORGE 		Twenty-six months.

 DIEGO 		Twenty-six months?  For murder?  I must
		be your lawyer.

 GEORGE 		I've got to get out of here, Diego.

 DIEGO 		Only two ways I know to leave here
		early.  One is to escape.

 GEORGE 		What's the other one?

 INT. DANBURY F.C.I. - CLASSROOM - DAY 
	George is trying to teach basic education to the inmates.
	The room, mostly black and hispanic, is hostile.  They don't
	want to learn.

 GEORGE 		Alright, let's open our books.

 INMATE #1 		Man, fuck you.

 INMATE #2 		We ain't opening shit.

 INMATE #1 		You just the warden's boy.  We on to
		you.  You just trying to knock some time
		off, asskissing motherfucker.

	Diego watches as the room reacts with laughter.  This ain't
	going to be easy.

 GEORGE 		Alright.  You're right.  I want to get
		out of this shithole as fast as I can.
		And I don't want to do this any more
		than you do.  But for me to walk early,
		some of you have to graduate.  You,
		forget about it.  You're hopeless, go to
		sleep.

	The room laughs again.

 INMATE #3 		Damn, homeboy, you got ruined.

 GEORGE 		But the rest of you could get diplomas
		and get jobs when you're on the outside.

	The room looks at him.  They ain't buying it.

 INMATE #1 		Shit, I'm in for life.

 INMATE #2 		I'm a criminal.  I ain't getting no
		motherfucking job.

 GEORGE 		We can learn some criminal shit, too.
		Alright, I'll make you a deal.  What if
		half the time, we learn about George
		Washington, and the other half, I'll
		teach you how to smuggle drugs?

 INMATE #2 		Man, you don't know dick about smuggling
		no drugs.

 GEORGE 		I was arrested in Chicago with six
		hundred and sixty pounds of grass.  I
		think that qualifies me.

	Diego looks up from his desk, suddenly very interested.

 INMATE #1 		How did you get a hold of six-hundred
		and sixty pounds of dope?

 GEORGE 		Flew it in from Mexico on a single
		engine Cessna.  Now, do we have a deal
		or not?

	They react.  They're in.

 GEORGE (CONT'D) 		Alright, the first thing you need to
		know about smuggling drugs is that it's
		easy.  The DEA are a bunch of losers.
		They couldn't find their dicks in a
		whorehouse.  They don't know what the
		fuck they're doing...

	Diego watches George winning over the room.  He listens
	intently to George's every word.  His wheels are turning.

 INT. DANBURY F.C.I. - GEORGE'S CELL - NIGHT 
	Lights out.  Diego and George lay in their cots.  George is
	tired.  Diego is not.

 DIEGO 		George?  Hey, George?  I listen to what
		you say to the class today about the
		smuggling.  You are a magico, ah?

	George doesn't respond.

 DIEGO (CONT'D) 		I never believed you were a murderer.  I
		knew.  I knew you are a magico.  I have
		seen it in you.  It's in your spirit.

 GEORGE 		I'm tired, Diego.  Go to bed.

 DIEGO 		You like to make the boundaries
		disappear.  It's not only the money, is
		it, George?  The adventure is part of
		the victory.  It's the thrill, ah?

 GEORGE 		Good night.

 DIEGO 		In my country, I am a magico.  A man
		with a dream.  A man on the rise.  To
		take nothing and make it something,
		okay?  I have failed my dream, but I
		will accomplish.  That is why I am in
		your country.  Yes, I lose my freedom.
		But they do not take my dream.  Do you
		have a dream, George?

 GEORGE 		I would if I could get some sleep.

 DIEGO 		Yes, you have a dream.  And maybe you
		accomplish your dream.  But yet you
		failed.  Why?

 GEORGE 		Because I got caught.

 DIEGO 		No, my brother.

 GEORGE 		Because they caught me?

 DIEGO 		You failed because you had the wrong
		dream.

	Diego climbs off his bunk and looks George square in the eye.

 DIEGO (CONT'D) 		George?  What do you know about cocaine?

 INT. DANBURY F.C.I. - MESS HALL - DAY 
 GEORGE 		I don't know, Diego.  I've got a good
		thing going already.  Everybody smokes
		pot.  It's easy.  Cocaine is a rich
		man's drug.  It's too expensive.

 DIEGO 		No, no.  That is where you are wrong.
		For us, it is cheap.  In Medellin, we
		buy for six-thousand dollars a kilo.  IN
		Miami, we sell for sixty.

	George's interest is piqued.

 GEORGE 		That's over fifty-thousand dollars
		profit per kilo.

 DIEGO 		And that's wholesale.  Cut it a few
		times and retail, you're looking at two,
		three-hundred thousand.

 GEORGE 		Oh my G-d.

 DIEGO 		Yes.  And a kilo of coca is smaller than
		a kilo of your precious marijuana.
		Everything is the same, George, except
		instead of thousands, you are making
		millions.

 GEORGE 		Jesus Christ.  Jesus fucking Christ.

 DIEGO 		Now do you see what I am saying?

 GEORGE 		Getting it here is no problem.  Trust
		me.  I'll fly it in myself if I have to.
		What about supply?  How much can we get?

 DIEGO 		Don't worry.  We will talk of
		everything.  We have the time.  You
		arrive here with a Bachelor of
		Marijuana, but you will leave with a
		Doctorate of Cocaine.

 INT. DANBURY F.C.I. - GEORGE'S CELL - NIGHT 
	Diego and George pouring over Diego's plans.  Discussing,
	planning, plotting.

 DIEGO 		What type of planes do you have?

 GEORGE 		Four passenger, single engine Cessna.

 DIEGO 		How many kilos can we fit in these
		planes?

 GEORGE 		I don't know.  A hundred, hundred and
		fifty.  How many miles is it from
		Colombia to Miami?

 DIEGO 		Fifteen hundred.  We'll have to stop
		somewhere to refuel.

 GEORGE 		We'll refuel in the Bahamas.  I know
		someone there.

 DIEGO 		Great.  I love the Bahamas.

 EXT. LIQUOR STORE - WEYMOUTH - 1976 
 SUPERIMPOSE: JULY, 1976. 
	George is at a payphone.  He drops in about a million
	quarters until he is finally connected.

 GEORGE 		Diego Delgado, please?

 DIEGO 		Allo?

 GEORGE 		Diego?  It's George.

 DIEGO 		George, hallo!  Today is the day, ah?
		Are you out?

 GEORGE 		Yeah, I'm out.

 DIEGO 		Congratulations, brother.  I've been
		waiting for you.

 GEORGE 		How are we doing?

 DIEGO 		Perfect, George.  Perfect.  Everything
		is fine down here.  Everything is all
		set up.

 GEORGE 		Do we need a plane?  How does this work?
		When do I see you?

 DIEGO 		Slow down, George.  Slow down.

	Fred exits the liquor store carrying two bottles of Dom
	Perignon.  As he catches George's eye, he lifts the bottles
	showing them off.  George holds up his finger, indicating
	he'll be just a second.

 DIEGO (CONT'D) 		You need to come down here, everybody
		meets everybody.  Ho ho ho.  Ha ha ha.
		We do one for good faith and then we
		talk about airplanes.

 GEORGE 		I can't go anywhere, Diego.  I'm on
		parole.  I can't leave the state.

 DIEGO 		But you must.  It's the only way.

 GEORGE 		I just got released five minutes ago.

 DIEGO 		George, are we gonna do this or not?

 EXT. BASSETERRE HOTEL - ANTIGUA - POOLSIDE - 1976 - DAY 
	George steps outside and spots Diego.  Their eyes meet.
	Diego looks different, relaxed.  He wears a straw hat,
	shorts, and sports a healthy tan.  The two men embrace.

 GEORGE 		Good to see you, Diego.

 DIEGO 		Yes.  Look around you.  The sun.  The
		water.  The women.  It's better than
		Danbury, no?  Come on.  I have some
		friends I would like you to meet.

 EXT. BASSETERRE HOTEL - ANTIGUA - POOLSIDE - 1976 - DAY 
	Diego and George sit with five other Colombians, most
	notably, a man named CESAR ROZA.  The mood is not friendly.

 DIEGO 		Fifteen kilos.  Seven and a half in each
		suitcase.  You receive a hundred
		thousand dollars upon delivery.

 GEORGE 		Okay.

 CESAR 		Not so fast.  I would like to go over
		the details.

 GEORGE 		What details?  I put the coke in the
		false bottoms and take it through
		customs.

 CESAR 		Tell me about the suitcases.  What is
		the make and the color?

 DIEGO 		Samsonites.  Red.  No tags.

	Cesar thinks about it.

 CESAR 		Hmm.  I see.  Will there be clothes in
		the suitcase?

 GEORGE 		What?  Yeah, sure.

 CESAR 		Whose cloths?  Your clothes?

 GEORGE 		My clothes, your clothes.  What does it
		matter?

 CESAR 		I would like to know the contents.
		Every detail is important.

 GEORGE 		What are we doing here, Diego?  This
		guy's a clown.  He's talking about
		clothes.

 CESAR 		I demand to know everything.  I do not
		trust six-hundred thousand dollars of
		coca to someone I don't know.

 GEORGE 		It's a lousy fifteen kilos.  I piss
		fifteen kilos.

 CESAR 		The coca is my responsibility!

 GEORGE 		You're a fucking amateur!

 DIEGO 		Gentlemen, please.  There is no need to
		be impolite.  Cesar, this will be fine.
		You have my word.  George, Cesar is just
		being thorough.  That's all.

 CESAR 		Very well.  But just remember, Mr. Jung.
		I will be with you the whole way.  And I
		will be watching.

 INT. LOGAN AIRPORT - CUSTOMS - 1976 - DAY 
	George carries the two Samsonites over to customs
	inspections.  It's a long walk.  George's heart beats hard.
	The sound is audible and grows with every beat.  BA-BUMP.  BA
	BUMP.  Cesar lurks at the baggage carousel.

 GEORGE (V.O.) 		When you're carrying drugs across the
		border, the idea is to remain calm.  The
		way I do it is to think of something
		pleasant, a fun party, a moment of
		triumph.  A sexual encounter.  I
		actually project myself to that place.
		Anything to keep your mind off the fact
		that you're going to jail for a very
		long time if they find the fifteen kilos
		of cocaine in your suitcases.

	George stands in front of the customs agent.  He tries his
	best to look relaxed as the agent reviews his documents.

 CUSTOMS AGENT 		On vacation?

 GEORGE 		Yes.

 CUSTOMS AGENT 		On vacation for only one day?

	BA-BUMP.  BA-BUMP.  The heartbeats are very loud.

 GEORGE 		    (weak smile)
		My brother's wedding.  Imagine that,
		huh?

	George's breathing is labored and his swallowing reflex
	doesn't seem to be working.  Cesar passes through, eyeballing
	George the whole time.

 CUSTOMS AGENT 		Open your bags, please.

	George opens the Samsonites.  Super dry mouth.  BA-BUMP.  BA
	BUMP.  The beats are deafening now.  Cesar nervously monitors
	the situation from the payphones.

 CUSTOMS AGENT (CONT'D) 		Whose clothes are these?

 GEORGE 		Mine.

	The customs agent holds up a woman's undergarment.  Cesar
	throws up his hands in frustration.

 CUSTOMS AGENT 		And this?

 GEORGE 		What can I tell you?  Different strokes.

	George winks at the customs agent, who shakes his head before
	finishing the inspection.

 CUSTOMS AGENT 		Alright, go ahead.

 EXT. LOGAN AIRPORT - PAYPHONES - CONTINUOUS 
	George moves to the payphones, sets down the two suitcases,
	and pretends to make a call.  Not inconspicuously, Cesar
	grabs the bags and walks quickly out of the terminal.

 INT. BASSETERRE HOTEL - ANTIGUA - 1976 - DAY 
	Diego, Cesar, George and JACK STEVENS, a silver haired
	executive type, lounge around the mini-suite.  Cesar still
	has that crazy look in his eye.

 DIEGO 		Three-hundred kilos it is, then.

	A beautiful Latin woman enters and kisses both Diego and
	Cesar.  Her name is INEZ, and friendly she is not.

 DIEGO (CONT'D) 		Has everyone met Inez?  This is George.
		I've told you about him.  And this is
		friend, Jack Stevens.

	The men proffer their hands, but she just looks at them like
	ants before sitting down next to Diego.

 DIEGO (CONT'D) 		Try to be more respectful, darling.  My
		apologies.  But she is mistrustful of
		Americans.  Shall we proceed?  Let's
		hear it again, Mr. Stevens.

 STEVENS 		I'll fly down on a Friday, refuel in the
		Bahamas, and then to Medellin.

 INEZ 		Friday?

	Inez addresses Diego and Cesar only.  She speaks in Spanish.
	The conversation is about "Why Friday?"  Inez has some
	problem with it.  Diego explains.  And Inez is reassured.

 DIEGO 		Please, continue.

 GEORGE 		We make the pick-up, refuel once more in
		the Bahamas, and fly back on Sunday with
		the mom and pop traffic.

 CESAR 		Why are you speaking?

 GEORGE 		Excuse me?

 CESAR 		You.  Your responsibility is over.  You
		do not fly.  You are not a pilot.  You
		are not a distributor.  You introduced
		us to Mr. Stevens and the use of his
		airplane.  That is all.  You make a
		percentage.  A generous one.  And you're
		lucky to get that.

 GEORGE 		I see.  How much?

 CESAR 		Padrino will pay ten-thousand per kilo.
		For everyone.  For you, and you, and
		you.

	He indicates George, Diego and Jack Stevens.

 CESAR (CONT'D) 		There is no negotiation.  Three-million
		dollars.  That is all.

 STEVENS 		I want two.

 GEORGE 		Gee, Jack, a million each had such a
		nice ring to it.

 STEVENS 		No way.  I'm doing all the work.  Taking
		all the risk, and it's my plane.

	Diego and George look at each other.

 STEVENS (CONT'D) 		Hey, you guys don't have to do shit.
		Just sit back and collect your money.

 GEORGE 		You good with this?

	Diego nods.

 GEORGE (CONT'D) 		Alright.

	This is too much for Inez to handle.  She starts screaming
	machine gun Spanish.  Something about a "lousy two-hundred
	and fifty-thousand dollars," and how Diego is "such a coward"
	to give away all his money.  Diego is embarrassed but tries
	to remain calm.

 DIEGO 		You will watch what you say.  Especially
		around George.  He is my brother and he
		speaks as good Spanish as you.

	But Inez is wild.  She starts in again, a log of "Putos
	(SOB's)", and "Cojones" and "Maricones (gay/sissys)."  Even
	Cesar is uncomfortable.  Diego stands.

 DIEGO (CONT'D) 		Okay.  That's enough.

 INEZ 		Get your hands off me.

	Inez takes a swing at Diego and catches him full across the
	face.  Time stops in the room.  Question.  What will Diego
	do?  Answer: SMACK!  Diego swings back and a full scale is
	on.  Cesar continues the conversation.  It's surreal.  As if
	Diego and Inez weren't beating the shit out of each other
	right in front of them.

 CESAR 		Do you have pictures of your kids?

 STEVENS 		What?

 CESAR 		I'll need to see them.  Also need their
		names and the names of their schools.
		We are trusting you with ninety million
		dollars worth of coca, Mr. Stevens.
		Without your children, there is no deal.

	Stevens thinks about it.  Kids as collateral.  Inez and Diego
	are still duking it out.  But Diego finally gets the upper
	hand and drags her into the bedroom.

 STEVENS 		Fine.  So if that's all, I'll be leaving
		now.

	Cesar walks him to the door.

 CESAR 		Don't forget the pictures.

	Diego calls from the other room.

 DIEGO (O.S.) 		George.  George, come in here.


 INT. LA BELLE MER - BEDROOM - LATER 
	Diego has put Inez in the bathroom and is holding the door
	closed.  She pounds and kicks and screams in frustration, but
	he pays no attention.

 DIEGO 		What's the matter, George?

 GEORGE 		What's the matter?  We're moving three
		hundred fucking kilos and we're making
		dogshit.

 DIEGO 		A million dollars for our first run is
		not bad, George.

 GEORGE 		It is bad.  It's chump change.  We might
		as well be hauling suitcases across the
		border.  We're getting screwed.

 DIEGO 		I know.

 GEORGE 		And what happens when these guys stop
		paying?  Sooner or later, these guys are
		going to cut us out.  Then where are we?

 DIEGO 		That's my George, always thinking.

	The door is yanked open to reveal Inez.  She is in a rage.
	Diego slams it in her face.

 DIEGO (CONT'D) 		This is only part of the business,
		George.  A very small part.  Don't
		worry, there is so much more to do.
		Which reminds me, I need a favor from
		you.  I must go to Colombia.

 GEORGE 		What is it, George?  Because I have to
		get home.  I've got a parole officer
		waiting for me.

 DIEGO 		I need you to go to Miami.

 EXT. VENETIAN KING APTS. - MIAMI - 1977 - DAY 
	George gets out of a taxi to find SEVERAL COLOMBIAN MEN
	hanging around outside an apartment.  He checks the address
	and moves over to the men.

 GEORGE 		I'm George.  Friend of Diego's?

	The Colombian men are not impressed.  They grab George and
	pull him inside.

 INT. VENETIAN KING APTS. - CONTINUOUS 
	George is pinned against the wall and the Colombian men all
	start screaming at him in Spanish.  There seems to be a
	problem.  A man, ALESSANDRO, steps forward.  He is the one
	who speaks English.

 ALESSANDRO 		QUIET!  Callate!  Where's Diego?

 GEORGE 		I don't know.  He sent me.  I'm George.

 ALESSANDRO 		Oh, I see.  George.  Well, that explains
		everything.  Open your mouth, George.

	George's puzzled look is replaced by a gun barrel in his
	face.  Alessandro presses it against George's front teeth.

 ALESSANDRO (CONT'D) 		Now, you listen to me.  Are you hearing
		me?

	George nods.

 ALESSANDRO (CONT'D) 		You see this?

	He indicates two duffel bags stuffed with fifty kilos of
	cocaine.

 ALESSANDRO (CONT'D) 		I've been holding this shit for him for
		three weeks.  You tell Diego I don't
		appreciate it.  You tell him I want my
		money by Friday.  Can you do that?

 GEORGE 		Um-hmm.

 INT. JUNG HOUSE - GEORGE'S ROOM - DAY 
	George sits on his bed, reading.  Two duffel bags are tucked
	away in the closet.  Ermine pokes her head in.

 ERMINE 		You have a phone call.

	George picks up the phone.

 DIEGO (O.S.) 		George.

 GEORGE 		Jesus Christ, Diego, where are you?
		It's been eleven days and these guys
		want their fucking money.

 DIEGO (O.S.) 		Bad news, George.  I'm in Colombia.

 GEORGE 		Well, you better get here fast.  I'm
		sitting on...

	George notices Ermine is loitering in the hallway,
	eavesdropping.

 GEORGE (CONT'D) 		Hi, Mom.

	George acknowledges her before shutting the door in her face.

 GEORGE (CONT'D) 		I'm sitting on fifty fucking keys.  Get
		your ass up here.

 INT. CARCEL DE VARONES - MEDELLIN, COLOMBIA - CONTINUOUS 
	It's a South American prison.  Diego is on the pay phone.

 DIEGO 		It's a little hard to get away right
		now.  I'm afraid you're on your own.

 INT. FOREAL'S HOUSE - MANHATTAN BEACH - 1977 - NIGHT 
	George and Derek sit in the living room with MR. T, a hippie
	ish looking professor.  On the table sits various
	paraphernalia.  Scales, beakers, test tubes, and a hot box.
	George and Derek watch as Mr. T scoops some of George's
	cocaine and sets it onto the two-inch metal plate.

 MR. T 		What we're doing is measuring the
		purity.  Pure coke melts out a hundred
		and eighty-five, a hundred and ninety
		degrees.  Cutting agents melt much
		lower.  About a hundred degrees.
		Quality product starts melting at a
		hundred and forty degrees.  That's what
		I'm hoping for.

	Mr. T turns the dial.  120.  130.  140.

 MR. T (CONT'D) 		Good.

 150. 160. 
 MR. T (CONT'D) 		Jesus Christ.

 170. 180. 
 MR. T (CONT'D) 		Holy fucking Mary!  Jesus, fuck me
		running!  Where did you get this shit!

	At one-hundred and eighty-seven degrees, the white powder
	dribbles off the hotplate and melts away.

 MR. T (CONT'D) 		Damn!  Can I do a fucking line?!

	Mr. T puts his nose in the powder.  George pulls Foreal
	aside.

 GEORGE 		What did I tell you?

 DEREK 		It's great and everything, but what am I
		going to do with all this?

 GEORGE 		Sell it?

 DIEGO 		Jesus Christ, George, I don't see you in
		two years, and you show up at my door
		with a hundred and ten pounds of
		cocaine?

 GEORGE 		Just sell it, Derek.

 DEREK 		Alright, but it's gonna take me a year.

 INT. THE WHIPPING POST - MANHATTAN BEACH - 1977 - NIGHT 
	Money everywhere.  All over the floor, the counters, the
	chairs, and even in the sinks.  George and Derek count the
	money patiently, writing the dollar amount in yellow high
	lighter on the top of each stack, before wrapping it with a
	rubber band.

 DIEGO 		Thirty-six hours.  I can't believe it.
		Everything is gone in thirty-six hours.

 GEORGE 		I think it's fair to say you
		underestimated the market there, Derek.

 DIEGO 		Touche.

 GEORGE 		But to the victor belong the spoils.

	George divides the money.  There's a hell of a lot.

 GEORGE (CONT'D) 		Half a million for you.  Half a million
		for me.  One-point-three five for the
		Colombians.

 DEREK 		Nice doing business with you, George.

 GEORGE 		Not bad for a weekend's work, huh?

 INT. AIRPORT - MIAMI - DAY 
	Immaculate in his white turtleneck and sunglasses, George
	walks with two aluminum cases.  He is greeted by Alessandro
	and his thugs.

 ALESSANDRO 		Greetings, Mr. George.

 GEORGE 		Where do you guys want to count?

 ALESSANDRO 		On the plane.

 GEORGE 		What plane?  We going someplace?  Where
		we headed?  You have your money.  It's
		all there.  What the fuck is going on?

	They usher him away.

 EXT. OLAYA HERRERA AIRPORT - MEDELLIN - DAY 
 SUPERIMPOSE: MEDELLIN, COLOMBIA 
	The lear jet lands.

 EXT. DESERTED SUGAR FACTORY - LOS RIOS, COLOMBIA - DAY 
	The blazer pulls into a long driveway.  They approach a gate
	where SHIRTLESS TEENAGERS with MAC-10's stand guard.  The
	gate opens.  YOUNG SOLDIERS open the door for George and
	roughly usher him over to a Jeep within the confine.  They
	frisk him top to bottom.  Diego is leaning against another
	Jeep and waits for George to be released.

 DIEGO 		George, good to see you, my brother.

 GEORGE 		What the fuck is going on?  When did you
		get out of jail?

 DIEGO 		Pablo used his influence.  Now, George,
		watch what you say.  Everybody hears
		everything.  A lot of things get said
		and done that, well, let's just say this
		isn't America.  Life is cheap here, you
		know?  No offense, but you know what I'm
		saying?

 GEORGE 		Yeah.  Keep my mouth shut and let you do
		the talking.

 DIEGO 		Right.  Now who is the person in
		California?  The connection?

 GEORGE 		Just a friend.

 DIEGO 		Who?  I need to know.  Ah, never mind.
		We'll talk about it later.

 GEORGE 		Yeah.  You do the talking.

	The sound of a young man, a MALETON, struggling can be heard
	in the distance.  From another area, PABLO ESCOBAR emerges.
	He is singular in purpose.  He is handed a pistol and moves
	quickly over to the man and quietly speaks a few words.  And
	then, without emotion, he shoots the maleton in the head.
	George and Diego, who is visibly shaken, watch.  Escobar is
	handed a towel, and he wipes the splattered blood off his
	hands, as he moves back.

 LARGE COLOMBIAN MAN 		He will see you now.
		    (to Diego)
		Not you.

 DIEGO 		There must be some kind of mistake.

 LARGE COLOMBIAN MAN 		No mistake.  Mr. Escobar will see Mr.
		Jung alone.  You are to wait here.

	George hesitates.

 DIEGO 		It's alright, George.  You go.

 LARGE COLOMBIAN MAN 		This way, please.

	The large Colombian man escorts George towards the area where
	the maleton was just shot.  George looks back at Diego as he
	is led away.

 ESCOBAR 		So, this is the man who takes fifty
		kilos and makes them disappear in one
		day?

 GEORGE 		Actually, it was three.

 ESCOBAR 		The man who gives us the airplanes.  The
		man from America.  The mafia.  Chicago.
		Boom boom.  Hollywood.  You are going to
		open for us the gates of Hollywood,
		George?

 GEORGE 		It would be my pleasure.

 ESCOBAR 		Good.  Very good.  Welcome, my friend.
		Welcome to my country.

	Escobar moves over to embrace George.  George returns it, and
	their hands come together.  George can't help it.  He
	reflexively looks at his hands.  Escobar understands.

 ESCOBAR (CONT'D) 		The man in the garden.  He was full of
		courage.

 GEORGE 		Un sapo?

 ESCOBAR 		Un rata - no good.  But he could have
		run, fled the country.  Gone to the
		policia.  But then his wife, his
		children, his parents, his friends, many
		people would die.

 GEORGE 		Yes.

 ESCOBAR 		But, never mind.  I am thinking we can
		do much together.  This problem with
		Diego, the stolen car, the jail, is very
		silly business.  To release him from the
		carcel, it causes me much inconvenience.
		The fifty kilos could have been a big
		problem.  And I don't like problems.

 GEORGE 		With all respect, Padrino.  Diego is my
		partner.  I do not do business without
		him.

	Escobar looks at him with a cold stare.  But George doesn't
	flinch.  His face reveals nothing.  Finally, a smile breaks
	across Pablo's lips.

 ESCOBAR 		I like you, George.  You are loyal.
		That is good.  That is rare.  Maybe
		crazy.  Yes.  I can tell already.  You
		are like me.  I look at you and I see
		myself.  It's in the eyes, no, George?

 GEORGE 		Yes, it is.

 ESCOBAR 		So, you are wanting to sell the cocaine
		for me in your country, George?

 GEORGE 		Yes, sir.  As much as you can give me.

 ESCOBAR 		As much as I can give you?  Ha ha.  Very
		good.  I like that.  Come, George.  Let
		us drive.  We have much to talk about.

	Diego watches the two men walk outside.  Escobar throws an
	arm around George's shoulder.  Pablo hops into a Jeep and
	motions for George.  The bodyguards come running.  But Pablo
	waves them away.

 EXT. MOUNTAINSIDE - COLOMBIA - DAY 
	Escobar pulls the Jeep off the road and parks it.  Before
	them is a stunning panorama.

 ESCOBAR 		I like to come up here.  To make the
		decisions.  To be one with nature.

 GEORGE 		It's beautiful.

 ESCOBAR 		People tell me that I am crazy.  That my
		business will never work in your
		country.  What do you think, George?

	Escobar looks out over the vista, allowing George the time to
	respond in full.

 GEORGE 		What do I think?  I don't want my answer
		to be influenced by what I want, so I'm
		going to have to say I don't know.

 ESCOBAR 		Yes.  I do not know, either.  What do
		you want, George?

 GEORGE 		I want money.

 ESCOBAR 		Yes.  Money.  Which is what, George?

 GEORGE 		Freedom.

 ESCOBAR 		Power?

 GEORGE 		Yeah, maybe.

 ESCOBAR 		Family.

 GEORGE 		Sure.

 ESCOBAR 		Beautiful girls?

 GEORGE 		Keep them coming.

 ESCOBAR 		Keep them coming?  Ah, yes.  Ha ha.  You
		are right.  But money.

 GEORGE 		Money.

 ESCOBAR 		And Diego?

 GEORGE 		Diego is my brother.

	Escobar looks at George a long time.  He's inscrutable.

 ESCOBAR 		Good.  Take care of him, George.  I'm
		fond of him, but he is sometimes like a
		baby.  Keep an eye on him, okay?

 EXT. DESERTED SUGAR FACTORY - ENTRANCE - DAY 
	Diego is a little pissed off for being left for so long.  He
	taps his foot and picks at his fingernails.  Escobar and
	George pull up in the Jeep.  Diego leaps to his feet.

 DIEGO 		Padrino.

	Escobar wraps his arms around Diego in an embrace.

 ESCOBAR 		Diego, mijo.  I've made a decision.  We
		are going into business and I would like
		to start right away.

 MONTAGE - GEORGE AND DIEGO TAKING OVER THE WORLD 
	The following images are overlaid with snow falling and money
	dropping through frame.  CLOSE SHOTS of George and Diego on
	the phone, wheeling and dealing, hands counting cash, and
	lines being drawn off mirrors.  The effect is surreal and
	dreamy.

 INT. WAREHOUSE - DAY 
	A duffel bag is unzipped, revealing bricks and bricks of
	cocaine.  Each marked with a "P."  A knife punctures one of
	the bricks.  A mound of white powder is brought up to a man's
	nose.  It's George who samples, and then it is sampled by the
	man he is doing business with.  The shot widens TO REVEAL all
	the participants and dozens and dozens of duffel bags.  A
	handshake seals the deal.

 STILL PHOTOS 
	Handshake after handshake after handshake.

 INT. MIAMI HOUSE - NIGHT 
	George and Diego counting cash.  It's everywhere.  All over
	the floor, in two-foot stacks.

 MORE STILL PHOTOS 
	Various transactions completed.

 INT. MIAMI HOUSE - NIGHT 
	George and Diego count.  It's ridiculous how much money there
	is.  The stacks are now waist high and spill into other
	rooms.  Inez is there, pacing the floor and rapid-fire
	talking on the phone.

 MORE STILL PHOTOS 
	George and Diego, the Banditos.  Cigars.  Champagne.  Arms
	around each other in camaraderie.  In Diego's yellow Ferrari.
	With Inez, sunning on a yacht.  More coke and more
	transactions.  When the deals are with Derek Foreal, Diego is
	always notably absent.

 INT. MIAMI HOUSE - NIGHT 
	The money is so high, it almost reaches the ceiling.  There
	is nowhere to put it.  George and Diego sit at the coffee
	table, dwarfed by the stacks of bills.  There is a
	discrepancy in the count.

 GEORGE 		Three million.  I counted it twice.

 DIEGO 		It's two-point-five, George.  I am sure.

	George starts to pick up the money.

 GEORGE 		I'm calling it three.

 DIEGO 		We're half a million off.

 GEORGE 		Fuck it.  I'm not counting it again.

 DIEGO 		Weight it.  If it's sixty pounds, it's
		three.  If it's fifty, it's two-point
		five.

 GEORGE 		I don't give a shit.  Close enough.

	George moves down the hall looking for a place to stack the
	money, but there is no more room.

 GEORGE (CONT'D) 		Where do I put this!?

 DIEGO 		Try the back bedroom.

	George opens the back bedroom door to find wall-to-wall
	money.  It's packed.

 GEORGE 		There's no room.

 DIEGO 		Try the closet.

	No luck there, either.  George drops the money on the floor
	and moves back into the living room.

 GEORGE 		We've got to do something about this.

 INT. BANCO DE FEDERALE - PANAMA CITY - DAY 
 SUPERIMPOSE: PANAMA CITY, PANAMA 
	George and Diego watch as their money is hauled into a huge
	wall safe.  Armed Panamanian soldiers stand guard.  The
	Panamanian officials and the BANK PRESIDENT oversee the
	proceedings.

 GEORGE 		Are you comfortable with this?

 DIEGO 		George, we've got sixty-one million
		dollars.  It's either here or someplace
		else.  We've got to put it somewhere.
		Unless you want to launder it.

 GEORGE 		And keep only forty-percent?  No thanks.

 DIEGO 		Then relax.  It's a federal bank.
		Guaranteed by the government.  And Senor
		Noriega has very lenient banking
		principles.  No questions.  No problems.
		All the pesados keep their money here.
		Even El Padrino.  What do you worry?
		Everyone knows we are with Escobar.  Who
		is going to fuck with us?

 INT. BANCO DE FEDERALE - PRESIDENT'S OFFICE - DAY 
	George and Diego sign papers.  The bank president
	congratulates them and hands them documentation.

 GEORGE 		I love it.

 BANK PRESIDENT 		I'm sorry.

 GEORGE 		I give you thirty-million dollars and
		you give me this little book.

	Diego and Inez's wedding.  The ceremony.  The ring.  The

	best man, and the only American.

 INT. BILTMORE HOTEL - BALLROOM - NIGHT 
	A huge reception.  All the pomp and circumstance Colombian
	money can buy.  Politicians.  Policemen.  And every smuggler
	north of Colombia.  George sits with Diego and Inez at the
	table of honor.  Inez is opening presents.  Diego's tipsiness
	is a little out of character, but hey, it's his wedding day
	and a little champagne never hurt anyone.  He drunkenly
	throws his arm around George's shoulder.

 DIEGO 		I'm married, George.  Me.  I can't
		believe it.  Can you believe I'm
		married, George?

 GEORGE 		You're a lucky man, Diego.

 DIEGO 		I love you, my brother, do you know
		that?

 GEORGE 		I love you too, man.

	George notices MIRTHA showing teeth across the room.

 GEORGE (CONT'D) 		I'll be right back, Diego.

 INEZ 		Look, honey, a power boat.

 DIEGO 		Great, baby, great!

	They kiss.  George walks across the dance floor directly
	towards Mirtha.

 GEORGE 		Hello.

 MIRTHA 		Hello.

 GEORGE 		Do I know you?

 MIRTHA 		I don't think so.

 GEORGE 		Why are you smiling?

 MIRTHA 		Why are you smiling?

 GEORGE 		I don't know.  My name is George.

 MIRTHA 		I know who you are, El Americano.
		Mister George.

 GEORGE 		What is your name?

	Cesar arrives.

 CESAR 		Mr. Jung, I see you've met my fiancee,
		Mirtha.

	He kisses her.

 GEORGE 		Mirtha.

 CESAR 		Diego needs to see you right away,
		please.  Excuse us, Amorcito.

	They leave.  George looks back, Mirtha is giving him more
	teeth.  George arrives at the table.  Various greetings.

 AUGUSTO 		Pleased to meet you finally, George.  I
		am Augusto Oliveras.

 GEORGE 		My pleasure, Augusto.  Diego has told me
		much about you.

 RAMON OCHOA 		Congratulations on your conquest of the
		West Coast.   How much bigger can we
		get?

 GEORGE 		Sky's the limit.  We're just beginning
		to tap the market.  If it's accepted by
		actors and musicians, the rest will
		follow.

	They all agree.  Mirtha still gives George the teeth from
	across the room.  Diego returns to the table.

 AUGUSTO 		We are talking about George's West Coast
		operation.

 DIEGO 		Ah, George's mystery man.

 RAFAEL OJEDA 		Yes, where is this man?  When do we meet
		him?

 DIEGO 		You don't meet him.  George keeps this a
		secret.  He's here meeting everyone,
		goes to Colombia and meets Pablo, but
		still keeps his secrets.  Even from his
		brother.

 JUAN CARLOS "THE GUAPO" 		Come on, George, we're all in this
		together.

 EMILIO OCHOA 		Yes, George, there's enough for
		everybody.

 GEORGE 		I think Padroni is happy with the
		current situation.  Will you please
		excuse me?

	George exits after Mirtha.

 INT. BILTMORE HOTEL - BALLROOM - CONTINUOUS 
	George steps into the empty lobby looking for Mirtha.  He
	can't find her.  She appears from the shadows and startles
	him.  George embraces her and plants one on her.

 MIRTHA 		You better know what you're doing,
		George.  You're playing with fire.

 GEORGE 		I like fire.

	She blows him a kiss from the adjoining lounge chair.  He
	blows one back.  She licks her lips and it's on.  He's out of
	the chair, pouring champagne over her tan body, and licking
	it off.  She squeals with delight.
	A table gets knocked over as they cause a commotion.  A hotel
	manager comes over, but George hands him a wad of cash and he
	quickly fucks off.

 INT. SILVER STAR WEDDING CHAPEL - LAS VEGAS - 1978 - DAY 
	There is no white dress.  There is no tuxedo.  George and
	Mirtha haven't even taken off their sunglasses.

 MIRTHA 		I do.

	They kiss.  Mirtha wipes her red nose.

 MIRTHA (CONT'D) 		I need a fucking drink.

 INT. EASTHAM HOUSE - CONTINUOUS 
	George moves to the bedroom.  Mirtha is pregnant and she's
	showing.  She's also bent over a mirror with a straw in her
	hand.  George opens the door and takes her by surprise.

 GEORGE 		Jesus Christ.

 MIRTHA 		Oh, don't be such a fucking hypocrite.
		I quit smoking, didn't I?

 GEORGE 		Put that shit away, they're here.

 INT. EASTHAM HOUSE - DOWNSTAIRS - LATER 
	Mirtha and George lead Fred and Ermine from room to room,
	showing off the house.  The decor is, well, eclectic.  It
	doesn't match the architecture.

 ERMINE 		It's all so beautiful.

 MIRTHA 		What do you think, Dad?

 FRED 		Yeah.  Nice.

 ERMINE 		Look at this credenza.  If you don't
		mind me asking, how much is something
		like that?  It's got to cost a fortune.

 GEORGE 		    (quickly)
		It's a family heirloom.

 ERMINE 		I've seen those in magazines.  They're
		not cheap.

 GEORGE 		Mirtha comes from a very wealthy family.

 ERMINE 		Oh, I see.

 MIRTHA 		Come on.  I'll show you the rest of the
		house.

	George and his father move outside.

 EXT. GROUNDS - CONTINUOUS 
	George and his father walk.

 GEORGE 		So, business is going good.  I've got
		this import/export thing going on in
		Miami that's been very profitable.  With
		my investments...

 FRED 		Don't bullshit me, George.  I don't see
		you very much, I don't want to waste the
		time.

	They move along the rear of the house.  Classic cars line the
	driveway.

 FRED (CONT'D) 		You come from my body, remember?  You're
		my baby boy.  The same kid who would
		jump off a mountain if someone told him
		he couldn't do it.  You haven't changed
		much.  I know the things you do.  Not
		everything.  But I get the picture and I
		don't care.  I don't like it.  It's not
		what I would have chosen for you, but
		it's your life.  It doesn't have
		anything to do with me.

	He turns and looks at his boy.

 FRED (CONT'D) 		You're like your mother.  You love
		money.

 GEORGE 		Dad.

 FRED 		No, it's good.  You have a family.  It's
		good if it makes you happy.  It's nice
		to have nice things.  Are you happy,
		son?

 GEORGE 		Yeah, Dad.  I'm happy right now.

 INT. HOLIDAY MOTEL - LITTLE HAVANA - 1978 - DAY 
	Diego puts a straw in his nose and snorts a big gakker.  His
	eyes are wide, his pupils dilated, and a weapon sticks out of
	the back of his pants.  He knocks the dust off his nose
	before moving outside.  George is on the porch, smoking a
	cigarette.

 DIEGO 		Three years.  How long have we been in
		business?  Three years.  Does she get to
		meet your connection?  Was she good
		enough?

 GEORGE 		Shut up, Diego.  They're going to be
		here any minute.  I'm trying to
		concentrate.

 DIEGO 		I'm very angry with you, George.  Very
		angry.  You don't take me to California,
		but you take your bitch wife?  A woman?
		I understand you love her, but it was
		you and me who started this.  You and
		me.

 GEORGE 		What do you need my connection for,
		Diego?  What are you going to do with
		it?

 DIEGO 		What do I do with it?  Nothing.  It's
		for peace of mind.  It's for the
		principle.

	George doesn't have time for this.  He checks the cylinders
	on his weapon and runs over possible scenarios in his mind.
	But Diego won't get off the soap box.

 GEORGE 		Jesus fucking Christ, Diego.  I ain't
		telling you.  It's just business.  Now,
		shut up.  You're driving me crazy.

 DIEGO 		I'm driving you crazy?  No.  You're
		driving me crazy.  We had a dream.  What
		happened to our dream?

	A black sedan pulls up and FIVE PUERTO RICAN MEN approach the
	room.  George and Diego greet them and lead them inside.
	It's game time.  The atmosphere is charged with danger and
	everyone is acutely aware of everything.  The guys sit down,
	their guns bulging through the inside of their suits.  The
	suitcases are opened.  The rules are the same.  No English.
	No raising voices.  No sudden movements.  George offers their
	leader, TONY, beers for his men, and is politely declined.
	The count starts.  George and Diego riff through ten thousand
	dollar bundles.  Diego is still acting pissy.  He's mumbling
	to himself, making faces, slamming the money all around.  The
	guys keep a close eye on him.  Diego finishes a stack, throws
	one of the bags on the ground.  The conversation is in
	Spanish unless otherwise indicated.

 TONY 		Algun problema?

 GEORGE 		No no no... no problema, amigo.  El
		dinero esta todo aqui.
		Lleves las "llaves" y mas tarde lo
		contaremos.  Okay?  No problem.

 TONY 		Que problema?  Nosotros esperamos.

	The pressure is getting to one of the hoods.  His name is
	BENNY.  He's got a crazy eye and he seems ready to snap.
	George resumes the count, but Diego won't get off it.

 DIEGO 		    (English)
		You embarrassed me, George.  You make me
		look very bad.

 BENNY 		Que esta diciendo?

 GEORGE 		Nothing.  Todo esta bien.

 DIEGO 		    (English)
		Everything is not alright.  I bring you
		in, and you slap my fucking face!

 GEORGE 		This is not the time, Diego.

	The men all reach for their pieces and all hell starts to
	break loose.

 TONY 		Hay algun problema?  Hablame!

 DIEGO 		    (English)
		You fucked me in front of my whole
		family!

 GEORGE 		Fuck you...I didn't fuck you.

 BENNY 		Maldita sea, que diablos esta diciendo?

 GEORGE 		Esta todo aqui, amigo...take the keys.
		Take 'em and go.

 TONY 		Que esta pasando aqui, jefe?

 DIEGO 		Sientese ye no se meta en lo que no le
		importa.

	The guns are out and pointed.  It's out of control now.

 GEORGE 		Take it easy!  Everything's okay!

 DIEGO 		Que es lo que quieren de me, hijueputas
		campesinos?

	George steps forward with the keys.

 GEORGE 		Take the fucking keys!

	BLAM!  Courtesy of Benny, George is hit.  The shoulder, the
	collarbone.  It's hard to tell.

 GEORGE (CONT'D) 		Estoy bien, okay?  Everything is
		alright.  There's no problem.  Okay?
		This never happened.  No one has to know
		anything about this.  Diego, I want you
		to calmly tell them where the fucking
		coke is.  Do it now.

 DIEGO 		Es un Ford blanco junto a una pick-up.

	Tony very carefully takes the car keys.

 GEORGE 		No problem, gentlemen.  Goodbye.

	The men slowly back out the door.  George looks at Diego.

 GEORGE (CONT'D) 		Derek Foreal.

 DIEGO 		What?

 GEORGE 		Derek Foreal.  Derek Foreal.  Derek
		fucking Foreal.  Alright?  The answer to
		all your dreams.  Are you happy now?

 EXT. LOS ANGELES INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT - DAY 
	George and Diego exit the terminal.  George's arm is in a
	sling.  The familiar sight of Derek Foreal is Lincoln
	Continental.

	The three men come together, and Diego and Derek are
	introduced.  The men's hands come together and the FRAME
	FREEZES on their handshake.

 EXT. EASTHAM HOUSE - UPSTAIRS - DAY 
	Fred pulls into the driveway in his new car and honks the
	horn.  Fred and Ermine get out of the car.

 FRED 		Hello, hello.

 INT. OLIVEROS MANSION - MIAMI - NIGHT 
	It's a New Year's Eve party.  A lavish Colombian celebration.
	George and a very pregnant Mirtha move through the crowd to
	find Augusto.

 AUGUSTO 		I'm so glad you two could make it.
		Mirtha, look at you.  So beautiful.  You
		look like you're about to burst.

 MIRTHA 		Thanks.  I am.  Where's Martha?

 AUGUSTO 		I don't know.  Drunk somewhere.  Try the
		bar.  And if you find her, tell her to
		come, it's almost midnight.

	As Mirtha leaves, Augusto throws his arm around George's
	shoulder.

 AUGUSTO (CONT'D) 		It's good you came down, George.  We
		need to discuss a few things.

 DIEGO 		Where's Diego?

 AUGUSTO 		He's not here, George.

 GEORGE 		Yeah, well where is he?  And who is this
		Norman K. guy?  That's all anyone is
		talking about.  Norman K.  Norman K.  Do
		I know him?

	Augusto lets out a big laugh.

 AUGUSTO 		Norman Cay is not a person.  He is an
		island, George.  In the Bahamas.  From
		what they say, it is free and it's
		Diego's new home.

 GEORGE 		What?

	Augusto throws an arm around George's shoulder.

 AUGUSTO 		Let us walk.  From what I understand,
		Diego has bought a hundred and sixty
		acres, a marina, a hotel, and an
		airstrip.

 GEORGE 		Motherfucker works fast.

 AUGUSTO 		The word is that soon he is to be king
		of the middle empire.  He is doing
		multiple runs right now and using the
		island as a jump-off point.

 GEORGE 		He what?

 AUGUSTO 		Yes.  Jack Stevens is already a very
		busy man.  Along with many others.  You
		shouldn't stay away so long.

 GEORGE 		That's impossible.  We can't be up and
		running.  Who's distributing?

	Augusto says nothing.  But the ball is dropping in Times
	Square.  10, 9, 8, 7...

 GEORGE (CONT'D) 		Oh, no.

	Happy New Year.  Streamers, confetti, and champagne.  George
	marches through the kissing guests and over to a phone.  He's
	steaming.  The music is up, so he has to scream.

 GEORGE (CONT'D) 		Hello, Derek?  This is George.  Am I
		wearing lipstick?
		I said, am I wearing lipstick?  Because
		when I'm getting fucked, I want to make
		sure my face is pretty.  You're buying
		directly from Diego, aren't you, you son
		of a bitch?

 INTERCUT 
	Derek Foreal in full New Year's regalia, complete with party
	hat.

 DEREK 		I don't want to get caught in the middle
		of this.  That's between you and Diego.

	George's face scrinches in pain.

 DEREK (CONT'D) 		It's nothing personal, George.  Just
		business.

 GEORGE 		Yeah.  I understand.  Just business.
		Right.  Fuck you.

	The song ends, and George is left standing there screaming.

 GEORGE (CONT'D) 		I bring you in, and this is how you
		repay me?  You little homo!  Hey, Derek?
		Derek?

 INT. OLIVEROS MANSION - DINING ROOM - 1979 - LATER 
	It's late.  The family is all there.  Fifteen, twenty strong.
	Cuban coffees all around.

 MIRTHA 		Que va hacer?

 AUGUSTO 		Que queres decir.  Que es lo que el va
		hacer?  Pues, no va hacer nada.

 MARIA 		Alguna cosa tiene que hacer.

 FAMILY MEMBER #2 		De otra manera, es un marica.

 FAMILY MEMBER #3 		Un hijueputa

 FAMILY MEMBER #1 		Maricon.

 FAMILY MEMBER #2 		Mira, vos sos responsable por el exito

 MARIA 		No Puedes hacer ni un culo.

 AUGUSTO 		El no va hacer nada.  Hay un problema.
		Aqui, hubo un error y nosotros lo vamos
		ha arreglar.

 BLANCA 		No le escusches a mi yerno.  A el solo
		le importa la plata.

	Blanca reaches into her purse, pulls out an ice pick folded
	in a piece of linen cloth, and puts it down in front of
	George.

 BLANCA (CONT'D) 		Vos lo tenes que matar, ahorita mismo.
		De lo contrario vas a quedar como un
		marica sin horror.

 FAMILY MEMBER #3 		Mejor dicho vos sos un aculillado.

 FAMILY MEMBER #1 		Maricon.

 BLANCA 		Sabes que, vos no tenes pantalones.
		Nadie te va a respetar.  Usa esto.  Deja
		solo un huequito tan pequeno, que ni
		sangre le va a salir a ese malparido del
		Diego.

 AUGUSTO 		Blanca, por favor.

 MIRTHA 		Mama, vos sos bien antigua.  Como lo va
		a matar con un picahielo.  Eso era en su
		tiempo, estamos casi ya en los ochenta.
		El lo va a meter un tiro, lo va a volar,
		le va a hechar un hijueputa carro
		encima.

 AUGUSTO 		Dejen la maricada pues!  No jodan!
		Nadie va a matar a nadie!  George,
		debemos hablarle al Patron, es la unica

 GEORGE 		No, no, no, no yo puedo arregarlo solo.

 EXT. NORMAN CAY - BAHAMAS - 1979 - DUSK 
	George cruises through the turqoise water of the Caribbean in
	a sport fisherman.  Before him is Norman Cay.  White sand
	beaches.  Beautiful.  Pristine.

 EXT. NORMAN CAY - DOCKS - DUSK 
	Waiting for him is Cesar.

 CESAR 		Good to see you, George.  It's been a
		long time.

 INT. THE YACHT CLUB - SUNSET 
	The Yacht Club is a tavern style bar that juts out over the
	water.  The crimson sky streaks the windows.  Diego looks
	like Che Guavera.  His hair is long, and a graying beard
	sticks through his gaunt face.  The bar has been taken over
	by Diego's BANDITOS.  Automatic weapons and PROSTITUTES
	accent this drunken setting.  George is escorted through the
	door by Cesar, and the room quiets.  All eyes on Diego and
	George.  Diego rises.

 DIEGO 		George, I am happy to see you.  How are
		you, my brother?

 GEORGE 		No more brothers, Diego.

 DIEGO 		Of course we are brothers.  Why do you
		say that?   You hurt me, George.

 GEORGE 		You fucked me, Diego.

 DIEGO 		I did not.

 GEORGE 		You went behind my back and you cut me
		out.

 DIEGO 		No, I never.  I would not do that,
		George.  Never.

 GEORGE 		I talked to Foreal, Diego.

	There is a pause.  Diego's goons ready their weapons as Diego
	scoops up a cringer with his pinky and sniffs.

 DIEGO 		Maybe you are right.  I did betray you a
		little bit.

	One of the men says something in Spanish and everyone laughs.
	George is furious.  He starts to tremble and his face turns
	red.

 DIEGO (CONT'D) 		Oh, boo hoo, boo hoo.  So sad, George.
		I stole your California connection.  So
		what?  Who introduced you to Pablo
		Escobar?  Me.  Who introduced you to
		your fucking Colombian wife?  Me.  Who
		protected you when my friend Cesar Roza
		wanted to slice your fucking throat,
		huh?  Who mad you millions and millions
		of dollars?  Me.  And what do I get in
		return?  This?  Accusations?  I have
		always given you everything, George, but
		that is over now.  This is my operation.
		My dream.  So go home, George.  Go back
		to your stupid little life.  You can
		sell half grams to your fucking
		relatives for all I care.  Because you
		are out!

	George lunges at Diego and is immediately grabbed.

 GEORGE 		You'd better kill me now, Diego, because
		you're a dead man.

 DIEGO 		George, don't be so emotional.  This is
		business.  Besides, I can't kill you,
		you are my brother.

	They lead him away.

 EXT. YACHT CLUB - CONTINUOUS 
	George is getting the shit kicked out of him.  His teeth
	broken, kicked in the head, the body, the groin.  His arm
	stomped.  Blood and broken bones.  It's a king size beating.
	The men prop him up and Cesar reaches back and hits him with
	a haymaker.  CRACK.  George's nose is broken.  Blood spurts
	everywhere.  George is dropped to the ground, spit on, and
	left for dead.

 CESAR 		Say "hi" to your pretty wife for me.

 EXT. HACIENDA LOS NAPOLES - COLOMBIA - POOL - DAY 
	A beautiful, sprawling estate.  A family barbecue, Colombian
	style, is in full swing.  Kids play soccer.  Zoo animals run
	wild together.

	George is led outside by TWO OVER-ARMED BODYGUARDS.  Pablo
	sees him and gives George a big hug.

 ESCOBAR 		George, you look terrible.

 GEORGE 		Yeah, well...

 ESCOBAR 		Diego?

 GEORGE 		Yeah.

 ESCOBAR 		Please.  Sit down.  We'll drink some
		scotch.

 GEORGE 		I didn't come here to drink scotch.

 ESCOBAR 		I see.  I'm sorry about this, George.
		I'm not happy about this situation.
		It's bad.  You now know who your Brutus
		is.

 GEORGE 		You know why I'm here.  You know what I
		have to do.  I came here for permission.
		Out of respect, Pablo.  This is
		bullshit, he's making me look like a
		punk.

 ESCOBAR 		It is very difficult.  Diego makes me a
		lot of money.  If Diego goes so does the
		money.  You were an excellent teacher,
		George.  When the student has learned
		well, the teacher is no longer
		necessary.  We must remember we have
		wives, friends, familia.  Even familia
		that has not been born.  But sometimes,
		we must forget as well.  I am like you.
		I must teach the lesson.  We want to
		teach the lesson.  But we cannot.  We
		must remember that life is the teacher.

 GEORGE 		You're saying life will take care of
		Diego?

 ESCOBAR 		Life will take care of everybody.
		Diego, me, you.  It is the teacher.

 GEORGE 		I get it.   I'm really pissed, Pablo.
		You know the DEA knows about Norman's
		Cay.  For Chrissakes, Diego worships
		Adolf Hitler and John Lennon, that's
		fucked up!

 ESCOBAR 		I'm sorry, George.

 GEORGE 		Yeah, well, what are you gonna do?  You
		and me, Pablo?  Are we good?

 ESCOBAR 		Of course, George.  We are beautiful.
		We are brothers.  Real brothers.  Not
		like Diego.  We started this, George.

	Escobar embraces George for a moment, and then George starts
	to move away.

 ESCOBAR (CONT'D) 		And, George?  The vengance?  It is best
		served cold.

 INT. EASTHAM HOUSE - GEORGE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT 
	Mirtha is sleeping.  She's so big, she looks like she's gonna
	explode.  George sits on the bed and rests his hand on
	Mirtha's face.  He looks like the Elephant Man.

 MIRTHA 		George.  Oh, Jesus Christ, George.  Look
		at you.

 GEORGE 		Shhh, honey, never mind.  It's alright.
		It's over.  I quit the business.  I'm
		out.

 MIRTHA 		Pablo said no?

 GEORGE 		Pablo said no.  It's all over.  And I'm
		never going back.  I have you.  We have
		the baby.  And there's nothing else.
		It's just the family now.  Shhh.  Sleep
		now.

 EXT. EASTHAM HOUSE - DAY 
	Fred, Ermine and Mirth are waiting for George in the car.
	Mirtha's water has broken.  Ermine honks the horn from the
	back seat and screams out the window.

 ERMINE 		George, it's time!  George!  George!

 INT. HOUSE - CONTINUOUS 
	George is high and in a panic.  He races around, trying to
	get a suitcase packed and find his keys.

 GEORGE 		Coming!

	He finally gets it together, but before he runs out the door,
	he does one last blast.

 INT. CAPE COD HOSPITAL - HYANNIS - MATERNITY - DAY 
	Mirtha is on the birthing table and screaming in pain.  She's
	crowning.  George wears hospital scrubs and a surgical mask.
	He and his saucer pupils hold Mirtha's hand in comfort.  The
	baby comes, and DOCTOR MICK BAY slaps it's behind and cuts
	the cord.  Tough ass Mirtha breaks down and sobs
	hysterically.  But something is wrong with George.  The color
	drains from his face.  He grabs his chest and falls over onto
	the floor.  The MEDICAL STAFF attends to him.

 GEORGE (V.O.) 		Watching my baby girl born did something
		to me.
		They talk about religious experiences, I
		didn't believe in religion.  But when
		Kristina Sunshine Jung came into this
		world, something in me changed.  I
		looked at her and I knew right then that
		I could never love anything but my
		daughter ever again.  It sounds sappy,
		but it was like, click, I knew what I
		was put on this planet for.  It was the
		greatest feeling I ever had followed by
		the worst feeling I ever had.

 NURSE 		He fainted.

 MIRTHA 		George!

	The doctor grabs George's wrist.

 DR. BAY 		He's in tachycardia.  George, your heart
		is racing.  Have you been using drugs?

 GEORGE 		Coke.

 DR. BAY 		Cocaine?  How much?

 GEORGE 		I don't know.  Maybe eighteen grams.

 DR. BAY 		In how long?  A week?

 GEORGE 		Today.

 DR. BAY 		Oh, Jesus, Get me a 12-lead e.k.g. and
		start an i.v. stat!  This man is having
		a heart attack.

 INT. CAPE COD HOSPITAL - HYANNIS - LATER 
	George lies in the recovery room, sedated, tubes everywhere.
	He's hooked up to IV's, monitors, and machines.  Dr. Bay
	enters.

 DR. BAY 		I've reviewed your toxicology report
		three times, George.  I've never seen
		anything like it.  Eighteen grams.
		The lethal dose is a gram and a half.
		You should be in the Guiness Book.

	George cracks a faint smile.

 DR. BAY (CONT'D) 		It's not funny, George.  You should be
		dead right now.  Absolutely.  I cannot
		come up with one logical explanation for
		why you're still breathing.  I'm not
		here to give you lectures, I've got no
		moral interest in what you do.  But,
		take it easy, George.  Stay with us a
		while.  You've got a daughter now.

 INT. EASTHAM HOUSE - DAY 
	Kristina is crying.  Daddy George to the rescue.  He picks
	her up, cuddles her.  Gives her a bottle and she quiets.

 EXT. EASTHAM HOUSE - FRONT YARD - 1980 - DAY 
	A one-year-old Kristina is being coaxed by George to take her
	first steps.

 GEORGE 		Come on.  Come on, honey.  You can do
		it.  Come to Daddy.

	Kristina tries, stumbles.  Gets up again.  She looks like a
	drunk, but she's doing it.

 GEORGE (CONT'D) 		Good girl!

	Mirtha enters.  She's all pinned out, dressed in Ungaro,
	Cartier, and dark sunglasses.

 GEORGE (CONT'D) 		Look, Mirtha.  She's walking.

 MIRTHA 		She did that before.

 GEORGE 		No.  These are her first steps.  Watch
		her.

 MIRTHA 		Yeah.  I know.  She did that before.

 GEORGE 		But this is...

 MIRTHA 		I said, I've seen it before.

 GEORGE 		Alright.

 MIRTHA 		Can you lift the furnace.  I need money.

 GEORGE 		Where are you going?

 MIRTHA 		Out.

 MONTAGE - SERIES OF SHOTS - 1980-85 
 HOME MOVIE STYLE & PHOTOGRAPHS 
	The years go by and they are SUPERIMPOSED as they pass.
	George, clean and sober, enjoying family life.  Healthy and
	happy.  Mr. Mom.  Mirtha looks worse and worse as her habit
	becomes bigger and bigger.  As George and Kristina grow
	closer and closer, Mirtha is stepping out on the town.
	Blowing money right and left.  Shopping with Mirtha, buying
	clothes, furs, and diamonds.  As Kristina gets older, WE SEE
	her birthday parties.  George and Kristina wearing paper hats
	and eating ice cream.  She's two years old, she's three,
	four, five, six...

 INT. EASTHAM HOUSE - 1985 - NIGHT 
	The Eastham house is all done up for a party deluxe.  Fully
	catered, with bartenders, waiters, music, the works.  And of
	course the three c's, champagne, caviar and Colombians.
	George is laughing with Augusto and Martha Oliveros, but when
	Derek Foreal appears in the doorway, George excuses himself
	and walks over.

 DEREK 		Happy Birthday, George.  Mirtha invited
		me.

 GEORGE 		Yeah.  She told me.

 DEREK 		Look, I'm sorry about everything.  I
		feel like an idiot.  You were right.  I
		did fuck you.  And then Diego fucked me.
		Cut me out, too.

 GEORGE 		I heard.

 DEREK 		I lost sight of everything.  Forgot who
		my friends were.

 GEORGE 		It's in the past.  I'm out of the
		business now, so forget about it.  No
		hard feelings.  We need to move on.  And
		besides, I'm sorry, too.

 DEREK 		You?

 GEORGE 		For calling you a homo.

 DEREK 		That was out of line.

	George throws his arm around Derek's shoulder.

 GEORGE 		Good to see you, Derek.

	Mirtha runs in with a giant crystal punch bowl filled with
	mother of pearl.  She holds it over her head triumphantly.

 MIRTHA 		Now let's fucking party, motherfuckers!
		Let's have some fucking fun.

 DEREK 		Jesus, is that Mirtha!?

	A very underweight Mirtha nervously runs around the party,
	shoving coke up everyone's noses.  She is gakked to the gills
	and out of control.  Her pupils a mile wide.

 DEREK (CONT'D) 		Christ almighty, George.  Feed her a
		cheeseburger or something.  What does
		she weight, eighty pounds?

 GEORGE 		I know.  She needs to slow down.  She's
		going to blow an O-ring.

	Singing.  The birthday cake is brought in, the candles are
	blown out and everyone cheers.
	Mirtha runs over to her husband, still holding the cocaine.
	She's sweaty, her hair matted down on one side.

 MIRTHA 		Happy birthday, baby.  Do a line.

	She tries to push a line up his nose.

 GEORGE 		No, that's alright.

 MIRTHA 		Oh fucking relax.  Let your hair down
		for once.  It's your fucking birthday,
		for Chrissakes.  You're such a fucking
		pussy.  I swear to G-d, I married this
		big time drug dealer and wound up with
		the maid.

	Mirtha's loud now and making a scene.  He thinks about it.

 GEORGE 		No honey, I'm alright.

 AUGUSTO 		A toast!  To Mister George Jung.  Mr. I
		95, north and south.  My brother-in-law.
		Happy birthday!

	Everyone raises their glasses.

 EVERYONE 		To George!

	A party guest comes running inside.

 PARTY GUEST 		Cops!  They're all over the place.

	The WAITERS, in their white jackets, exchange knowing looks.
	The BARTENDER comes out from behind the bar.

 BARTENDER 		Freeze!

	In an instant, all of the waiters' guns are out.

 WAITER 		Massachusetts State Police Department!
		Everybody on the floor!

 EXT. EASTHAM HOUSE - LATER 
	Police cars everywhere.  All the party guests are filed out
	the door, and are being led away.  Mirtha is dragged out,
	spitting and screaming.  George, in handcuffs, is pushed to a
	squad car.  He looks through the window to see a FEMALE
	POLICE OFFICER escorting Kristina out of the house.

 INT. M.P.D. - INTERROGATION ROOM - NIGHT 
	George, still dressed in his party clothes, sits at a desk.
	TWO DETECTIVES set a confession in front of him.

 GEORGE 		What's this?

 DETECTIVE #2 		It's your statement.  How it was all
		yours, the pound of coke was for
		personal use and none of the guests had
		any idea it was there, yeah, right.

	George looks through the papers.

 GEORGE 		I want my kid out of protective custody.
		Now.  No fucking around.  My wife and my
		kid on a plane tonight.  I sign when
		they call me safe and sound.

 DETECTIVE #1 		No fucking way.

 GEORGE 		Fuck you, then.  I sign nothing.

	The detectives ponder.

 DETECTIVE #2 		Do it.

	Detective #1 walks to the door.

 DETECTIVE #1 		George?  You better get yourself a good
		lawyer this time.  We're gonna nail your
		ass to the wall on this one.

 GEORGE 		Oh hey, one more thing?

 DETECTIVE #1 		What's that?

 GEORGE 		Get me a six pack.

 EXT. EASTHAM HOUSE - GARAGE - NIGHT 
	It's the middle of the night.  George walks through a dark
	and lonely house.  He goes to the furnace, opens it up and
	sees that there are only five stacks left.

 GEORGE 		Fuck.

 EXT. JUNG HOUSE - WEYMOUTH - PORCH - MORNING 
	George pulls up to the front.

 GEORGE 		Hi.

 FRED 		I heard.  Ermine, your son is here.

 ERMINE (O.S.) 		Tell him I don't want to see him.  Tell
		him he's not welcome here.

 GEORGE 		Mom.

	Ermine's back is to George.  She won't look at him.

 ERMINE 		Don't you dare step one foot in this
		house.  You're not my son, you hear me?
		I don't have a son anymore.

	She disappears into the house.  The sound of a door slamming.

 FRED 		She's angry.  It's all over the news.

 GEORGE 		Yeah.  Listen.  I'm going to be going
		away for awhile.

 FRED 		You're not going to trial?

 GEORGE 		No.

 FRED 		Good.

	They stand there and look at each other for a while.  There's
	a lot to say but nothing's coming out.  George hands Fred a
	gym bag.

 GEORGE 		Give this to Mom, will you?

 FRED 		Money.  You and your mother.  All the
		time chasing it.  I never understood it.

 GEORGE 		Give it to her, Dad.  It'll make her
		happy.

 FRED 		Yeah, I know.  This is it, isn't it?

	The two men throw their arms around each other and hold on to
	one another in the doorway of the old house.

 GEORGE 		Tell Mom, you know...

 FRED 		I'll tell her.

	George breaks away and moves to the T-bird.

 FRED (CONT'D) 		Take care of yourself.

 INT. BANCO DE FEDERALE - PANAMA CITY - 1985 - DAY 
	George walks through the bank.

 INT. BANCO DE FEDERALE - PANAMA CITY - CONTINUOUS 
	George sits at a desk in front of a Panamanian BANK EMPLOYEE.
	He slides his bank book across the table.

 GEORGE 		I'd like to make a withdrawal.

	The employee opens the book and gets a funny look on his
	face.  Nervous.

 BANK EMPLOYEE 		Excuse me, please.

	He gets up and moves to the BANK MANAGER.  They move to
	another MANAGER TYPE.  And another.
	And then everyone disappears behind closed doors.  Finally,
	the BANK PRESIDENT emerges and moves over to George.

 BANK PRESIDENT 		I'm afraid there is a problem, Mr. Jung.
		The banks have gone through a change, a
		nationalization.  I'm afraid your funds
		have been appropriated by the Panamanian
		Government...

	George starts to shake.  The bank president tries to explain,
	but whatever he says is unimportant.  George is paralyzed.

 INT. APARTMENT - LIBERTY CITY, FLORIDA - NIGHT 
	An inexpensive one-bedroom furnished apartment.  It ain't
	much, but it's home.  Mirtha has just received the news and
	is losing her mind.  Clara Blanca is cooking dinner.

 MIRTHA 		What are we going to do?!  What are we
		going to use for money?!

 GEORGE 		Please, Mirtha.  I'll start working for
		Augusto.  I'll talk to him tonight.
		I'll do something.

 MIRTHA 		Don't touch me.  Tell me.  Just answer
		the question.  What do I spend?  What?
		How will we live?

	Kristina sits there.  She hears everything, so does Clara
	Blanca.

 GEORGE 		Not in front of the kid.

 MIRTHA 		Don't give me that shit.  You just
		better do something.

	She storms into the bedroom and slams the door.  George
	stands there.  Awkward silence.  George goes to Kristina.

 GEORGE 		Everything's gonna be okay, sweetheart.
		Don't be upset.

 KRISTINA 		What's happening to us?

	Tough question to answer.

 GEORGE 		I don't know.

 KRISTINA 		Are we gonna split up?

 GEORGE 		No, never.  Don't even think about that,
		it's impossible.  I love your mother.
		And you are my heart.  Could I live
		without my heart?  Could I?

	Kristina nods "no."  They embrace.

 INT. GEORGE'S THUNDERBIRD - MIAMI - NIGHT 
	The car moves along I-95.  George is driving while a jacked
	up Mirtha does a speed bump.  A cop is following in the
	distance.  It is not okay.

 GEORGE 		There's a fucking cop behind us, Mirtha.
		Be cool, will ya.

 MIRTHA 		Fuck you, George, just fucking drive.

 GEORGE 		Hey, why don't you just put a "I'm doing
		cocaine" sign on the car.  What is your
		fucking problem?

 MIRTHA 		My problem?  We're broke, that's my
		fucking problem.  And you're a fucking
		spy.

 GEORGE 		What?

 MIRTHA 		That's right.  Always spying, always
		judging.  Everyone's laughing at you,
		you fucking pussy.  You let Diego fuck
		you in the ass.  Maybe you are a fucking
		faggot.  You must be fucking Diego
		because you're not fucking me.

	Mirtha grabs nuts.

 GEORGE 		Those are my nuts!

	George tries to fend her off.  The car swerves all over the
	road.  It's turned into a full scale fist fight.  The red
	lights of Florida's finest come up behind them and George is
	pulled over.

 EXT. I-95 - CONTINUOUS 
	Mirtha leaps out of the car, teary eyed, crazed and bloodied.
	The policemen step from their car.

 MIRTHA 		He's a fugitive and a fucking cocaine
		dealer!  There's a kilo in his trunk
		right now!  Take this sorry motherfucker
		to jail!

	George sits behind the wheel.  He knows it's over.

 INT. M.C.I. WALPOLE - VISITING AREA - 1989 - DAY 
 SUPERIMPOSE: FOUR YEARS LATER 
	Visiting day.  Inmates sit across from their families.
	Mirtha is sitting at the glass.  George walks to his seat.

 MIRTHA 		I'm divorcing you, George.  I'm getting
		custody of Kristina.  And when you get
		out next week, you're going to pay
		support and that's the end of it.
		Alright?  There's someone else.  I'm
		sorry.

	George just looks at her.  His face is stone.  But he is
	moved.

 MIRTHA (CONT'D) 		You should have taken better care of me,
		you know?  You've been away a long time.
		Four years.  Say something.

 GEORGE 		What do you want me to say?  I'm in
		prison.  You should know.  You put me
		here.

 MIRTHA 		Fuck you, George.  I knew you'd say
		something like that.  Always thinking
		about yourself.

	She moves away and drags nine-year old Kristina into the
	room.
	Kristina yanks her arm away and they get into a heated
	argument.  Through the glass, George can't hear the words but
	it's clear that Kristina doesn't want to be here.

 GEORGE 		My baby.  She's so big.

	Mirtha forces Kristina over to the glass and keeps showing
	her, prompting her to talk.  Kristina stares at George
	through the glass.  Cool.  Defiant.  Angry.  She picks up the
	phone and speaks, every word an accusation.

 KRISTINA 		I thought you couldn't live without your
		heart.

	She drops the phone, walks away, and doesn't look back.

 INT. PHONE BOOTH - MIAMI STREETS - DAY 
	George puts in the quarters.

 GEORGE 		Hello, Derek?  It's George.  Yeah.
		Yeah, I am.  I'm in Miami.  I'm looking
		to do something.  I want to put together
		a crew.  Do you know anybody?  Leon?  I
		don't know him.  What's his last name?
		Alright.  Give me the number.

 EXT. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - MIAMI - DAY 
	Nine-year old Kristina Jung leaves school.  George, fresh out
	of prison, moves across the street to meet her.

 KRISTINA 		What are you doing here?

 GEORGE 		Nothing.  I just wanted you to know I
		was out.  I just wanted to see you.

 KRISTINA 		Well, here I am.  See?

 GEORGE 		How are you doing?

 KRISTINA 		George, you just can't show up, tell me
		you love me, and have everything be
		okay.

 GEORGE 		Dad.

 KRISTINA 		What?

 GEORGE 		You can call me Dad if you want.

 KRISTINA 		I don't want, alright?  It's not funny.
		I'm really pissed off, George.  You blew
		it, now leave me alone.

 GEORGE 		Kristina, c'mon, I'm sorry.  I'm going
		to make this right.  I've got a few
		things going on...

 KRISTINA 		What do you want from me?

 GEORGE 		Just to walk with you.  I want to be
		your dad again.

 KRISTINA 		Do what you want, it's a free country.

	She walks away.  He follows.

 INT. THE PALM LOUNGE - MIAMI - DAY 
	George sits at the bar with a man named LEON MINGHELLA.

 LEON 		It's a four-man operation.  Two on the
		ground.  Two in the air.

 GEORGE 		Who's the co-pilot?

 LEON 		You're looking at him.  We provide the
		plane, transportation cost, U.S. landing
		spot, and take it to wherever you want
		it to go.  You provide the pick up point
		in South America, and are responsible
		for payment.  You assume all the bust
		risks.  We take sixty-five percent of
		all transportation fees, ten percent of
		the gross, plus our expenses.
		This is not a negotiation, so if this is
		okay with you, we can talk further.  If
		not, we can forget we had this
		conversation.

 GEORGE 		Sounds fine.  I'll need to meet
		everybody.

 LEON 		They're over at the booth.

	Leon leads George over.

 LEON (CONT'D) 		Gentlemen, this is George.  George, this
		is Ben, G.G. and...

	George's eyes widen as he looks at the last man.  It's Kevin
	Dulli.

 GEORGE 		Holy shit, Dulli!

 KEVIN 		Georgie, oh man, hold the mayo!

 GEORGE (V.O.) 		That was it.  Seeing Dulli after
		fourteen years sealed the deal for me.
		The rest was just details.  My end was
		roughly five-hundred thousand.  Kristina
		and I could have a good life for five
		hundred grand.  Start over somewhere.
		One final score.  That's all I needed.

 INT. OLIVEROS MANSION - MIAMI - DAY 
 AUGUSTO 		Three-hundred kilos is a very big load,
		Georgie.  Why don't we start small?

 GEORGE 		No.  I have the space.  I figured it
		out.  This is what I want to do.

 AUGUSTO 		Alright.  I'll ask Pablo, tell him it's
		for you.  I don't think there will be a
		problem.

 GEORGE 		Five-thousand per kilo.

 AUGUSTO 		Ha ha.  That's too much, Georgie.  Those
		days are over.  The rate is one-thousand
		dollars.  Inflation, you know?

 GEORGE 		This is a one time thing, Gusto.  One
		and I'm out.  Give me a good price for
		old time's sake.  What do you think?

 EXT. RESIDENTIAL STREET - MIAMI - DAY 
	George and Kristina walk through the neighborhood.  He
	carries her books.

 GEORGE 		Let me ask you something.  If you could
		go anywhere in the world, anywhere,
		where would you want to go?

 KRISTINA 		You mean, like a trip?

 GEORGE 		Yeah, sure, whatever.

	Kristina thinks about it.

 KRISTINA 		I don't know.  Maybe California.

	George is amused by her answer.

 GEORGE 		California?  You can go anywhere in the
		world.  India.  Tibet.  Australia.
		Paris.  And you choose California?

 KRISTINA 		Yeah.

 GEORGE 		What is it?  A Disneyland thing?

 KRISTINA 		No.  I just kind of like the sound of
		it.

 GEORGE 		California, huh?

 KRISTINA 		California.

	They turn a corner and arrive at Kristina's house.  Mirtha is
	standing in the doorway.

 GEORGE 		Go on inside now.  I want to talk to
		your mom alone.

	He kisses his daughter goodbye.

 KRISTINA 		Bye, Dad.  See you in the morning, okay?

 GEORGE 		I'll be here.

	George moves over to Mirtha.  It's been a while.

 MIRTHA 		What do you want?

 GEORGE 		You knew I was seeing Kristina, right?

 MIRTHA 		Yeah.  She told me.  You walk her to
		school.

 GEORGE 		Yeah, so I've been thinking.  I love
		her, y'know?  I kind of want to have
		her.  I've been away for so long.  Make
		up for the missed time, you know?

 MIRTHA 		I haven't seen one dollar from you.  You
		haven't paid me one cent in child
		support, alimony.

 GEORGE 		Yeah, well.  I'm working on that.  I've
		got something going.

 MIRTHA 		Yeah?  I better see some money out of
		it.

 GEORGE 		Yeah, you will.  Of course.

	Mirtha looks at her ex-husband.  It's not all bad.

 MIRTHA 		Hey, look.  You start paying, who knows
		what will happen.  You're a good father,
		George.  I always gave you that.  But
		you've got to talk to her.

 GEORGE 		Yeah.

 MIRTHA 		She's getting big.  Getting her own
		ideas.

 GEORGE 		I know.  Well, that's all I really
		wanted to say.  So, okay, then.

	He moves down the steps and heads for the sidewalk.

 MIRTHA 		Hey, George.  You okay?

 GEORGE 		Yeah.  I'm fine.  I'm good.

 INT. THE PALM LOUNGE - DAY 
	The restaurant is filled with the team.  They discuss, argue,
	re-examine every little detail.

 KEVIN 		We take off from Lauderdale, Sunday,
		refuel, and be in Medellin by Monday.

 LEON 		Overnight, refuel, and back Wednesday
		night.

 GEORGE 		Where are you coming in?

 BEN 		Vero Beach.

 G.G. 		It's good.  It's small.

 LEON 		Then we drive it to the Lauderdale house
		where it stays until pick up and payment
		the next morning.  You want to go over
		it again?

 GEORGE 		No.  All set.  Piece of cake.

 INT. GEORGE'S STUDIO APARTMENT - MIAMI - NIGHT 
	George is cooking dinner for Kristina.  He's only got a hot
	plate so it's slow.  The table is set with plasticware.
	Kristina chops the salad.

 GEORGE 		I'm thinking about getting out of town
		this week.  You want to come with me?

 KRISTINA 		Where are you going?

 GEORGE 		I don't know.  Maybe California.

 KRISTINA 		You swear?

 GEORGE 		Yeah.  Go out there, check it out, see
		what it's like.  I've got some stuff to
		do this week, but I'm thinking maybe
		Thursday.  Thursday after school.

 KRISTINA 		You know I can't.  Mom will never let me
		go.

 GEORGE 		You let me take care of your mother.
		You just pack your bags.

 KRISTINA 		But I've got school.

 GEORGE 		There's schools in California.

 KRISTINA 		You swear?

 GEORGE 		That's right.  Three o'clock.  Thursday.
		At your mother's.  You and me.  It's a
		date.

 KRISTINA 		I don't believe you.

 GEORGE 		I swear.  On my life.

 KRISTINA 		Swear on my life.

 GEORGE 		I swear on your life.

 EXT. VERO BEACH AIRFIELD - DUSK 
	George, Ben and G.G. wait on the tarmac.  George is pacing.
	The sound of a Cessna is heard and soon it is dropping out of
	the sky.  The plane lands and taxis over.

	Kevin and Leon stick their fists out of the airplane in
	triumph.  The men quickly unload the plane into the trunks of
	two Broncos and the back of a truck.

 INT. FT. LAUDERDALE HOUSE - NIGHT 
	WE FOLLOW the duffel bags out of the Bronco into the house.
	The boys sit around as George samples the product.

 KEVIN 		Are we good?

 GEORGE 		Are we good?  Yeah, we're good.  We're
		beautiful.  We're perfect.  This is A
		grade, one-hundred percent pure
		Colombian cocaine, Ladies and Gentlemen.
		Disco shit.  Pure as the driven snow.
		Good riddance.

	He looks the boys over.

 GEORGE (CONT'D) 		You saved my life, Dulli.  You'll never
		fucking know.  All you guys.  Everyone
		just got a raise.  Instead of ten
		percent, you get fifteen.

 LEON 		Jesus, George, fifteen percent.  That's
		an extra two-hundred large.

 GEORGE 		I don't give a shit.  Split it up.  Have
		a great life.  I'm done.  I'm out.
		Starting over.  Cheers.

	They clank.  George gets up and does the Snoopy Dance to the
	bathroom.

 GEORGE (CONT'D) 		Yeah!  Unbelievable.  Dulli, pour us
		another round.  I gotta hit the head.

	George leaves the room.  The camera slowly pans back to the
	guys.  Something doesn't look right.  They have not moved.
	They look bummed.  Leon looks at G.G.

 LEON 		What?

 G.G. 		I feel bad.

 BEN 		Me too.  He's not such a bad guy.

 KEVIN 		Fuck you guys.  All of you.  I've known
		him for thirty fucking years.  Fucking
		George.

 LEON 		Yeah, I like him, too.  But what's done
		is done.  So let's not get all
		sentimental about it, okay?

	The CAMERA PANS BACK SLOWLY to the bathroom door, George
	comes back into the room, dancing.  He goes and sits down
	with the guys.

 GEORGE 		    (laughing)
		Dulli, I was just thinking about that
		time we landed in Mexico.  You've gotten
		a lot better since then, huh pal?
		Remember that fucking landing strip?
		Huh?

	George is the only one smiling.  No one is looking at him.

 GEORGE (CONT'D) 		Hey, what's wrong fellas?  Why the long
		faces?

	He looks at each one.  He slowly realizes something's up.  He
	looks to Dulli finally.

 GEORGE (CONT'D) 		    (defeated)
		No.  C'mon, Dulli.

	The front door busts down, agents pour in.  The CAMERA SWISH
	PANS to George.  Lights out.  Slow motion.  Slow dolly into
 XCU. 
 EXT. OTISVILLE F.C.I. - NEW YORK - 1999 - DAY 
	George has tears in his eyes.  He is frozen.  Paralyzed by
	the memories.

 GEORGE 		Oh, no.

 INT. FT. LAUDERDALE HOUSE - 1989 - DAY 
	The voices from the bust can be heard as the CAMERA PUSHES
	SLOWLY into George's face.  Surreal.

 GEORGE (V.O.) 		I was busted.  Set up by the FBI and the
		DEA.  That didn't bother me.  Set up by
		Kevin Dulli and Derek Foreal to save
		their own asses.  That didn't bother me.
		Sentenced to sixty years at Otisville.
		That didn't bother me.

 EXT. MIRTHA'S HOUSE - MIAMI - 1989 - DAY 
	Nine-year old Kristina Sunshine Jung sits on the front porch

 GEORGE (V.O.) 		I had broken a promise.  Everything I
		loved in my life goes away.

 INT. OTISVILLE F.C.I. - 1989 - DAY 
	George is led into a small room and greeted by his lawyer,
 ARCHIE ZIGMOND. 
 ZIGMOND 		Here's the deal, George.  You're not
		getting out.  I tried to get you
		furloughed, but your mother squashed it.
		Said it would only upset him.  I'm
		sorry.

	George takes it in.  Blinks.  The years have not been kind.

 GEORGE 		How's he doing?

 ZIGMOND 		Well, he's out of the hospital, but
		there's not much anyone can do for him.
		It's just a matter of time.  Listen, I
		brought a tape recorder in case you
		wanted to say something to him.  That
		way he could hear your voice.

 GEORGE 		Right.

	Zigmond sets the tape recorder down and leaves the room.
	George stares long at the machine.  He pushes the record
	button and looks at the red light.

 GEORGE (CONT'D) 		Hello, Dad...

 EXT. JUNG HOUSE - DAY 
	A sixty-nine year old Fred shuffles from his house to the
	blue LTD.  He gets in, turns the key, and puts his son's tape

		was about three-and-a-half feet tall,
		weighing all of sixty-pounds, every inch
		your son...

 EXT. JUNG HOUSE - 1953 - DAY 
	Six-year old George runs through the leaves to the truck and
	rides to work with his father.

 GEORGE (V.O.) 		...those Saturday mornings going to work

		the biggest truck in the world.

 INT. FRED'S LTD. - 1989 - CONTINUOUS 
 CLOSE ON FRED 
	visibly moved.

 GEORGE (V.O.) 		I remember how important the job we did

 GEORGE (V.O.) (CONT'D) 		Remember those home movies when Mom

 INT. JUNG HOUSE - GEORGE'S BEDROOM - 1973 - NIGHT 
	James J. Trout pulls a handcuffed George's boots over his
	socks as Fred and Ermine watch.

 GEORGE (V.O.) 		And that FBI agent, Trout?  When he had
		to get on his knees to put my boots on?
		You said...

 FRED 		That's where you belong...

 INT. FRED'S LTD. - 1989 - CONTINUOUS 
	A choked up Fred repeats the words.

 FRED 		...you sonofabitch.  Putting on George's

 GEORGE (V.O.) 		That was a good one, Dad.  That was
		really something.  Remember that?

 INT. OTISVILLE F.C.I. - NEW YORK - 1989 - DAY 
	George's eyes well up and he sparks a cigarette, as he keeps
	trying to tell his father goodbye.

 GEORGE (V.O.) 		And that time you told me that money
		wasn't real?  Well, old man, I'm forty
		two years old.  I finally learned what
		you tried to tell me so many years ago.

 INT. FRED'S LTD. - 1989 - CONTINUOUS 
	Tears come crashing out of the old man's stoic face.

 GEORGE (V.O.) 		I finally understand.  You're the best,
		Dad.  I just wish I could have done more
		for you.  I wish we had more time.

 EXT. OTISVILLE F.C.I. - NEW YORK - 1999 - DAY 
	A vision of Fred Jung sits on the ground before his fifty-two
	year old son.

 GEORGE 		I guess I kind of lost sight of things.
		"May the wind always be at your back and
		the sun always upon your face, and the
		winds of destiny carry you aloft to
		dance with the stars."  Love, George.

 FRED 		That was a beautiful message.

 GEORGE 		I meant every word of it.

 FRED 		Did you know I died two weeks after you
		sent me that tape?

	The apparition of Fred disappears and George is left alone
	once again.

 GEORGE 		Yeah, Dad.  I knew that.

 INT. OTISVILLE F.C.I. - NEW YORK - 1990 - DAY 
	George is led into the room where THREE FBI MEN await him.
	One of them is named FRED GARCIA.

 GARCIA 		How are you doing, George?

 GEORGE 		What do you guys want?

 GARCIA 		You hear about your old friend, Diego?

 GEORGE 		What about him?

	Garcia tosses a newspaper onto the table.  The Miami Herald.
	Inside is a full page letter addressed from Diego Delgado to
	Vice President George Bush.  In the letter, Diego offers to
	make a deal.  In exchange for immunity, Diego will rat out
	the entire cocaine business.  Americans, Colombians, Noriega,
	Escobar, everybody.  Just let him free.

 GEORGE (CONT'D) 		What the fuck?  Is he going to walk?

 GARCIA 		He's going down, George.  It's election
		year.  We're not making any deals.

 FBI GUY #1 		He's never getting out.  Orders from the
		top.

 GARCIA 		So, how would you like to help us put
		him away?

 FBI GUY #2 		We've done our homework.  We know you
		hate this motherfucker.

 GEORGE 		I don't think so.

 GARCIA 		Don't be stupid, George.  We've got him.
		We've got him dead to rights.  But like
		I said, this is top priority so we're
		handing out free passes on this one.
		And the first one's got your name on it.
		Cut your sentence in half, maybe more.

 GEORGE 		No thanks, fellas.  You've got the wrong
		fucking guy.  I'm not a rat.

 INT. OTISVILLE F.C.I. - VISITOR'S ROOM - 1990 - DAY 
	George sits in the chair behind the plexiglass.  Mirtha
	enters and takes a seat on the other side.

 GEORGE 		Mirtha, what's going on?  Everything
		okay with Kristina?

 MIRTHA 		Kristina's fine.

 GEORGE 		Is she here?  Is she coming?

 MIRTHA 		Is she here?  George, Kristina hates
		you.  You fucked her over one too many
		times.  And I'm not here to socialize.
		Did you hear about Diego?

 GEORGE 		Yeah.

 MIRTHA 		Well, I got a call from Pablo.  He said
		this thing with Diego is a disaster.
		He's giving up lab locations, names,
		bank accounts, he was very pissed off.
		Pablo said to take him down.  His exact
		words were "Fuck Diego."

 GEORGE 		He wants me to testify?  Is that what
		he's asking me to do?

 MIRTHA 		George, he wasn't asking.

	Mirtha gets up and starts to move away.

 GEORGE 		Mirtha, how are you doing?

 MIRTHA 		Better than you.

 INT. COURTHOUSE HALLWAY - JACKSONVILLE - 1990 - DAY 
	George, Archie Zigmond and two armed guards walk down the
	corridor.

 GEORGE 		Hey, Arch, you think the judge will let
		us get a cocktail after this is all
		over?

 ZIGMOND 		I'll see what I can do, George.

 GEORGE 		Thanks, Arch.

	They walk into the crowded courtroom.

 INT. COURTHOUSE HALLWAY - JACKSONVILLE - 1990 - DAY 
	Packed.  Nuts.  Standing room only.  The courtroom buzzes as
	George is led down the center aisle and is handed off to the
	bailiff.  Over this we hear...

 CLERK 		Sir, please state your name.

 GEORGE 		I'm George Jung.  Spelled J-U-N-G.

 CLERK 		Thank you.

 PROSECUTOR 		Mr. Jung, do you know Diego Delgado?

 GEORGE 		Yes, I do.

 PROSECUTOR 		Do you see him here in the courtroom?

 GEORGE 		Yes, he's sitting right there at the end
		of the table.

 PROSECUTOR 		Let the record state the witness has
		identified, Diego Delgado.

	The following sound bytes are dissolved together in montage
	style...

 PROSECUTOR (CONT'D) 		Mr. Jung, can you describe the
		circumstances of how you began talking
		about cocaine with Mr. Delgado?

 GEORGE 		Shortly after I arrived at Danbury
		Federal Correctional Institute I related
		to Diego that the crime I was in for was
		smuggling marijuana.
		Diego told me he had high level
		connections in Colombia and they needed
		to find someone to help them transport
		cocaine into America...

 GEORGE (CONT'D) 		The first run was fifteen kilos, which
		we smuggled into Logan Airport in hard
		shelled suitcases.

 GEORGE (CONT'D) 		We wrapped the cocaine in kitchen
		cabinet paper, and duct tape, that way
		if there were any dogs in customs...

 GEORGE (CONT'D) 		I introduced Diego to a pilot named Jack
		Stevens, who helped us fly 300 kilos of
		cocaine per week into the United States
		via twin-engine Cessnas.  Jack would fly
		into North Carolina, we'd meet him there
		and drive it down to different
		distribution points...

 GEORGE (CONT'D) 		I never met Pablo Escobar.  Diego
		Delgado was my only connection to
		cocaine from Colombia...

 GEORGE (CONT'D) 		Diego convinced me to keep most of my
		money in a Panamanian bank.  Diego had a
		close relationship with Manuel Noriega.
		In exchange for allowing us to keep our
		money there, we paid him a percentage.

 GEORGE (CONT'D) 		There was an 85% chance that if you
		snorted cocaine between 1977-1984, it
		was ours. Initially with my LA
		connections, we invented the
		marketplace.  In 1977, there was no
		other real competition.

 GEORGE (CONT'D) 		The first year we made about 100 million
		dollars between us.  It was an expensive
		operation.  Eventually we built up to
		three different pilots doing multiple
		runs per week, connections on both
		coasts, everything was running smooth.
		We were like a corporation...

 GEORGE (CONT'D) 		he was very anti-government.  He talked
		about revolution, forming his own
		country or island, he was looking for
		power as well as money.  I was just
		looking for money.

 GEORGE (CONT'D) 		He disliked the United States, thought
		it was a police state.  He hoped that by
		flooding the country with cocaine, it
		would disrupt the political system and
		tear down the morality of the country.

 GEORGE (CONT'D) 		Well, yes, Derek Foreal was my
		connection, I met him back in 1968 when
		I first moved to Manhattan Beach.  It
		was Foreal's marijuana connections that
		kicked off our cocaine market.

 GEORGE (CONT'D) 		Yes, it was my idea to bring the kilos
		to Los Angeles.  When Diego finally got
		Derek Foreal's name from me, it was only
		a matter of months before he'd cut me
		out.

 GEORGE (CONT'D) 		I'm not sure how my relationship with my
		daughter and ex-wife have anything to do
		with this trial.  I mean we're here to
		talk about Diego Delgado, aren't we?

 CALIBANOS 		Yes, we are Mr. Jung.

	We come out of the montage, the defense attorney Diego
	Delgado, Joe Calibanos, a sleazy-Greek-like-ex-basketball
	weight lifter guy is now doing the questioning.

 CALIBANOS (CONT'D) 		Mr. Jung, you're a convicted felon,
		correct?

 GEORGE 		Yes, I am.

 CALIBANOS 		Do you have any agreement or
		understanding whatsoever with the United
		States government in regards to your
		testimony?

 GEORGE 		No, I cam here out of my own volition.

 CALIBANOS 		Excuse me?

 GEORGE 		Something about vengance being best
		served cold.

 CALIBANOS 		Really.  Are you getting paid, Mr. Jung?

 GEORGE 		Excuse me?

 CALIBANOS 		Mr. Jung, don't you have an agreement or
		understanding with the United States
		Government in connection with your
		testimony in this case?

 GEORGE 		I'm doing sixty years at Otisville, no
		chance of parole.  Even if they cut my
		sentence in half I'll be seventy-three
		years old.  That's some fucking deal.  I
		don't know if the parole board, the
		judge, the pope or Jesus Christ himself
		can get me out of here.  I have a really
		bad record, I'm not sure what's going to
		happen.

 CALIBANOS 		So you do have an agreement with the
		United States Government, Mr. Jung,
		correct?

	George can't respond.  Looks to Diego.  Looks from the jury,
	the judge, George is on the spotlight and it's uncomfortable.
	He feels suddenly sleazy.

 CALIBANOS (CONT'D) 		I thought so.  No more questions.

	Silence.  The judge tells George he can step down.  Calibanos
	laughs quietly with associates.  George is bummed.  He walks
	by Diego.  They look at each other.

 GEORGE 		You shouldn't have taken the 30 million,
		Diego, I was out.

	George is lead away.

 CLERK 		The court calls Mr. Jack Stevens.

	Jack Stevens is lead to the stand.  WE SLOWLY DISSOLVE TO:

 INT. CAR - 1999 - DAY 
	The green of the New York State countryside drifts by as a
	brown Mazda moves along Highway 19.  Behind the wheel is a
	beautiful 20 year old woman wearing dark sunglasses.  She
	drives absently, her mind somewhere else.

 INT. OTISVILLE F.C.I. - VISITOR'S ENTRANCE - 1999 - DAY 
	The woman is buzzed through the double doors.  She moves to
	the MAN behind the desk and takes off her sunglasses.

 KRISTINA 		I'm here to see my father.

 ADMISSIONS OFFICER 		Name?

 KRISTINA 		Kristina Sunshine Jung.

 EXT. OTISVILLE F.C.I. - LATE AFTERNOON 
	The GUARDS are rounding up the other prisoners and escorting
	them inside, but George is still planting sunflowers.

 GUARD 		Hey, George, five more minutes, buddy.

 INT. VISITOR'S ENTRANCE - CONTINUOUS 
	The admissions officer looks up from his paperwork.

 ADMISSIONS OFFICER 		Jung.

	Kristina grabs her papers and moves to the counter.

 ADMISSIONS OFFICER (CONT'D) 		Belongings in here.

	Kristina empties her pockets and deposits her possessions
	into a locker box.  She is handed a key.

 ADMISSIONS OFFICER (CONT'D) 		Feet on the blue line.

	Kristina stands on a blue piece of tape and the admissions
	officer buzzes open the giant metal door.  But Kristina
	doesn't move.

 ADMISSIONS OFFICER (CONT'D) 		Miss?

	He presses the buzzer again, but she just stands there.

 ADMISSIONS OFFICER (CONT'D) 		Miss?  Something wrong?

 EXT. OTISVILLE F.C.I. - CONTINUOUS 
	George turns around as a GUARD taps him on the shoulder.

 GUARD 		George?  George, come on.  You've got a
		visitor.

	George looks up to find Kristina being buzzed through the
	gate.  She moves through the open area and onto the grass
	quickly.  SLOW MOTION: Father and daughter come together at
	last in a long embrace.

 GEORGE 		I'm sorry, baby.  I'm so sorry.

 KRISTINA 		It's alright, Dad.

 GEORGE 		I didn't mean to...

 KRISTINA 		I know, Dad.  I know...

	He hugs her hard.

 GEORGE 		I fucked up.

 KRISTINA 		Shhhh.

 GEORGE 		I love you.  I love you so much.  You've
		got to know that.  You've got to know.

 KRISTINA 		I know, Dad.  I love you too.

 GEORGE 		After everything.  After everything, the
		only thing left out of my whole life is
		you.

	Kristina looks at her father, smiles, and disappears.  There
	was no Kristina.  The guard continues to tap.

 GUARD 		George?  George, come on.  It's getting
		dark.

	George looks up to find a prison guard.  His name is GUS, and
	he helps George to his feet.

 GEORGE 		But I have a visitor.

 GUS 		Not today, George.  Time to go back.

 GEORGE 		But I want to put her name on the list
		for tomorrow.  My daughter.

 GUS 		Okay, George.

 GEORGE 		Because she's visiting me.

 GUS 		We'll do that tomorrow, okay?  It's
		lockdown time.

	The shadows grow long, and Gus leads George down a cement
	path that cuts through the grass.  The huge structure of
	Otisville looms dark against the sky, and Gus and George take
	the long walk back.

 EXT. OTISVILLE F.C.I. - NEW YORK - DUSK 
	Standing outside the fences, Kristina smokes a cigarette as
	she watches her father being led away.  After a few moments,
	she turns around, walks to her car and gets in.  Time to go
	home.  And as the brown Mazda pulls out of the driveway, the
	taillights turn red, growing smaller and smaller, until they
	finally disappear.

CLOSE - MR. BEAUMONT

watches his watering, then looks up.

The sky and the neighborhood are reflected in his dark glasses.  He 
moves his false teeth around a little in his mouth, jutting out his chin 
in the process.  He's thinking about who knows what.

He looks back down at his lawn.

CLOSEUP - WATER ON GRASS

The water hits the grass and mats it down.

WIDER - MR. BEAUMONT

moves the hose over a bush and gets a kink in it.

Water stops coming out of the nozzle and there is a LOUD HISSING NOISE

Mr. Beaumont goes around the bush and is undoing the kink when he is 
suddenly hit with a tremendous seizure.

Water is still spraying out over the driveway and onto the car and into 
the yard beyond.

A small boy, GREGG, appears wearing only white underpants and a white 
t-shirt.  He holds a large red popsicle.

Gregg waddles around looking at the crazy water show.  He holds his hand 
out to get it wet in the spray.  This makes him screw up his face in a 
laugh.

He waddles over and looks at Mr. Beaumont on the ground.

Mr. Beaumont seems to be worse now, unconscious, but still gripping the 
hose tightly. His clothes are sopping wet.

11. EXT. GREGG'S HOUSE - DAY

Screen window of Gregg's house. Gregg's mother calls out but remains

15. INT. JANITOR'S QUARTERS - COLLEGE - NIGHT

We MOVE INTO the face of JEFFREY. He is hiding behind a furnace.  He is

He sees a male student trying to rape his girlfriend.  She is crying and 
telling him to stop but the boy keeps forcing her down toward the ground. 
forcing her clothes off her.  Jeffrey at this point hears his name being 
called.  Each time he hears his name the caller is closer.  The boy is now
hurting the girl.  Before Jeffrey leaves the furnace room he yells out:

					 JEFFREY
			Hey, shit head. Leave her alone. Don't 
			force girls!

The couple looks up but cannot see Jeffrey.  The boy is scared and releases
the girl who promptly pulls farther away, crying.

Jeffrey leaves the furnace room.

Jeffrey comes walking out of the airport, where his Mother and AUNT 
BARBARA, who is a very absent-minded little woman with very thick glasses, 
are waiting for him.  

They are parked illegally and another car is honking at them.  Their 
trunk is open in anticipation of Jeffrey's things.  They are waving and 
yelling at Jeffrey to get his attention.  He finally joins them and kisses 
his Mother, then his Aunt.

Jeffrey comes down the stairs.  Everyone says their "good mornings," and 
Jeffrey sits down to breakfast.

					 JEFFREY
			What time are visiting hours?

				    MRS. BEAUMONT
			I've made arrangements with Dr. Gynde for

			Well. Okay.

				    MRS. BEAUMONT
			Jeffrey, when you see your father.

					 JEFFREY
			Yeah?

				    MRS. BEAUMONT
			He doesn't know you're out of school. He

					 JEFFREY
			What?

				    MRS. BEAUMONT
			It would be too much for him. So please

			.Jeffrey!. Nobody wanted you to leave

going back to school will be an option one

She peers into the room.  Jeffrey does too.

34. INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY

All he can see are curtains surrounding a bed and stacks of medical 
machinery.  Doctor Gynde comes out from behind the curtains and walks to 
Jeffrey.

					DR. GYNDE
			Hello Jeffrey.

					 JEFFREY
			Hello, Doctor Gynde. How is he?

					DR. GYNDE
			He's fighting hard. Jeffrey. it's very
			important that your father doesn't try
			to move. he's been immobilized. It would
			be very painful for him. sit close. you do
			the talking and moving. He knows you're 
			here. He became very emotional. I don't 
			think he likes the idea of you seeing him
			like this.

Nurse Cindy goes to the bed.  She begins to pull the curtains back 
revealing Mr. Beaumont.

				    NURSE CINDY
				(smiling a big smile)
			Mr. Beaumont! Your son is here to visit you.

Then we see Mr. Beaumont.  He has numerous tubes and needles going into 
different parts of him.  A stainless steel device holds his head perfectly
still.  Nurse Cindy picks up a tray and leaves.

					 JEFFREY
			    (shocked but concealing it)
			Hi Dad.

				     MR. BEAUMONT
			 (speaking as plainly as possible,
  but sounds like mumbling)
			Hey Jeff.

Jeffrey goes to him and puts out his hand to shake his father's hand but 
remembers his father cannot move.  Jeffrey pats him on the shoulder.

					 JEFFREY
			Looks like they've got you strapped in
			pretty good.

				     MR. BEAUMONT
			 (lips moving but hardly any sound)
			uh uh.

					 JEFFREY
			Are you feeling okay?

				     MR. BEAUMONT
				    (more mumbling)
			uh uh.

Tears well up in Mr. Beaumont's eyes.  Before Jeffrey can stop him he 
reaches for Jeffrey's hand, then struggling against tremendous pain he 
manages to form words.

				     MR. BEAUMONT
			 (more plainly but under strain)
			Good to see you, son.

					 JEFFREY
				 (holding back tears)
			It's good to see you, Dad.

Jeffrey squeezes his father's hand.

35. EXT. VACANT FIELD - DAY

Jeffrey is walking down a dirt road on his way home.  He kicks up little 
clouds of dust as he walks.  He has some time to think about things. He 
sees a green bottle in the distance. He gathers up a few more rocks and 
pitches them one by one at the bottle.  He misses.

He looks for a few more good rocks to throw and while looking through some
tall grass and weeds, he sees something strange.

He looks closer.  It is a HUMAN EAR, covered with crawling ants.

Jeffrey immediately stands up and looks around.  All he sees are houses 
- some laundry drying - a very peaceful scene.  No one seems to be around -
No one seems to be watching him.

He looks again at the ear.

We are so close we can hear ants racing frantically around the ear into it.
There is dried blood on part of it.

Jeffrey finds a brown paper bad and using a twig, he pushes the ear onto 
it.  Again, he stands up and looks around.

IN THE DISTANCE, a MAN goes into the back door of a house.  Nothing more.

Jeffery hurries off, carrying the bag with the ear in it.

of the room; one of them comes toward Jeffrey.

					JEFFREY
			Are you Detective Williams?

					DETECTIVE WILLIAMS
			Yes.

					JEFFREY
			My name is Jeffrey Beaumont - I live near
			you. I believe you know my father, Tom
			Beaumont - Beaumont's Hardware Store?

					DETECTIVE WILLIAMS
			Sure I do. I understand he's in the
			hospital. How is he?

					JEFFREY
			He's alright, I guess. I hope. They're
			doing tests, that's why I'm home from 
			school. I was over at the hospital this
			morning and I was going home and in the
			field behind our neighborhood. there
			behind Vista, I found an ear.

				DETECTIVE WILLIAMS
				(matter of factly)
			You did? A human ear?

					JEFFREY
			Yeah. I've got it here in this bag. I
			thought I should bring it to you.

					DETECTIVE WILLIAMS
			Yep, that's right. Let's take a look at it.

Jeffrey opens the bag and lets Detective Williams look inside.

					DETECTIVE WILLIAMS
					  (continuing)
			That sure looks like a human ear, doesn't
			it?. Let's run it down to the Coroner's
			Office and see what they make of it. Then,
			I want you to show me exactly where you
			found it.

39. INT. CORONER'S OFFICE - DAY

Jeffrey, Detective Williams, and an OLD CORONER'S OFFICER are looking at 
the ear, which is sitting in a medical dish on a table.

					CORONER'S OFFICER
			The tests will take awhile. Meanwhile,
			we'll check the morgue records. I don't
			recall anything coming in minus an ear.

The Coroner's Officer turns to Jeffrey.

					CORONER'S OFFICER
					   (continuing)
			Now if you'd found a jaw or let's say, a
			heart, or even an arm, we would assume
			that there was a corpse, however, a finger
			or an ear. the person may very well be 
			alive somewhere.

					JEFFREY
			What can you tell about the person from the
			ear?

					CORONER'S OFFICER
			Well. when the tests are done, quite a lot
			. Sex, blood type, whether or not the ear
			came off a dead person. Right now, I know
			what you know. It's a real human ear. The
			human was, or is, Caucasian.
			. also. It looks like the ear was cut off
			with scissors.

40. EXT. VACANT FIELD - DAY

Jeffrey is out with Detective Williams and a CREW OF OFFICERS who have 
roped off the area and are doing a grid search.

A POLICE PHOTOGRAPHER is also there taking flash pictures all around the 
field, especially where Jeffrey has told them he found the ear.

Detective Williams takes Jeffrey aside.

					DETECTIVE WILLIAMS
			By the way, Jeffrey, this story isn't going
			to the press and I'm going to ask you to 
			consider all you've heard strictly 
			confidential. Do not discuss this business
			with anyone, but me, or other police
			personnel. Got it?

			Got it. Thanks for letting me in on as much

					SANDY
			That's too bad.

					JEFFREY
			What do you know about the ear?. anything?

					SANDY
			Didn't my father tell you not to talk about
			it?
				  (she smiles)

					JEFFREY
			Come on. you brought it up. Do you know 
			anything?

					SANDY
			I don't really know much but bits and pieces
			. I hear things. My room is right above my
			father's office. The ear. there's no corpse
			in the morgue missing an ear, and it did come
			off a living person. That's direct from the
			Coroner's Office. The person is unknown. 
			There are a couple of cases I get mixed up on, 
			but I think there are some people who were 
			brought in for questioning on a murder case 
			that could have something to do with the ear. 
			I heard some of the same names.

					JEFFREY
			Do you know who was brought in for 
			questioning?

					SANDY
			There were at least three, maybe four. But
			a name that keeps coming up is this woman
			who lives in an apartment building very
			close to your house and also close to the 	
			field where you found the ear. There's 
			also a business man over by the Franklin
			factory district that was questioned. and
			a musician. and some others.

					JEFFREY
			Were all these people questioned this
			afternoon?

					SANDY
			No. this has been going on for some time
			. several months. About six months ago
			some parts of bodies were found down by
			the river. They were from people who were
			reported missing. They never found one
			complete body. only parts.

					JEFFREY
			The ear is from a missing person maybe?

					SANDY
			Maybe so.

					JEFFREY
			It's a strange world isn't it? Do you know
			what building the woman lives in?

					SANDY
			Yeah. It's close by. that's what's creepy.
			They've had her under surveillance for a 
			couple of months, except I don't know what
			they've found out because my father isn't
			in charge of her.

					JEFFREY
			I guess you have to get back home soon?

					SANDY
			Not really, why?
				(then she understands)
			You want to see the building?. Come on,
			I'll show you.

				(Jeffrey points to a house)
			I used to know a kid who lived there and who
			had the biggest tongue in the world.

Jeffrey and Sandy both laugh.

					SANDY
			What happened to him?

					JEFFREY
			I don't know. he moved away.
 
									CUT TO:

56. EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD STREET - NIGHT

A LONG SHOT

Jeffrey and Sandy walking and talking, sometimes laughing in the distance,
while the MUSIC theme, haunting yet warm, plays over.

57. EXT. WILLIAMS HOME - NIGHT

They arrive back at Sandy's home.

CLOSER ON JEFFREY AND SANDY

in front of Sandy's home.

					SANDY
			I've gotta go in.

					JEFFREY
			Thanks for the tour. It was nice talking
			to you.

Sandy just looks at him shyly before she turns to go up the front walk.

					JEFFREY
				    (continuing)
			I guess I'll see you sometime.



					SANDY
			I guess so. Like you said. It's a 
			strange world.

					JEFFREY
				      (smiles)
			Yeah. Good bye.

Jeffrey watches as Sandy goes inside her house.  He watches her house for 
a moment and sees her cross the living room.  He turns and walks away.  

Again, the MYSTERIOUS CHORDS OF MUSIC swell up as Jeffrey walks through 
the night.

									CUT TO:

58. INT. BEAUMONT'S HARDWARE STORE - DAY

Jeffrey is poking around in the back room.  He picks up some bug spraying 
devices.  He yells out to an old black man who works in the store.

					JEFFREY
			Hey, Ed, okay if I borrow these bug spraying
			rigs later on?

Ed peers into the back room.  Spots Jeffrey.

					ED
			Listen Bud. If you need to spray for bugs
			they're yours.  It causes me no pain.

					JEFFREY
			Okidoke Ed. Thanks.

									CUT TO:

59. EXT. BEAUMONT'S HARDWARE STORE - DAY

Jeffrey puts the stuff in the trunk of the car.  There are several "Awake" 
magazines there too.  He gets in the front seat and drives off.

									CUT TO:

60. INT. BEAUMONTS' CAR - DAY

Jeffrey driving.  He looks at his watch.  It is 3:30.

61. EXT. CENTRAL HIGH SCHOOL - DAY

Jeffrey is parked across the street from the school.  High school kids 
are pouring out the front door.  In a moment he sees Sandy come out with 
two or three other girls.  They walk down the sidewalk away from Jeffrey.

He starts the car and slowly follows them to the corner, where he pulls 
up alongside of them. very close. Sandy suddenly recognizes him.

					JEFFREY
			You hungry or thirsty, or both?

					SANDY
				   (taken back)
			I don't know.

					JEFFREY
			I'd like to talk to you about something.

					SANDY
			Just a minute. pull over and wait a 
			minute.

Sandy pulls her girlfriends away from Jeffrey's car and says something to 
them.  There is some whispering and giggling and then,

					SANDY
				  (to the girls)
			Please, don't say anything to Mike.
			promise?

The girls promise.  Sandy goes around and gets in the car.

					JEFFREY
			I don't want to cause any trouble.

					SANDY
			I'm here, aren't I?

					JEFFREY
			    (smiling as though he knew)
			I guess Mike's got some sort of sports
			practice in the afternoon.

					SANDY
			Ooooo, you are smart. Just don't get too
			smart.

									CUT TO:

62. INT. DINER - DAY

Jeffrey and Sandy are sitting in a booth.  Jeffrey's grilled cheese on 
white bread and a coke have just arrived along with Sandy's coke.

					SANDY
			Alright, now tell me. What is it?

					JEFFREY
			There are opportunities in life for gaining
			knowledge and experience. sometimes, in
			some cases. it's necessary to take a risk.
			I got to thinking. I'll bet a person could
			learn a lot by getting into that woman's 
			apartment. you know. sneak in and hide
			and observe.

					SANDY
			You said it was a strange world. 
			and you're the strangest part of it. Are 
			you crazy.she is possibly involved in 
			murder. This gives me the creeps.

					JEFFREY
			Settle down. I have a plan which I think
			will work. There is very little for you
			to do, but I do need your help.
			.Aren't you curious about my plan?

					SANDY
			  (thinking and intrigued, plus she 
  			   is beginning to like Jeffrey)
			It wouldn't hurt to hear the plan, I guess.

					JEFFREY
				  (getting excited)
			Alright. the first thing is to get into her
			apartment and open a window that I could 
			crawl into later.

					SANDY
			Now, how are you going to do that?

					JEFFREY
			Right out in the car I happen to have some
			old overalls and a bug spraying rig. I will
			go to her apartment and be the pest control
			man. I will spray her apartment. After a 
			few minutes you will knock on her door, 
			drawing her attention away from me and I 
			will then jimmy a window.

					SANDY
			What will I say when she comes to the door?

					JEFFREY
			You will be a Jehovah's Witness. I have a 
			few "Awake" magazines for you. You don't 
			have to keep her very long. a few seconds 
			is all I'll need. Whatiya think?

					SANDY
			I don't know. it sounds like a good 
			daydream, . but actually doing it is too
			weird. too dangerous.

					JEFFREY
			Let's just try the first part. If that
			goes well, we'll see about the rest. No one
			will suspect us, because no one would 
			believe two people like us would be crazy
			enough to do something like this.

					SANDY
			You've got a point there.

									CUT TO:

63. INT. BEAUMONTS' CAR/LINCOLN STREET-DAY

Jeffrey and Sandy are in the car.  Jeffrey is struggling to put on the old overalls.

					JEFFREY
			Now. we'll walk over so there's no license
			plates and you give me at least three 
			minutes. I can stall if it's more, but I
			need time to find a good window .alright?

					SANDY
			Alright.

					JEFFREY
			Let's go.

64. EXT. LINCOLN STREET - DAY

They get out of the car. Sandy has the "Awake" magazines.

					JEFFREY
			Okay, I'm going ahead. Wait a minute,
			what's her name?

					SANDY
			Oh bother. Dorothy Vallens, Seventh
			Floor.  Look on the mailbox for her number,
			bright boy.

					JEFFREY
			Thanks. Dorothy Vallens. Okay. good
			luck . three minutes, no sooner.

					SANDY
			Alright. Good luck, yourself.

Jeffrey takes off in the direction of the apartment building.

									CUT TO:

65. EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY

Jeffrey walks up the front steps and goes in the double outer doors.

66. INT. LOBBY - APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY

He looks up and down the mailboxes and finally finds "D. Vallens, 
Apartment Number 710."

Jeffrey goes into the lobby.

									CUT TO:

67. INT. STAIRWAY - APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY

Jeffrey climbs the stairs.  An OLD LADY is making her way down the stairs.
She sees Jeffrey and his rig.

					OLD LADY
			Well, it's about time you came.

Jeffrey forces a smile at her and after she's gone.

					JEFFREY
				    (to himself)
			That's a good sign.

He keeps climbing.  He arrives at the Seventh Floor. and finds Number 710. 
He knocks and waits.  He looks around. the hallway is empty.

DOROTHY VALLENS opens the door.  She is a very beautiful woman in her 
late thirties.  She has a beautiful full figure, dark eyes, black thick 
wavy hair.  Full red lips.  Right now, however, she looks a bit tired and 
a bit frumpy in an old terrycloth robe.

					DOROTHY
			Yes? What is it?

					JEFFREY
			Pest control. gotta do your apartment.

					DOROTHY
			Oh God, that stuff stinks.

					JEFFREY
				 (as he goes in)
			Nope. it's new stuff. no smell.

					DOROTHY
			Oh yeah, that's good.

68. INT. DOROTHY'S APARTMENT - DAY

Jeffrey goes all around the baseboards, spraying.  All the while he's 
getting a good look around the apartment.

There is a window above the kitchen sink out to the fire escape.  Jeffrey 
looks around to see what Dorothy is doing and she is watching him spraying.
The apartment is smaller than he thought, so he sprays the kitchen very 
slowly and makes believe the sprayer is jammed.

Suddenly, there is knocking at the door.

					DOROTHY
			What is this. Grand Central Station?

She opens the door.  Jeffrey looks. It's not Sandy. A MAN, with a yellow 
sports coat, is standing there.  Jeffrey begins to sweat, because the MAN 
looked around Dorothy to see him.  Dorothy says something to the Man which 
Jeffrey cannot hear.

The next time Jeffrey looks up, the Man is gone.  The whole thing looks 
to be turning out badly when Jeffrey spots a key on the counter.  On a 
long shot, he steals it just as the front door shuts. He wraps things up 
and gets out.

					JEFFREY
				    (to Dorothy)
			That oughta do it.

					DOROTHY
			Yeah.


69. 	INT. STAIRWAY - APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY

Jeffrey leaves.  Out on the stairs, he finds Sandy with her "Awake" 
magazines.

					SANDY
			Are you alright?

					JEFFREY
			Yeah. let's get outta here. What
			happened?

As they go downstairs,

					SANDY
			I was just about to go to the door, when
			that man did my job for me. Was it alright?

					JEFFREY
			Yes and no. Did you recognize him?

					SANDY
			No. I only saw his back. He went down 
			another stairwell at the end of the hall.

					JEFFREY
			I didn't get a good look at him either, but
			he sure looked at me. I didn't have time to 
			get a window, but I found this key.
				 (he shows it to her)
			Pretty nifty, huh?

					SANDY
			Yeah, if it opens the door.

					JEFFREY
			Yeah.

70. 	INT. LOBBY - APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY

They get to the door of the apartment building.

					JEFFREY
			You go first.

71. EXT. LINCOLN STREET - DAY

They leave the building separately.  When Jeffrey gets to the car, 
Sandy isn't there.  He looks around.  He starts the car and drives off.

There, up ahead, he spots her.  He pulls over and she gets in.

					SANDY
			So. what's next?

					JEFFREY
			Pretty clever. Are you game for more?

					SANDY
			I owe you. since I goofed up this one.

					JEFFREY
			You didn't goof it up, but. you still
			owe me one. I want to sneak in tonight. 
			It's Friday. do you have a date tonight?

					SANDY
			Yes. I do.

					JEFFREY
			Well, it's Friday night and you're a 
			beautiful girl. I guess you would have
			a date. that does that.

72. INT. BEAUMONTS' CAR/WILLIAMS HOME - DAY

Jeffrey is driving Sandy home.

					SANDY
			You really want to do this, don't you?

					JEFFREY
			I don't want you to get involved, really,
			I mean, I do, but if something went wrong
			I mean, like you said, they may be involved
			in murder.

They pull up in front of Sandy's house.

					SANDY
			   (making up her mind - against
    			    her better judgment)
			I'll tell Mike I'm sick. There's a game
			tonight anyway and he'll never miss me.
			Afterwards he can go out with the guys.
			Just so the record is kept straight though,
			I love Mike. What do want me to do?

					JEFFREY
			    (studies her a moment, then)
			First of all, we'll have a nice dinner.
			Try to find out where Dorothy sings.

					SANDY
			I already know. The "Slow Club." It's on
			Route 7.

					JEFFREY
			Great. I'll pick you up around eight
			o'clock. Is that good?

					SANDY
			Yeah, but don't pick me up. my father may
			think it's strange. I'll walk over to your
			house. I'll be there at eight o'clock.

					JEFFREY
			Okay. You better get out before someone
			sees us.

Sandy gets out of the car and without turning around walks into her 
house.  Jeffrey calls out after her.

					JEFFREY
			See ya!

INSERT T.V. SCREEN

The television is on.  Some crime show is playing, but the SOUND is 
very low.

The FAMILY DOCTOR is over and is giving Mrs. Beaumont an injection of 
medicine.  Aunt Barbara is sitting nearby.

					DR. GYNDE
			That will take care of you, Frances, for
			another week. I don't want you to overdo
			things either. Take it very easy.

					AUNT BARBARA
			I'll see to it, Bill.

					DR. GYNDE
			Good.

					MRS. BEAUMONT
			I feel fine.

					DR. GYNDE
			That's not the point. You're under a great
			deal of stress. don't overdo it. don't
			be foolish.

Jeffrey enters the room - to say goodnight.

					JEFFREY
			Doctor Gynde. my whole family's sick.
			What's going on?

					AUNT BARBARA
			I'm not sick.

Jeffrey points to his head and makes a circular "crazy" gesture.  They 
all laugh, except Aunt Barbara.

					AUNT BARBARA
					(continuing)
			We'll see who stays in my will.

They laugh again.

					JEFFREY
				  (to his mother)
			Can I use the car tonight?

					MRS. BEAUMONT
			Of course, Jeffrey.

They say their goodnights.

74. INT. BEAUMONTS' CAR - NIGHT

Jeffrey and Sandy are looking at each other.  Jeffrey turns back to 
driving.

Sandy watches Jeffrey drive then she turns and watches the stores and 
shops go by.

When she is turned away, Jeffrey turns and look at her.  Sandy is 
thinking.

					SANDY
			What's the plan.

					JEFFREY
			First of all, we're going to the Slow Club
			to see Dorothy Vallens. We'll watch her for
			awhile. I'd like to hear her sing anyway,
			and then also we'll know she is there and
			not in her apartment.

					SANDY
			Brilliant.

					JEFFREY
			Then we'll drive back to her apartment and 
			I will plant myself there.

					SANDY
			This is not my usual Friday night!

									CUT TO:

75. EXT. "SLOW CLUB" - NIGHT

The SLOW CLUB is a sleazy night club on the outskirts of town.  It

Sandy park.  They get out of the car and enter the club.

									CUT TO:

76. INT. "SLOW CLUB" - NIGHT

					(French accent)
			Good evening. two?

					JEFFREY
			Yeah. Could we get a small table in the

					SLEZY MAITRE D'
			Surely, come this way.

They follow him and are seated.

					MAITRE D'
			May I get you something to drink?


					JEFFREY
			I'd like an ice-cold Heineken.

					SANDY
			    (she might as well)
			That sounds good.

					JEFFREY
			Two.

					MAITRE D'
			Two Heinekens, thank you.

The Maitre d' leaves.

On stage a FAT COMIC is telling jokes.  The jokes are tailored for this 
kind of working-class crowd.  The people are laughing.  The place is 
almost full.  Jeffrey and Sandy are taking it all in.

					JEFFREY
				    (to Waiter)
			When does Dorothy Vallens come on?

					WAITER
				(flustered; overworked)
			I don't know. pretty soon. Who knows.

After the Waiter leaves,

					SANDY
			That guy was filled with information.

They pour their beers.

					JEFFREY
				 (raising his glass)
			Here's to. an interesting experience.

					SANDY
			I'll drink to that.

They drink.

									DISSOLVE TO:

77. INT. "SLOW CLUB" - NIGHT

Later. Jeffrey and Sandy have just finished dinner.  The M.C. is arranging 
a floral art deco microphone and a SAXOPHONE PLAYER, a BASS PLAYER, and a 
DRUMMER are on stage.

					M.C.
				 (very low key)
			Ladies and gentlemen. The Blue Lady.
			Miss Dorothy Vallens.

There is quite a round of applause, even though most people continue 
laughing, talking, and drinking.  Dorothy Vallens comes out on stage.



She smiles. The house lights are still up. As she sings the first lines 
of "BLUE MOON" the house lights go down and a blue spot light comes up on 
her as she sings the word, "Blue." This is a very sexy and slow version of 
the song.

During the song, Jeffrey and Sandy look at one another with the thought 
that this is the woman whose apartment they are about to break into.

Jeffrey and Sandy leave as Dorothy starts her next song, "BLUE VELVET."  
They hear the first few lines before they get out the door.

78. EXT. "SLOW CLUB" - NIGHT

They hurry to the car, get in, and drive off.

									CUT TO:

79. INT. BEAUMONTS' CAR - NIGHT

Jeffrey and Sandy drive through dark areas of the city.  They don't talk 
as they drive, but again they sneak glances at one another.

80. INT. BEAUMONTS' CAR/LINCOLN STREET - NIGHT

They turn in to the street where Dorothy Vallens lives and glide to a stop 
close to the building.  Jeffery cuts the engine.

It is very quiet.  Both are looking around to see if anyone is out or 
watching.  Jeffrey tries to look up out the front windshield to the 
Seventh Floor.  It is dark.  Sandy moves.  Every tiny sound is heard.  
Sandy looks at Jeffrey for some time, then back at the building.

					SANDY
			Jeffrey, I don't think you ought to do it.

					JEFFREY
			Why not?

					SANDY
			It's crazy and dangerous. My God. I 
			shouldn't have told you.

					JEFFREY
			It'll be okay. I don't think you should
			wait out here though. I think you should 
			go home. Can you drive this car?

					SANDY
			Yeah. but.

					JEFFREY
			Leave it in the front of your house for me.
			okay?

					SANDY
			O.K.

					JEFFREY
			Could you wait a little while. this key may
			not fit.

					SANDY
			. I wish you wouldn't do this.  It doesn't
			make any sense. Let's go somewhere and 
			have some coffee.

					JEFFREY
			I'm going in, Sandy. I'll see you tomorrow
			and tell you how it went.

					SANDY
			I. I don't want to see you tomorrow.
			Mike's coming over.

					JEFFREY
			Oh, okay. can I call?

					SANDY
			Okay. yeah, call.

					JEFFREY
			Look. it can wait till Sunday.

					SANDY
			Call tomorrow. It's okay. Good luck. I hope
			you can sneak out okay. You're going to 
			wait until she's asleep?

					JEFFREY
			Yeah.

					SANDY
			I'm going to wait here until she comes.

					JEFFREY
			Are you sure?

					SANDY
			I'll honk four times so you'll hear it and
			know she's on her way up. Okay?

Jeffrey nods.

					JEFFREY
			Okay. thanks.

					SANDY
			I don't know if you're a detective or a 
			pervert.

					JEFFREY
			That's for me to know and for you to find
			out. I'll see you. I mean call you. okay?

					SANDY
			Okay, okay. Bye.

Jeffrey gets out of the car and shuts the door.  He looks in one more time 
at Sandy.  They stare at each other silently.

Jeffrey can see her lips in the black darkness of the car.  Sandy watches 
him cross the lawn and go into the apartment building.  She slides over and
sits in the driver's seat.

									CUT TO:

81. INT. STAIRWAY - APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT

Jeffrey hurries up the stairs to the Seventh Floor.

SOMEONE comes out of an apartment just as Jeffrey gets to the Seventh Floor.

He goes up another flight of stairs to the Eighth Floor and waits until 
the man goes downstairs.

Jeffrey then goes back to the Seventh Floor and goes to Door 710.  
He takes out the key and looks around. No one.  He inserts the key.  
It fits.  He turns it.  The door opens.

82. INT. DOROTHY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

He quickly enters the very dark apartment and shuts the door.  It takes a 
moment for his eyes to adjust to the darkness.  Soon he finds his way 
around.  He decides on the closet to hide in.  However before he goes in 
to the closet he slowly surveys the apartment as well as he can in the 
darkness.  He goes down the hallway to the back bedroom.  

Across the hallway he opens another door and is surprised to find an empty 
child's room.  In the child's room he sees a small pointed hat with a 
propeller on top.  The kind that plays music when the propeller turns.  
The hat is sitting silently on the bed post.  He quietly closes the door.  
He returns to the closet.  Once inside, he checks out how much he can see. 
Through the slats he has a view of half the apartment.  This is where he 
will stay.  He moves around some to relax.  He takes several deep breaths. 
He looks at his watch.  It says "10:17."

83. INT. BEAUMONTS' CAR/LINCOLN STREET - NIGHT

Sandy sits in the car, carefully watching the apartment building and 
street.

84. INT. DOROTHY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

In the closet, Jeffrey shakes his shoulders and moves around some to 
stretch his muscles which are getting tired.  Again, he takes several 
deep breaths.  He looks at his watch - it says 12:45.

					JEFFREY
				    (to himself)
			Oh no, hurry up Dorothy. Come on!. and I
			gotta pee. Great. it's now or never.

Jeffrey sneaks out of the closet and makes his way across the bedroom to 
the door of the bathroom.  His foot hits the door and it makes a loud 
noise.  He freezes.

85. INT. DOROTHY'S BATHROOM - NIGHT

He moves again into the bathroom.  He starts to pee.

					JEFFREY
			Heineken.

									CUT TO:

86. INT. BEAUMONTS' CAR/LINCOLN STREET - NIGHT

Suddenly Sandy sits up alert.

87. EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT

A car drives up and a MAN helps Dorothy Vallens get out.  They walk into 
the building.

									CUT TO:

88. INT. DOROTHY'S BATHROOM - NIGHT

Jeffrey instinctively has flushed the toilet and because everything else 
is so quiet the water SOUNDS seem very loud.

89. INT. BEAUMONTS' CAR/LINCOLN STREET - NIGHT

Sandy begins to honk the horn.

90. INT. DOROTHY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Unable to hear the warning horn, Jeffrey nonchalantly leaves the bathroom 
as the tank is still filling.

SUDDENLY, he hears something. a key going in the door.  He bolts toward 
the closet.  He flies inside it and is swinging the door shut as the front 
door opens.

Just as suddenly, the toilet tank gets full and the water shuts off - 
SILENCE, except for Dorothy Vallens at the front door.

					DOROTHY (V.O.)
				(we're watching Jeffrey trying to 
  				 control frightened breathing in
			  the dark closet)
			Thanks Jimmy, see you tomorrow. You want a
			drink, or something?

					JIMMY (V.O.)
			I better get back. thanks anyway.

					DOROTHY
			Goodnight.

					JIMMY
			Goodnight now.

The front door shuts and the living room lights go on.  Jeffrey can see 
Dorothy come toward him.  She walks RIGHT UP, almost to his face, when 
the phone RINGS.

She turns immediately and goes to answer it.  Jeffrey almost passes out. 
He thought he'd had it.  He overhears.


					DOROTHY
				    (on the phone)
			Hello. yes. yes sir, Frank. Let me
			talk to him. Please Frank, sir. I like
			to sing Blue Velvet. Don? It's okay.
			Don't worry. Don??. can you hear me?
			Is little Donny OK? Is he there? Don? You
			mean Meadow Lane? Frank?! What's the
			matter with him? I know. When? Okay. In
			an hour. I'll be sweet. Momma loves you.
			Okay Frank, sir.

She hangs up the phone hard and puts her head in her hands.

					DOROTHY
				    (to herself)
			Frank, you son of a bitch!

She goes and sits down and starts chewing a fingernail.  She nervously 
gets up again and looks at a framed photograph for a moment then hides 
the photograph under a pillow on the couch.  She puts on a record, "FOR 
YOUR PRECIOUS LOVE."  She sits back down and chews her nail again, 
listening to the MUSIC; she starts to cry.  She stops herself and takes 
the record off.  She starts taking off her stocking.  She then takes off 
her dress.

Underneath, she has on a bra and panties.  She crosses the living room, 
goes down the hallway into the bathroom.

Jeffrey can't see her too well now.  She takes off her panties in the 
bathroom.  She is now naked.  She looks at herself in the mirror.  We see 
Jeffrey's face as he watches her.  She disappears from view completely and 
we HEAR her start a SHOWER.

									DISSOLVE TO:

91. INT. DOROTHY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Jeffrey's face.  He sees Dorothy - in a towel - come toward him again.  
He quickly moves back into the closet as far as he can.

She opens the door, reaches in and gets a blue velvet robe.  She doesn't 
see Jeffrey even though he isn't well hidden.  She closes the door.  It 
CLICKS shut.

Jeffrey is in almost total darkness.  He listens.  He can HEAR WALKING 
around, then silence.  He hears the kitchen sink WATER RUNNING.

He HEARS her WALKING AGAIN.  Now he can see her.  She sits down on her 
bed.  She looks up.  Just as Jeffrey shifts his weight.  She looks at the
closet strangely, but then calmly picks up a book and thumbs through it.  
She slowly gets up.

Jeffrey doesn't know what is up.  He looks but she walks out of view.

SUDDENLY, he hears a DRAWER OPEN, and just as suddenly, the CLOSET DOOR 
FLIES OPEN, and there she is with a pistol pointed right at him.  When 
she realizes that SOMEONE IS REALLY THERE, she SCREAMS ONCE, very loud.

					DOROTHY
				 (crazy scream, then)
			GET OUT OF THERE!! GET OUT!! Put your
			hands up, on your head. GO ON!! Get down
			on your knees - DO IT!! What are you 
			doing? Who are you? What's your name?.
			WHAT'S YOUR NAME?

					JEFFREY
			Jeffrey.

					DOROTHY
			Jeffrey. Jeffrey what?

					JEFFREY
			Jeffrey nothing.

					DOROTHY
			You tell me!! Let me see that wallet.
				 (reads his license)
			Jeffrey Beaumont. What're you doing in
			my apartment, Jeffrey Beaumont?

					JEFFREY
			I wanted to see you.

					DOROTHY
			What? Are you kidding me? Who sent you 
			here?

					JEFFREY
			Nobody.

					DOROTHY
			Shit. You better tell me something.

					JEFFREY
			I was. an experiment. Just to see if
			I could do it.

					DOROTHY
			An experiment? Hey, I've seen you before.

					JEFFREY
			I sprayed your apartment. I took your key.
			I really didn't mean to do anything but 
			see you.

					DOROTHY
			Tell me what you saw tonight. TELL ME.

					JEFFREY
				 (scared, nervous)
			. I saw you come in, talk on the phone.
			get undressed.

					DOROTHY
				   (interrupting)
			The phone. What did you hear on the phone
			. Tell me. Word for word.

					JEFFREY
				 (trying to remember)
			You said hello. to Frank. You wanted to 
			talk to someone?. Don?. and little Donny.
			You said something about Momma loves you.
			and something about a Meadow Lane.
			something in an hour. I don't remember
			any more.

Dorothy stares at Jeffrey studying him for some time thinking.

					DOROTHY
			That's right. That's what I said. You
			have a good memory. Then what?

					JEFFREY
			Well.

					DOROTHY
			THEN WHAT?

					JEFFREY
			Then you got undressed.

					DOROTHY
			How many times have you sneaked into girls'
			apartments and watched them undress?

					JEFFREY
			    (quietly; feeling guilty)
			Never before this.

					DOROTHY
			How'd you like it if someone sneaked into
			your house and watched you.
				   (gets an idea)
			Get undressed. I want to see you.

					JEFFREY
			No. Come on.

					DOROTHY
			NO, you come on. Take off your pants. I
			want to see you.

					JEFFREY
			Look. I'm sorry. Just let me leave.

					DOROTHY
			No way.

Dorothy moves to the kitchen counter and gets a knife.  She goes to 
Jeffrey.  Now she has a knife and a gun.  He's scared.

					DOROTHY
			Get undressed. I want to see you.

Jeffrey begins to undress. First he takes off his shoes and socks, 
Then his shirt.  He undoes his belt and unzips his pants and takes them 
off.  Now he is only in his underwear.

					DOROTHY
			STAND UP.

He does.

					DOROTHY
				    (continuing)
			Come closer.

Dorothy has a strange look on her face.  She reaches out and pulls 
Jeffrey's underpants down to his knees.  She looks at him.

					DOROTHY
				    (whispering)
			What do you want from me?

					JEFFREY
			   (quietly, getting very hot)
			I . I don't know.

					DOROTHY
				    (whispering)
			What do you want?

Dorothy is getting very DREAMY and begins to talk in a childlike voice.  
She opens her robe and pulls Jeffrey to her breasts.

					DOROTHY
			Don't move. don't look at me.

Jeffrey's eyes close with nervous ecstasy as Dorothy begins touching him.

					DOROTHY
			Do you like that?

					JEFFREY
			Yes.

He tries to touch her.

					DOROTHY
			Don't move or I'll kill you.

She looks at him.

					DOROTHY
				   (continuing)
			Do you like talk like that?

					JEFFREY
			No.

					DOROTHY
			Lie down on the bed.

He lies down.  He looks frightened.

There's a KNOCK, KNOCK on the door.  Dorothy looks VERY frightened.  She 
quickly moves a finger to her lips in a "quiet" sign and whispers to 
Jeffrey.

					DOROTHY
				 (whispers, frantic)
			Shut up. Hurry! Go in the closet. Don't
			say anything or you'll get killed. I mean
			it.

KNOCKING is heard louder at the door.  Jeffrey picks up all his clothes 
and gets in the closet.  He's naked and hiding in the closet.  Dorothy 
closes her robe and glides to the front door.

Jeffrey sees FRANK come in.

Frank is medium height and stocky with a burr hair cut.  He is wearing a 
tight blue t-shirt and an old black sports jacket.  He's got on a pair of 
blue jeans and boots.  He has a raw, mean sexuality - a "bomb about to go 
off" - presence. 

He comes into the room slowly, always looking at Dorothy.  He sits on the 
couch.

					DOROTHY
			Hello, baby.

					FRANK
                      (annoyed, condescending)
			Shut up. It's daddy. shithead.

					DOROTHY
			Hello, daddy.

					FRANK
			  (can't-you-remember-
			   anything-attitude)
			. my bourbon.

Dorothy goes into the kitchen to get Frank his drink.  As she passes the 
closet, Jeffrey can see the fear in her face.

She returns with a small glass of bourbon and hands it to Frank.  Frank 
sips on it.

					FRANK
			. sit down. get your chair.

Dorothy brings a small chair over from the wall and sits down.  She 
adjusts her robe.

					FRANK
				 (studying her)
			. spread your legs.

Dorothy slowly spreads her legs.  She can see Jeffrey staring out of the 
darkness of the closet at her.

					FRANK
			wider.

She opens her legs wider.  Frank looks at her crotch and drinks his 
bourbon.  He stares at the floor for a moment, then slowly looks back at 
Dorothy, her body - her crotch.

Dorothy looks up at the ceiling, waiting.  Frank suddenly reaches to his 
belt, where he has a small canister and a mask.  He opens a valve on the 
canister and places the mask over his nose and mouth.  The canister is 
filled with helium, which makes Frank's voice very high and strange 
sounding.  The result is frightening.

					FRANK
				   (high voice)
			. mommy.

Dorothy jumps.  She keeps looking at the ceiling.

					FRANK
			   (continuing, with high voice)
			. MOMMY!.

					DOROTHY
				    (frightened)
			. mommy's here.

					FRANK
				  (high voice)
			Baby wants to fuck.

Then, Frank's voice goes to normal.

					FRANK
			(normal voice, but loud - like
    			 an army order to himself)
			GET READY TO FUCK!

Frank goes to Dorothy and kneels down in front of her.  He takes one more 
gasp of helium.

					FRANK
				   (high voice)
			Baby wants blue velvet.

Dorothy opens her robe and gives a part of the robe to Frank.

					DOROTHY
				   (whispering)
			Okay.

Frank slowly moves

Frank slowly moves his mouth to the robe and runs his lips along the 
texture of the velvet.  His hands rub the velvet and feel Dorothy's body 
underneath.  His hands start feeling her breasts as he sucks and bites the 
velvet robe.

Dorothy is very frightened but she is getting hot in spite of her fear.  
Then Frank, in a sort of sickening way, pulls Dorothy down to rug.  He 
warns her.

					FRANK
			Don't look at me!

He begins stuffing part of the robe into her mouth.  Then, he pushes her 
arms back and she keeps them back, letting Frank have his way.  Frank 
sucks and bites the velvet coming out of her mouth, while he pinches and 
feels her breasts in a strange, compulsive, timidly sickening way.  
Dorothy is moaning.  Frank is breathing very heavily. He feels her crotch.

					FRANK
			Don't look at me!!!
			     (heavy breathing)
			Daddy's home.

He starts stuffing the robe in his mouth now and he gets on top of Dorothy.
He starts humping her and pulling her nude body up and down him.  Faster 
and faster, then he has a climax in his pants.  Dorothy's head is falling 
back.  She can see Jeffrey blurred in the distance - in the closet.  
Cautiously, she looks sideways at Frank.

					FRANK
				    (screaming)
			Don't look at me!!!

He slugs her in the face.  His nose is running and he's stifling sobs from 
deep within him.  On his hands and knees, he moves away.  The robe pulls 
out of his mouth.  His breathing is even heavier now.  He stands and 
begins to move around the apartment.  He goes to a wall, turns off the 
lights, then turns and walks into the bathroom, all the while breathing 
big, heavy breaths, trying to stop the crying.  Dorothy moans softly.

It gets very quiet and still for a moment.  Then, Jeffrey hears Frank 
with his high helium voice talking to himself in the bathroom.  The high, 
strange sound reverberates in the distance.  Jeffrey can't make it out - 
soon, he hears Frank's high laughing.  Frank comes back into the living 
room.  The mask is around his face.  All his breathing - every sound is 
high . He laughs a little and crosses the darkened room to the door.

					FRANK
			Stay alive baby. See you next Christmas!

Frank leaves and shuts the door.  The apartment is silent except for 
Dorothy's moans.  

Jeffrey is stunned.  He doesn't move.  He watches Dorothy in the 
half-light.  She rolls over and starts crying.  The crying is deep and 
genuine.

Slowly, Jeffrey emerges from the closet and goes to her.  He bends down 
and touches her.  She flinches and turns to see him.  She turns back 
sobbing.  He tries to get her up.

					JEFFREY
			Why don't you come lie down. Come on, I'll
			help you.

She struggles up with Jeffrey's help and he takes her over to the bed.  
She falls down on her side, turned toward the wall.  He covers her with 
the sheet.

					DOROTHY
			Don't.
			    (referring to the sheet)
			I don't like that. What do you want?

					JEFFREY
			Nothing. Are you alright?

					DOROTHY
			Sure I'm alright.
			   (she starts crying again)

					JEFFREY
			I'll go then.

He starts to put on his underwear.  They're inside out.  He tries to turn 
them around.

					DOROTHY
			Don?

					JEFFREY
			No.

					DOROTHY
			Don. Hold me. I'm scared. Hold me.
			Please.

Jeffrey turns to her.  He studies her.  He reaches out and takes her 
shoulders.  He moves down and holds her.

					DOROTHY
				    (whispering)
			Thank you. honey.

					JEFFREY
				    (whispering)
			It's okay. It's okay.

They lie together for a long silent moment.

					DOROTHY
			Do you like the way I feel?

					JEFFREY
				    (hesitates)
			Yes.

					DOROTHY
			See my breasts?  . See?

Jeffrey looks.

					JEFFREY
			Yes.

					DOROTHY
			See my nipples?

					JEFFREY
			Yes.

					DOROTHY
				    (whispering)
			You can kiss them if you want. Fell them
			. They're getting hard.

Jeffrey starts to move closer.  Dorothy closes her eyes.

					DOROTHY
				    (continuing)
			Go ahead. I don't mind.

Jeffrey can't help himself.  He licks and sucks her nipples and feels her 
breasts.  They both are getting very hot.

					DOROTHY
			Feel me.

Jeffrey is all over her now.  Dorothy suddenly seems to recognize him.

					DOROTHY
			You can hit me, if you want to.

					JEFFREY
			No. please. I won't.

Dorothy arches back and whining she throws her head back hard against the 
wall.

					JEFFREY
			Stop it!

She moves and won't let him feel her anymore.  She holds his hands away.

					DOROTHY
				    (whispering)
			Do you like me?

					JEFFREY
				    (whispering)
			Yes, I like you.

					DOROTHY
				    (whispering)
			You can be my special friend and come and
			put that in me.

They start making love.  Suddenly, Dorothy starts crying.

					JEFFREY
			What's the matter?

Suddenly Dorothy slaps Jeffrey in the face. very hard.

					DOROTHY
			Get off me.

Jeffrey gets off her, pressing his hand to his face.  Dorothy goes into 
the bathroom crying all the way.  Jeffrey sits, confused.

Suddenly Jeffrey hears a horrible scream from Dorothy.  A true scream of 
horror.  He rushes into the bathroom to see what is wrong.

92. INT. DOROTHY'S BATHROOM - NIGHT

She is just flushing something down the toilet.  The water SOUND rushes.  
He turns to her.  She is trembling and in a state of shock.

					DOROTHY
			I made it go down the toilet.

					JEFFREY
			What?

He looks in the swirling water. It looks like an ear revolving around and 
around then whatever it is disappears.

					DOROTHY
			I made it go down the toilet.

Jeffrey looks up. he sees written with a bar of soap the words "look down" 
on the mirror.

He looks down into the sink.  At the bottom he sees a small clot of blood 
and a smear of fresher blood.

Jeffrey suddenly remembers mentally Frank's high helium voice reverberating
in the bathroom.

93. INT. DOROTHY'S BATHROOM - NIGHT

FLASHBACK

Frank in bathroom.

94. INT. DOROTHY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

FLASHBACK

Frank at door saying "see you next Christmas."

95. INT. DOROTHY'S BATHROOM - NIGHT

					JEFFREY
				   (inner voice)
			Next Christmas. Is he Santa Claus who has
			left a present for Dorothy? What was it?
			An ear? Another ear?!!
				(out loud, to Dorothy)
			What was it?

					DOROTHY
			(strangely - extremely frightened
  			 now that Jeffrey may have left it)
			Do you know?

					JEFFREY
			No.



					DOROTHY
			  (breathing heavily, strangely)
			You don't?

					JEFFREY
			No. What is happening?

					DOROTHY
			Maybe you don't know. I know you though.
			You're Jeffrey Beaumont and I know where
			you live and I know ways to get you and I
			know ways to kill you.

					JEFFREY
			Please don't talk like that. You're upset.
			I'm not helping you. I'm sorry for what I
			did. I better go.

					DOROTHY
			Go then. I can't let you put it in me now
			but I want you. I like you.
	
					JEFFREY
			Then don't talk about killing.

					DOROTHY
			Did I say that?. I didn't mean it. or did I?
				     (laughs)
			Sometimes I think it would be fun.
				  (strange smile)
			Go ahead, you better leave now. I can't
			open myself to you now. I'll tell you a little
			secret.
				  (she leans close)
			I want to die.

					JEFFREY
			Don't say that.

					DOROTHY
			It's a secret so don't tell anyone. Some day
			I'll show you where. I've gotta go to sleep 
			now.

					JEFFREY
			 (frightened by her craziness)
			O.K.

He takes another look at the blood in the bottom of the sink.  He takes 
another look at the beautiful dark troubled eyes of Dorothy Vallens, and 
turns, goes through the hall to the living room.  He crosses slowly to the 
door, suddenly he turns back and enters the hallway going down to the 
bathroom.  He stops and looks at Dorothy who is turned away from him.  
She stares into the sink.  Jeffrey notices that a square of fabric has 
been cut from the bottom of her blue velvet robe

					JEFFREY
			I'm leaving now.

She is whispering something to herself.

					DOROTHY
				 (very faint whisper)
			Help me. help me. please help me.

Jeffrey doesn't know what he can do.

96. INT. DOROTHY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Jeffrey turns back, goes through the living room.  He looks around and 
sees the empty bourbon glass of Frank's.  Suddenly he remembers the 
photograph that Dorothy hid.  He picks up the pillow and sees a picture 
of a smiling man and a small boy standing next to him wearing a pointed 
hat with a propeller. He turns the photo over and finds an old marriage 
license.  It reads: Dorothy Vallens to Don.

					JEFFREY (V.O.)
			Don. Oh my God.

He hides the photo again.  He sees Dorothy's telephone.  He memorizes the 
number - moving his lips with each digit.  He goes to the front door and 
opens it quietly.

97. EXT. STAIRWAY - APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT

He looks out into the hall.  It's empty.

97A. INT. HALLWAY - APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT

He quickly goes to the back stairway and down the stairs.  These steps are 
cement and his feet make echoing sounds which seem very loud.  He goes 
through a door marked "EXIT".

98. EXT. LINCOLN STREET - NIGHT

. and comes out, crosses a lawn and goes out onto the sidewalk.

He walks along taking in deep cleansing breaths.  He looks at his watch.  
2:30.  He feels so confused, exhilarated, so uneasy.  He secretly worries 
about what he's gotten into.

99. INT. BEAUMONTS' LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Jeffrey enters the house. THE CAMERA RUSHES along the rug in the dark to a 
foot.  The lights come on.  PAN UP the leg to Mrs. Beaumont waiting in a 
chair, staring.

					JEFFREY
				     (startled)
			God. you scared me.

					MRS. BEAUMONT
			Is something wrong? What's happened to 
			your face?

					JEFFREY
			Nothing. I'm fine.

					MRS. BEAUMONT
			You can't just stay out half the night and
			carry on, Jeffrey. There's got to be some
			order, Jeffrey. I thought it would have
			been nice to call your father when you got 
			home but now it is much too late.

FADE TO:

100. INT. JEFFREY'S BEDROOM - DAY

Jeffrey gets out of bed and goes to the phone.  He dials a number.

					JEFFREY
			Louise Wertham, please. okay.
					(waits)
			Louise?. Jeffrey. Hi. What's up?
					(pause)
			MARRIED?! Good night! Louise! Are 
			you kidding?
				    (long pause)
			Well, Louise, I wish you a lot of
			luck and if things don't work out, 
I think you should go into comedy.

Jeffrey hangs up the phone hard.  He shakes his head.

101. INT. BEAUMONTS' HARDWARE STORE - DAY

Jeffrey's drinking a cup of coffee behind the counter in the store.  
He thinks.  He takes another drink of coffee and sets the cup down.  
He clasps his hands behind his back and begins pacing up and down.

					JEFFREY
				(to himself, out loud)
			How can I help her? I can't tell her to go
			to Detective Williams. She'll think I'm a
			policeman. She has my address. She can go	
			there. if she has to. I'll tell her. and 
			her. and she thinks I'm Don. her husband?
			Where the hell is Don? - maybe he died.

Jeffrey dials the phone.

					JEFFREY
			Hello?. Mrs. Williams?. This is Jeffrey
			Beaumont. Fine. Okay. Is Sandy there? 
			Okay. Hi Sandy. Can you talk? He is?.
			Well, I guess I'll talk to you later on.
			It went okay. I'll tell you about it.
			Dinner?. Tomorrow night? Seven o'clock,
			yeah, sounds good. Okay. he's still in
			the hospital. Okay, yeah. See you 
			tomorrow. thanks.

102. INT. HOSPITAL LABORATORY - DAY

The searching, mysterious MUSIC plays over while,

A DOCTOR is looking at various blood samples under a powerful microscope.  
Various sophisticated gadgets are seen in CLOSEUPS.

					JEFFREY (V.O.)
			This is what my father's disease looks like?

					DR. GYNDE
			Yes.

The BLOOD is seen in CLOSEUP. Cells are moving.

The Doctor makes a change in magnification.  The cells are huge - then, 
even bigger.  They are so big we can hear them moving.

103. EXT. "SLOW CLUB" - NIGHT

The parking lot is half-full.  A strong wind is blowing trash around.  
Jeffrey parks his car.

104. INT. "SLOW CLUB" - NIGHT

. and enters the club. He speaks to the Maitre d'.

					JEFFREY
			A table in back, please.

					MAITRE D'
			Certainly

Dorothy is singing her opening song as the Maitre d' seats Jeffrey.

					JEFFREY
			I'll have an ice-cold Heineken.

					MAITRE D'
			One Heineken, certainly, sir.

Jeffrey surveys the place after the Maitre d' leaves.  It is very dark and 
smoky inside.  He has trouble seeing, but suddenly he spots Frank sitting 
with some other GUYS watching Dorothy sing.  They are sitting two tables 
away.

Frank is totally captivated by Dorothy's singing and is very serious-
looking.  He looks right up to her eyes.  In his hand he works a small 
piece of blue velvet cloth with his fingers.  Again her first number, 
"BLUE MOON," segues into "BLUE VELVET."  This song she sings mainly to 
Frank.  When it is over Frank continues watching Dorothy and everyone else 
applauds loudly.

Jeffrey drinks up his Heineken and goes back outside.

EXT. "SLOW CLUB" - NIGHT

He looks around at all the cars but none stand out as Frank's.  He gets 
into his car and pulls out across the street, re-parks the car and waits.

									DISSOLVE TO:

106. EXT. "SLOW CLUB" - NIGHT

Traffic roars past Jeffrey and in the distance several people exit the 
SLOW CLUB.  Among them are Frank and his friends.  They get into a black 
Ford Fairlane and drive out of the parking lot - down the highway.  
Jeffrey starts his engine and moves out after them.  He has to gun the car 
up to sixty-five to catch up with them.

107. EXT. CITY STREETS - NIGHT

The mysterious MUSIC plays.

He follows them to an intersection where they turn off to the right.  
He waits at a light right behind them.  Inside they are lighting 
cigarettes.  The light turns green and Frank takes off.  Jeffrey follows 
them through a dark area down by the docks.  He follows them up a narrow 
street through dark factories.

108. EXT. FRONT STREET - NIGHT

Dark, low MUSIC now.

Up ahead, Frank parks his car.  Jeffrey quickly pulls over and kills his 
lights and engine.  He watches Frank and his friends enter an old apartment
building next to a bookbinding factory.  They disappear within.  The 
electric lines above buzz loudly.

Jeffrey gets out of his car and walks up the deserted street.  He reaches 
Frank's car which is making popping and clicking NOISES as it cools down.  
He looks at the license plates - walks a few paces ahead and then writes it
down in his notebook.  He continues on to the apartment building.

109. 	INT. LOBBY - FRANK'S BUILDING - NIGHT

Inside he looks at the names on the mailboxes.  He sees a name - Frank 
Booth.  The name gives him the chills.  The apartment number is 26.

In the distance, he hears footsteps.  He quickly leaves.

110. EXT. FRONT STREET - NIGHT

. and crosses the street down to his car.  He gets in and waits.  Frank 
comes out of the building and crosses to his car.

					JEFFREY
			     (out loud to himself)
			I'll bet I know where you're going.

He follows Frank as he pulls out.

									DISSOLVE TO:

111. 	EXT. DINER PARKING LOT - NIGHT

Jeffrey discreetly parks just after Frank kills the engine on his car.  
He watches Frank leave the parking lot.

112. EXT. VACANT FIELD - NIGHT

He follows Frank through the same vacant lot where he found the ear.  He 
seems to use the lot as a secret short cut to Dorothy's apartment.


113. EXT. DINER PARKING LOT - NIGHT

Jeffrey goes back to his car to wait.

									DISSOLVE TO:

114. EXT. DINER PARKING LOT - NIGHT

A storm is building.  There is a roar of thunder as Frank slams his car 
door as he gets in.  His mouth twists into a smile as he guns the engine 
and leaves.  Jeffrey waits till Frank is safely gone.

					JEFFREY
			       (thinking out loud)
			I shouldn't go in. I shouldn't. but I'm
			too curious. and I have to try to help her.

He then gets out of his car as the wind is building.

115. EXT. VACANT FIELD - NIGHT

. and runs through the vacant lot.

116. EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT

. to Dorothy's building.

117. INT. STAIRWAY - APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT

He goes up to the seventh floor and knocks twice on 710.  A moment passes, 
then the door flies open.

Dorothy looks as if she was expecting Frank to be coming back.  Dorothy 
LOOKS BAD.

					JEFFREY
			Hi. can I come in?

					DOROTHY
			  (looking around the hallway)
			Yeah. hurry up though.

They go inside.

118. INT. DOROTHY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

					JEFFREY
			Are you alright?

Dorothy breaks down crying.

					DOROTHY
			No. I'm not.

Jeffrey goes to her.

					DOROTHY
			Why are you here. whatiya want?


					JEFFREY
			. I. uh.

					DOROTHY
				   (still crying)
			I looked for you in my closet tonight.
				  (a little laugh)
			It's crazy, I don't know where you came
			from but. I like you.

					JEFFREY
			That's not crazy. I like you too.

Dorothy looks up.  They stare at each other for some time.

					DOROTHY
			I liked being with you last night.

					JEFFREY
			. same here.

There is a loud knocking on the door.

					DOROTHY
				(she starts to stagger)
			Oh shit.

					JEFFREY
				    (frightened)
			Frank? .can you stand up?

					DOROTHY
			I'm alright. go hide. This won't 
			take long. Be quiet.

Jeffrey gets in the closet and Dorothy closes the door.  She holds her 
head collecting her fragile self.  Dorothy goes to the door and opens it.
It's the Man with the Yellow Sports Coat - tonight he's wearing a purple 
sports coat and light blue double knit pants.  His eyes are glazed and his 
face is broken out in a sweat.

					YELLOW MAN
			Frank gone?

					DOROTHY
			Yeah. but get outta here. He's comin'
			back.

					YELLOW MAN
			Bull.

					DOROTHY
			Alright, suit yourself.

					YELLOW MAN
			He's comin' back?. What for?

					DOROTHY
				     (shaking)
			'Cause he's comin' back, that's what for.
			Frank's got you really loaded tonight.

					YELLOW MAN
				    (getting upset)
			Yeah, maybe so. Frank's got me. and you.
			and really it's all thanks to Don. isn't
			it. remember that. Your husband was the
			one who started fucking my mind with drugs.

					DOROTHY
			Oh he forced you, huh?

					YELLOW MAN
			He's the reformed dealer though who wanted
			to turn himself in. he's the one that caused
			Frank to come and Frank's fucking us real
			good. I just feel so horny. I'm supposed to
			be here watching you why can't I be here 
			fucking you. Listen. I know his cock's the 
			size of a pin - let me give you the real 
			thing. let me wet my whistle, baby.

					DOROTHY
				 (cool, but real mad)
			No way. get out. I'm gonna tell Frank.
			I'm gonna tell him what you said.

					YELLOW MAN
			Okay, I'm goin'. You'll see. I'll get you.

Dorothy kicks the door after he closes it, then she chains it.  Jeffrey 
comes out of the closet.

					JEFFREY
				 (talking softly)
			Nice guy.  Who's he?

					DOROTHY
			Who's it, you mean.

SUDDENLY, Dorothy starts to shake and cry.

Jeffrey grabs her and shakes her and holds her tight to him.  She starts 
sobbing again.

					DOROTHY
				    (continuing)
			Oh God. Don!!! Why can't I just die.

					JEFFREY
				(quietly, soothing her)
			There you go again. stop saying that.
			You can make it.

					DOROTHY
			I can't. I can't. You think you know 
			so much.

					JEFFREY
			Take it easy. What's goin' on anyway?.
			Why are you in so much trouble?

Dorothy is sobbing and Jeffrey is holding her.  There is a long silence 
and she calms down.  

					DOROTHY
				   (whispering)
			I. don't. okay. Just don't. just be
			with me.
				(now very strangely)
			Oh God. Come with me. Who are you.
			Come up here.

Dorothy takes Jeffrey through the kitchen and out the back.

119. INT. BACK STAIRWAY - APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT

. to a back stairway leading to the roof.

120. EXT. ROOFTOP - APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT

The storm is closer and the dark clouds move violently in front of a full 
moon.  The wind continues to moan.  They move to the roof top and Dorothy 
leads Jeffrey through the chimneys to the edge of the building.  A very 
sad forlorn version of "Somewhere over the Rainbow" - creeps through the 
wind.

					DOROTHY
				 (as she stares down)
			Look.

					JEFFREY
				(turning to her quickly)
			No.

					DOROTHY
			(continuing to look down, her
    			 eyes widening - she whispers)
Falling.

					JEFFREY
			No. Please, Dorothy. Why are you in so
			much trouble?

He moves closer to her.

					JEFFREY
				    (continuing)
			Who is Don?

					DOROTHY
			      (very crazy and angry)
			Don?. Are you in with them?

					JEFFREY
                            (whispering)
			No. But you're in very big trouble.

					DOROTHY
			Why are you so interested? Why do you
			keep asking me?


					JEFFREY
			I came back to help you. You said do I
			let girls sneak into my house. You know
			where I live. if you need to. come to 
			where I live. O.K.?

					DOROTHY
			Who are you? Maybe I'll need to. you like
			me, huh?

					JEFFREY
			Yes.

					DOROTHY
				    (whispering)
			. or do you just want me? I'm going to let
			you enter me now.

					JEFFREY
			No. I should go.

					DOROTHY
			Please. please stay.

She makes him kiss her. he really likes it.  Once again, Jeffrey and 
Dorothy get VERY HOT.  Dorothy and Jeffrey lie down on the roof.  Dorothy 
cries out suddenly and bangs her head hard again and again against the 
roof.

					JEFFREY
			Why Dorothy?

We move very close to Jeffrey's ear as Dorothy's lips come up and whisper 
into it.

					DOROTHY
			Don? I have to make it hurt. I want
			there to be nothing again. Don!!!
				(as she slams her head 
        			 again and again)

She reaches up and clutches Jeffrey then pulls him down with a feverish 
kiss.  Lightening cracks above them and the wind howls.

FADE TO WHITE:

FADE DOWN TO:

121. EXT. LINCOLN STREET - NIGHT

Jeffrey leaves the pool of light from a street light and walks into 
darkness.  He continues down the sidewalk.  He looks up at the starry sky.
The stars are so far away - the feeling is cold and lonely.

									DISSOLVE TO:

121A. 

Darkness: There are bell tones sounding, and as each one sounds pin points
of light appear on Mr. Beaumonts distorted dream face.  He is trying to 
speak.  He's trying to say "Jeffrey."

121B. 

Another dark image appears.  A robin sits in a tree at night.  Very close.
There is a slow low reverberating chirping sound.

121C.

Now Dorothy's apartment building at night.  A very low angle looking up 
to the roof.  Suddenly a pinpoint of red appears coming toward us from 
the roof.  It flies toward us very fast growing larger until we see it is 
a red high-heeled shoe.  As it fills the screen it becomes red lips of 
Dorothy's which open into a scream.

121D.

Jeffrey wakes in his room - terrified.

122. INT. BEAUMONTS' LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Jeffrey is talking with Aunt Barbara in the semi-dark living room.

					JEFFREY
			Will you tell Mom when she gets home from 
			the hospital that I've gone to dinner at
			Sandy Williams' house?

					AUNT BARBARA
			Okay honey. that sounds nice. Jeffrey.
			I think you've got termites in the house.

					JEFFREY
			Oh yeah?. Have you seen any?

					AUNT BARBARA
			I've seen a few.

					JEFFREY
			Well, I haven't seen any. I wouldn't worry
			about it. Look. I better go.

					AUNT BARBARA
			Okay honey.

Jeffrey leaves and Aunt Barbara moves about tapping on the walls.  She 
moves into a dark area and taps.  Something falls.  She reaches down.

In EXTREME CLOSEUP we see a termite walking by her shoe on the thick 
carpet.  Then in EXTREME CLOSEUP we see Aunt Barbara's fingers pinch the 
termite and bring it up in front of her thick glasses for a look.  She 
looks at the termite, then looks back at the walls.

We GLIDE ALONG the dark walls of the house.

									CUT TO:

123. INT. WILLIAMS' DINING ROOM - NIGHT

They all sit around the dining room table.  They have their heads bowed 
in a prayer before dinner.

					SANDY
			We thank you in the name of the Father, the
			Son, and the Holy Ghost. Amen.

They start passing food around.

					MIKE
			Like I was saying. if you toss the ball like
			this, with your fingers just down here, that
			thing'll spin like a beauty. real straight.

					DETECTIVE WILLIAMS
					  (teasing him)
			Yeah? Then how come nobody caught anything
			last week?.

					MIKE
				 (not laughing)
			'Cause we had a bad day.

					DETECTIVE WILLIAMS
			You play any sports, Jeffrey?

					JEFFREY
			No.

					MIKE
			Looks like you'd make a good runner.

					JEFFREY
			Well.

					MIKE
			I mean, you don't exactly have the build
			for a football. I mean. no offense.

Jeffrey looks around and sees Sandy looking at him.  She then gives a 
stern look to Mike.  Then Mike and Sandy both look at Jeffrey.

					JEFFREY
				   (not offended)
			No. you're right.

					MIKE
			I mean. some guys play anyway but they
			usually get slaughtered.

					JEFFREY
			Yeah, well I never wanted to get 
			slaughtered much.

					MIKE
				(not getting any humor)
			Well, most guys don't. I mean that's the
			point. You all mind if I take my vitamins?

					MRS. WILLIAMS
			No, Mike. but there are vitamins in the
			food, you know.

Everyone laughs.

					MIKE
			Yeah, but I gotta supplement that. I gotta
			take a bunch of zinc too. The body is like
			a machine. EVERYTHING has got to stay in 
			perfect tune for perfect health. That's 
			what I'm interested in.

Sandy looks at Mike.

					MIKE
			Oh yeah. and a few other things.

Everyone laughs again.

					SANDY
			We've got some Heinekens.

					DETECTIVE WILLIAMS
			Yeah. I like Bud myself.

					SANDY
			I'll get it. Mike, whatiya want?

					MIKE
			I guess another glass of water.

Sandy and Jeffrey share a look.

									DISSOLVE TO:

124. INT. WILLIAMS' BASEMENT - NIGHT

Mike and Sandy are sitting on a couch in the basement.  Jeffrey is sitting
on a chair nearby.  The television set is on.

					MRS. WILLIAMS
				    (calling downstairs)
			Who wants dessert? It's blueberry pie. and
			ice cream.

Jeffrey and Sandy say "yes."

					MIKE
			None for me, thanks.

Jeffrey looks over at Sandy.  Mike sees this.  There is more tension 
growing.

					MIKE
				 (referring to T.V.)
			What are watchin' this junk for?

					SANDY
			You can change it if you want to.

					MIKE
			I don't know why we have to watch T.V.

					SANDY
			Mike. We don't have to watch it. Come
			on.

Mrs. Williams comes downstairs carrying a tray with dessert.

					MRS. WILLIAMS
			Here you are. Would anyone like coffee?

					JEFFREY
			That sounds great!

					MRS. WILLIAMS
			Anyone else?. Alright Jeffrey, just a 
			minute.

Mrs. Williams goes back upstairs.  Jeffrey and Sandy start eating their 
dessert.  Sandy watches Jeffrey happily wolf down his pie.  Mike stands up.

					MIKE
			I'll be right back.

He leaves as if he's going to go upstairs.  Once around the corner he 
stops and listens to see what Jeffery and Sandy will say to one another.

					SANDY
			Well, how did it go?. What happened?

					JEFFREY
			Well. I've found out some things.
			nothing really for certain. There are some
			strange people involved.

					SANDY
			What did you see?

					JEFFREY
			Well.
			  (looking around, feeling funny)
			Maybe we should discuss this somewhere
			else. you know what I mean?

Just then, Mrs. Williams starts down with the coffee for Jeffrey.  
She sees Mike at the bottom of the stairs.  This seems strange to her.

					MRS. WILLIAMS
			Mike?. Are you alright?

Mike starts upstairs.

					MIKE
				   (mumbling)
			Yes.

Downstairs, Jeffrey and Sandy hear that Mike was close by.  Mrs. Williams 
and Mike pass on the stairs and Mrs. Williams enters the basement.  She 
throws Sandy a concerned look.  Just then, Mike calls downstairs.


					MIKE
			Sandy?. Could I talk to you a minute?

					SANDY
				   (calling up)
			Sure. just a sec.
				   (to Jeffrey)
			Excuse me.

125. INT. WILLIAMS' LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Upstairs, Mike is by the front door.

					MIKE
			Come on out a minute, okay?

					SANDY
			Okay.

They leave.

125A. INT. WILLIAMS' BASEMENT - NIGHT

Downstairs Mrs. Williams picks up some dishes.

					MRS. WILLIAMS
			Please excuse me a moment, Jeffrey, and I'll
			get to the dishes.

					JEFFREY
			Sure thing. please don't worry about me.
			Can I help you with the dishes?

					MRS. WILLIAMS
			Nice of you to offer, Jeffrey, but certainly
			not. just relax and enjoy your coffee.
			I'm sure Sandy will be back soon.

Detective Williams comes to the top of the stairs and calls down.

					DETECTIVE WILLIAMS
			Jeffrey?

					JEFFREY
			Yes?

					DETECTIVE WILLIAMS
			If you want to come up a minute, I'll show
			you some pictures.

126. INT. DETECTIVE WILLIAMS' STUDY - NIGHT

Jeffrey enters Detective Williams' study.

					DETECTIVE WILLIAMS
					   (continuing)
			Take a look at these. These are the photos
			of the vacant lot where you found the ear.
			You might find them interesting.


Jeffrey begins going through the pictures.  They are 8 X 10 black and 
white prints.  Mostly they are pictures of weeds, but they look quite 
beautiful in an abstract way.  As he goes through them.

					JEFFREY
			These are beautiful. How's the case 
			coming?

					DETECTIVE WILLIAMS
			Okay.

					JEFFREY
			Anything you can tell me?

					DETECTIVE WILLIAMS
			The criminals are winning.

					JEFFREY
			Is that why you say it's horrible?

					DETECTIVE WILLIAMS
			Yes.

					JEFFREY
			I guess you've seen some bad things.

					DETECTIVE WILLIAMS
			Yes I have - so bad I wouldn't poison
			your mind by telling you.

					JEFFREY
			Why do you do it?

					DETECTIVE WILLIAMS
			I won't let the bastards get me up against 
			the wall. It's an act of defiance.

					JEFFREY
			Yeah. I get it.

Suddenly Jeffrey sees something in the black and white photos.  A piece 
of cloth in the grass.  Carefully he asks.

					JEFFREY
			What is this? What color is it?

					DETECTIVE WILLIAMS
				     (leaning over to see)
			Blue. It's Blue Velvet.

Sandy comes into her father's study looking upset.  Detective Williams 
puts the photos away.

					SANDY
			Can I use the car for a while?

					DETECTIVE WILLIAMS
			Sure. What's up?

					SANDY
			I want to buy Jeffrey a Dairy Queen.

					JEFFREY
			A Dairy Queen?
				(he holds his stomach)
			Oh yeah? Sure, that sounds great.

									CUT TO:

127. INT. WILLIAMS CAR/NEIGHBORHOOD STREET - NIGHT

Jeffrey gets in and Sandy starts the car.  She pulls out.  They drive away.

					JEFFREY
			What's with Mike?

					SANDY
			He got a little jealous.

					JEFFREY
			I'm sorry, I didn't.

					SANDY
			It's okay. Don't worry about it.

The car glides along.

Jeffrey and Sandy smile at one another.  They drive on.

					SANDY
			You want a Dairy Queen?

					JEFFREY
			No way. I'm about to blow up.

128. INT. WILLIAMS CAR/CHURCH - NIGHT

Sandy laughs as she pulls the car curbside in a quiet street by a church.
The church pipe-organ music drifts softly into the night.

					SANDY
			You want to tell me about it?

					JEFFREY
			. OK. It's a strange world, Sandy.
			this is what I have found out. What I 
			think I have found out. Dorothy Vallens
			is married to a man named Don. they have
			a son. I think the son and the husband
			have been kidnapped by a man named 
			Frank who has now cut off both of Don's 
			ears. I think he is holding them to make 
			her do things for him. I think she wants 
			to die. the ears were for her a warning 
			to stay alive. there is another man 
			involved. I call him the "yellow man".
			you saw his back the other day in the hall 
			at her door. I don't know what he does but 
			I think he's on drugs supplied by Frank. 
			Frank is a very dangerous man.

					SANDY
				    (quietly)
			Wow. Should you tell my father?

					JEFFREY
			I don't see how I can. and I can't prove
			any of this. I got all this information
			illegally. also it could get you in
			trouble.

					SANDY
			You saw a lot in one night.

					JEFFREY
			. Actually. I've been in twice.

					SANDY
				     (uneasy)
			Twice. without her sensing anything?

					JEFFREY
					(lying)
			Yes.

					SANDY
				    (pausing)
			Did you see her undressed?

					JEFFREY
			Yeah. I mean. a little, . you know.

					SANDY
			Yeah?

					JEFFREY
			    (a searching, slight smile)
			That doesn't bother you, does it?

					SANDY
			Who, me? Why should it?

					JEFFREY
			     (seeing some jealousy and 
            		and happy for it)
			That's what I thought.

					SANDY
			You're sure right. It is a strange world.

					JEFFREY
			Why are there people like Frank. Why is
			there so much trouble in this world.?


					SANDY
			I don't know. I had a dream. in fact. the
			night I met you.
				(she reflects silently on 
                         this before proceeding)
			. in the dream the world was dark because
			there weren't any robins. you know, birds.
			robins stood for love. and all of a sudden
			thousands of robins flew down and brought
			this blinding light of love. and it felt
			like that love would be the only thing that
			would make any difference. I guess. until
			the robins come there is trouble.

					JEFFREY
			Yeah I guess so.
			       (he turns to her)
			You're a neat girl.

					SANDY
			So are you.
				     (laughs)
			I mean you're a neat guy. We better
			get back.

					JEFFREY
			I guess so. you want to help me watch
			Frank?. I'm going to stake out Frank's
			place tomorrow. with a camera.

Sandy starts the car and pulls out into the street.  They begin driving 
back.

129. INT. WILLIAMS CAR/NEIGHBORHOOD STREET - NIGHT

					SANDY
			No, silly - I'm still in school you know.
			but I'll meet you after school and you 
			can tell me what you've learned. You better
			be careful, Jeffrey.

					JEFFREY
			I will.  I'll pick you up on the same 
			corner at three thirty-five, okay?

They pull up in front of Jeffrey's house.

					SANDY
			Okay. be careful.

					JEFFREY
			Okay, Sandy.

130. EXT. BEAUMONTS' HOME - NIGHT

Jeffrey gets out of the car.  He goes around to her side and looks down 
at her in the car.  She looks very beautiful.  He stands there for a 
moment.

					JEFFREY
			Can I give you a kiss good night?

					SANDY
				(pauses, trembling)
			You better not, Jeffrey.

					JEFFREY
			Okay. okay.

					SANDY
			Goodnight.

					JEFFREY
			See ya tomorrow.

Sandy slowly drives off.  Jeffrey watches her go then turns and goes 
inside his house.

131. INT. BEAUMONTS' LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

The house is very dark and quiet.  Jeffrey finds a note by the one table 
light is on.  The note is from his mother.  It reads, "Jeffrey hope you 
enjoyed yourself. See you at breakfast. Love Mom."  A postscript is written
on the note by Aunt Barbara.  "Jeffrey, honey, I found these. Love, Aunt 
Barbara."  Jeffrey sees that Aunt Barbara has left him two dead termites.  
He picks one up and studies it.  Again we see a huge CLOSEUP of a termite 
in the half-light.  Jeffrey shakes his head in amusement.

132. INT. JEFFREY'S ROOM - NIGHT

Jeffrey paces nervously.  He picks up the phone and mouthing the numbers 
he dials Dorothy's number.  There is a "click" but no one speaks.  
Jeffrey instinctively speaks.

					JEFFREY
			Hello?

					FRANK (telephone V.O.)
			Speak to me Fucker.

Jeffrey hangs up immediately.  He's scared.

					JEFFREY
				   (to himself)
			Stupid!! So stupid. now she might be in
			even more trouble with Frank. I hope not.
			I hope not. tomorrow I have to find out
			more about Frank.

133. INT. BEAUMONTS' CAR/FRONT STREET - DAY

Jeffrey has a camera taped and rigged to the dashboard aimed at the front 
door of Frank Booth's apartment building.  The camera is covered with a 
cardboard shoe box.  Jeffrey is eating a sandwich which was 
wrapped in wax paper and is waiting and watching.

A LADY steps out of the building and begins walking down the steps.  
Jeffrey reaches over and removes the shoe box and quickly takes two 
pictures.


We see a MAN walk down the street and turn up the steps.  Jeffrey shoots, 
but really only gets the back of the man.

JEFFREY
			Damn!

He replaces the cardboard box and continues eating.

									DISSOLVE TO:

134. INT. BEAUMONTS' CAR/FRONT STREET - DAY

Later in the day.  Jeffrey sits waiting.  He looks at his watch.  It says 
2:00.

As he looks up he sees Frank getting out of a car with another man. the 
Yellow Man.  They head for Frank's building.  Jeffrey hurriedly removes 
the shoe box and begins snapping pictures.  They mount the steps and 
disappear within the old dark structure.

					JEFFREY
			Wow.

									DISSOLVE TO:

135. INT. BEAUMONTS' CAR/FRONT STREET - DAY

Jeffrey's watch - the hand - time lapses around to 3:00.

					JEFFREY
			     (out loud to himself)
			Fifteen more minutes.

Just then, he sees movement and takes the box off the camera.  He starts 
shooting as TWO MEN come out the door.  It is the Yellow Man and a man who
is very well dressed with wavy hair and a mustache.  He carries an 
alligator-skin briefcase FRANK HAS DISAPPEARED.  Both are talking together 
and now laughing.  Jeffrey takes five or six pictures and then tries to 
cover the camera as they approach.  The box falls.  The Yellow Man looks, 
but Jeffrey gets the box back in time and pretends to be looking in the 
glove compartment.

The two men walk right by Jeffrey and get into the car behind his.  
Jeffrey decides to follow them.  He waits a few seconds and starts off.

136. EXT. CITY STREET - DAY

They drive through town.

137. FACTORY BUILDING - DAY

. to a large factory building, park and go up a flight of metal stairs on the side of the building.  Jeffrey steps into the shadows and watches them.  At a metal landing they stop.  He sees them standing on their tip toes in order to see something in the distance.  The man with the alligator briefcase is laughing with the Yellow Man at what he sees.  He grips the Yellow Man on the shoulder.  Jeffrey cannot see what they see from his vintage point.  He looks at his watch. "3:25".

					JEFFREY
			You gotta wait for me Sandy. I'm on a real roll.

He quickly takes a picture of the two of them on the staircase.

138. EXT. ALLEY - DAY

. then he goes down an alley in the direction they were looking.  At the 
end of the alley he turns left and stops short.

139. EXT. COLD STORAGE COMPANY - DAY

He sees a crowd of people, an ambulance, and two police cars.  He walks 
closer.  Through the crowd he sees a broken window.  Hanging in the window
is a dead man.  Blood is dripping out of a huge wound to the head.

On the sidewalk in front of the building a woman is lying in shock.  
Her legs have been brutally broken and are angled back toward her head 
in horrible positions.  Jeffrey stands next to two black guys.  Suddenly 
one of the police officers start pushing everyone away.  Jeffrey turns to 
them.

					JEFFREY
			What happened?

					GUY #1
			He was blown away man. can't you see?

					GUY #2
			That cracker was the biggest dealer in 
			this section of the city, brother. the
			police are going to find more drugs in
			there than you can believe. It's a 
			speedball heaven in there.

					JEFFREY
			Oh yeah? What about the woman?

					GUY #1
			Probably just a whore he happened to be
			with at the time.

					JEFFREY
			Man oh brother.

					GUY #1
			This is the way the world is my man. take
			a good look.

Jeffrey takes a last look before checking his watch and hurrying off.

									CUT TO:

140. EXT. CENTRAL HIGH SCHOOL - DAY

Jeffrey drives up to the corner where Sandy is standing.  She is 
frantically looking around.  Jeffrey stops for her.

					SANDY
			    (looking beyond the car)
			GO ON!!!. GO!

Jeffrey looks around.  A big FOOTBALL PLAYER is running up to a chain 
link fence across the street, but it's too late - Mike sees Jeffrey.  
Everything stops for a moment.  Then, Mike runs off.

					SANDY
			Oh great.

141. INT. BEAUMONTS' CAR/CENTRAL HIGH SCHOOL - DAY

Sandy goes around and gets in the car.

					SANDY
				   (continuing)
			You were late.

					JEFFREY
			I'm really sorry.

					SANDY
			What am I going to do?

					JEFFREY
			You want to go talk to him?

					SANDY
			Yeah, but. I don't think it's going to do
			much good. Let's go. I'll try to talk to 
			him later.

									CUT TO:

142. INT. DINER - DAY

Jeffrey and Sandy are sitting in the diner in a different booth, but 
having the same things as before.

					SANDY
			You know, that cheese is practically
			all chemicals.

					JEFFREY
			That's what makes it so good. You wanta
			hear what I saw today?

					SANDY
			Shoot.

					JEFFREY
			Number one. I saw the Yellow Man go into 
			Frank's building, laughing with Frank.
			Now. the only trouble is. what does this
			prove?

					SANDY
				    (thinking)
			Nothing really, but it's interesting.
			they know each other. they seem to like
			each other.



					JEFFREY
			Maybe. But I think the Yellow Man is on 
			drugs. I think Frank supplies him.

					SANDY
			Oh yeah?

					JEFFREY
			Number two. I saw the Yellow Man come out.
			This time with a well-dressed man with an
			alligator briefcase. They drove down this
			factory building and stood on a staircase
			looking at something in the distance. 
			Number three. now get this. In the distance
			was a murder. a drug dealer shot to death
			and a woman with her legs broken.

					SANDY
			Jeffrey!!

					JEFFREY
			Then these guys told me the police will
			find a huge amount of drugs inside the 
			dead man's place.

					SANDY
			I can't believe what you are finding out.
			Are you going to continue with this. Are
			you going back to her apartment?

					JEFFREY
			Yeah.

					SANDY
			Jeffrey?. Why?

					JEFFREY
			I'm seeing something that was always hidden.
			I'm involved in a mystery. I'm learning.
			and it's all secret.

					SANDY
			You like mysteries that much?

					JEFFREY
			Yeah. you're a mystery. I like you.
			very much.

Jeffrey stands up and moves to her side of the booth.  They stare at each 
other.

					SANDY
			Oh yeah?

Jeffrey leans over and kisses her gently.  She pulls away.

					SANDY
			Don't. please, Jeffrey.

Jeffrey looks at her for a moment.

					JEFFREY
			You worry about me really?

					SANDY
			Yes. is that so surprising?. Yeah I
			worry. a lot. I got you into this.

									CUT TO:

143. INT. STAIRWAY - APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT

Jeffrey winds his way up the staircase of Dorothy's apartment building.  
He hesitates before crossing to Dorothy's door.  He knocks on the door and 
Dorothy opens it.

					DOROTHY
			Come in.

					JEFFREY
			Hello.

144. INT. DOROTHY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Dorothy closes the door.  She chains it.

They kiss.  The kiss gets hotter.  The feeling begins.

They move down the hall to the back bedroom.  They've never made love 
there.  As they hurriedly undress Jeffrey sees the pointed child's hat 
with the propeller.  He picks it up and spins the propeller.  It makes a 
bit of music.  Dorothy shrieks as she lurches toward Jeffrey grabbing his 
hand, stopping him from turning the tiny propeller.  She gains some 
control of herself.  Jeffrey releases the hat into her hand.

					DOROTHY
			It used to make me laugh .but.

					JEFFREY
			I'm sorry .maybe I better go Dorothy.

					DOROTHY
			Yes. Frank-

					JEFFREY
			Frank is coming?

					DOROTHY
			No. how could he?. Don't go. You think
			I'm crazy, don't you? I want you to stay.
					(crying)
			. don't hate me.

					JEFFREY
				   (very nervous)
			I sure don't hate you.

					DOROTHY
			I'm not crazy.
				     (thinking)
			I know the difference between right 
			and wrong.

					JEFFREY
			That's good.

Jeffrey moves to get out of bed.

					DOROTHY
				    (she poses)
			Do you like my body?

					JEFFREY
			Sure I do.

She moves closer to him, towards his back touching it with her tongue.  
She gets down in a pose and holds it.

					DOROTHY
			I'm a statue. you can feel me.you
			can do anything you want.

Jeffrey's hands find her flesh and move about.

									DISSOLVE TO:

Jeffrey and Dorothy are making love in her bed in almost total darkness.

					DOROTHY
				     (dreamily)
			What do you want to do?

					JEFFREY
			I'm doing it.

					DOROTHY
			Are you a bad boy?

					JEFFREY
			Whatiya mean?

					DOROTHY
			Do you want to do bad things?
				   (very dreamy)
			Anything. anything.

					JEFFREY
				  (whispering hot)
			What do you want?

					DOROTHY
			I want you to hurt me.

					JEFFREY
			No. I told you. I don't want to hurt you.
			I want to help you. I think I know some of
			what is happening to you. 
				  (she doesn't react)
			. Dorothy? Frank has your husband and son.
			Dorothy? Doesn't he? You have to do 
			something Dorothy. go to the police.


					DOROTHY
			No police!!!.
			 (pushing herself back against
			  the headboard; then frantic)
			No police!!

Suddenly, Dorothy gets very odd.  She turns into a little girl.  She has
a frightening little girl smile.

					DOROTHY
			You like to open me. don't you?

					JEFFREY
			Yes.

					DOROTHY
				(thinking with a grin)
			What if I told Frank that you opened me?

For just one quiet moment we see the stairway to Dorothy's apartment.  
It is empty.  Then back to Jeffrey and Dorothy.

					JEFFREY
			That wouldn't be too good, would it?

					DOROTHY
			Frank would open you.

					JEFFREY
			Okay. I know you've been scared. now you
			want to scare someone.

					DOROTHY
			    (smiles very strangely)
			Does that scare you?

					JEFFREY
			Shut up.

					DOROTHY
			Beeeee careful.

					JEFFREY
				  (scared and mad)
			Come on Dorothy.

					DOROTHY
			What if Frank came over here and found us?

The curtains in the kitchen bellow out with an eerie gust of wind.

					JEFFREY
			Look, snap out of it, will ya?

					DOROTHY
			Kiss me.

They kiss.



					DOROTHY
				    (continuing)
			Do you love me?

					JEFFREY
			Do you love me?

					DOROTHY
			I asked first.

					JEFFREY
			Sometimes I think I do.

					DOROTHY
			And sometimes you think you don't?! Well,
			get away then!

She bolts up.

					JEFFREY
			Wait a minute. Wait. Whatiya want? For
			cryin' out loud!

					DOROTHY
			Just get outta my bed.

She hits out at Jeffrey and strikes him in the face.  Jeffrey struggles 
with her to keep her from hitting him again but she breaks loose and slams
out at his face again.  He pushes back hard and her head actually hits the
wall.  She smiles through the pain.

					JEFFREY
			Oh God. are you alright.

She falls on him and smothers him with kisses.

					DOROTHY
			See. see how you hurt me? Now. Open
			me. enter me.

Jeffrey moves on top of her in the darkness.

We move very close to Jeffrey's ear as Dorothy's lips come up and whisper
into it.

					DOROTHY
			I love you Don with all my heart.

					JEFFREY
			No. it's not Don.

But he can't stop himself or her from making love.

					DOROTHY
			Come inside me. Oh yes, oh yes, oh yes.
				   (very frantic)
			Oh yes, oh yes, oh yes.

The movement subsides.  There is silence in the room, except for breathing.

					JEFFREY
			I didn't mean to hurt you.

					DOROTHY
			Shhhhhh. Now I have your disease.

					JEFFREY
			You. what?

					DOROTHY
			You put your disease in me. your semen.
			it's hot and full of disease.

					JEFFREY
			There's no disease, I can tell you.

					DOROTHY
			Men are crazy. then they put their
			craziness into me. then it makes me
			crazy. then they aren't so crazy for
			awhile. then they put their craziness
			in me again.
				  (starts crying)
			. it's burning me. but I love you. I
			do, I do. Did you know that? Did you
			know that I love you?

					JEFFREY
				 (very apprehensive)
			I'm glad you do.

					DOROTHY
			There's so much I want to tell you. I'm in
			so much darkness though with things moving.
			there is darkness sucking me. It's kissing
			me and darkness is entering me. in every
			hole. It's opening me to a death.

					JEFFREY
			Dorothy. no!

					DOROTHY
				    (whispering)
			If I die, then they'll be free. It's 
			getting late, isn't it? I can tell. it's
			a cold feeling when it's late. It's warm
			then it gets cold. Jeffrey. I feel it 
			getting cold.

					JEFFREY
			You called me Jeffrey.

					DOROTHY
			I did. are you?

					JEFFREY
			Yes.

					DOROTHY
			Why are you here?
				(Jeffrey gets on top 
   				 of her again)
			Hmmmmmmmm!!!! Ok.

					JEFFREY
			No. not really.
			     (they kiss - very hot)
			but also because I really want you 
			to be alright.

Dorothy stops and looks at him - she holds his face.  She starts to cry.

					DOROTHY
			You do .you really do.

She continues holding his face - looking in his eyes crying openly.  
he pulls him down to her.

					DOROTHY
			Jeffrey. Jeffrey. Jeffrey.

Jeffrey smiles.

					JEFFREY
			I guess I should go.

					DOROTHY
			I want you to stay with me.

					JEFFREY
			I think I better go.

146. INT. DOROTHY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Later.  Jeffrey is dressed and Dorothy comes out of the bathroom in her 
robe.  She is combing her hair.  One or two lights are on now.  She looks 
at Jeffrey and smiles, brushes some of his hair back from his face.

					DOROTHY
			You're my special friend, aren't you?
				     (whispers)
			I have you inside of me still.
				     (big smile)
			It helps me. I need you.

Jeffrey doesn't know what to say.  He starts walking toward the door with 
Dorothy beside him.

					JEFFREY
					(lying)
			I'll call you.

					DOROTHY
			Okay. soon? Do you think I'm too fat?

					JEFFREY
			What?

					DOROTHY
			I'm getting a little bit fat. I hate that.

					JEFFREY
			You look beautiful to me.

She pats her hips.

					DOROTHY
			Right in here. fat, fat, fat.

Dorothy takes the chain off the door and opens it.  The hall is empty.  
There is some noise on the stairs.  Suddenly, Frank and TWO FRIENDS of 
his come into view on the stairway.

					JEFFREY
				    (to Dorothy)
			Oh no.

					DOROTHY
			    (her eyes glaze over -
        		     she's gone again)
			No. 
				(calling out to Frank)
			Hi baby.

					FRANK
			Who's this fuck?

					DOROTHY
			He's a friend. from the neighborhood.
			we were just talking.

					FRANK
				   (to Jeffrey)
			From the neighborhood?
				     (slowly)
			Shut the fuck up.
				   (to Jeffrey)
			You like telephones? Huh?. You wanta go
			for a ride?

					JEFFREY
			No thanks.

					FRANK
			No thanks. what does that mean?

					JEFFREY
				 (very carefully)
			I don't want to go.

					FRANK
			Go where?

					JEFFREY
			On a ride.

					FRANK
			A ride?. Hell, that's a good idea. okay,
			let's go. Hey, let's go.

Frank grabs Jeffrey and pulls him along.

					FRANK
			     (continuing to Dorothy)
			Come on. We're goin' for a joy ride.

147. INT. STAIRWAY - APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT

Frank takes Jeffrey on a wide-eyed terror walk down the stairway.

									CUT TO:

148. INT. FRANK'S CAR/CITY STREETS - NIGHT

Frank and Dorothy are in the front seat.  Jeffrey is sandwiched between 
two very dirty strange guys in the back.  Frank is driving very fast and 
very crazy.  Sitting next to him on the front seat is a police radio which 
periodically blares out police reports.  At the lights, when they turn 
green, Frank lays rubber.

					FRANK
			Where you wanna go? I know!. We gotta see
			Ben. We gotta, right?

					PAUL
				   (laughing)
			Yeah. we gotta see Ben. 

The car roars through a seedy street lined with bars and clubs.  Liquor 
and sex shop signs glow in hot neon colors.  They are blurred visions 
because of the speed of Frank's car.

Driving music plays.
Frank careens dangerously down various narrow streets, just barely making
turns.  The Ford bounces off several curbs.  Dorothy occasionally steals 
a glance back at Jeffrey.  She squeals out loud - sometimes with glee, 
mostly in fear.

Raymond and Paul laugh with Frank, yell out or light cigarettes.

149. EXT. "BARBARY COAST" - NIGHT

Frank finally gets to where he's going - a corner bar - and skids to a 
hault.  They all pile out.  Frank grabs Jeffrey.

					FRANK
			Come on. I wancha to meet a frienda mine.
			Raymond, get enough beer for Ben too.

					RAYMOND
			Okay Frank.

					FRANK
				   (to Jeffrey)
			What kinda beer do you like?

					JEFFREY
				   (just says it)
			Heineken.

					FRANK
			FUCK THAT SHIT. PABST BLUE RIBBON!!!

He grabs Jeffrey and pushes him into the bar.

150. INT. "BARBARY COAST" - NIGHT

Moving fast now, they go through this dark frightening place.  Frank has 
Jeffrey by the neck forcing him faster.  In the back there is a black man 
fondling a white girl near a doorway.

151. INT. BACK ROOM - "BARBARY COAST" - NIGHT

They go through the door to a back room.  A few naked girls are there near
beds with curtains around them.  One girl lies on her bed with dried vomit
around her head and pillow.  Suddenly Frank spots his friend Willard.  
He runs toward him violently and grabs him by the throat.

					FRANK
			Hey shithead. that's the last time I get
			you high and watch you freak out - 
			motherfucker you tore my coat and I lost
			my lucky piece of blue velvet, man.

152. 	INT. DETECTIVE WILLIAMS' STUDY - NIGHT

			A big love letter.

Frank pushes him down on the bed with the dried vomit whore.  They leave 
Willard.

154. INT. STAIRS AND LANDING - BEN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

... and go up a flight of dirty wooden steps.  Frank bangs on a door at the 
first landing.  Raymond joins him with a case of Pabst Blue Ribbon Beer.

					FRANK
			Hey Ben. OPEN UP. It's Frank.

A tall, slender man with a smoking jacket and a mustache opens the door.  
It's BEN.  His voice is very horse from years of smoking.

					BEN
				(very gracious)
			Frank. Come in.

					FRANK
			Hey, I brought some friends. and some
			beer.

					BEN
			Fine. Welcome. Come sit down.

155. INT. BEN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

The apartment is very large.  All the furniture is over-stuffed.  In 
the room there is a very much over-weight WOMAN dressed in black and a 
greasy-looking COUPLE.  On the couch, a YOUNG WOMAN plays with a large 
doll.

					FRANK
			   (getting higher all the time)
			Suave. goddam are you suave, you fucker.
			You want some beer?

					BEN
				    (smiling)
			Certainly Frank.
				 (to the fat woman)
			Darling, get some glasses. We'll have 
			some beer with Frank. Won't you sit down?

Everyone kinds of mills around.  Paul sits down in a chair and starts 
laughing at some private joke in his head.

					FRANK
			Shit Ben! How the shit are ya?

					BEN
			Fine Frank. Fine. How are you?

					FRANK
			Fuckin' good, real fuckin' good. You know
			this little tid bit, Dorothy, and this thing,

			this beer's gonna get too warm. I can't stand
			fuckin' warm beer. it makes me puke.

					BEN
			Darling, where are the glasses?. Oh.
			here they are.

The Big Lady brings the glasses in and sets them on the card table.  
She looks worried.  She gives a helpless pleading look to Ben.

					FRANK
			Raymond! Where's the fuckin' beer?

					RAYMOND
			Right here Frank. You want me to pour it?

					FRANK
			No, I want ya to fuck it. Shit, yes.
			pour the fuckin' beer.

					RAYMOND
			There ya go.

					FRANK
			Good, let's drink up.

					BEN
			To your health, Frank.

					FRANK
			Shit. let's drink to something else.
			let's drink to fuckin'. Say here's 
			to your fuck Frank.

					BEN
			If you like Frank. Here's to your fuck.
			cheers.

Frank's friends, Paul and Raymod, laugh.

					FRANK
				  (laughs loud)
			Cheers. Suave man. you're so fuckin'
			suave. WE LOVE BEN! Here's to Ben!.

Frank slaps Jeffrey in the face.

					FRANK
			Hey neighbor. Here's to Ben.

					JEFFREY
			    (stunned, grabbing his face)
			Here's to Ben.

					FRANK
			Do you see, Ben?. I can make him do
			anything I fuckin' please.

Ben goes to Jeffrey.

					BEN
			Thank you neighbor. let me see your
			face. did he hurt you?

Jeffrey shows him.

					BEN
				  (continuing)
			Oh. my.

Suddenly Ben slugs Jeffrey in the stomach.  Jeffrey doubles over.

					BEN
				(continuing again)
			Is that any better?

Frank almost dies laughing.  Everyone else joins in.  Ben turns to Frank.

					BEN
			Frank, I have something for you. Excuse
			us everyone.

					FRANK
			EXCUSE US por favor! Hey. let Tits see
			her kid.

As Jeffrey tries to catch his breath, he sees tremendous emotion fill 
Dorothy's face.  She rushes forward.  Raymond grabs her by the arm and 
takes her into another room.  Jeffrey hears her crying out.  He hears a 
small boy.

					DOROTHY (V.O.)
			Donny, oh my Donny.

					DONNY (V.O.)
			Mommy!

155A. INT. BACK ROOM - BEN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Dorothy is sobbing and clinging to Donny.  He is crying and gripping her 
like a small monkey would grip its mother.  Suddenly Donny breaks away, 
screaming.

DONNY
			Mommy. You left me. you stopped loving me.

					FRANK
			  (coming back into Ben's living room)
			Okay. let's hit the fuckin' road. we're
			givin' our neighbor a joy ride. let's get
			on with it. Bye, Ben. Ya wanna go on a 
			joy ride with us, anyone? You?
				 (looking around)

Dorothy rejoins the group.  She's in a state of shock.  Frank pinches her
cheek.

					FRANK
				   (continuing)
			No smile for Frank? No? Okay, fuck it.
			Let's go. Oh you wanna come with Raymond?

Raymond has picked up the greasy girl.

					BEN
			See you Tuesday, Frank.

					FRANK
			Right Ben. LET'S GO FUCK. I'll fuck
			anything that moves.

156. EXT. "BARBARY COAST" - NIGHT

They leave and pile back into the car.

157. INT. FRANK'S CAR/CITY STREETS - NIGHT

Now there are four in the back.  Raymond starts necking with the Greasy 
Girl.  They speed on into the night.  Frank drives through various dark 
streets.

158. INT. FRANK'S CAR/HIGHWAY - NIGHT

. then out onto a highway and goes over 100 mph down a two-lane highway.

					FRANK
				   (to Jeffrey)
			Hey? . You like to walk.

					JEFFREY
			What?

					FRANK
			Let's take our neighbor out. Let him
			fuckin' walk back.
				     (laughs)

As Frank is driving Jeffrey sees Dorothy nervously look at the road and 
surrounding countryside, then questioningly at Frank.  She senses something
about where they are going.

					DOROTHY
			Where are we going, Frank?

					FRANK
			Hey. Tits. I'm taking your neighbor to 
			the country. maybe something for you too.

					DOROTHY
				   (very anxious)
			Frank?

					FRANK
			You want to see him too, right?

					DOROTHY
			Yes, but.

					FRANK
			Then, shut up!

Frank sees Dorothy look back at Jeffrey.


					FRANK
				   (continuing)
			Hey. What's this fuck got to do with
			anything.

159. INT. FRANK'S CAR/DIRT ROAD - NIGHT

Frank angrily swerves the car off onto a small dirt road bouncing down 
it, screeching to a halt near an orchard of trees.  He turns violently 
around to Jeffrey.

					FRANK
			What are you lookin' at?

					JEFFREY
			Nothing.

					FRANK
			   (locks eyes with Jeffrey; 
      		    long pause)
			Don't look at me, Fuck. I shoot when I see
			the whites of the eyes.
				(takes helium)
			You like me?.

Jeffrey is quiet.

					FRANK
				 (still high voice)
			Look at these. What are these?

					DOROTHY
			Come on, Frank. Let's go. Please.

Frank is doing something to Dorothy's chest but Jeffrey can't see.

					FRANK
			Don't say PLEASE, Fuckhead. WHAT ARE
			THESE?

					DOROTHY
			Those are my breasts.

					FRANK
			Can I feel 'em?

					DOROTHY
			If you want to.

Frank takes helium.

					FRANK
			Baby wants to pinch 'em.

She winces and tries to pull away.

					FRANK
				   (continuing)
			What's the matter? Give 'em back. They're
			just a little red, that's all. let me feel
			'em again. Come here.

Frank pulls her over and starts to pinch her again.  It really hurts her 
and she is frightened and in pain.

					JEFFREY
			Hey. leave her alone.

Frank pretends not to hear Jeffrey and pinches Dorothy's breasts real hard.
She stifles a scream.  Jeffrey gets mad.  He hits Frank hard in the face. 
Everyone is deadly silent as Frank turns to Jeffrey.  Frank stares at 
Jeffrey.

					FRANK
			NEXT! . out of the car fuck. HELP HIM
			OUT, RAYMOND!!

160. EXT. FRANK'S CAR/DIRT ROAD - NIGHT

Frank gets out and presses his face against the rear window.  His distorted
face is hideous.  He opens the back door.  Raymond and Paul grab Jeffrey 
and pull him out of the car.  The Greasy Girl laughs nervously.

					DOROTHY
			Frank. he didn't mean it. Leave him
			alone. come on. He didn't mean it.

					FRANK
			Shut up. Gimme your lipstick.
				    (takes gas)
			. Hey, pretty, pretty.

Dorothy doesn't move fast enough so Frank dumps her whole purse out on the
front seat and grabs the lipstick and a flashlight.  He puts lipstick 
heavy onto his lips.

While Raymond and Paul hold Jeffrey.  Frank kisses Jeffrey all over the 
mouth.  Jeffrey tries to hit Frank and pull away, but Raymond and Paul 
have a hold of him.  Jeffrey looks very strange with these big blotches 
of red lipstick on his face and mouth.

					DOROTHY
			LEAVE HIM ALONE!! FRANK!!

Frank slams the front door shut to muffle Dorothy.  He grabs Jeffrey and 
presses his frightened face against the front window.  Then, the back 
window.  Then, he flops Jeffrey up on the hood with Paul's help and presses
Jeffrey's face against the rear window.  Inside the car, this show is 
crazy and scary.  Then, Frank takes Jeffrey over to the side of the car 
again.

					FRANK
				   (to Jeffrey)
			You're fuckin' lucky to be alive.
			LOOK AT ME!

Raymond pulls Jeffrey's face back so he's looking at Frank.  Dorothy and 
the Greasy Girl watch in terror.



					FRANK
			Don't be a good neighbor to her or I'm 
			gonna send you a love letter. straight
			from my heart, fucker. You know what a 
			love letter is? It's a bullet. straight
			from my gun, fucker. Once you get a love
			letter from me, you're fucked forever.
			Understand, Fuck?

					JEFFREY
			Yes.

					FRANK
			I'll send you straight to hell, Fuck!

Frank takes a small square of blue velvet out of his pocket and begins 
feeling Jeffrey's face with it.

					FRANK
			 (continuing; breathing heavily)
			You feel good. feel my muscles.

Raymond makes Jeffrey raise his arm and Jeffrey feels Frank's biceps.

					FRANK
				  (continuing)
			You like that? 
                     (to Raymond and Paul)
			Hold him tight for me.

Suddenly Frank starts hitting Jeffrey in the face.  Dorothy screams at the
car window.

CUT TO BLACK:

161. 	EXT. DIRT ROAD - DAY

NO SOUND. THEN A MOAN.

JEFFREY'S P.O.V. of rocks on the ground.

He slowly picks up and looks around.  The car is gone.  He is swollen, 
bloody, and covered with lipstick.  His pants have been pulled down and 
"FUCK YOU" has been written with lipstick on his legs.

He struggles to his feet and pulls his pants up.  He fastens his belt 
and begins limping up the dirt road highway.

He rounds the corner and steps inside the office, when he stops short with
fear.  Detective Williams is not there, but sitting at a desk next to 
Detective Williams' desk is the Yellow Man.  Their eyes lock.

Jeffrey freezes.

					JEFFREY
			Excuse me.

Jeffrey turns away as quickly as possible and goes over to a water cooler
and gets a drink, keeping his back to the Yellow Man.  He shakes with 
fear.  He slowly turns around.  The Yellow Man is studying some papers on
his desk.

Again the Yellow Man looks up.  This time he is slightly suspicious and he
cooks his head.  Jeffrey cannot move.

Finally, Jeffrey is able to step away.  As he leaves the Yellow Man's line
of sight, Jeffrey catches the names on the door.

					DETECTIVES

									CUT TO:

179. EXT. WILLIAMS HOME - NIGHT

Jeffrey walks through the darkness, carrying the photos.  He stops in 
front of Detective Williams' house and hesitates.  Jeffrey's face has a 
troubled look.  He approaches the front door.

He hesitates again before finally knocking.  Detective Williams answers 
the door.  Sandy is in the background.  When she sees the look on Jeffrey's
face, she knows why he's there.

					DETECTIVE WILLIAMS
			Jeffrey! Come on in.

					JEFFREY
			Hi. Hi Sandy. I'm sorry to bother you,
			but I've got to talk to you.

					DETECTIVE WILLIAMS
			Okay. come on in. Looks like you had a 
			bad face lift.

					JEFFREY
			  (with a goofy smile to Sandy)
			Yeah.

180. INT. WILLIAMS' LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Sandy gives him a concerned look.  Jeffrey follows Detective Williams to 
his study.

181. INT. DETECTIVE WILLIAMS STUDY - NIGHT

He closes the door behind him.

					DETECTIVE WILLIAMS
			Okay?

					JEFFREY
			Okay. I gotta tell you. I've. discovered
			some things. .Anyway I have to show you
			some pictures and tell you some things 
			about them. The first picture is this.

He shows him the picture of Frank and studies Detective Williams' face as 
he sees it.



					JEFFREY
				    (continuing)
			This is Frank Booth. His address is on
			the back of the photo. He, in my opinion,
			is very sick and dangerous. This photo 
			here is of Frank with another man as they
			went into Frank's apartment.

Jeffrey casually hands the photo over and watches Detective Williams' face 
extra carefully.  Detective Williams doesn't flinch, yet his eyes slowly 
glide upwards to meet Jeffrey's.

					JEFFREY
				    (continuing)
			And that man came out with a third man - 
			this well-dressed guy. here's the photo.
			I think a girl named Dorothy Vallens is
			in trouble with these people. I think
			Frank has taken her husband and her son.

					JEFFREY
				    (continuing)
			I have no hard proof of any of this. Her
			address is also on the photos. I think
			these people are involved with drugs. and
			murder. I think Frank is killing drug
			dealers and.
			     (he decides not to tell Detective 
  				Williams everything)
			. and somehow Frank is getting all their
			drugs. I had to tell you I got slightly
			more involved in this than you wanted me
			to, but it's over now for sure. .I had to
			tell you about these things in case it 
			could help.

					DETECTIVE WILLIAMS
			Well now Jeffrey, how did you come to get
			so involved?

					JEFFREY
			I can't tell you the whole story. I. I
			took it upon myself. I can't say more.

					DETECTIVE WILLIAMS
			Is Sandy part of this?

					JEFFREY
			No. not at all.

					DETECTIVE WILLIAMS
				    (referring to the photos)
			Who knows you have these?

					JEFFREY
			Only you. and the photo lab.

					DETECTIVE WILLIAMS
			You're all through with this now?


					JEFFREY
			Yes sir. I sure am.

Detective Williams studies Jeffrey, then the photos.

					DETECTIVE WILLIAMS
			For now. Alright. you better be. And
			Sandy better not be involved with this,
			I can tell you. Be prepared to come in 
			for further interrogation on this later.

					JEFFREY
			Yes sir.

Jeffrey leaves the study.

182. INT. WILLIAMS' LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

In the living room, Jeffrey looks at Sandy.

					SANDY
			Everything okay?

					JEFFREY
			Yeah. I think so. I just had to tell him
			some of what I knew. Is Friday still on?

					SANDY
			You didn't tell him about me?

					JEFFREY
			No.

Detective Williams comes out of his study and sees the two of them talking.
He sees some nervousness.  Sandy quickly changes the subject.

					SANDY
			I should never had gotten you going on this.
				(changing, smiling)
			Yes Jeffrey. Friday's on!

					JEFFREY
			Okay. great!

186. EXT. WILLIAMS HOME - NIGHT

Jeffrey is driving over to Sandy's.

He has to park across the street because a police car is sitting in front
of the Williams' house.  Its lights are slowly revolving on top. The engine
idles. a Man is inside. his head down, studying some papers.

Jeffrey barely notices all this, as he heads for the door.

Mrs. Williams answers the door and Sandy is behind her in the dining room.

					MRS. WILLIAMS
			Hello, Jeffrey. Come in.

187. INT. WILLIAMS' LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Jeffrey enters and crosses the room to Sandy.

					JEFFREY
			You all set?

Detective Williams comes in arranging some papers which he begins placing
in a briefcase on the dining room table.  Just then a man comes up to the
door which is still open.  Jeffrey turns to see.  It is Detective 
T.R. Gordon, the Yellow Man.  All the color instantly drains from 
Jeffrey's face.

					YELLOW MAN
				    (yelling inside)
			Hey John - get a move on!!

Detective Williams turns.  He sees Detective Gordon.  He turns again.  He 
sees Jeffrey's expression.  Sandy hasn't seen it yet.

Detective Williams goes to Jeffrey.  He looks him straight in the eye.  He
also positions himself between Jeffrey and T.R. Gordon.

					DETECTIVE WILLIAMS
			Easy does it Jeffrey. Behave yourself.
			don't blow it.

Sandy becomes curious and moves over to Jeffrey and her father.  Jeffrey 
decides to trust Detective Williams.  The Yellow Man (T.R. Gordon) yells 
again.

					YELLOW MAN
			Come on John, get it in gear pal!

					DETECTIVE WILLIAMS
			So long Jeffrey. You two have a nice
			night, okay?


					JEFFREY
			Okay.

					SANDY
			What is it?

					JEFFREY
			Just some fatherly advice.

					DETECTIVE WILLIAMS
			That's right.

Jeffrey and Sandy head for the door.  The Yellow Man's and Jeffrey's eyes
meet once more.  The Yellow Man cocks his head. thinking.  No recognition.

					SANDY
				 (to her mother)
			Goodnight mom.
			     (to the Yellow Man)
			Goodnight Tom.

					T.R. GORDON-YELLOW MAN
			Goodnight, Sandy.

188. EXT. WILLIAMS HOME - NIGHT

They cross the yard to the car.  Jeffrey helps Sandy in, then goes around
and gets in himself.  They are both dressed very nicely.

Jeffrey starts the car and pulls out.

					SANDY
			What was that all about?

					JEFFREY
			Nothing. really! It's good to see you.

					SANDY
			It's good to see you.

					JEFFREY
			Where to?

					SANDY
			Just go over to Gelford and up to Vista.
			It's not far. Can you tell me any more
			about what you learned?

					JEFFREY
			I'd rather not talk about it. I'll tell
			you about it sometime.

					SANDY
			It's okay.

					JEFFREY
			... You look beautiful.

					SANDY
			Thank you. Whatiya say we just enjoy the 
			evening?

					JEFFREY
			I like that idea. that's a real good idea.

									CUT TO:

190. INT. PARTY BASEMENT - NIGHT

Jeffrey and Sandy go downstairs to a basement which is dark and crowded 
with kids dancing and talking.  Jeffrey and Sandy are holding hands.  
Jeffrey feels a little out of place.

A COUPLE OF GIRLS raise their eyebrows and give approving looks to Sandy.
The music is loud, fast dancing music.

					SANDY
			You want to dance?

					JEFFREY
			I can't dance fast.

					SANDY
			Really?

					JEFFREY
			Really. you want to dance with someone
			else?

					SANDY
			NO.

					JEFFREY
			Let's wait for some slow one.

					SANDY
			Just a minute.

Sandy leaves Jeffrey for a moment and Jeffrey watches her make her way 
through the crowd to a GIRL by the record player.  Sandy confers with the
girl.  Sandy comes back to Jeffrey.

					SANDY
			Don't worry. I took care of it. You
			want something to drink?

Just then, the music goes slow.

					JEFFREY
			You want to dance?

					SANDY
			Okay.

They begin to dance.  At first, further apart, then, they make the mistake
of looking in each other's eyes and they move very close together.  
They move around to another look.  Then they kiss.  They kiss for the 
entire rest of the song.  Between songs and during the entire next song.  
They finally, as they say, come up for air.

					SANDY
			I love you, Jeffrey.

They kiss again.  Then they dance and look at each other.  Then they hug
each other.  As they hug, Jeffrey closes his eyes.

					JEFFREY
		               (inner voice)
			I really do love you.

191. INT. PARTY BASEMENT - NIGHT

Later.  Jeffrey gives Sandy a little kiss while they're over by the cokes.  They're having a drink.  Sandy introduces Jeffrey to some of her friends.  She is very proud of him.  They are both very happy.  They look at each other and kiss again.

									DISSOLVE TO:

193. INT./EXT. PARTY HOUSE - NIGHT

Later.  The party is breaking up.  Kids are beginning to go upstairs and go out the front doors to their cars.  Jeffrey and Sandy are coming up stairs arm in arm.  They say goodnight to the PARENTS in the living room and leave through the front door.  They can't take their eyes off one another.  They are totally oblivious to the THREE GUYS in a car across the street.

As soon as Jeffrey gets Sandy and himself in his car, he starts it and moves off.  

194. INT. BEAUMONTS' CAR/NEIGHBORHOOD STREETS - NIGHT

The dark car comes to life with a loud low roar and peels out with a 
scream.  It follows Jeffrey and Sandy for a way, then it roars up behind 
them swaying back and forth, honking its horn and trying to ram Jeffrey's 
car in the rear.

Jeffrey looks frantically in the rear view mirror.  Sandy turns around in
fear.  Jeffrey guns his car and races down the street.

					SANDY
			Oh my God. What's wrong?

					JEFFREY
			Frank!!

He swerves around the corner.  Up ahead, a car is pulling out of a 
driveway.

					JEFFREY
                     (continuing; referring 
                      to the car ahead)
			Come on. MOVE IT!

Jeffrey swings hard around another corner and heads up a dark street, 
passing "Lincoln St."

					JEFFREY
			I can't outrun this guy.

He floors the car and flies down another street very fast.

					JEFFREY
			My father has a gun at home.

					SANDY
			No.

					JEFFREY
			Sandy. this guy is a killer!! I promise
			you.

Sandy turns back to take a look.  Jeffrey swerves the car again; he bangs
it off a curb as he rounds a corner.  A hub cap goes flying off rolling
noisily down the street.

					SANDY
			Try to get to my house. then my father
			can.

CLOSEUP ON JEFFREY

195. INT. WILLIAMS' LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

FLASHBACK

He remembers Detective Gordon, the Yellow Man, at Sandy's house.

196. INT. BEAUMONTS' CAR/NEIGHBORHOOD STREETS - NIGHT

					JEFFREY
			No!!

Jeffrey floors the car again. but the car behind him is fast and gains 
on him.  It swerves back and forth in the rear view mirror.  Now it 
swerves and roars up alongside Jeffrey's car.  Sandy screams.

					SANDY
			It's Mike! It's Mike!

Jeffrey looks over.  It is Mike.  Out of enormous sense of relief he 
starts laughing.  He slows instantly and so does Mike.

197. EXT. BEAUMONTS' HOME - NIGHT

He pulls slowly up in front of his house, his head back laughing.  Mike 
swerves his car in front of Jeffrey's and jumps out.

					MIKE
				(out of the car; very drunk)
			Hey come here, you stole my girl, you
			bastard. I'm gonna kick your ass, right
			in front of your stupid house.

					SANDY
			... Stop it Mike.


					MIKE
                           (to Sandy)
			You shut up. nobody's talkin' to you.
			Hey who's that Jeffrey? Your mother?

Everyone turns and looks.  Slowly out of the darkness comes a nude woman.  It is Dorothy.  She is totally in shock, bloody saliva is dripping from her mouth.  She is bloody, swollen and bruised all over.  She is totally different, drained of her sexuality.  She has been ravaged.

					JEFFREY
			Dorothy! ... Dorothy!

					SANDY
			Dorothy Vallens?

					JEFFREY
			Yes.

He jumps out of the car, gets a hold of her and helps her back.  Mike 
comes after him.

					MIKE
                        (going for Jeffrey)
			Hey, you ivy league shit. COME HERE!

					JEFFREY
	                  (pushing Mike off)
			Later Mike. I gotta take care of someone
			who's hurt here, in case you haven't 
			noticed.

					SANDY
			Mike, go home.

Mike's friends are dazed, watching Dorothy staggering beside Jeffrey.  
Mike steps back as Jeffrey puts Dorothy in the car.  Jeffrey stands back
up and glances at Mike.

					MIKE
                       (dull, very drunk)
			Hey, I'm sorry. Hey.

Jeffrey gets into the car.

					JEFFREY
			Yeah. okay, Mike.

Jeffrey shuts the door.  Dorothy is sandwiched between him and Sandy in 
the front seat.

					SANDY
			Take her to my house. My dad can get an
			ambulance faster than anyone. Do you have
			anything to put around her?

					JEFFREY
     				  (starts the car)
			No. Is Detective Gordon going to be at
			your house?

					SANDY
			Probably not. no. Why?

					JEFFREY
			OK. Let's get her over to your father's.

					SANDY
                   (looking quickly from 
                    Dorothy to Jeffrey)
			Right. Watch out for Mike, there.

Mike and his friends are getting in Mike's car.  Mike is trying to start 
the engine.  He does and clumsily throws the car in reverse.  He screeches
out and screeches to a stop.  Then he guns away forward and shoots crazily
down the road.

					JEFFREY
			Here we go.

They drive off.

198. INT. BEAUMONTS' CAR/NEIGHBORHOOD STREET - NIGHT

					DOROTHY
				   (looking over)
			Oh God. Jeffrey is that you?

Sandy looks at Jeffrey questioningly.

					JEFFREY
			Yeah, it's me.

Sandy is confused. how do they know each other?

			No.

					SANDY
			You better call him and get an ambulance

Dorothy is clinging to Jeffrey.  Mrs. Williams goes to call.

Sandy moves closer.  Jeffrey looks at Sandy and she returns the look.

					DOROTHY

She looks up at Mrs. Williams.

					DOROTHY
                            (continuing)
			I opened myself to him. He put his

She presses herself tight to Jeffrey.

					DOROTHY
                            (continuing)
			Tell me its okay. I opened myself to
			you. Okay, okay, okay, okay?

Mrs. Williams watches with confusion and worry for the hurt this is 
causing Sandy.  Sandy is crying now and turns away.

					JEFFREY
			Sandy? ...Sandy, please.

					MRS. WILLIAMS
			I'll get a coat for her. 

She leaves the room hurriedly.

Dorothy clings to Jeffrey.  Her eyes are turning a dull, milky white.  The
effect is horrifying.  She is in shock.

Sandy is still crying, while she moves back and watches Jeffrey.  Jeffrey
turns to look at Sandy.

			HELP HIM!! Promise me you'll help him!

Jeffrey arrives at Dorothy's apartment building and pays the driver.  
He gets out of the cab and looks around.  No police.  Quiet.  The 
building looks just the same standing there in the dark.  The dim lights 
in the front entrance.  Jeffrey moves up to the front doors and enters.  
No one.

			well, find him!!

210. INT. STAIRWAY - APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT

Jeffrey slowly climbs the stairs.  His shoes squashing the carpet make 
mall crushing sounds as he climbs higher into the building.

He arrives at the Seventh Floor and stops.  A high-pitched whine can be 
heard faintly.  It gets louder as Jeffrey crosses to Dorothy's apartment 
door.  He gets his key out and inserts it.  Turns it.  With a loud click 
the door swings open and the high whine becomes piercing.  He sees 
something and jumps back.

211. INT. DOROTHY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

It is Detective Gordon, the Yellow Man, standing in the center of the room.

FLASHBACK

He plays the look into the apartment again in his mind and again.

CLOSER ON DETECTIVE GORDON

Something is wrong with him.  He is bleeding from the head.  He stands 
almost motionless. in shock.

Jeffrey peers into the room again.  He enters carefully and lets the door 
close behind him.  He very cautiously moves forward into the room.  Slowly
he moves closer to a hideous sight.  Standing in the middle of Dorothy's 
apartment is T.R. Gordon, the Yellow Man.  He is in an extreme state of 
shock.  He is bleeding badly from a huge wound at the top left of his head.  His eyes focused on something only his twisted inner mind see.  Sitting in one of Dorothy's chairs is a dead man with no ears. only half-healed bloody wounds at each side of his head.  A bullet hole in the center of his forehead.  The T.V. is crushed in but it is turned on and it is the television that produces the high electrical whine.  Jeffrey moves forward again and kicks the television cord out of the wall.  The high whine stops instantly.  Silence except for the Yellow Man's labored breathing.

Suddenly there is a loud "radio voice" coming from the Yellow Man's police
radio which is turned "on" in his jacket pocket.  Jeffrey's heart leaps 
and just as suddenly the Yellow Man throws his arms out wildly knocking a 
floor lamp to the ground and crushing out its light.  Jeffrey's heart goes
wild at this sight and he jumps back but the Yellow Man is silent and 
motionless again.  The radio talks again.

					RADIO VOICE #1
			Get back and stay down.

					RADIO VOICE #2
			. It's apartment eight.

Music. LOVE LETTERS STRAIGHT FROM MY HEART. begins to play.  
Jeffrey watches the Yellow Man and listens to the radio.

					RADIO VOICE #2
					 (continuing)
			I'm sending Jack and Pete to the roof.
			It's.

					RADIO VOICE #1
			Hey.

Sounds of shots.

					RADIO VOICE #1
					 (continuing)
			He's shooting. from the second window.

					RADIO VOICE #3
			Stay in place.

					RADIO VOICE #2
			Jack. get up there quick. can return
			fire?.

			I think he's alone. but return fire to

Many shots.

We see Jeffrey's face in CLOSEUP.

									CUT TO:

212. EXT. FRONT STREET - NIGHT

The real scene is before us.  Police cars line the street along with a 
huge fire truck and several ambulances.  Special police marksmen are 
crouched behind cars and behind a stone wall opposite Frank's building.  
Screams are heard from within and police radios blare.  Shots are being 
fired into a black window.  Once in a while a shot is returned.  Two 
policeman are dead and one is being loaded onto an ambulance.

					POLICEMAN #1
			He hasn't fired a shot for six minutes.
			maybe we got him. get on the radio. get
			Detective Williams. ask him if we can
			rush the son of a bitch.

A policeman runs off. more shots are fired into the building but none 
are returned.  The policeman comes running back.

					POLICEMAN #2
			It's in the works already. we're in 
			there. they're goin' down the back stairs 
			now. It won't be long. and they'll have
			us rush 'em from here. one whistle and
			we go.

Suddenly there is a long barrage of gunfire into Frank's apartment.  
Then a loud whistle.

					POLICEMAN #1
			That's it. let's go.

Police race across the street to Frank's building.

213. INT. FRANK'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Police kick the door in and rush into the apartment.  It's empty excpt for
a large dog which has been shot.  The dog growls and cowers back in a 
corner.  Every now and then it limps on bloody legs back and forth.

214. INT. DOROTHY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Jeffrey hears the radio.  He hears the policemen talking at Frank's place.  He hears that Frank is gone.  He decides to leave Dorothy's apartment.

					JEFFREY
			 (speaking to T.R. Gordon who doesn't
			  hear him because he's almost dead)
			I'm leaving now. I'll let them find you
			all on their own. find all this horror
			on their own.
				     (whispers)
			Good bye.

He goes out and closes the door.

215. INT. STAIRWAY - APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT

The door clicks shut.  He makes his way quietly down the hall to the 
stairway. thinking.  He starts down the stairs.

					JEFFREY
			So. Frank escaped.

He rounds the corner on a landing on the stairway and goes down another 
floor. and another.  At the next landing, something out the window catches
his eye.  He notices a man get out of the car.  He recognizes the man.  
It is the well-dressed man he saw with the alligator briefcase.  Jeffrey 
watches the man come toward Dorothy's building.  Then his eye goes back 
to the man's car.  It is Frank's car.  He notices the man is carrying a 
police radio.

					JEFFREY
				    (to himself)
			Frank's car. Is this man a cop? He has a 
			radio!. So did Frank though and he's no
			cop. that's for sure. and he's driving 
			Frank's car. who is he?

The man enters the building at the front entrance directly below Jeffrey.

Jeffrey starts climbing back up the stairs. thinking faster.

					JEFFREY
			What happened that day?.

Jeffrey runs like mad up to Dorothy's apartment.  He looks back once and 
sees the well-dressed man hurrying up the stairs.

CLOSEUP on well-dressed man's face. It is Frank, underneath a very good 
disguise.

Jeffrey has trouble getting the key out of his pocket.  He fumbles with it
and it drops to the floor.

Frank climbs the stairs.

Finally the key goes in and Jeffrey frantically opens the door.  He rushes
into the room.

220. INT. DOROTHY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

The horror and strangeness of the scene within strikes him again.  He 
rushes to the Yellow Man and takes the police radio out of his pocket.  
He runs into the back of the apartment - to the back bedroom where he 
crouches down behind a double bed.

					JEFFREY
				  (into the radio)
			Detective Williams!! Detective Williams!!

					DETECTIVE WILLIAMS
				         (over radio)
			Detective Williams here. Is that you,
			Jeffrey?

					JEFFREY
			Yes it's me!!! Frank is on his way up 
			to Dorothy's apartment.
			     (thinks; hits himself in the
                              forehead; inner voice)
                        Oh no. Frank has a radio and is hearing
                        everything we say!!
			      (thinks some more - fast)
			Detective Williams. hurry. I'm in the 
			apartment. hurry. I'm hiding in the back
			bedroom.

					DETECTIVE WILLIAMS
			We're ten minutes away and moving as fast
			as we can.

221. EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD STREET - NIGHT

Sandy runs frantically down a dark street.  We see a street sign which 
says "Lincoln."

222. INT. DOROTHY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Jeffrey drops the radio under the bed and runs back to the living room.  
He leaps safely into the closet just as Frank opens the apartment door and
enters.  Jeffrey freezes with fear in the darkness of the closet.  Frank 
is smiling.

					FRANK
			 (calling pleasantly in the direction 
  of the back bedroom)
			Hey neighbor. shit for brains. You forgot
			I have a police radio. I know where your
			cute little butt is hiding. Here I come!
			Ready or not!

He starts down the hall to the back bedroom.  The police radio which 
Jeffrey planted under the bed and Frank's radio both start broadcasting. 
Frank turns his radio off - now only the one under the bed plays.

					FRANK
			Hey fuck. I can hear you radio! .Hey
			you stupid fuck. you got about a 
			second to live.

Jeffrey watches Frank reach inside his coat for his gun.  He watches Frank
sneak to the back bedroom area.  Jeffrey turns and looks at the Yellow 
Man.  He gets an idea. He quickly rushes out of the closet - feels inside 
the Yellow Man's coat for his police gun.  It's there.  He gets it but it 
causes the Yellow Man to moan and leap some in another almost death-spasm.  Jeffrey takes the bloody pistol and races back inside the closet frantically catching his breath.  Just then he hears Frank in the back room.

					FRANK (V.O.)
			           (helium voice)
			Hey pretty pretty.

Jeffrey then hears three or four shots - deadly sounding coming from a 
pistol with a silencer attached.

					FRANK (V.O.)
			Hey fuck, where are you?

Jeffrey sees a furious Frank come storming out of the back room and come 
slowly up the hall - directly toward him.

Jeffrey raises his pistol - very slowly.  Frank enters the living room.  
He looks around.  The Yellow Man moans.  Frank makes a face and blasts the 
remainder of the Yellow Man's head away and this time the Yellow Man falls
dead to the floor.  Jeffrey tenses in the silence which hangs in the air.  Frank looks to the kitchen. all around the living room.  He looks at the closet.  He smiles - he slowly goes right toward Jeffrey - smiling.  Jeffrey points the pistol.  His finger moves to the trigger.  He squints his eyes.  He doesn't want to kill a man. any man.  Frank comes right to the closet door and throws it open, when Jeffrey hears Sandy scream.

					SANDY (V.O.)
			Jeffrey!!

Frank and Jeffrey lock eyes as Jeffrey pulls the trigger.  He yells Sandy's
name and Frank's head is blown off.

We see Sandy's frightened face.  We see policemen racing up the stairs in 
Dorothy's apartment.

223. EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT

We see cop cars with lights revolving, radios blaring.

224. INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - POLICE STATION - NIGHT

The large room is crowded with policemen and members of the F.B.I.  
Everyone is talking excitedly.  Jeffrey and Sandy are sitting by Detective
Williams in wooden chairs near the center of the room.  We hear bits of 
conversation.

					DETECTIVE WILLIAMS
				         (to Jeffrey)
			Because of your information I alerted
			internal affairs to check out Detective
			Gordon.  I had to keep on with him as 
			if nothing was different.  He slipped 
			off on his own when he found out we were
			going to raid Frank's place.

					 JEFFREY
			Does Dorothy know her husband is dead?

					DETECTIVE WILLIAMS
			Not yet.

					JEFFREY
			Oh my God. Is her son OK?

					F.B.I. MAN
			We're looking for him. In your opinion,
			why did Frank kidnap Dorothy's son and
			husband?

					JEFFREY
			He became obsessed with her. She hated
			him. He had to have her. He kidnapped
			them to control her. to make her do 
			things. Then she wanted to commit 
			suicide so he started cutting off ears
			as a warning to her to stay alive. I'm
			not kidding. Frank loved blue. blue
			velvet. He had to have Dorothy cause
			her whole life was blue.

					F.B.I. MAN
			You seemed to see some very interesting
			things on your little escapade with 
			Dorothy Vallens.

					JEFFREY
			Yeah. I guess I did.
				 (He turns to Sandy
  with a worried look)
			What's going to happen to me?

					F.B.I. MAN
			We're going to leave that up to Detective
			Williams. I'll tell you though. you're 
			okay. you shot a real son of a bitch.

					JEFFREY
			Yeah. I sure know that. Yeah, but how
			many more are out there?

FADE TO BLACK - DARKNESS

225. EXT. BEAUMONTS' BACK YARD - DAY

A huge low roaring sound comes in.

SLOWLY WE COME UP OUT OF A HUGE DARK HOLE. We see we are rising out of an 
ear but still among the crevices.  They look enormous.  We move up and 
float above the ear and traverse across a cheek to an eye.  Jeffrey's eye. 
His face is bathed in light.

All sorts of springtime-in-the-garden sounds are heard.

We suddenly see that Jeffrey is sleeping in his back yard. Detective 
Williams is with Mr. Beaumont working in the garden in the distance.  
The sprinkler is turning.  Sandy comes out on the back porch and calls.

					SANDY
			Jeffrey. Lunch is ready.

Jeffrey opens his eyes.  He looks around confused for a moment.  He sees 
Sandy.

					JEFFREY
			Okay. I'll be right in.

Sandy goes back inside.  Suddenly, a big red ROBIN chirps loudly above.  
Jeffrey looks up at it sitting in the cherry tree.  The Robin and Jeffrey 
seems to exchange a special look.

Jeffrey smiles up at the fat bird.

He gets off the lawn chair and walks away from us toward the back door of 
the house.  As he passes his father and Detective Williams:

					JEFFREY
			How ya doin' Dad?

					MR. BEAUMONT
				     (distant voice)
			Hey Jeff. I'm feelin' so much better.

					JEFFREY
			Good deal Dad.

He and Detective Williams share a smile.

226. INT. BEAUMONTS' KITCHEN - DAY

Jeffrey enters the kitchen and sees Sandy standing with Aunt Barbara by the
kitchen window.  Beyond, in the living room Mrs. Williams and Jeffrey's 
mother turn toward the kitchen when they hear the screen door slam.

A large Red Robin has just flown down to the window still carrying a big 
bug in its mouth.

					SANDY
			    (Referring to the bird)
			Look Jeffrey.

					JEFFREY
			  (As he joins Aunt Barbara and
			   Sandy to look at the robin)
			Yeah. I just saw him outside. Maybe
			the robins are here.

					AUNT BARBARA
			I don't see how they do it. I could
			never eat a bug.

					JEFFREY AND SANDY
				          (smiling)
			It's a strange world, isn't it?

									CUT TO:

227. 	EXT. FLOWER GARDEN - DAY

Yellow tulips sway in a warm afternoon breeze.

									DISSOLVE TO:

228. EXT. SHADY STREET - DAY

A bright red gorgeous fire engine is moving very slowly down the street.

We MOVE IN to see the happy face of a FIREMAN.

									DISSOLVE TO:

229. EXT. CROSSWALK - SHADY STREET - DAY

A very clean uniformed, smiling POLICEMAN with arms outstretched allows 
clean happy SCHOOL CHILDREN to cross the street safely.

									DISSOLVE TO:

230. EXT. TREE - DAY

A songbird SINGS in a tree.

We are in a beautiful park.  Slowly we move down and a little hat with a 
propeller comes into view.  The hat is on the head of a small child who is
dancing slowly toward Dorothy.  She is laughing.  When the boy gets within
arms reach they embrace.  We move close to Dorothy's smiling face.  Tears
of happiness come into her eyes, but there is still a distant look as we 
hear Bobby Vinton sing the last lines of his song.

"and I still can see Blue Velvet through
 my tears."

Blue Velvet dissolves in and takes over the image.

					THE END
