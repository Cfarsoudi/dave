FADE IN:

1   EXT:   MIDTOWN MANHATTAN STREETS - DAY

    Behind the opening credits, we watch a montage of RUPERT
    PUPKIN making his daily rounds as a messenger delivering
    manila envelopes and packages to various New York offices,
    always courteous and polite in his demeanor, PUPKIN is an
    attractive-looking young man just past thirty and dressed
    in a stylish blue suit, broad tie and wide-collared shirt.
    His shoes are neatly polished, his hair carefully groomed.
    As the montage continues, we see that he has finished his
    deliveries and is walking rapidly towards his destination.
    It turns out to be a television theater north of Times
    Square whose marquee announces THE JERRY LANGFORD SHOW.
    It is dusk and the show is about to break. There is a
    very small crowd already positioned at the stage door --
    a few young girls, a few curious passers-by who have
    stopped to see who will emerge. Three professional
    autograph hunters are clustered together:

    MAE, a lady in her sixties, wears a red velvet dress, a
    lace hat and much too much rouge.

    SIDNEY is in his mid-twenties, tall, badly-complexioned,
    slicked hair but otherwise neatly dressed. He carries
    a brown lunch bag.

    CELESTE is an enormously fat woman in her mid-thirties.
    She wears a large cape to conceal her obesity.

    A middle-aged MAN, dressed in a corduroy suit,    emerges
    from the backstage door which is guarded by a    large,
    white-haired POLICEMAN. The non-professionals     in the
    crowd just peer at the MAN but MAE immediately    steps in
    front of him with her autograph book raised.

                       MAE
                 (to the MAN)
           Are you somebody?

                       MAN
           No, honey, I'm just a working stiff.

    The MAN keep walking and MAE returns to her cohorts
    just as PUPKIN arrives.

                         MAE
           Hi, Rupert.

                       CELESTE
                 (coolly)
           Hello, Rupert.

                       SIDNEY
           Who did you get?

                 PUPKIN
           (distractedly)
     Nobody.

PUPKIN carefully places himself near the door, a step or
two away from the other professionals.

                 MAE
           (to SIDNEY)
     I got Mr. Raf Vallone outside 21.

                 CELESTE
           (to SIDNEY about PUPKIN)
     He'd never tell you anyway, Sidney.

                 MAE
     Then I got him again at the
     Pierre at four o'clock.

                 SIDNEY
     Be a dear, Mae. I don't happen
     to have Mr. Vallone.

                 MAE
     You know what I want for him.

                 SIDNEY
     But I have only six Barbra's left.
     You know how difficult she is to
     work with.

                 MAE
     I don't have her even once.

                 CELESTE
           (to MAE)
     Maybe Rupert would help you.

PUPKIN shoots a hostile glance back at CELESTE.

                 SIDNEY
     Would you do that, Rupert? You don't
     feel about Barbra the way I do.

                 MAE
     I'll give you Mr. Burt Reynolds too.

                 CELESTE
           (needling RUPERT)
     Look, Sidney, Rupert doesn't do
     that sort of thing.

                 SIDNEY
     How about it, Rupert?   I'll give
     you whoever you want.

SIDNEY starts pulling little white cards out of his paper
bag and reading them off.

                    SIDNEY
     Rodney    Dangerfield ... Richard
     Harris    ... Liza Minelli ... and
     she's    not so easy to work with
     either    ... Louise Lasser!

                 CELESTE
     You're wasting your time.

PUPKIN has been trying to remain apart from the other
three. Finally he turns to SIDNEY.

                 PUPKIN
     Look, Sidney. I'm just not
     interested. This isn't my
     whole life, you know.

                 CELESTE
     What's that supposed to mean --
     that it's my whole life, or
     Sidney's or Mae's?

                 MAE
     It is so my whole life.

                 CELESTE
     Shut up, Mae. What about your
     mother? Isn't she part of
     your life?

                 MAE
     It's her whole life too.

The show breaks. The doors swing open and people pour out.
The crowd around the backstage door swells.

                 POLICEMAN
           (to the crowd)
     If you want Jerry's autograph, give
     me your piece of paper and I'll
     send it backstage.

A number of people in the crowd hand in pieces of paper.
PUPKIN is standing next to a young couple, about college
age. The YOUNG GIRL has just sent in her paper.

                 PUPKIN
           (to the GIRL)
     What are you going to do with
     Jerry's autograph?

                 YOUNG GIRL
     I don't know. Maybe I'll sell it.

                 BOYFRIEND
     I'll tell you what she's going to
     do with it. She's going to pin

     it on her bulletin board and
     have an orgasm.

The YOUNG GIRL laughs unself-consciously.

                             CUT TO:

LANGFORD's limousine waits directly in front of the stage
door. MAE has engaged the CHAUFFEUR who stands at the
door of the car in conversation.

                 CHAUFFEUR
           (wearily)
     No, Mae.

                 MAE
     I don't mean now.

                 CHAUFFEUR
     No, Mae.

                 MAE
     I'll get right out.

The CHAUFFEUR, smiling, shakes his head.

                             CUT TO:

A plain-looking GIRL in a black raincoat and black, floppy
hat stands on the street side of the limousine,
carefully watching MAE and the CHAUFFEUR talk.

                             CUT TO:

                 MAE
     But I've never been in one.

We hear a cry as a celebrity emerges from the backstage
door. MAE turns and goes back towards the door.

                             CUT TO:

The POLICEMAN is handing out the autographs. Suddenly
LANGFORD emerges, flanked by three PAGES, husky young men
in their early twenties dressed in theater uniforms.
There is screaming and some yelling of LANGFORD's name.
LANGFORD pays no attention. Smiling nervously, he makes
his way towards the limousine. The CHAUFFEUR stands at
the rear of the car, holding the door. LANGFORD enters
the car and then suddenly springs back. The GIRL in the
black raincoat and black hat has hidden herself in the
back seat of the limousine. The three PAGES, who have
already turned and headed back toward the theater, hear
the commotion and swing around. The GIRL, who we shall
come to know as MARSHA, hides herself in the far end of
the limo, so two of the PAGES go around to the far side
of the car and start pulling her out while the third PAGE
moves into the limo from the street side. She fights

like a wildcat, but the PAGES slowly    manage to drag her
out. During the struggle, LANGFORD     stands amid the crowd,
a bit shaken. PUPKIN stands next to     him, staring at him.
When finally catches LANGFORD's eye,    PUPKIN smiles
pleasantly.

                 PUPKIN
           (to LANGFORD who
           barely listens)
     How the hell did that girl get in
     there? Jesus, they certainly
     don't give you very good protection,
     do they?

LANGFORD says nothing, glancing nervously at PUPKIN.

                 PUPKIN
     Look at you here. Who the hell
     is watching you? Any one of
     these freaks could just walk
     right up to you and do whatever
     he wants.

A couple YOUNG GIRLS are pressing against LANGFORD.

                 FIRST GIRL
     Oh, Jerry. How can we get to
     talk to you?

                 PUPKIN
     Just a minute. This is crazy.

PUPKIN straightens up for action.

                PUPKIN
          (yelling at the crowd)
     Okay! Stand back!

PUPKIN wades through the crowd towards the limousine,
pushing SIDNEY and MAE among others out of the way.
LANGFORD follows in the path PUPKIN is clearing.

                 PUPKIN
     Didn't you hear me?!?    Come on,
     people, have a heart.

The PAGES have succeeded in pulling the GIRL out of the
far door of the limo just as PUPKIN and LANGFORD arrive
at the near door. The CHAUFFEUR has been blocked by the
crowd from opening the door so PUPKIN opens it.

                   PUPKIN
     Stand back!    (To LANGFORD)   Go ahead,
     Jerry.

LANGFORD slips in quickly. He looks up at PUPKIN who is
holding the door, smiling pleasantly.

                        LANGFORD
           Thanks.   Thanks very much.

    PUPKIN stares at LANGFORD for a moment and then slides
    into the limo next to him, closing the door behind him.

2   INT:   LIMO - NIGHT

                       PUPKIN
           I hate to bother you like this, Jerry,
           but could I speak to you for a minute.

                       LANGFORD
           I'd like to but ...

                       PUPKIN
           I know you're a busy man. I promise not
           to take very long, really. But I need
           your advice.

    PUPKIN looks down at his hand which has been badly
    scratched.

                       PUPKIN
           You don't have a handkerchief, do you?
           Jesus, these people will kill you for a
           cufflink.

    LANGFORD hands him a monogrammed handkerchief, then checks
    his watch.

                       PUPKIN
           Thanks. If you have to be somewhere, I
           don't mind talking as we drive. You can
           drop me off anywhere.

                       LANGFORD
           Sorry, but I've got a strict rule never to ...

                       PUPKIN
           I put myself on the line for you, Jerry.

    Reluctantly, LANGFORD signals with his head to his
    CHAUFFEUR to start moving. As the car moves through New
    York traffic, PUPKIN and LANGFORD talk.

                       PUPKIN
           Thanks, Jerry. I'm grateful for this chance
           to talk to you ... I hope I'm not boring you.

                       LANGFORD
           I'll let you know.

                       PUPKIN
           Really? Fine. I'm      Rupert Pupkin, Jerry.
           I know that the name    itself doesn't mean
           very much to you but    it means an awful lot
           to me, believe me.     Maybe you've seen me

     outside your show and wondered who I am.
     Well, right now, I'm in communications but,
     by nature, I'm a stand-up comedian. I know
     what you're thinking -- 'oh no. Not another
     one.' And I wouldn't take up even one minute
     of your time if I wasn't absolutely convinced
     of my talent. I'm really good, Jerry,
     believe me, I'm dynamite. Now you're probably
     wondering if I'm so good why haven't you
     caught my act somewhere, right?

                  LANGFORD
     Well ...

                 PUPKIN
     Well, up to now, I've been biding my time,
     developing my act slowly and carefully so
     that when my big break finally comes, I'm
     ready -- like you were that night Paar got
     sick and you sat in for him. I was there
     that night, in the theater. That was the
     most important night of my life, until
     tonight, of course.

PUPKIN fishes a cigarette case out of his jacket pocket,
flips it open and offers one to LANGFORD.

                  LANGFORD
     No thanks.   I don't smoke.

PUPKIN returns the pack to his pocket.

                PUPKIN
     Me neither. I just carry them as a
     courtesy. How about a cough drop?

                 LANGFORD
           (smiling indulgently)
     No thanks. I don't cough.

                 PUPKIN
     I try not to but sometimes, you know
     ... Am I making any sense?

                 LANGFORD
           (smiling)
     Go on.

                 PUPKIN
     Well, that night you did Paar, I walked
     out of the theater like I was in a dream.
     All of a sudden, I knew what I wanted.
     I started catching your guest appearances
     on Sullivan and taping them and, when you
     got your own show, it got to be a kind of
     regular thing. I studied how you built
     to your one-liners, nice and relaxed like
     you were chatting, and how you delivered

     the jokes without leaning too much on
     them, without saying "here's the punchline,
     folks." And I watched the way you played
     off dead audiences, how you let those long
     silences build until people couldn't
     stand it and then the way you got them
     off the hook with that slow smile. You
     were my college of comedy, Jerry, like
     a kind of teacher, a friend. I know it
     sounds crazy, but when you watch someone
     every night ... But that's all in the
     past. What I'm trying to say is this.
     I'm ready now. I've finished the course.
     And I'm thinking as we sit here talking
     "Is this it? Is this that one big break?"
     Is it, Jerry?

There is a long pause.

                 PUPKIN
     Jerry?

                 LANGFORD
     Look ... er ... what was the name?

                 PUPKIN
     I'm Rupert, Jerry.

                 LANGFORD
     Look, Rupert. I know what you're saying.
     But things don't work that way. You can't
     just walk onto a network show without any
     experience. You've got to start at the
     bottom ...

                 PUPKIN
     But that's where I am!

                 LANGFORD
     You've got to work your way up, learn your
     trade in front of live audiences, start
     playing the little clubs.

                 PUPKIN
     But that can take years, Jerry! Look at
     me. I'm already 31 years old! People my
     age are way ahead of me. I've got some
     catching up to do and I need your help.
     What do you say, Jerry? All I'm asking
     you to do is listen to my act. That's all.
     Is that asking too much?

                 LANGFORD
     I get calls from agents every day.
     All they want ...

                 PUPKIN
     I tried getting an agent.   I did, Jerry.

           But you know how it is. You can't get an
           agent unless you're working and you can't
           get work unless you've got an agent ...
           or unless you know somebody. And the
           only person I know is you, Jerry.

    There is a long pause.

                       LANGFORD
           Look, why don't you call my office.

                       PUPKIN
           Could I?!? Oh, I knew you'd say that,
           Jerry. You don't know how many times I've
           had this conversation in my head. And this
           is the way it always turns out. That's why
           I had to sort of invite myself into the car
           tonight. I know it's kind of presumptuous
           and I really appreciate the time you've
           given me. But breaks like this don't just
           happen. You have to make your own breaks.

    The limousine starts slowing down as it pulls up before
    U.N. Plaza. It stops. LANGFORD gets out. PUPKIN follows.

3   EXT:   U.N. PLAZA APARTMENTS - NIGHT

    LANGFORD turn to PUPKIN,    looking to get rid of him as
    cleanly and gracefully as    possible. LANGFORD extends
    his hand. PUPKIN goes to     shake it but his hand is wrapped
    in the handkerchief. He     extends his left hand. LANGFORD
    shakes it awkwardly.

                       LANGFORD
           Nice meeting you, Rupert.   I hope it all
           works out for you.

                       PUPKIN
           Thanks, Jerry. I don't know how to repay
           you. I'm a little short on cash this
           evening, but, if you don't mind some good,
           hearty food, I'd be honored to take you
           to dinner.

                       LANGFORD
           Thanks, but some people are waiting for me.

                       PUPKIN
           Oh, I understand. Well, then, maybe I could
           repay you with a joke.

    LANGFORD is starting to walk into the building.

                       PUPKIN
           Wait a minute. How's this? The      first night
           you do your show from the coast,    you open
           this way. "Good evening, ladies    and
           gentlemen, it's great to be back    here in

           Southern California where you can wake up
           in the morning and listen to the birds
           coughing ... "

                       LANGFORD
                 (nodding but unsmiling)
           Not bad. Maybe.

    PUPKIN calls after LANGFORD who heads for the entrance
    to his building.

                       PUPKIN
           Consider it a gift. Hey, Jerry!
           How about lunch? My treat!

                       LANGFORD
                 (turning back before
                 he enters the building)
           Call my office.

    PUPKIN waves with his bandaged hand, notices LANGFORD's
    handkerchief and unwraps it.

                       PUPKIN
                 (to the handkerchief)
           Thanks, Jerry.

    The CAMERA MOVES IN for a CLOSE-UP of PUPKIN in a kind of daze.

                                   FADE TO:

4   INT:   SARDI'S RESTAURANT - DAY

    PUPKIN and LANGFORD stand at the edge of the foyer, waiting
    for the Maitre d' to seat them. VINCENT, the owner, spots
    them and hurries over.

                       VINCENT
           I'm sorry, Mr. Langford. (To PUPKIN,
           angrily) How did you get in?

                       LANGFORD
           That's alright, Vincent.   Mr. Pupkin's a
           friend of mine.

                       VINCENT
                 (puzzled)
           Oh, I see.

                       PUPKIN
           That's alright. Now if you'd be good enough
           to find us a nice table.

    PUPKIN pushes a five dollar bill into VINCENT's hand.

                        VINCENT
           Certainly.   This way, please.

VINCENT leads PUPKIN and LANGFORD to the "bullpen," a
select spot in a corner of the restaurant.

                 VINCENT
     Here you are. Enjoy your lunch, gentlemen.

                 LANGFORD
     Is Eddie here today, Vincent?

                 VINCENT
     I'll send him over.

A WAITER arrives and hands them the menu.

                 WAITER
     Our specialty today is Rizzofino Dolce Acqua
     a la Marinara con Spezi. Very good.

                 PUPKIN
     Sounds like a new opera.

                  LANGFORD
     Fine.   What comes with it?

                   WAITER
     Me.

The three laugh.

                  PUPKIN
     Fine.   For two.

                   WAITER
     Very good.

The WAITER leaves.

                 PUPKIN
     You look tired, Jerry.

                 LANGFORD
     It shows, does it? It's all these problems
     with the show. That and the custody suit.

                 PUPKIN
     I was sorry to read about that, Jerry.
     Charlene never should have gotten the
     kids. If there's anything I can do.

                 LANGFORD
     I appreciate it, Rube. Just talking about
     it a little with you helps.

Eddie arrives. He     is a small, slightly-bald man with
greying hair and a    goatee. He wears a foulard under an
open-necked shirt.     He carries a long sketch pad. He
immediately sets up    a small easel and starts sketching.

                 PUPKIN
     Hasn't Eddie already done you?

                 LANGFORD
     Never mind. You were saying ...

                 PUPKIN
     Well, I've been giving a lot of thought
     to your situation, Jerry, ever since I
     saw you starting to lose ground in the
     ratings. And I think I know what the
     problem is. Too many of the same faces.

                   LANGFORD
     Yeah?

                 PUPKIN
     Sure, people are getting tired of these
     people who live off game shows and talk
     shows and can't really do anything. They've
     seen 'em and heard 'em till they can't
     stand it anymore.

                 LANGFORD
     You know, maybe you're right, Rube.

                 PUPKIN
     I'm sure I am. When a show runs out of
     surprises, it loses its audience.

A YOUNG GIRL stands before PUPKIN and LANGFORD.   She hands
PUPKIN her autograph book.

                 PUPKIN
     What's your name, dear?

                   GIRL
     Dolores.

                 PUPKIN
           (writing)
     To Dolores, who sensed greatness.
     Rupert Pupkin.

                 GIRL
           (reading it)
     Thanks, Mr. Pupkin.

The GIRL leaves.

                 PUPKIN
     You see what I mean? What you need on the
     show is some unknown quantity, some brilliant
     talent making his television debut. Imagine
     the suspense. Who is this young guy? How
     will he do with the eyes of all America on
     him? Something like that has got to help.

                       LANGFORD
           And that's where you come in.

                       PUPKIN
           Why not? Believe me,     Jerry, I'd give you
           the credit you deserve    and I'll stick with
           you. Anytime you need     me, I'll be there,
           doing a few minutes at    Guild scale.

                       LANGFORD
           I'd be grateful, Rube.     I really would.

                       EDDIE
           All finished, Mr. Langford.

    EDDIE turns the caricature so PUPKIN and LANGFORD can see
    it. It's a picture of the two of them, facing each other
    and smiling.

                       PUPKIN
           Oh, Jerry, you sneaky ...

                       LANGFORD
           Looks good, Eddie.

    The WAITER arrives with a bottle of champagne.

                       PUPKIN
           What's this?

                       WAITER
           Compliments of Mr. Sardi.

    EDDIE hangs the picture of LANGFORD and PUPKIN on the wall
    behind them among the hundreds of other caricatures --
    from Bankhead to Sid Caesar to Bette Davis. The CAMERA
    PANS over these. We hear the champagne pop.

                       PUPKIN'S VOICE
           How does your afternoon look?

                       LANGFORD'S VOICE
           What have you got in mind?

                       PUPKIN'S VOICE
           Well, we've still got time to catch
           the Cubs and the Mets out at Shea.

                       LANGFORD'S VOICE
           Why not? But first, a toast. To you,
           Rube and your success.

                       PUPKIN'S VOICE
           Thanks, Jerry.

                                     FADE TO:

5   EXT:   U.N. PLAZA - NIGHT

                       PUPKIN
           Thanks, Jerry.

    PUPKIN takes LANGFORD's handkerchief and folds it
    reverentially, tucking it carefully into his breast pocket.
    He claps his hands together a few times for joy and
    dashes into the street to hail a cab.

                                    CUT TO:

6   INT:   LANGFORD'S APARTMENT

    LANGFORD enters his apartment. It is tasteful, modern,
    spacious and empty. A floodlight shines on a single
    setting at the end of a long dinner table. He walks over
    to a large aquarium and sprinkles some food for the fish.

                       LANGFORD
                 (to the fish)
           Say hello to Jerry.

    On a shelf above the aquarium stand three pictures, one of
    two boys, roughly eight and eleven, flanked by a shot of
    each boy alone. LANGFORD walks to the end of the table
    where a covered dish and a New York Post await him. He
    lifts the covered dish which reveals a large, cold salmon.

                       LANGFORD
                 (to the fish)
           Say hello to Jerry.

    LANGFORD begins poking at the fish with his fork.    The
    phone rings. He answers it.

                         LANGFORD
           Yeah.

                       GIRL'S VOICE
           It's Marsha, Jerry. Did you get my note?
           I left it on the back seat. Did you get it?
           I dropped it there before they pulled me
           out. Those guys hurt me, Jerry. (pause)
           Jerry?

                       LANGFORD
                 (icily)
           Who gave you this number?

                          MARSHA'S VOICE
           Don't be    angry with me, Jerry. I didn't
           know what    else to do; I've been trying
           you every    five minutes, I miss you,
           baby ...    Jerry?

    LANGFORD hangs up the phone and then takes it off the receiver.

                         LANGFORD

            Say goodbye to Jerry.

     He shakes his head wearily, returns to his dinner and turns
     to the inside pages of the New York Post.

                                     CUT TO:

7    EXT:   LEXINGTON AVENUE IN THE SIXTIES - NIGHT

     A cab pulls up in front of an all-night florist shop.
     PUPKIN dashes out of the cab and into the florist's.
     The cab waits.

                                     CUT TO:

8    EXT:   LEXINGTON AVENUE IN THE SIXTIES - NIGHT

     PUPKIN dashes out of the florist's clutching a single red
     rose. He hops back into the cab which starts moving.

                                     CUT TO:

9    EXT:   A STREET OFF BROADWAY - NIGHT

     The cab pulls up in front of Gil's Steaks and Chops, a
     restaurant of little distinction that has a few checkered
     tableclothed tables in the rear and a long bar at the
     front. PUPKIN stares through the window of the bar at
     RITA, the bargirl, an attractive, somewhat shopworn blonde
     in her late twenties. PUPKIN enters.

                                     CUT TO:

10   INT:   BAR-RESTAURANT

     PUPKIN goes to the near end of the sparsely-populated bar.

                         PUPKIN
            Miss!

     RITA comes over.    PUPKIN smiles knowingly.

                        PUPKIN
            A beer please, Miss.    Something imported.

                        RITA
            Heineken's alright?

                         PUPKIN
            Fine.

     RITA serves him a Heineken's.     She stares at him, searching
     his face.

                        PUPKIN
            How have you been, Rita?

     She stares again.

                 RITA
     You're not Rupert Pupkin!

PUPKIN smiles broadly.

                 RITA
     How the hell did you find me?

                 PUPKIN
     Sally Gardner, I met her after a matinee.
     Aren't you glad to see me?

                   RITA
     Sure, sure.    How is old Sally?

                 PUPKIN
     The same, I guess. You know, two kids,
     a nice husband, living in Clifton.

                   RITA
     It figures.

                 PUPKIN
     A lot of the kids in our class have
     moved back.

                 RITA
     What are you doing here?

                 PUPKIN
     I just thought I'd say hello. Here,
     I brought you a little something.

                 RITA
           (recognizing his style)
     Oh, yeah, Mr. Romance.

                 PUPKIN
     Don't forget to put in an aspirin.
     It lasts longer.

RITA fills a glass of water and puts in the rose.

                 RITA
     Nothing's gonna keep it alive in this place.

                 PUPKIN
     How have you been, dear, sweet Rita?

                 RITA
     I don't have an aspirin.

                 PUPKIN
     Maybe a Rolaids would work.

PUPKIN pulls out a pack of Rolaids and hands one to RITA
who smiles vaguely and drops it into the glass.

                 RITA
     Well, what are you up to these days,
     Rupert?

                 PUPKIN
     Didn't you know you'd see me again?

                 RITA
     You still going to the movies?

                 PUPKIN
     You're looking as beautiful as ever.

                  RITA
     Oh, yeah.   I was a real knockout.

                 PUPKIN
     I thought so.

                 RITA
     Well, here I am.     Local cheerleader
     makes good.

                 PUPKIN
     I voted for you for Most Beautiful.

                 RITA
     Yeah?

                 PUPKIN
     I didn't have the nerve to tell you then,
     but I guess it's alright now.

                 RITA
     Well, nothing terrible's gonna happen,
     if that's what you mean.

There is an awkward pause.    PUPKIN stares admiringly at
RITA.

                 RITA
     Well, how are things with you, Rupert?

                  PUPKIN
     Great!   Everything's starting to break.

                 RITA
     Is that right?

                 PUPKIN
     Yeah. As a matter of fact, that's why
     I'm here. I've known about this place
     for a long time. I just didn't want
     to make my move until I had something
     to offer you. Everything's a question
     of timing.

RITA stares at PUPKIN as he rattles on.

                 PUPKIN
     What's the matter?

RITA shakes her head in disbelief and chuckles.

                 RITA
     Jesus Christ, Rupert Pupkin!

                 PUPKIN
           (smiling)
     The two of us are often confused.     He's
     the one with the famous father.

PUPKIN waits for a laugh. RITA just keeps shaking her
head. PUPKIN looks around.

                 PUPKIN
           (critically)
     You like this place?

RITA shrugs.

                 RITA
     Why, you got something better?

                 PUPKIN
     Maybe.

                 RITA
     What?

                 PUPKIN
     What are you doing tonight?

                 RITA
     Tonight?

RITA starts laughing.

                 PUPKIN
           (smiling reluctantly)
     What's so funny?

                 RITA
           (still laughing)
     You call me up all junior and    senior year.
     Night after night after night,    right? And
     every time I'm wondering 'when    is this guy
     going to stop talking and ask    me out?'
     Well, now I know the answer.     August
     twelfth, nineteen seventy-six.     It only
     took you ten, eleven years to    work up to it.

                 PUPKIN
     If I had asked you out?   Would you
     have gone?

                   RITA
     Oh, no.

                   PUPKIN
     Why not?

RITA starts laughing again.

                 RITA
     Because I thought you were a jerk!

                 PUPKIN
     You see! I was right! But that guy isn't
     me anymore. I look at my picture in the
     yearbook and I don't even recognize myself.
     I'm not the same guy, Rita.

A bull-necked MAN in his early forties enters. He waves
a brief hello to RITA as he walks by. RITA smiles and
the MAN takes a seat at the far end of the bar.

                   MAN
     Rita!

                 RITA
           (to PUPKIN)
     Excuse me a minute, honey.

                 PUPKIN
     I'm not honey! I'm Rupert.

RITA goes to the far end of the bar and serves the MAN a
beer. They chat briefly as PUPKIN watches uneasily.
Finally PUPKIN downs his beer and raises his glass.

                    PUPKIN
     Miss!     Miss!

The MAN gets RITA's attention for PUPKIN.   RITA returns
to PUPKIN and serves him another beer.

                 PUPKIN
     I'm in the mood to celebrate tonight.
     Why don't we go to this nice restaurant
     I know, talk over and times, get to
     know each other all over again.

                   RITA
     And then?

                 PUPKIN
     Well, tomorrow night I thought we'd
     go out again, talk some more, get to
     know each other even better.

                   RITA
     How much?

                 PUPKIN
     How much what?

                 RITA
     How much do we have to get to know
     each other?

                 PUPKIN
     I don't understand.

                 RITA
           (emphatically)
     How much do we have to get to know each
     other before we start talking about
     that job?

                 PUPKIN
     I'm not talking about any job.

                 RITA
     Then what's this big offer you were
     talking about?

                   PUPKIN
     You'll see.    Right now I'm asking you
     for a date.    How about it?

                 RITA
     I'm sorry, Rupert.     But I'm busy.

                   PUPKIN
     Busy?

                  RITA
     Yeah.   Busy.

                 PUPKIN
     But this is the biggest night of my life.

                 RITA
     I've already got a date.

The MAN at the end of the bar raises his glass.

                   MAN
     Rita!

RITA goes to the far end of the bar. She pours him another
beer and settles against the bar, resuming her chat with
him. PUPKIN looks for a moment and downs his beer. He
raises his glass.

                  PUPKIN
     Miss!   Miss!

RITA returns to him.

                        PUPKIN
            Is that your date?

                        RITA
            None of your business.

                        PUPKIN
            What do you want to go out with him for?

                        RITA
            He's a good friend of mine.

                        PUPKIN
            Tell him you're busy.

                        RITA
            What's so important about tonight?

                          PUPKIN
            Everything!    You don't understand.

                        RITA
            No. I don't. It's been really nice
            seeing you, Rupert. Thanks for dropping
            in. But I've got some work to do.

     RITA leaves PUPKIN and returns to the far end of the bar
     where she once again resumes talking with the MAN. PUPKIN
     sits for a moment, gets up slowly and heads for the john.

11   INT:   THE JOHN - NIGHT

     He enters the john and goes to the farthest of the three
     urinals. A moment later, the MAN enters. He goes to the
     nearest of the three urinals. The two men stare at the
     wall before them but the obvious tension between them
     renders them both incapable of relieving themselves.
     PUPKIN glances over at the MAN's face, then immediately
     turns back to the wall as the MAN turns to look at him.
     The MAN glances quickly at PUPKIN and then returns to
     staring at the wall. PUPKIN sneaks a furtive glance at
     the MAN's penis. The MAN sneaks a furtive glance at
     PUPKIN's penis.

                                     CUT TO:

12   INT:   THE BAR - NIGHT

     PUPKIN emerges from the john, followed a moment later by
     the MAN. They resume their seats at each end of the bar.
     A third MAN has come in and is seated midway between PUPKIN
     and the MAN.

                          PUPKIN
            Miss!

     RITA walks over reluctantly.

                 PUPKIN
     Listen to me for a second.

                 RITA
     I have work to do, Rupert.

                 PUPKIN
     Just listen. I'm at the start     of
     something really big. I don't     want
     to talk about it here but it's    going
     to happen soon and it's going    to be
     great -- for both of us.

                    RITA
     No kidding?

                 PUPKIN
     So see that guy some other night.

                    MAN
     Rita!

RITA turns to go.

                 PUPKIN
     But I haven't finished!

RITA returns to the MAN and pours him another beer. PUPKIN
sits for a few moments, then downs his beer quickly. Again,
he raises his glass.

                  PUPKIN
     Miss!   Miss!

The MAN leans over the bar and tells RITA something. She
opens a bottle of beer and hands it to the MAN who slides
it down the bar towards PUPKIN. As the beer reaches the
middle of the bar, the THIRD MAN seated midway between
PUPKIN and the MAN raises his beer glass to take a sip just
as the sliding beer bottle passes under his hand. The
bottle stops right in front of PUPKIN who takes it and
slides it back with equal force. At this moment, the THIRD
MAN in the middle has finished his sip and has just placed
the THIRD MAN's glass on the counter. The beer bottle
collides with the THIRD MAN's glass, creating a mess. RITA
glares at PUPKIN as does the THIRD MAN. PUPKIN shrugs an
apology and RITA cleans up the mess.

                 RITA
           (to the THIRD MAN)
     I'll get you another one.

As RITA cleans up the mess and pours a fresh beer, the MAN
walks down the bar towards PUPKIN. He leans over him and
puts a supposedly friendly paw on his shoulder. PUPKIN
glances distastefully at the MAN's hand on him.

                    MAN

              (to PUPKIN)
     Look,    friend. I'm trying to have a
     nice    civilized conversation with the
     young    lady. Be a good little lad,
     huh,    and give us a break.

PUPKIN looks up at the MAN who pats him on the back in a
gesture of fraudulent friendship and menace. PUPKIN burps.
With an effort, the MAN controls his temper and returns to
his seat at the end of the bar. PUPKIN instantly raises
his glass.

                    PUPKIN
     Miss!     Miss!

The MAN advances towards PUPKIN with another bottle of
beer. PUPKIN watches passively as the MAN pours half the
bottle into PUPKIN's breast pocket and slams the half-empty
bottle on the counter. The MAN walks down to the end of
the counter where a smiling RITA is waiting.

PUPKIN again gulps his beer down. RITA and the MAN stare
at PUPKIN expecting him to raise his glass and call for
another beer. PUPKIN just sits there. After a few
moments, RITA and the MAN resume their conversation, but
they keep glancing over at PUPKIN, expecting him to
interrupt them with a call for beer at any moment. PUPKIN
continues to sit there. Just as RITA and the MAN have
settled back into their conversation, PUPKIN falls like a
stone from the barstool onto the floor. He lies
motionless. RITA and the MAN look at PUPKIN for a moment
while the handful of other patrons glance at him and return
to their drinks. RITA leaves the bar and goes to the rear
of the restaurant, disappearing into the kitchen. As she
does, the MAN walks over to where PUPKIN is lying inert
and prods him cruelly with his foot.

                 MAN
     C'mon, schmuck, wake up so I can
     kick your ass outta here.

The MAN turns to the kitchen to see if RITA is returning.
As he does, PUPKIN carefully opens one eye, grabs a free
chair from a nearby cocktail table, rises and bangs the MAN
smartly over the head. The MAN falls, out cold. PUPKIN
straightens up quickly as the other patrons look on with
interest. PUPKIN brushes off his suit, which is blue, just
like the MAN's, and stands above the MAN just as the MAN
stood above him, his back to kitchen. RITA emerges from
the kitchen with the owner, MR. NICHOLS and a large black
COOK.

                 RITA
           (to NICHOLS)
     He was making trouble one minute
     and the next he was on the floor.

RITA automatically reaches out as she talks for what she

     thinks is the MAN's arm. Instead, PUPKIN turns around
     smiling, leaving her too startled to speak. NICHOLS and
     the COOK lift the MAN to his feet.

                        COOK
            Okay, buddy, here we go.

     NICHOLS and the COOK lead the MAN, who is still groggy, out
     of the bar as RITA continues to stare at PUPKIN with a
     mixture of curiosity and amusement.

                        RITA
            Okay, Tarzan. Where do we eat tonight?

                                    CUT TO:

13   INT:   CHINESE RESTAURANT ON UPPER WEST SIDE - NIGHT

     We are in the kitchen watching two dishes being chopped,
     shredded and boiled in deep fat. The activity is frantic.
     WE FOLLOW the two dishes as a WAITER carries them from the
     kitchen to a booth where PUPKIN and RITA are talking. It
     is a painfully plain restaurant, shaped in a rectangle,
     with booths lining either side and a row of little tables
     in between. At the back is the kitchen and two phone
     booths, facing each other. An old Chinese WOMAN mans the
     cash register by the door. The WAITER sets the dishes down
     before RITA and PUPKIN and clears an enormous plate of
     spare rib bones from RITA's place. RITA hands the WAITER
     her empty cocktail glass. RITA and PUPKIN are facing one
     another.

                        RITA
            Another one, Chan.

                        PUPKIN
                  (to WAITER)
            Chopsticks, please.

     The WAITER nods and leaves.

                        RITA
            So all this time you've been thinking
            about me, huh?

                        PUPKIN
            That's right, Rita.

                        RITA
            What kinds of things were you thinking?

     PUPKIN drops his eyes shyly.      RITA starts laughing.

                        RITA
            Oh, ho! Those kinds of things!    Shame
            on you, Rupert.

                       PUPKIN

     Rita, I assure you there was ...

                 RITA
     Rupert Pupkin is an unclean person!

                 PUPKIN
     Come on, Rita. People will hear.

                 RITA
           (in a whisper)
     Rupert Pupkin is an unclean person. Oh,
     come on, Rupert. Relax. Have a little fun.

WAITER arrives with RITA's drink and chopsticks and a beer
for PUPKIN.

                 PUPKIN
     This is a very important evening to me,
     Rita.

                 RITA
     Did you know your nose wiggled when
     you talked?

                   PUPKIN
     It does?

                 RITA
     Yeah. Just the tip. Like a rabbit.
     (pause) Hey, are we gonna eat or
     what? I'm starving.

PUPKIN serves RITA.

                 RITA
     It always looks like they put worms
     in this stuff.

                   PUPKIN
     Just taste.

RITA tastes.

                 RITA
     Well, I guess it won't kill me.

                 PUPKIN
     This is supposed to be the finest
     Cantonese cuisine in the city.

                 RITA
     Yeah? Then what happened to the
     tablecloths?

PUPKIN drops his eyes.

                 RITA
     Oh, don't worry about it.   This is

     fine. (She takes a long drink) I'm
     having a good time. So you've been
     devoted to me, huh?

                 PUPKIN
     I used to see you at the Garden
     every year.

                 RITA
     Oh, the Follies. That was the right
     name for 'em. How did you know which
     one was me? We all looked like chickens.
     What I mean is, we all looked like the
     same chicken. I thought it was gonna be
     Rita Keane in the Ice Follies and I
     wind up looking like Henny Penny.

RITA chuckles to herself.

                 PUPKIN
     You just didn't get the breaks.

                 RITA
     Breaks, bullshit! My parents didn't
     have the money for the right coach.
     But what difference does it make?

She starts laughing to herself.

                 RITA
     I remember once we were down in
     Atlanta and the ice machine broke
     down. We did three hours of slush.
     Everyone was falling on their faces
     and hopping up with their arms open
     for a bow like the whole thing was
     planned. And the people ate it up.

                 PUPKIN
     I liked the show.

                 RITA
     Yeah? The Follies? You really must
     have been carrying the torch. What
     did you think when I got married?
     You knew I got married?

                 PUPKIN
     I knew it wouldn't last.

                 RITA
     You think I should have married you,
     instead, huh?

                 PUPKIN
     Peter Drysdale!     Really, Rita!

                 RITA

     If he'd only been hit by a train.
     He was worth a helluva lot more dead
     than alive, I can tell you that.

RITA raises her glass to the WAITER who is standing nearby,
talking with another WAITER. As she does, a nice-looking
young MAN sitting in the middle aisle raises his glass of
beer to her and drinks it, as a kind of toast. RITA
smiles briefly and her eyes return to PUPKIN. The YOUNG
MAN is seated behind PUPKIN, facing RITA. The WAITER comes
over and collects the glass. Throughout the rest of the
scene, a subtle flirtation continues between RITA and the
YOUNG MAN.

                 PUPKIN
     Are you seeing anyone?

RITA starts for a moment, thinking PUPKIN has caught her
looking at the YOUNG MAN.

                 RITA
     What do you mean?

                 PUPKIN
     I want to know about the competition,
     that's all.

                 RITA
     Well, tomorrow night, I've got a date
     with Joe Namath -- you know Joe. And
     Thursday --- let's see --

                 PUPKIN
     I'm serious, Rita.

                 RITA
           (imitating him)
     I'm serious, Rita. (In her own voice)
     Sure I see people. I'm not a nun, Rupert.
     I see a lot of people.

                 PUPKIN
     Anyone special?

                 RITA
           (chuckling)
     You mean am I "going steady"?   Rupert,
     I'm thirty-one years old!

                 PUPKIN
     What about that guy tonight?

                 RITA
     Him?

                 PUPKIN
     Why him?

                 RITA
     What am I supposed to do, huh? Sit
     home watching TV? He's just some guy.
     He's got his own aluminum siding
     business. He comes into the city
     sometimes, that's all.

                 PUPKIN
     You don't go out with him for his
     money?!?

                 RITA
     Oh, horrors! Look, Rupert, what do
     you think they pay me in that dump?
     Ninety-five bucks. And you don't get
     the world's greatest tippers in there
     either. Somebody has to take care of
     me.

                 PUPKIN
     That's what I want to talk to you
     about, Rita.

The WAITER arrives with RITA's drink.

                 PUPKIN
     Who's your favorite movie star?

                 RITA
     You are, Rupert.     Especially your nose.

                 PUPKIN
     Just tell me.

                 RITA
     Is this some kind of game? Are you
     going to tell me something about my
     character?

                   PUPKIN
     You'll see.    Give me his name.

                 RITA
     I can't think of anybody.

                 PUPKIN
     You've got to have one, Rita. Everybody
     does.

                 RITA
     Okay. Okay. Let's see.       (pause)
     Marilyn Monroe.

PUPKIN slowly pulls out a leather-bound book from his
inside jacket pocket.

                   RITA
     Oh, Rupert!    Are we going to exchange

     phone numbers!?

PUPKIN expertly flips to a middle page in the book and,
keeping the book open, his finger pointing under a name,
he turns the book to RITA.

                 RITA
     That's her name.

                 PUPKIN
     Her name! She signed this herself,
     especially for me.

RITA starts flipping through the book, curious about the
other names. She isn't paying any attention to what PUPKIN
is saying.

                 PUPKIN
     She wasn't a great actress but she had
     a real gift for comedy. She died
     tragically, you know, alone, like so
     many of the world's most beautiful
     women. I'm going to see that doesn't
     happen to you, Rita.

                 RITA
     Who's this one?

PUPKIN checks the book.

                 PUPKIN
     Burt Reynolds.

                 RITA
     Oh yeah, the guy with no clothes.
     Who's this?

                   PUPKIN
     Mel Brooks.

                   RITA
     And this?

                 PUPKIN
     Carol Burnett.

                   RITA
     No kidding.    How about this?

                 PUPKIN
     Glenda Jackson.

                 RITA
     Never heard of her.

                 PUPKIN
           (pointing to other names)
     And that's Woody Allen and there's

     Ernie Kovacs -- he's dead -- and that
     one's Lauren Bacall.

                 RITA
     You don't really know any of these
     people?

                 PUPKIN
     Take a look at this.

PUPKIN flips to one of the back pages and shows a name to
RITA.

                 RITA
           (squinting)
     I can't make it out.

                  PUPKIN
     Try.

                 RITA
     This is really weird handwriting!

Exasperated, PUPKIN follows the name in question with his
index finger.

                 PUPKIN
     Rooooper ....

                 RITA
           (guessing)
     Redford!

                 PUPKIN
     That's Robert Redford.

                  RITA
     It is?

                   PUPKIN
     No!    It's ... it's Rupert Pupkin

PUPKIN tears out the page and hands it to her shyly.   RITA
just stares at it and back at PUPKIN.

                 PUPKIN
     Don't lose it. It's going to be worth
     something in a couple of weeks.

RITA start laughing.

                 PUPKIN
     That's what I've been trying to tell
     you. Things are really breaking for
     me. I'm ticketed for stardom.

RITA laughs harder, despite efforts to be serious.

                 PUPKIN
     Only a couple of hours ago, I was
     talking to Jerry Langford, the Jerry
     Langford. Stop it, Rita!

RITA pulls herself together for a moment.

                 PUPKIN
     We were talking about my doing my act
     on his show.

                 RITA
           (suppressing a smile)
     Your act?

                    PUPKIN
     Get    that guy you knew from Clifton out
     of    your head right now. You're looking
     at    Rupert Pupkin, Rita. Rupert Pupkin,
     the    new King of Comedy.

RITA starts laughing hysterically, in spite of herself.

                 RITA
           (getting a grip on herself)
     I'm sorry.

                 PUPKIN
     Why not me, Rita? A guy can always
     get what he wants if he's willing to
     pay the price. All it takes is a
     little talent and sacrifice and the
     right break. If you've got a friend
     in the right place, that's all it
     takes. And that's exactly what I
     have going for me right now. After
     all, crazier things have happened.

RITA listens silently for a moment, then begins to giggle.
As PUPKIN resumes speaking, we CUT between RITA and the
YOUNG MAN. Their flirtation picks up steam. The YOUNG MAN
raises his eyebrows as if to ask, "Are you interested in
me?" She smiles. All the while, PUPKIN rattles on.

                 PUPKIN
     You just don't realize what a shot on
     the Langford Show can mean. That's
     coast to coast, national TV, a bigger
     audience than the greatest comedians
     used to play to in a lifetime. A shot
     like that means a free ticket on the
     comedy circuit -- Flip Wilson one week,
     Cosby the next, then Sonny and Cher or
     Carol Burnett. And you've always got
     those other talk shows to fall back on
     -- Carson, Griffin. And all that leads
     straight in one direction, Rita --
     Hollywood! That's when we really start

     living. How does this sound to you --
     a beach house in Malibu, right on the
     ocean. You'll get a beautiful tan,
     believe me. And we'd keep a suite at
     the Sherry. That's the only place to
     stay when you're big. We could get
     something on a top floor and look down
     on all our old friends in Clifton and
     just laugh. How does that sound to you?

                 RITA
     It sounds wonderful, Rupert, and I
     really hope you get what you want.
     But it's getting late and I'm a working
     girl. You know what I mean?

The telephone at the back of the restaurant starts ringing.
A WAITER in the background moves slowly to answer it.

                 PUPKIN
     You going to spend the rest of your
     life in that place? Is that what you
     really want, talking about nothing with
     nothings? I thought you wanted something
     a little better than that and that's what
     I'm offering. Every King needs a Queen,
     Rita. I want you to be mine. What do
     you say?

                 RITA
     You really want to help me out? You
     see this. (She points to her lower
     back molar) A hundred seventy-five
     bucks. If you could spare fifty, say,
     until next Monday, that would keep
     three people really happy -- me, my
     landlord and my dentist.

During RITA's speech, the WAITER has been working his way
from the phone booth towards the front of the restaurant.

                 WAITER
     Telephone for you, Miss.

                 RITA
           (looking puzzled)
     Me? Nobody knows I'm here.   You didn't
     tell anybody, did you?

                 PUPKIN
     No.

                 RITA
           (getting up)
     What the hell's going on?

CAMERA FOLLOWS RITA, who walks to the back of the
restaurant and picks up the dangling receiver in one of

     the two facing booths, the other of which is occupied.

14   INT:   THE PHONE BOOTH - NIGHT

                        RITA
            Hello?

                        MAN'S VOICE
            Hi.

                        RITA
            Who is this?

                        MAN'S VOICE
            Who do you think it is? I've been
            staring at you all evening.

                        RITA
            Where are you?

     The YOUNG MAN taps forcefully with his index finger on the
     glass door of his booth. RITA, hearing the noise, turns
     around and finds herself staring at the YOUNG MAN. She
     smiles.

                                      CUT TO:

15   INT:   THE RESTAURANT - NIGHT

     PUPKIN at the table looking over the check. He gets out a
     ten dollar bill. RITA emerges from the booth in nervous
     high spirits.

                        RITA
                  (with repressed gaiety)
            You know who that was -- the bar.       I
            have to go back to work.

                        PUPKIN
            How did they know you were here?

                        RITA
                  (gathering her things)
            I guess I must have told them.      They
            need someone right away.

                        PUPKIN
                  (accusingly)
            You don't even care, do you?

                         RITA
            Oh, no.   I do. Really!

                        PUPKIN
            It's not the bar, Rita.    Don't tell
            me it's the bar.

                        RITA

            Don't be angry. It has nothing to
            do with you. I had a nice dinner,
            really. It was great seeing you
            again.

     PUPKIN stare at her icily.

                          RITA
            Come on.    Let's see a smile.

                        PUPKIN
            Why don't we finish the evening up
            at the bar together? End the evening
            where it began?

                        RITA
            After what happened there?

                        PUPKIN
            Well, I could at least drop you off!

                        RITA
                  (hurriedly making up her face)
            That's okay. Really. I can manage.
            Why don't you just go to a movie or
            something? Don't let me spoil your
            evening.

                        PUPKIN
            But that wouldn't be right.

     RITA gets up and stands before PUPKIN.

                        RITA
                  (firmly)
            Look, Rupert. It's been a lot of fun,
            really. I'll see you sometime, huh?

                         PUPKIN
            But Rita!

     RITA starts moving towards the door.

                        RITA
            Come on, Rupert.      I'm in a hurry.

     RITA marches out with PUPKIN trailing behind. He throws
     the check and the ten dollar bill at the CASHIER.

16   EXT.   THE STREET - NIGHT

     CAMERA FOLLOWS PUPKIN as he streaks out the door and jumps
     into the adjacent doorway, immediately peering down the
     street. He spies the YOUNG MAN and RITA walking about
     three quarters of a block down and follows them, keeping
     out of sight. They turn occasionally to see if he's
     around, then stop turning. They go around the corner and
     disappear into a large apartment building. PUPKIN rushes

     after them,   positioning himself across from    the building.
     He searches   the windows for some clue as to    where they
     have gone.    Finally a set of lights go on on    the fourth
     floor and a   MAN's shadow is seen closing two    sets of
     blinds.

                                    CUT TO:

17   INT:   THE APARTMENT BUILDING FOYER - NIGHT

     PUPKIN enters the building and finds himself in a small
     entranceway. The door to the lobby is locked. Next to
     the door, on the wall, are listed the tenants, their
     apartment numbers and a button next to each name. There is
     an intercom speaker. There are eight apartments listed on
     the fourth floor, running from 4A to 4H. PUPKIN looks them
     over, takes a deep breath and pushes 4A.

                                    CUT TO:

18   INT:   YOUNG MAN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

     It is an extremely well-furnished studio apartment with all
     the requirements of a contemporary bachelor pad -- an
     imitation bearskin rug, nice bookshelves including an
     elaborate stereo system, recessed lighting, including a
     soft spotlight on the Queen-sized bed with its pseudo-satin
     cover. The YOUNG MAN and RITA stand in the middle of the
     room. RITA looks about uneasily. No intercom buzzer sounds.

                        YOUNG MAN
            Welcome to the pleasure dome.

                        RITA
            You don't kid around, do you?

                        YOUNG MAN
                  (smiling)
            I do alright. What's your libation?

                        RITA
            Huh?

                        YOUNG MAN
            Your potion. Your drink.

                        RITA
            Bourbon and soda.   Make it light.

     The YOUNG MAN goes to his chic little bar and starts fixing
     RITA a strong bourbon and soda. He also fixes himself a
     strong scotch and water. As he works, they talk.

                        YOUNG MAN
            You from the South?

                        RITA
            Me?

                        YOUNG MAN
            That's what Southern people drink.
            Lots of bourbon.

                        RITA
            What do people from Jersey drink?

                        YOUNG MAN
            I make it a point to study things
            like that. It's important to know
            people's backgrounds, their tastes,
            their culture. It gives you a little
            head start.

     The YOUNG MAN turns from the bar and hands RITA her drink.

                           YOUNG MAN
            I'm Chet. Whom do I have the
            pleasure of serving?

                          RITA
            I'm Mary.

                        YOUNG MAN
            Pleased to meat you, Mary. (He lifts
            his glass) To our evening.

            Who?

                          PUPKIN
            Rita Keane.    I want to talk to her.

                          WOMAN'S VOICE
            Rita Keane?

                        PUPKIN
            That's right. Oh, never mind.      I
            must have the wrong apartment.

                        WOMAN'S VOICE
            There's no Rita here.

                           PUPKIN
            I know.     I know. I'm sorry to bother
            you.

                        WOMAN'S VOICE
            You must have the wrong apartment.

                          PUPKIN

            I'm sorry.

20   INT:   YOUNG MAN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

     RITA is seated on the couch. The YOUNG MAN is putting a
     record on the phonograph. Once again, the intercom doesn't
     sound. PUPKIN has drawn another blank.

                        YOUNG MAN
            Leisure is America's fastest growing
            industry. Did you know that? Think
            about it. Short work weeks, more
            vacation. People need something to
            do with all that time and that's where
            I come in. Leisure Villages, Inc.
            We buy land an hour or so outside
            your metropolitan centers. We set
            up the bungalows, dig some lakes, lay
            out a golf course, you know, fix the
            whole place up so it's usable. Then
            young, personable guys like me show
            the people around. It the guy seems
            tight, we point out the investment
            factor. If he's a swinger, well,
            the bungalows are very private. If
            he's a sports nut, we talk up skiing
            and fishing and tennis.

     The phonograph starts playing Burt Bachrach.

                        YOUNG MAN
            What's your work, Mary?

     The YOUNG MAN walks back to her and stands over her.

                         RITA
            Me.   I fly for National.

                        YOUNG MAN
                  (delighted)
            No kidding?

                        RITA
            What's that smell?

                        YOUNG MAN
            Sandalwood incense. It seemed very
            you.

     We hear the intercom at the other end click off.   PUPKIN
     pauses a moment and pushes 4C.

22   INT:   YOUNG MAN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

     RITA and the YOUNG MAN are seated on the couch. Still no
     buzzer. As the YOUNG MAN talks, RITA is staring at a
     woman's shoe lying underneath a small table that holds a
     lamp.

                        YOUNG MAN
            Did you know that you have remarkable
            hair?

                        RITA
            Yeah? You know what?       I feel like
            going to a movie.

                         YOUNG MAN
            Now?

                       RITA
            Sure. Why not? It's only twenty of
            ten. We can make a ten o'clock show.

     The YOUNG MAN takes her hands and looks deep into her eyes.

                        YOUNG MAN
            Why don't we make our own movie?

                          RITA
            No.    I don't think so.

                        YOUNG MAN
            Don't be so uptight. Give it a chance.

                        RITA
            I want to go to the movies, that's all.

                        YOUNG MAN
            We can go to the movies later.

     RITA pulls her hands away.

                        RITA
            Let's stop playing games, okay.
            I'm not a kid.

                        YOUNG MAN
            You have something against pleasure?

                         RITA

            I'm just not interested in being
            tonight's ritual sacrifice, okay?

                        YOUNG MAN
            Shall I freshen up your drink?

     RITA shakes her head.

                        YOUNG MAN
                  (growing irritated)
            What exactly did you think we were

24   INT:   YOUNG MAN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

     The YOUNG MAN is practically sitting on RITA's lap.   He
     has RITA backed up against the end of the couch.

                        YOUNG MAN
            Look, if you've got sexual problems
            let's talk about them. It helps
            clear the air.

                        RITA
            There's nothing wrong with me.

                        YOUNG MAN
            Then it's me?

                        RITA
            I don't even know you.

                        YOUNG MAN
            Then find out. Sex is a great way
            of breaking down barriers.

                        RITA
            I don't think so.

                        YOUNG MAN
            I'm sure this could lead to something
            beautiful.

     The YOUNG MAN kisses RITA roughly.

                        YOUNG MAN
            Passive resistance, huh?

                        RITA
            Let's just write this thing off as
            a big mistake. What do you say?

                        YOUNG MAN
            What's wrong with me?

                         RITA
            Nothing.   I just want to go home.

                        YOUNG MAN
            I can see I'm not turning you on.

                        RITA
                  (smiles)
            You noticed that, huh?

                         YOUNG MAN
            Come on.   What's wrong with me?

                        RITA
            You really want to know?

                        YOUNG MAN
            Yeah.

                        RITA
            How can I put it? Well, it's like
            you've got your fly open and your

     The YOUNG MAN has RITA securely pinned and is starting to
     undo her blouse. She is desperate.

                        YOUNG MAN
            Afterwards, you'll thank me.

     The buzzer sounds with great force.        It is one, long,

     protracted blast that breaks the YOUNG MAN's concentration.
     RITA takes advantage of the distraction to grab her bag
     and rush out as the buzzer continues to sound.

     PUPKIN still has his finger on 4G as RITA rushes out the
     EXIT door next to the elevator and comes rushing towards
     him. She is numb and emotionally exhausted.

                       PUPKIN
            Rita!

            What do you want?

     RITA keeps walking out of the entranceway and onto the
     street. PUPKIN is at her side.

                        PUPKIN
            Don't be angry with me.     I was worried
            about you, that's all.

                        RITA
            Just go home and leave me alone.

     PUPKIN take off his jacket and puts if around RITA's
     shoulders.

                        PUPKIN
                  (quietly)
            Here. You'll need this.      It's getting
            chilly.

                        RITA
            I'm so bad.   I'm such a dummy.

                        PUPKIN
            Don't say that, Rita.     Everyone
            does crazy things.

                        RITA
            Not all the time.

                        PUPKIN
            I'll get us a cab.

     PUPKIN rushes into the street and hails a cab.

32   EXT: WEST 56th STREET BETWEEN EIGHTH AND NINTH AVENUES -
     NIGHT

     WE SEE the taxi pull up in front of one of those middle-

class tenements -- a fairly well-preserved six-story
building with a fire escape running up the front. PUPKIN
helps RITA out of the taxi. A dime bounces at PUPKIN's
feet.

                 CAB DRIVER'S VOICE
     Stuff it, big spender!

PUPKIN pays no attention.   He walks RITA to her front
stoop.

                 RITA
     Well, I guess you're entitled to come
     up for coffee.

                 PUPKIN
     That's okay, Rita. You're tired and
     I know I'm not always the easiest guy
     to be with.

There is a pause.

                 RITA
           (puzzled)
     What do you want, Rupert?

                 PUPKIN
           (softly)
     You don't understand anything, do you?
     I love you, Rita. I want to change
     your life ... if you'll only give me a
     chance.

RITA just shakes her head sadly.

                 PUPKIN
     Look, what if I arranged it so you
     could meet Jerry? You'd have to
     believe me if you heard it from him.

                 RITA
     There's no ...

                 PUPKIN
     I'll arrange that, Rita. We'll all
     go out to dinner some night or maybe
     out to his place, on a weekend. You'll
     see. The trouble with you is you've
     got no faith. Now go to bed and get a
     good rest and I'll see you in a couple
     of days.

PUPKIN gives RITA a very gentle, sweet kiss on the
forehead.

                 PUPKIN
           (gently)
     Now run along in.

     RITA just stares at him.

                        PUPKIN
            Go on.

     RITA turns slowly and goes in.       She looks back.   PUPKIN is
     gone.

                                       FADE TO:

33   EXT:   MADISON AVENUE AND 48th STREET - DAY

     PUPKIN carries a large manila folder into 424 Madison.        As
     usual, he is impeccably dressed.

34   INT:   OFFICES OF KOERNER-LIBERMAN TRAVEL - DAY

     It is a large corner office, broken up by glass dividers.
     A RECEPTIONIST sits at a desk facing the door. PUPKIN enters.

                        RECEPTIONIST
            Yes.

     PUPKIN hands the RECEPTIONIST the package.

                        PUPKIN
            I need somebody to sign. You can sign
            anything you want -- Cary Grant, Art
            Carney, I don't care.

     The RECEPTIONIST signs.

                        PUPKIN
            Would you mind very much if I used
            your phone? It's local.

                        RECEPTIONIST
            Don't be, long. Dial nine.

     PUPKIN takes out a little piece of paper from his suit
     pocket and dials a number.

                        PUPKIN
                  (tense, nervous)
            May I speak to Jerry Langford, please?
            Thanks ... Jerry Langford, please.
            Rupert Pupkin ... Jerry knows. I'm
            calling at his request ... I see.
            That's alright. I'll call him again.

                        RECEPTIONIST
            That's not Jerry Langford, the ...

                         PUPKIN
                   (smiling proudly)

            That's right.   Thanks for your phone.

35   EXT:   TIMES SQUARE - DAY

     PUPKIN approaches Times Square phone booth. He rests a
     few folders on a trash basket just outside the booth. He
     enters the booth and dials.

                        PUPKIN
            Jerry Langford, please ... May I speak
            to Jerry Langford, please ... Rupert
            Pupkin, I called earlier ... I see.
            How long do you expect that'll last?
            Oh, fine. I'm at (PUPKIN checks the
            number on the phone) CH 4-1482 ... I'll
            be here for another half hour, forty-
            five minutes. Please be sure he gets
            my message. Thanks.

     PUPKIN hangs up.

36   EXT:   TIMES SQUARE - DAY

     A SHOT of the clock on the Allied Chemical Building. It
     reads 10:10. A nearby record store starts blasting music
     into the street through a loudspeaker. The music serves
     as background for a montage in which we CUT BETWEEN the
     clock, which moves in bites towards 11:30 to Broadway as
     it looks to PUPKIN in the booth -- that cavalcade of
     hustlers, whores, housewives, kids, weirdos and working
     people; and SHOTS of various people waiting to use the
     phone -- their impatience, anger, disgust. Each time one
     of them arrives, PUPKIN pretends to thumb through the phone
     book and dial a number. WE WATCH him chatting with
     animation until the waiting party leaves. Then WE SEE him
     push the coin return to retrieve his dime. Finally, PUPKIN
     takes a last look at the clock.   WE SEE that it reads
     11:30. He leaves the booth and goes to the trash basket.
     His packages have been swiped.

38   INT:   A CORRIDOR IN THE HIGH-RISE OFFICE BUILDING - DAY

     PUPKIN emerges from the elevator and walks down the

39   INT: THE RECEPTION AREA OF THE JERRY LANGFORD SHOW
     OFFICES - DAY

     A bored, plump, middle-aged RECEPTIONIST sits behind a
     large desk that holds a phone receiver connected to a
     small switchboard. PUPKIN presents himself.

                         RECEPTIONIST
            Yes sir?

                        PUPKIN
            Mr. Langford, please.

                         RECEPTIONIST
            Your name?

                          PUPKIN
            Pupkin.    Rupert Pupkin.

     The RECEPTIONIST puts a call through. Wide-eyed, PUPKIN
     observes the blow-ups of Langford talking with various
     celebrities.

40   INT:   A TELEVISION STUDIO - DAY

     LANGFORD is seated at his desk on stage and PUPKIN is his
     guest. WE SEE television cameras and in the background,
     the control room.

                        PUPKIN
            You know the secret of dieting, Jerry?
            Grapefruit. It's good for you. It's
            filling. And it's low in calories.

                        LANGFORD
                  (to the camera)
            Take note of that, you ladies.

                        PUPKIN
            As a matter of fact, yesterday I went
            to the outdoor market near where I
            live and I bought twenty grapefruit.
            The grocer looked at me and said,
            "What are you gonna do with all those?"
            So I bent over and told him (in a
            confidential tone) "I'm gonna take 'em
            back to Florida and set 'em free!"

     LANGFORD and the AUDIENCE laugh heartily.

41   INT:   THE RECEPTION AREA -- DAY

                        RECEPTIONIST
                  (holding the phone and
                  talking to PUPKIN)
            I'm sorry, Mr. Pupkin, but Mr. Langford's
            secretary has no record of any appointment.

                          PUPKIN
            Pardon me?

                        RECEPTIONIST
            Mr. Langford's secretary has no
            record of any appointment.

                        PUPKIN
            Well, technically speaking, I don't
            actually have an appointment. Jerry
            asked me to call him today and when
            I couldn't get through, I thought ...

     As PUPKIN talks, a VISITOR has entered and stands behind
     him waiting for the RECEPTIONIST's attention.

                           RECEPTIONIST
            I see.     (Into the phone) He says Mr.
            Langford    asked him to call. (To
            PUPKIN)     Mr. Langford's secretary wants
            to know    what this is in reference to.

     The RECEPTIONIST glances past PUPKIN to the VISITOR
     waiting.

                        RECEPTIONIST
                  (to PUPKIN)
            Would you mind talking to her yourself?

     The RECEPTIONIST hands the phone to PUPKIN and occupies
     herself with the VISITOR.

                        PUPKIN
            Hello? ... Jerry and I discussed
            my being on the show last night and
            he told me to call ... No. I don't
            mind.

     PUPKIN hands the phone back to the RECEPTIONIST.

                        PUPKIN
            I'm supposed to wait.

     The RECEPTIONIST listens to the phone for a moment and then
     hangs up. The VISITOR has just disappeared into the back
     offices. PUPKIN stands there, smiling politely at the
     RECEPTIONIST who returns a professional smile.

                        PUPKIN
            Who was that gentleman?     (PUPKIN

     indicates with a glance to the
     entrance to the back offices that
     he is referring to the VISITOR)

                 RECEPTIONIST
     Mr. Gangemi.

PUPKIN draws a complete blank but wants to appear
knowledgeable.

                  PUPKIN
     Oh, I see.   Mr. Gangemi.

                 RECEPTIONIST
     He takes care of our air conditioning.

CATHY LONG emerges from the back offices. She is a tall,
modishly-dressed, attractive woman in her early thirties.

                 CATHY LONG
     Uh ... Mr. Pupkin?

                  PUPKIN
     Yes?

                 CATHY LONG
     I'm Cathy Long.

                 PUPKIN
     I'm Mr. Pupkin.

                 CATHY LONG
     Can I help you?

                 PUPKIN
     I'm sorry, but you are?

                 CATHY LONG
     I'm Bert Thomas' assistant.

                 PUPKIN
     Bert Thomas?

                 CATHY LONG
     He's our executive producer.

                 PUPKIN
     Oh, yes. I'm sure he is. But, you
     see, I've already talked directly
     with Jerry about my being on the show
     and he told me to get in touch with
     him. I'm just here to follow up on
     that.

                 CATHY LONG
     What do you do, Mr. Pupkin?

                  PUPKIN

     Stand-up comedy.

                   CATHY LONG
     Fine.    Where are you working?

                 PUPKIN
     Well, right now I'm developing new
     material.

                 CATHY    LONG
     I see. Well, as     soon as you start
     performing again,    let us know where
     you are and I'll    send my assistant
     down to check you    out.

                 PUPKIN
     Sure. Sure. But that's not necessary,
     Miss Long. Jerry and I already went
     over all this.

                 CATHY LONG
     Does Jerry know your work?

                   PUPKIN
             (nodding)
     Yes.    I don't think he does.

                 CATHY LONG
     You don't happen to have a tape or a
     demo that we might listen to?

                 PUPKIN
     Oh, sure. I've got lots of tapes.
     That's no problem.

                 CATHY LONG
     Good. Why don't you just send one
     to us and I assure you we'll listen
     to it promptly.

                 PUPKIN
     Great. I'll do that. I can see
     that'd be a lot easier for Jerry.
     Thanks a lot, Miss Long.

                 CATHY LONG
     Don't mention it, Mr. Pupkin.     Now,
     if you'd excuse me ...

                   PUPKIN
     Sure.    Sure. Thanks again.

CATHY LONG leaves. PUPKIN, left standing there, smiles at
the RECEPTIONIST who returns another professional smile.

                 PUPKIN
           (to the RECEPTIONIST)
     Thanks.

42   EXT:   THE UPPER-BROADWAY HIGH-RISE OFFICE BUILDING - DAY

     PUPKIN comes out of the building elated. He is immediately
     confronted by MARSHA. PUPKIN continues to walk as MARSHA
     skips beside him.

                        MARSHA
            I've got to speak to you for a minute.
            I'm Marsha.

                         PUPKIN
            Yeah.   I know.

                        MARSHA
            Look. Did Jerry say anything about
            me last night?

                        PUPKIN
            I'm really in a hurry, Marsha ...

                        MARSHA
            Was he angry? ... In the car last night,
            I saw you. Did he talk about me?

                        PUPKIN
            I thought that was you.     That was
            some stunt.

                        MARSHA
            What did he say?

                        PUPKIN
            We didn't talk about you.

                        MARSHA
            You know Jerry?

                        PUPKIN
            Yeah.

     MARSHA thrusts an envelope into PUPKIN's hands.

                        MARSHA
            Give him this for me.

                        PUPKIN
            Why don't you ...

                        MARSHA
            Because I can't! Please. I need
            your help. You'll be my friend forever.
            Come on. I'll buy you something.
            What do you want?

     She takes a great messy bunch of bills out of her raincoat

     pockets and jams them into PUPKIN's hands.

                        PUPKIN
            I don't want this.

                         MARSHA
            Take it.   I can get all I want.

     PUPKIN shrugs and pockets the money.

                         PUPKIN
            Okay.   I'll try.

                        MARSHA
                  (turning cold)
            Don't try. Do it.       Remember.   We
            just made a deal.

     PUPKIN stares at the envelope.

                        MARSHA
            And don't open it.    It's private.

                         PUPKIN
            Okay.   Okay.

                        MARSHA
            How soon can you get it to him?

                        PUPKIN
            I don't know. Couple a days.

                        MARSHA
                  (menacingly)
            You'd better.

      MARSHA turns and walks in the direction from which they
      came. CAMERA FOLLOWS PUPKIN who walks on for a block or
      so, then opens the envelope. It contains a set of
      apartment keys, a scrap of hand-knitted woolen cloth and a
      note in lipstick that reads: "I've made you a sweater,
      honey. Come try it on. I miss you. Love, M. 74 East
      83rd Street, Apartment 2B!" He takes out the money
MARSHA
      gave him. There are wads of tens, twenties and fifties
      with a sprinkling of fives and ones.

44   EXT:   A TIMES SQUARE HOTEL - DAY

     The hotel is just one step up from a flophouse. WE SEE
     PUPKIN enter.

45   INT:   PUPKIN'S ROOM - DAY

PUPKIN enters. WE SEE that it is a small room, furnished
by the hotel in the plainest way. Nicely-done home-made
collages of show business figures decorate the drab green
walls. The room is neat and clean. PUPKIN goes directly
to a plain table which holds two tape recorders -- one a
small cassette the other a large table tape recorder. He
picks up the microphone of the larger one and speaks into
it.

                  PUPKIN
     Testing.   Testing.   Testing.

In the following montage, we hear in the background the
replay of his "testing, testing testing" and various
other noises -- a bit of his voice taped, a burst of
laughter, the squeal of a tape recorder sent fast-forward,
a sudden burst of applause, a scrap of theme music. At the
same time, the CAMERA PANS about the room.    We look
at the collages which include all the obvious show business
figures, with a heavy emphasis on comedians from Chaplin
and Keaton to Sid Caesar and Woody Allen. The collages
also include such varied figures as Jimmy Carter, Julia
Childs, Tom Seaver, David Brinkley, Muhammad Ali, Clifford
Irving, Walter Cronkite and Mark Spitz. There is a special
Kennedy section -- John F. and Bobby framed in black,
Jackie in mourning and a picture of Teddy. There is also a
trio of assassins -- Sirhan, Oswald and James Earl Ray.
There is also a talk show collage with a photo of Langford
in the center like a sun surrounded by Snyder, Walters,
Carson and Griffin. One bookshelf holds a veritable
library of comedy -- joke books, biographies of comedians,
treasuries of American humor. Another shelf holds scores
of tapes in their own little boxes, each one neatly marked,
i.e., "LANGFORD MONOLOGUES:    7/5/72 to 9/9/72." "MISC.
MONOLOGUES 6/13/68 to 8/1/69."

                              CUT TO:

PUPKIN sitting before the tape recorder lost in thought.
Finally, he starts the larger recorder and lifts the mike.

                 PUPKIN
     First, Miss Long. Thanks very much
     for your help at the office and for
     passing this along to Jerry. I
     appreciate it more than you know.

PUPKIN stops the tape recorder and thinks again for a few
beats. He then starts the large recorder.

                 PUPKIN
     Now, Jerry. Before I begin, I just
     want to thank you for listening to
     this material and for the opportunity
     that you've given me. You know, lots
     of people think that guys like you,
     you know, people who have made it,
     lose their feeling for struggling

     young talent such as myself. But
     now I know from experience that those
     people are just cynics, embittered
     by their own failure. I know, Jerry,
     that you're as human as the rest of us,
     if not more so. (pause) Oh well, I
     guess there's no point going on about
     it. You know how I feel. So let's get
     on with the show.   The best of Rupert
     Pupkin! I've sketched out this little
     introduction in order to save you a
     little time. So close your eyes and
     imagine it's exactly six o'clock.
     You're standing in the wings and we
     hear Rick Ross and the Orchestra strike
     up your theme song.

PUPKIN pushes a button on the cassette and we hear the
theme song of the Jerry Langford Show, followed by the
voice of BERT CANTER, the announcer.

                 BERT CANTER'S VOICE
     And now, direct from New York, it's
     the Jerry Langford Show! Tonight,
     with Jerry's special guest ...

PUPKIN deftly shuts off the cassette and substitutes his
own voice for that of CANTER's. The large tape recorder
keeps rolling.

                 PUPKIN
     ... the comedy find of the year making
     his television debut, Rupert Pupkin, the
     King of Comedy!

PUPKIN rapidly races the cassette tape forward, then pushes
down the "play" button. We hear a burst of thundering
applause. PUPKIN lets the applause run for a while and
then shuts it off. The large recorder keeps rolling.

                 PUPKIN
     Now you come on, Jerry, and do your
     monologue. Then, when the time comes,
     this is how I see you introducing me.
     You'll say something like this.
     "Ladies and Gentlemen we're going to
     do something a little bit different
     tonight. It isn't often that you can
     call someone a sure thing in the
     entertainment business. After all,
     the verdict is always in your hands.
     But I think after you've met my next
     guest, that you'll agree with me that
     he's destined for greatness. So,
     now, will you please give your warmest
     welcome to the newest King of Comedy,
     Rupert Pupkin!!!"

     PUPKIN pushes the cassette and we hear another enormous
     burst of applause. PUPKIN lets it run, listening intently.
     He stands up and faces a wall of his room, still holding
     the microphone. WE SEE that the wall is covered by a huge
     blow-up of an audience laughing and applauding.

                                    CUT TO:

45   INT:   THE LANGFORD TELEVISION STUDIO - NIGHT

     WE SEE a real audience laughing and applauding.

                                    CUT TO:

     PUPKIN strides triumphantly onto the stage, nodding to
     acknowledge the applause. He stops center stage as the
     television cameras maneuver about him.

                                    CUT TO:

     A SHOT of the "APPLAUSE" sign flashing, then stopping.
     Still, the applause goes on.

                                    CUT TO:

     PUPKIN    raises his hands to quiet the audience. After a few
     moments    the applause dies down, except for a pair of hands
     in the    center of the orchestra. PUPKIN peers out to see
     who is    still applauding.

                                    CUT TO:

     RITA, in the middle of the audience, applauds
     enthusiastically.

                                    CUT TO:

     PUPKIN on stage.    PUPKIN gives RITA a special smile and
     nod.

                        PUPKIN
            Will somebody tell that lovely lady
            that the applause sign is off.

     The audience laughs.

                                    CUT TO:

46   INT:   PUPKIN'S ROOM - DAY

     PUPKIN stands facing the "audience" still holding the mike.

                        PUPKIN
            That's a possible introduction, Jerry.
            Now let's move on to my act.

                                    CUT TO:

47   INT:   THE RECEPTION AREA OF THE LANGFORD SHOW - DAY

     PUPKIN is pacing. He is wearing another suit, this one a
     broad-lapelled-grey. He is freshly shaved, is hair neatly
     combed, his shoes carrying a bright shine. He clutches a
     small flat box, neatly wrapped with the words 'FOR JERRY
     LANGFORD" written clearly across the top in large print.
     CATHY LONG emerges from one of the back corridors into the
     reception area.

                        CATHY LONG
            Yes?

                        PUPKIN
                  (suddenly a bit shy)
            I didn't want to take any chances
            with this ... uh ... Miss Long, so I
            ... uh ... thought I'd just bring it
            here myself.

     He hands CATHY LONG the package as though it contained
     nitroglycerine.

                        CATHY LONG
            We talked about this this morning,
            did we, Mr. ... ?

                         PUPKIN
            Pupkin.   Rupert Pupkin.

                        CATHY LONG
            Oh, yes. It's been some day. (pause)
            Well, I certainly appreciate your
            bringing this over, Mr. Pupkin, and
            we'll listen to it as soon as possible.

                        PUPKIN
            Fine. Er ... you don't have any idea
            how soon that might be?

                        CATHY LONG
            Well, you can try checking with us
            tomorrow. We might know something
            by then. Otherwise, it'll have to
            be Monday.

                        PUPKIN
            What if I just sort of waited around
            here today, just in case? I'll stay
            out of the way.

                        CATHY LONG
            You'd just be wasting your time,
            Mr. Pupkin. We won't know anything
            until tomorrow at the earliest.

                        PUPKIN
            Oh, I wouldn't consider it a waste of

            time at all.    I'd be glad to do it.

                        CATHY LONG
            Look, why don't you try us tomorrow.
            Okay?

                        PUPKIN
            Tomorrow? ... Right. I'll do that.
            Thanks a lot, Miss Long. And thank
            Jerry.

     CATHY LONG smiles at     PUPKIN and    goes, leaving PUPKIN
     staring at a picture     of LANGFORD    on the wall. WE FIX on
     LANGFORD a moment and     PULL BACK    to see LANGFORD in what
     PUPKIN would imagine     his office    to be.

48   INT:   AN OFFICE - DAY

     A large, corner office furnished in royal red, with high
     ceilings and a huge desk. Potted palms and hydrangeas rest
     on a marble floor. LANGFORD is moving about restlessly,
     clutching PUPKIN's tape in one hand and waving it about.
     PUPKIN is seated on a comfortable couch.

                          LANGFORD
            Dynamite!    This is dynamite!

                        PUPKIN
                  (shyly)
            You think so, Jerry?

                        LANGFORD
            Look, I've been at this for fifteen
            years, Rupert, and I haven't come up
            with anything like this -- not me,
            not any of my writers.

                        PUPKIN
                  (smiling with obvious
                  pleasure)
            Well, I'm glad you like it, Jerry.

                        LANGFORD
            Tell me something, Rube. (pause)
            How do you do it? I'm not asking
            to use the material myself. I just
            want to know how you (LANGFORD waves
            his arms in a gesture of frustration)
            how you do it.

                        PUPKIN
            Well, I don't know if I can explain
            it, really.

                          LANGFORD
            Come on.    Try, Rube.

                         PUPKIN

            Well,    it just sort of comes. I think
            about    my life, see, mainly about the
            worst    parts, all the awful things, and
            I just    try to see them in a funny light.
            That's    all.

                        LANGFORD
                  (eagerly)
            Is that what you do? The worst parts,
            and then you look at them in a funny
            light? Is that what you do?

                        PUPKIN
            More or less. It's hard to describe
            how its happens.

                        LANGFORD
            But that's just it, Rube. It doesn't
            happen for me. Why do you think the
            show is in so much trouble? By the
            time I've done my monologue, everyone
            has switched to Carson. Maybe if you
            did a little writing ... ?

                        PUPKIN
            Sure, Jerry, I'd do anything I could
            to help out.

                        LANGFORD
            You would? Great. Why don't you
            come out to my place this weekend
            and we'll hash it out. I'm having
            a few of my friends but we should be
            able to get a little work in.

                        PUPKIN
            Would you mind if I brought someone?

                        LANGFORD
                  (smiling)
            A girl, Rube?

                        PUPKIN
            A very special girl, Jerry.

                        LANGFORD
            I'd love to meet her.

49   THE HIGH-RISE OFFICE BUILDING ON UPPER BROADWAY - DAY

     PUPKIN emerges, lost in thought. Suddenly he notices
     MARSHA waiting nearby. She doesn't see PUPKIN. He sneaks
     off.

                                      CUT TO:

50   EXT:   U.N. PLAZA - DAY

     It is a bright morning. LANGFORD, attempting to camouflage
     himself by wearing a cap over his eyes and his trench coat
     collar turned up, his eyes hidden behind dark glasses,
     walks out of the building. A DOORMAN is standing by the
     door.

                          DOORMAN
            Cab, Jerry?

                        LANGFORD
            That's alright, thanks.

     WE FOLLOW LANGFORD as he walks. Some people don't notice.
     Others stare but leave him alone, a few commenting to their
     companions and pointing at him. A CAB DRIVER pulls
     alongside.

                        DRIVER
            Hey, Jerry. My brother can sing
            and juggle at the same time. How
            about puttin' him on your show?

     LANGFORD keeps walking.

                        DRIVER
            How about it, Jerry?

                        LANGFORD
            Sorry, I'm off duty.

51   EXT.   A MANHATTAN STREET - DAY

     LANGFORD stands at the corner, next to a middle-aged
     COUPLE.

                        WOMAN
            You're Jerry!!

     LANGFORD pulls his cap a little more tightly around his
     eyes.

                        WOMAN
            You know something.   (She giggles)
            I undress in front of you every night
            and Larry here doesn't mind at all.

                        LARRY
            I can't get anything started with her
            until you're off the air. Your show
            is ruining my sex life, Jerry.

                        LANGFORD
            Well then, you'll just have to put
            on a better show than I do.

                                      CUT TO:

52   EXT:   BROADWAY, A FEW BLOCKS SOUTH OF LANGFORD'S OFFICES -
     DAY

     WE WATCH LANGFORD continue to walk, feeling what it is to
     be a celebrity out in public. After a few beats, we

                                      CUT TO:

53   EXT:   BROADWAY - DAY

     WE SEE MARSHA trailing LANGFORD. LANGFORD notices her and
     starts walking quickly. MARSHA walks quickly. LANGFORD
     starts jogging. MARSHA starts jogging. Finally, LANGFORD
     breaks into a sprint. MARSHA runs after him. LANGFORD
     disappears into his office building. MARSHA arrives
     several seconds later.

                           MARSHA
            Jerry!     God damnit!

     Just as MARSHA turns around, PUPKIN, unaware of her, walks
     cheerfully into the building.

                                      CUT TO:

54   INT:   RECEPTION AREA OF JERRY LANGFORD SHOW OFFICES - DAY

     PUPKIN enters. The same middle-aged, plump RECEPTIONIST
     is seated behind the desk.

                           RECEPTIONIST
            Yes, sir?     (recognizing him)   Oh, hi.

                         PUPKIN
            Hi.   How are you?

                          RECEPTIONIST
            Not bad.

                          PUPKIN
            I'm fine.

                        RECEPTIONIST
            Can I help you?

                        PUPKIN
            I'd like to see Jerry, please.

                        RECEPTIONIST
            You are ... ?

                          PUPKIN
            Mr. Pupkin.

                        RECEPTIONIST
            Just a minute.

The RECEPTIONIST dials a number.

                 RECEPTIONIST
     Mr. Pupkin is here ... That's right
     ... (to PUPKIN) She'll be with you
     in a minute.

                   PUPKIN
     Who?

                   RECEPTIONIST
     Miss Long.

                 PUPKIN
     But I wanted to see Jerry.

                 RECEPTIONIST
     Mr. Langford's not in. Miss Long
     will take care of you.

                   PUPKIN
     Alright.

PUPKIN paces for a few beats. He smiles at the
RECEPTIONIST. A beat later, CATHY LONG comes out,
carrying the tape in its box.

                   CATHY LONG
     Mr. Pupkin?

                 PUPKIN
     How are you today?

                 CATHY LONG
     Fine, Mr. Pupkin. Thank you for
     your tape. We listened to it with
     great interest. And, frankly, Mr. Pupkin,
     we saw a lot of good things in what
     you're doing. We feel you have good
     potential. Very good potential.

                 PUPKIN
           (smiling)
     Thanks.

                 CATHY LONG
     That's why I'll be honest with you,
     Mr. Pupkin ...

                   PUPKIN
     Yes?

                 CATHY LONG
     We just don't think you're ready yet.

                 PUPKIN
           (baffled)
     Not ready?

            CATHY LONG
Well, we just don't feel right now
that you're right for Jerry.

            PUPKIN
      (rapidly, half-listening)
Right for Jerry. Sure.

            CATHY LONG
Some of the material ... some of the
one-liners, for instance ...

            PUPKIN
Yes?

            CATHY LONG
... were not very strong.

            PUPKIN
You didn't care for some of the jokes,
is that it?

            CATHY LONG
That"s right.

            PUPKIN
Good. Good. I can take care of
that right way. Thanks. Just tell
me the ones you think should go.
That would be a big help. (to the
RECEPTIONIST) This is great. (to
CATHY LONG) Which ones?

            CATHY LONG
Well, it's not just that, Mr. Pupkin.
You see, Jerry likes to panel his
guests, you know, chat with them
afterwards.

             PUPKIN
Sure.   Sure.

            CATHY LONG
And frankly, we just don't feel you've
got very much to talk about right now.

            PUPKIN
But I've got my whole life to talk
about!

            CATHY LONG
Which is interesting to you, I'm sure
and to your wife ... and to a few
friends. But we feel that you should
keep developing your act. Test it in
some live situations. There are a
number of clubs in the city you can

     try. And after a reasonable period,
     get in touch with us again and we'll
     be glad to send someone down to check
     out your progress.

PUPKIN stares at her for a few moments as the tension grows.

                 PUPKIN
     May I ask you a question, Miss Long?

                  CATHY LONG
     Of course.

                 PUPKIN
     Are you speaking for Jerry?

                 CATHY LONG
     Let's put it this way, Mr. Pupkin.
     Mr. Langford has complete faith in
     our judgment.

                 PUPKIN
     I'm sorry to have to say this, Miss
     Long, and I certainly don't want you
     to take it personally, but I have to
     tell you that I don't ... I don't
     have faith in your judgment.

                 CATHY LONG
     Well, I'm sorry you feel that way,
     Mr. Pupkin. But I'm afraid there's
     nothing that can be done about that.

                 PUPKIN
     No ... No ... I'm afraid I'll have
     to disagree with you again.

                 CATHY LONG
           (with strained politeness)
     That's your privilege, Mr. Pupkin.
     Now, if you'll excuse me, please, I
     have some things to do. I'm sorry
     the news isn't better.

CATHY LONG turns to go.

                  PUPKIN
     Miss Long?

CATHY LONG turns back.

                 PUPKIN
     When are you expecting Jerry in?

                 CATHY LONG
     He won't be in until very late this
     afternoon.

                 PUPKIN
     That's fine. Thank you.

CATHY LONG stares at PUPKIN for a moment, glances at the
RECEPTIONIST and then goes. PUPKIN takes a seat in the
reception area. He smiles once more at the RECEPTIONIST.
The RECEPTIONIST drops her eyes. A few beats go by. CATHY
LONG passes by the entranceway and glances at PUPKIN.
PUPKIN continues sitting there.

                 RECEPTIONIST
     Is there anyone else you would
     like to see?

                 PUPKIN
     That's alright. I'm happy just
     waiting.

A few beats pass in silence.

                 RECEPTIONIST
     Well, would you mind waiting outside,
     please, Mr. Pupkin? This is a reception
     area, not a waiting room.

                 PUPKIN
     I understand.

PUPKIN remains seated. A few more moments pass. Several
OFFICE PERSONNEL pass by the entranceway and glance at
PUPKIN. After a few more beats, a large, plainly-dressed
MAN in his mid-fifties emerges from the back offices. He
goes over to PUPKIN, who stands.

                 OFFICIAL
     Mr. Pupkin? I'm Raymond Wirtz, in
     charge of security for the Langford
     organization.

WIRTZ puts his arm on PUPKIN's shoulder and, as the
following dialogue unfolds leads him out the door, down
the corridor and into the elevator.

                 WIRTZ
     Now I think you understand that we
     have certain rules here that are
     essential to the smooth functioning
     of our operation.

                    PUPKIN
     Sure.     Sure.

                 WIRTZ
     And that without these rules, we really
     wouldn't be able to function at our
     best. You follow my point?

PUPKIN nods.

                        WIRTZ
            Now one of these rules is that only
            authorized personnel and those having
            official business with our organization
            are permitted on our premises. And
            that's why I'm asking you, Mr. Pupkin,
            to cooperate with us.

     They have reached the elevator and WIRTZ has pushed the
     button.

                        PUPKIN
            You want me to leave the building.

                        WIRTZ
            That's right. It's nothing personal,
            Mr. Pupkin. Just doing my job.

     The elevator arrives. WIRTZ signals with his head that
     PUPKIN should enter. PUPKIN gets in.

                        WIRTZ
            Have a pleasant day.

55   EXT:   STREET OUTSIDE THE LANGFORD BUILDING - DAY

     PUPKIN comes out and takes up a position outside the door,
     preparing to wait for LANGFORD. MARSHA sees him and comes
     over to him.

                        MARSHA
            Well, did you give it to him?

                         PUPKIN
                   (out of a daze)
            Huh?

                        MARSHA
            Did you get my letter to him?

                        PUPKIN
            He's not in there.

                        MARSHA
            Look, if you don't want to give it
            him, okay. I'll get somebody
            else. But don't try to con me.

                        PUPKIN
            I told you I'd try and I will. I'm
            going to wait for him right here.

                        MARSHA
            Give me the envelope, huh?

                        PUPKIN
            Sure, but ...

                        MARSHA
            I saw him go in myself!

                        PUPKIN
            Who?

                        MARSHA
            Jerry!

                        PUPKIN
            But they said he wasn't in.

                        MARSHA
            Just give me the envelope.

                        PUPKIN
            When did he go in?

                        MARSHA
            Ten minutes ago! That's when.

                        PUPKIN
            You sure?

                        MARSHA
            Look, I saw him my ...

                        PUPKIN
            And he hasn't come out?

                        MARSHA
            I've been standing right here.      Now
            how about it?

     PUPKIN turns and goes back into the building.       MARSHA yells
     after him.

                        MARSHA
            I'm staying right here!

56   INT:   RECEPTION AREA OF THE JERRY LANGFORD OFFICES

     PUPKIN enters briskly and goes up to the RECEPTIONIST.

                        PUPKIN
                  (with authority)
            Tell Jerry Langford I'm here, please.

                        RECEPTIONIST
            I'm sorry, sir. Mr. Langford's not in.

                        PUPKIN
            I happen to know he is.      So would you

            please tell him I'm here.

                         RECEPTIONIST
            I'm sorry.   He's not in.

                        PUPKIN
            You're putting your job on the line,
            lady.

     The RECEPTIONIST starts making a call inside. PUPKIN
     glances at her and walks right in to the inner corridors.
     He starts peering into the open doors of the offices that
     line the corridor. The whole place is like a gigantic
     maze. OFFICE PERSONNEL pass by him, taking no notice of
     him. He continues wandering around desperately, completely
     lost. A few beat later, he spots WIRTZ leading a pair of
     SECURITY GUARDS. PUPKIN keeps peering into offices quickly
     as he flees. The GUARDS and WIRTZ finally catch up to
     PUPKIN at the steno pool and, after a brief chase around
     the pool, they catch PUPKIN and subdue him. They start
     dragging him out past the eyes of the OFFICE PERSONNEL.

                        PUPKIN
                  (calling as he is dragged)
            Jerry! Jerry! (to WIRTZ) You're
            going the have a hell of a lot of
            explaining to do! (calling) Jerry!

                        WIRTZ
            You had your warning, Mr. Krupkin.

                         PUPKIN
            Jerry!   Help me. Jerry!

     A CLOSE-UP of PUPKIN as he is dragged out.

57   EXT:   LANGFORD BUILDING LOBBY AND EXIT - DAY

     WE WATCH the SECURITY GUARDS and WIRTZ pitch PUPKIN out
     into the street.

                        WIRTZ
            If we see your face again, Mr. Pupkin,
            we'll call the police.

                        PUPKIN
            Start looking for a new job!

     MARSHA comes straight up to PUPKIN who is brushing himself
     off. His eyes are glazed and distant.

                         MARSHA
            Well?

                         PUPKIN
            Huh?

                        MARSHA
            Does he have it?

                        PUPKIN
                  (abstractedly)
            Don't worry. I'll get it to him.

                         MARSHA
            Yeah?   When?

     There is a pause.

                        PUPKIN
            This weekend. He asked me to go out
            there, to his house.

58   THE BAR-RESTAURANT WHERE RITA WORKS - DAY

     PUPKIN enters the bar-restaurant. Through the window WE
     SEE him talking to RITA. He is voluble, animated. She
     looks skeptical, with a wry smile on her face. Finally WE
     WATCH him extract an answer from her. She shrugs, smiles
     and says yes. He comes walking out the door, his hounded
     expression softened by a smile.

59   INT:   THE FITTING AREA OF A MEN'S STORE - DAY

61   INT:   CARTIER'S JEWELERS - DAY

     WE WATCH PUPKIN perusing the beautiful diamond, sapphire,
     and emerald rings and we take a few moments to PAN OVER
     these beautiful jewels as he sees them. Finally, he picks
     out a splendid ring with a single, middle-sized sapphire
     and hands a surprised SALESLADY the money in cash.

                                  CUT TO:

62   INT:   SUBURBAN TRAIN - DAY

     PUPKIN and RITA are seated side by side. Since it is
     Saturday morning, the train is sparsely populated. A
     CONDUCTOR has just finished taking PUPKIN's tickets. RITA
     is edgy. PUPKIN is strangely calm and a little remote.
     He is wearing his new suit.

                        RITA
            What are we going to do?

                        PUPKIN
                  (patiently)
            Look, I told you, I've got some work
            to discuss with him. That's all.

                        RITA
            But what about me?

                        PUPKIN
            You're with me.

                        RITA
            That's fine, but while you two are
            talking, what am I going to do?

                        PUPKIN
            You can chat with the other guests.

                        RITA
            I'm sure they'll be thrilled hearing
            about the wonderful world of draft beer.
            (pause) Let's tell 'em I'm a model,
            okay?

                          PUPKIN
            What?

                        RITA
            If they ask what I do, let's just say
            I model. You don't mind pretending
            just a little, do you?

                        PUPKIN
            If it make you feel better.

     There is a pause.

                           RITA
            This is    a gas! Too bad nobody'll
            believe    it. (pause) After you guys
            are done    working, what happens? Are
            we going    out someplace, or what?

                        PUPKIN
            I'm sure Jerry has something arranged.

     There is another pause.

                           RITA
            What do    these people do for fun?
            Do they    party or do freaky things
            or just    get drunk or ... I mean,
            What do    they do?

                        PUPKIN
            I guess they just sit around and talk
            and enjoy each other's company, like
            anybody else.

                        RITA
            Talk?!? What can you talk about
            for three or four hours?!

                           PUPKIN
            What do    you mean? They've got plenty
            to talk    about. They do things.    All
            kinds of    interesting things happen
            to them    and then they talk about them.
            What do    you think Jerry's show is all
            about?

                        RITA
            Yeah, a cocktail party with no drinks.
            That's what all those shows are. At
            least they help you get to sleep.

     There is a pause.

                        RITA
                  (glumly)
            Boy, this is going to be some great
            weekend.   I thought we were gonna
            have some fun.

                        PUPKIN
                  (smiling)
            Just take it easy, Rita.     Everything's
            going to be fine.

     WE MOVE IN for a CLOSE-UP of PUPKIN who is fading out.

                                      FADE TO:

63   EXT:   A NEO-CLASSICAL MANSION

     It is a large white house with colonial columns set in the
     middle of a palatial estate whose rolling lawns are
     punctuated with fine old trees. We circle around to the
     back where LANGFORD, a handful of his FRIENDS (which can be
     familiar television celebrities) and PUPKIN and RITA are
     just finishing a lavish lunch on the patio. A pair of
     SERVANTS are clearing the table and serving the coffee and
     desert as the scene unfolds. As we arrive, we hear a loud
     burst of laughter. PUPKIN is regaling the COMPANY with

stories.

                 PUPKIN
     Oh, you have no idea how bad it's
     gotten in New York. Now the muggers
     are so efficient that, each time
     they jump you, they take your name
     and address and put you on a mailing
     list. (the COMPANY chuckles) And
     once you're on the list, you're in
     real trouble, like this friend of
     mine who was mugged thirty-two times
     on his way home from work. (a little
     laughter from the COMPANY)

A SERVANT places the desert, a little, elegant tart, in
front of PUPKIN and RITA.

                 PUPKIN
           (to SERVANT)
     Thanks.

The SERVANT smiles. As PUPKIN continues his story, he
glances occasionally at RITA who has begun to nibble at her
tart. PUPKIN also glances conspiratorially at LANGFORD
who smiles back.

                 PUPKIN
     So what my friend does is get himself
     a dog, one of those huge German
     Shepherds. One night, he's walking
     the dog in Central Park when he hears
     this voice behind him. (in a German
     accent) Okay, Harry, drop your
     vallet and keep your hantz over your
     head or I bite your little fanny off.

The COMPANY breaks up.

                 ONE GUEST
           (to LANGFORD)
     Looks like you've found yourself a
     winner, Jerry.

                 LANGFORD
           (looking at PUPKIN)
     He's the one who found himself
     a winner.

RITA looks up, smiles and blushes. The rest of the COMPANY
smiles benignly and grows attentive as RITA returns to
eating her tart. Suddenly she bites down on something
hard. She fishes it out of her mouth and looks at it. The
COMPANY giggles. It is the ring PUPKIN purchased at
Cartier's. The COMPANY applauds lightly and laughs.
LANGFORD lifts his wine glass.

                 LANGFORD

            To Rita and Rupert -- a short engagement
            and a long, happy marriage.

     The COMPANY drinks with murmurs of "Hear! Hear!"   RITA
     and PUPKIN beam. RITA looks lovingly at PUPKIN.

                        A SECOND GUEST
                  (the PUPKIN)
            Have you set a date?

                        PUPKIN
                  (looking pointedly at LANGFORD)
            Oh, yes.

                        A THIRD GUEST
            I hope we're all invited.

                        PUPKIN
            Everyone's invited.

                                   CUT TO:

64   INT:   THE LANGFORD TELEVISION STUDIO

     The theater is packed. World Series bunting hangs from the
     balcony and the front of the stage. We hear RICK ROSS and
     the ORCHESTRA strike up Mendelssohn's Wedding March.   Down
     one aisle walks RITA, accompanied by the MAN whom PUPKIN
     hit over the head at the bar. Down the other aisle marches
     PUPKIN, accompanied by LANGFORD. The AUDIENCE cheers
     wildly. The two COUPLES walk to the stage where a white-
     haired OFFICIAL awaits them. BERT CANTER stands at his
     side. PUPKIN and RITA disengage from their ESCORTS and
     stand before the OFFICIAL. The music stops and the
     AUDIENCE grows quiet.

                        OFFICIAL
            We are met here in these extraordinary
            circumstances to join this man and this
            woman in holy wedlock. But, before we
            begin, let me voice a personal word
            of thanks to you, Rupert and to you,
            Rita, for choosing me to perform this
            prestigious ceremony. Because we are
            on prime time, I am going to discard
            my customary remarks in favor of a
            few personal reflections.   When I was
            principal at Clifton High and these
            two were students, I had very little
            faith that Rupert here would amount
            to very much. But like his teachers
            and his fellow students, I underestimated
            this fine young man.   Some say that
            this misjudgment is directly tied to my
            recent dismissal as head of the Clifton
            School System. But let me take this
            opportunity to set the record straight.
            Knowing that Rupert and Rita here were

            most certainly destined for a great
            career and a lifetime of happiness,
            I voluntarily stepped down. I would
            only here add my own wishes to those
            of millions of viewers for their
            continued health, wealth and
            boundless success.

     The OFFICIAL looks quickly past RITA and PUPKIN.

                        OFFICIAL
            We'll be back to marry them in a minute,
            right after this word.

                                     FADE TO:

65   INT:   THE TRAIN - DAY

     PUPKIN and RITA are seated as they were.      We hear the
     CONDUCTOR calling.

                          CONDUCTOR'S VOICE
            Greenwich.    Greenwich next stop.
            Greenwich.

     PUPKIN and RITA grab their small suitcases and quickly move
     down the aisle towards the door.

                                     CUT TO:

66   INT:   A SUBURBAN TAXI - DAY

     RITA is peering out the window.     PUPKIN is still lost in
     thought.

                        RITA
            Look at that one. How'd you like to
            live in that?!?! Or that one! What
            do you figure these run?

     The taxi stops in front of a walled lot behind which is
     visible a handsome English stucco home.

                        PUPKIN
                  (to DRIVER)
            What's this?

                          DRIVER
            This is it.

                        RITA
            It's gorgeous!

     PUPKIN is genuinely puzzled.

                        PUPKIN
                  (to DRIVER)
            You sure?

                        DRIVER
            Look, friend, I wouldn't want to
            tell you how many times I made this
            trip.   (pause)    That'll be three
            seventy-five.

     PUPKIN, still puzzled, hands him a five dollar bill.

                        PUPKIN
                  (abstractedly)
            Keep it.

     The DRIVER gets out and puts PUPKIN and RITA's bags,
     which he had stacked on the front seat, onto the sidewalk.

                        DRIVER
            Thanks. If you need a ride back,
            just ask the guy for Wayne. That's me.

     The CAMERA PULLS BACK as PUPKIN opens the gate and he and
     RITA walk up the drive.

                                     CUT TO:

67   EXT:   LANGFORD'S HOUSE - DAY

     PUPKIN and RITA stand before the front door. PUPKIN rings,
     After a few beats, the door is opened by an Indonesian
     HOUSEBOY. PUPKIN walks in right past him, RITA following
     behind.

                                     CUT TO:

68   INT:   LANGFORD'S HOUSE - DAY

     PUPKIN hands the HOUSEBOY the two suitcases as he talks.

                        PUPKIN
            You must be Jonno. I'm Rupert Pupkin
            and this is Rita Keane. Mr. Langford's
            expecting us.

     Jonno nods politely but uncertainly.

                        JONNO
                  (uncertain)
            Mr. Langford asked you to come?

                        PUPKIN
            That's right. Would you mind
            taking those up? Jerry and I have
            some work that may oblige me to
            stay overnight.

                        JONNO
            But Mr. Langford's not here.

                        PUPKIN
            Out playing golf, right?

                        JONNO
                  (still puzzled and unsure)
            That's right.

                        PUPKIN
            Maybe he'll finally break a hundred.

                        JONNO
            Maybe it's better if you came back ...

                        PUPKIN
                  (interrupting)
            That's alright. We don't mind waiting.

     PUPKIN walks from the foyer into the living-room, leaving
     JONNO staring after him holding the bags. RITA walks into
     the living room after PUPKIN.

                        RITA
                  (worried)
            The table's only set for one.

                        PUPKIN
            That's from breakfast.     Relax, will
            you?

                                     CUT TO:

69   INT:   LANGFORD'S KITCHEN - DAY

     JONNO is on the phone.   A black lady COOK stands at his
     side.

                        JONNO
                  (into the phone)
            Let me talk to Jerry Langford please
            ... I know he is ... It's important.

                                     CUT TO:

70   INT:   LANGFORD'S LIVING ROOM - DAY

     It is a handsomely furnished room, done in old American
     antiques and other tasteful pieces. There is a grand piano
     heavy with pictures in one corner and wall-to-wall
     bookshelves that are mostly full and mixed with a balance
     of classics and modern popular reading. The whole room
     marks LANGFORD as a man of discernment. The shelves also
     house a fine stereo and a small, discreet bar. RITA and
     PUPKIN walk in like strangers in paradise, awed by the
     obvious elegance and expense the room reflects.

                        PUPKIN
                  (as though he owned it)
            How do you like it?

                 RITA
           (admiringly)
     I could live here.

                 PUPKIN
           (smiling proudly)
     It's the only way to live.

RITA stands in the center of the room, ill at ease, while
PUPKIN strolls about comfortably, picking up an ashtray
here, a cigarette case there, inspecting the artifacts for
inscriptions, clues, hints about LANGFORD's character and
life.

                 RITA
     How come he isn't here?

                 PUPKIN
     You heard the guy.     He's out playing
     golf.

                 RITA
     Didn't you tell him when we'd get here?

PUPKIN continues to move about the room, fielding RITA's
suspicious inquiries effortlessly.

                 PUPKIN
     We didn't have time to iron out the
     details. Now just relax. We're
     the first guests, that's all.

                 RITA
           (interrupting)
     That Jonno character hadn't even
     heard of us!

                 PUPKIN
           (a little irritated)
     It probably slipped Jerry's mind.
     He has better things to think about
     than what he tells his houseboy.

                 RITA
     It's just not time way I expected it,
     that's all.

There is a pause. PUPKIN continues his investigation.      He
has moved to the grand piano in the rear of the room.

                 RITA
     What do we do now?

PUPKIN is looking    at a picture of an American Gothic couple
standing in front    of a wood-frame house. As he comments on
the pictures, the    CAMERA PANS over them. They form a kind
of slide-show of    LANGFORD's life.

                 PUPKIN
     These are Jerry's parents. His father
     runs the Post office in Wolverine --
     that's in North Dakota.

PUPKIN then fixes on a picture of an eleven-year-old boy
standing next to a puppet stage with a puppet (obviously
held by the boy) staring at its master.

                 PUPKIN
     This one was in Newsweek. He started
     giving these puppet shows when he was
     still in grade school.

WE SEE a picture of a very young LANGFORD seated before a
microphone with some celebrity.

                 PUPKIN
     And this is from his quiz show in
     St. Louis. Can you believe it?

                   RITA
     Sure I can.

                 PUPKIN
     That was the name of the show.

WE MOVE to a picture of LANGFORD smiling at JACK PAAR.

                 PUPKIN
     And here's when he wrote for Jack
     Paar. He made a hundred and fifty
     a week and look at him now.

Another picture of LANGFORD with a group of women sitting
in a studio.

                 PUPKIN
     And this is his morning show.

A picture of LANGFORD standing in a park with his two boys,
eleven and eight.

                 PUPKIN
     And his kids. He's divorced.

RITA, who has been only half-listening, has picked up a
small, beautifully enameled cigarette box.

                 RITA
     Look at this. I love these kind of
     things. Look at the work.   I've got
     this thing about boxes.

RITA puts it down reluctantly, picks it up, then puts it
down again.

                                    CUT TO:

71   INT:   THE KITCHEN - DAY

     JONNO is holding the phone, waiting.     The COOK stands,
     looking at him.

                        JONNO
            Mr. Langford? ... I'm sorry to
            disturb you ...

                                    CUT TO:

72   INT:   THE LIVING ROOM - DAY

     RITA has just finished fixing herself a drink. She takes a
     large sip and starts pacing around. PUPKIN is seated.

                        RITA
            How much longer are we gonna have
            to wait?

                        PUPKIN
            I don't know. Until he gets back.

                        RITA.
            Do we have to just sit here?

                        PUPKIN
            He should be back pretty soon.

                        RITA
            Doesn't he have any music or anything?
            Let's get a little life into this place.
            It's like a funeral parlor.

     She walks over to the stereo and opens the cupboard beneath
     it, revealing rows and rows of records.

                        RITA
            This is more like it.

     She pulls out a record.

                        PUPKIN
            Come on, Rita.

                        RITA
            Come on, yourself.

     She puts the record on. Frank Sinatra starts singing "They
     Can't Take That Away From Me." She takes a big sip of her
     drink, puts it down and comes over to PUPKIN.

                        RITA
            How about a little spin, handsome?

                       PUPKIN

                    (pulling back)
            Here?

     RITA snuggles into PUPKIN and starts dancing him around.
     He resists feebly.

                        RITA
            Come on, Rupert.      I came up here for
            a good time.

     PUPKIN gives in and starts      dancing with her in the    style of
     the 1950's, elbow out, arm      up, box step. After a     few
     moments, PUPKIN closes his      eyes. He has reached a     moment
     of perfect bliss, his dream      girl in is arms. They     dance
     silently as we hear Sinatra      singing.

                        SINATRA'S VOICE
            The way you wore your hat,
            The way we danced till three,
            The memory of all that --
            Oh no, they can't take that away from me,
            No ... they can't take that away ...
            from ... me.

     The orchestra plays.

                        RITA
            You never could dance, could you?

                        PUPKIN
            How would you know?

                        RITA
            Oh I danced with you a couple of
            times -- at the Sigma U party.

                        PUPKIN
            You were there with Tommy Winston.

                        RITA
            You didn't ask me.

                        PUPKIN
            That's the one time I did ask you
            and you went with him anyway.

                        RITA
            Well, I couldn't go with you!

                         PUPKIN
            Why not?

                        RITA
            Be serious, Rupert.

73   INT:   THE DINING ROOM - DAY

     JONNO stands a few feet from the kitchen door, staring at
     RITA and PUPKIN dancing in the living room, an unbelieving,
     anxious expression on his face.

                                    CUT TO:

74   INT:   THE LIVING ROOM - DAY

     The music has stopped momentarily and PUPKIN and RITA
     disengage. PUPKIN looks lovingly at RITA.

                        PUPKIN
            Well, it's all ended happily and
            that's what counts.

     RITA grows jumpy under his gaze.      She looks around.

                        RITA
            I wonder what the rest of this
            place looks like?

                        PUPKIN
            I'm sure it's all very nice.

                        RITA
                  (gaily)
            Well, there's only one way to find out.

     RITA scampers over to the stairs and pauses on the first
     step.

                        RITA
            You coming or not?

     RITA bounds up the stairs.

                       PUPKIN
            Rita!

     CAMERA FOLLOWS PUPKIN up the stairs.

75   INT:   UPSTAIRS - DAY

     There is no sign of RITA.

                        PUPKIN
            Where are you?

     There is no answer. CAMERA FOLLOWS PUPKIN from room to
     room. They are all guest rooms, neat, pretty, clean.

                        PUPKIN
            Come on, Rita. This isn't funny.

     Finally, PUPKIN opens the door to another room.

76   INT:   A BEDROOM - DAY

     It is clearly LANGFORD's bedroom with a few clothes strewn
     about, and other signs of being lived in. RITA lies on the
     bed.

                        PUPKIN
                  (shocked)
            What are you doing, Rita?

                        RITA
            I love it! All those millions of
            women out there dying to change
            places with me right now.

                         PUPKIN
            Come on.   We shouldn't be here.

                        RITA
            Relax, will you. Let me have a
            little fun, for Christ's sake.

     RITA gets off the bed and runs into the john.

                                    CUT TO:

77   INT:   A LAVISH BATHROOM - DAY

                        RITA
            Look at this. It's nicer than my
            whole apartment.

     PUPKIN enters the large, beautifully done bathroom.   RITA
     examines her face in the mirror.

                        PUPKIN
                  (urgently)
            Let's go, Rita.

                        RITA
            Boy, I really need some sun.

                        PUPKIN
            Rita, this is Jerry's ...

                        RITA
            Lay off, will you, Rupert.

                        PUPKIN
            But we have no right ...

     RITA picks up a can of shave cream and squirts a large
     dollop in PUPKIN's face. WE COME IN for a CLOSE UP of
     PUPKIN's face, buried under shaving cream.

                        PUPKIN
            That wasn't funny, Rita.

     RITA hands him a towel.

                         RITA
            Here.

     She looks around.

                        RITA
            Now for something that smells nice.

     She swings open the cabinet with a flourish. The door
     swings open violently and the mirror shatters against
     something as pills and bottles tumble into the sink.
     PUPKIN and RITA stand there, staring at each other. RITA
     begins to laugh, but her laugh is cut short by the slam of
     the downstairs door.

                                     CUT TO:

78   INT:   THE FOYER

     LANGFORD has entered, drawn and businesslike.       JONNO and

                  (looking around)
            Where are they?

                        JONNO
            I was going to call the police but
            then I thought to myself 'what if
            they are Mr. Langford's friends?'

     We hear some whispers and scuffling at the top of the
     stairs. LANGFORD, JONNO and the COOK look up. PUPKIN
     comes bounding down the stairs jauntily with RITA following
     cautiously behind. PUPKIN has large traces of shaving
     cream behind his ears and on his neck.

                         PUPKIN
            Hi, Jerry.   We were just freshening up.

     PUPKIN stops at the base of the stairs, turns around, and
     waves RITA down.

                        PUPKIN
                  (to RITA)
            Come on, Rita. No need to be shy.

     PUPKIN smiles conspiratorially at LANGFORD.       RITA comes
     slowly down.

                        PUPKIN
            Jerry, I'd like you to meet Rita
            Keane. Rita, say hello to Jerry!

                 RITA
           (tentatively)
     Pleased to meet you.

LANGFORD nods imperceptibly, his face tense, his eyes
alert. RITA, reading her frigid reception, looks to
PUPKIN who walks blithely past LANGFORD into the living
room, toward the bar.

                 PUPKIN
     What's your pleasure?

PUPKIN glances at the small mess he has left on the bar and
turns back to LANGFORD who has moved into the living room
with JONNO and the COOK a few steps behind. PUPKIN flashes
LANGFORD an apologetic smile.

                 PUPKIN
           (to LANGFORD)
     We've already taken the liberty, so
     to speak. Rita was a little nervous.
     It isn't every day she meets someone
     like you.

                 LANGFORD
     What's going on here?

                 PUPKIN
     We've been sitting around, waiting.
     That's all. How was your golf game?

                 JONNO
     I told them you weren't here.

                 COOK
     That's right.

                 PUPKIN
     He did, Jerry. He was very helpful.
     We had to take an early train. There
     was nothing else until after one.
     (pause) I brought the material.
     It's upstairs, in my bags. (pause)
     Where is everybody?

                 LANGFORD
     Who?

                 PUPKIN
     The other guests! (in a confidential
     tone) We're getting a little hungry,
     to tell you the truth.

                 LANGFORD
           (as though confirming
           what PUPKIN said)
     You are.

                 PUPKIN
           (backing off)
     But we don't mind waiting, do we,
     Rita?

RITA says nothing. She has sensed something terribly
wrong and is slowly backing away from PUPKIN.

                 LANGFORD
     You know, I could have you arrested,
     both of you.

                 PUPKIN
           (seizing the idea)
     You know you could! And there'd be
     absolutely no way we could prove we
     belonged here. I never thought of that.

                 LANGFORD
     Well, you should have before you ...

                 PUPKIN
           (still fixed on the idea)
     Maybe we could work up a routine
     about that, about a guy who throws
     all his friends in jail. Let's talk
     about that.

                 LANGFORD
           (sharply)
     Let's not.

                 PUPKIN
     Sure, Jerry. Whatever you ...

                 LANGFORD
           (exasperated)
     Look, if you've got something for
     me to sign, let's have it and get
     it over with so I can get back ...

                 PUPKIN
           (interrupting)
     That wouldn't be right, Jerry.
     Not in your own house!

                 LANGFORD
           (summoning his last
           bit of patience)
     I have a lot of work to get to.
     (to JONNO) How did they get here?

                 PUPKIN
     We took a taxi, Jerry ... But don't
     worry about us. You go ahead and
     do your work and we'll just take a
     stroll around until lunch is ready.

                 LANGFORD
     You're a little thick, aren't you?

                 PUPKIN
           (smiling as though complimented)
     Well, maybe a ...

                 RITA
     What's he's saying, Rupert, is that he
     wants us out.

                 PUPKIN
     Don't listen to her, Jerry. She
     doesn't understand anything about us.

                 RITA
     Don't get me into this.

                 LANGFORD
           (to JONNO)
     Call the station.

JONNO goes back into the foyer, followed by the COOK.

                 LANGFORD
     There'll be a cab here in a few
     minutes. Now if you'll just wait
     at the gate ...

                 PUPKIN
     Look, Jerry, if I've said anything
     out of line, let's chalk it up to
     inexperience, okay? I'll just go
     upstairs and get my tape and we can
     start working. It shouldn't take
     long and then you'll have the rest of
     the afternoon to yourself.

                 LANGFORD
     I've told you just as clearly as I
     can. I want you out of here and I
     want you out now. Scram, beat it,
     vamoose, out! Is that plain enough!

RITA deftly pockets the enamel box.

                 PUPKIN
     But what about my material?    When
     are we going to go over it?

                 RITA
     Come on, Rupert, the man wants us
     to go.

                 PUPKIN
     Tell her she's wrong, Jerry!

                 RITA
     Look, Mr. Langford. I didn't know
     anything about all this. I hardly
     know this guy. I haven't seen him
     in years.

                 PUPKIN
     Rita!

                 RITA
     So if there's anything I can do, any
     way I can make this up to you.

                 PUPKIN
     She's nothing, Jerry. She's just
     some girl who works in a bar.
     Don't let her spoil things.

LANGFORD starts herding RITA and PUPKIN towards the door.

                  LANGFORD
     Come on.   Let's go.

                 PUPKIN
     All I'm asking is fifteen minutes.
     That's all. Just long enough to
     listen to my act. Is that asking
     too much -- fifteen minutes of your
     day against my whole life?

                 LANGFORD
     I'll call the police if I have to.

LANGFORD realizes he is being hard.    He stops for a moment.

                 LANGFORD
     I have my own life, that's all.

                 PUPKIN
     But what about me, Jerry? What about
     my life? I made plans -- based on
     what you said. You can't just turn
     your back on me.

                 LANGFORD
     I'm not telling you again.

There is a long pause as the truth finally sinks in. PUPKIN
just stares at LANGFORD with disbelief that turns to anger.

                 PUPKIN
     So this is the way it   works when
     you're big, huh? You    just play with
     people. Is that part    of the kick,
     Jerry? (pause) I can     see I was all
     wrong about you. All    wrong.

RITA starts tugging at PUPKIN.

                        RITA
            Come on, Rupert.

                        PUPKIN
                  (to RITA)
            Shut up! (to LANGFORD) You weren't
            my friend at all, were you? You were
            just playing some kind of game with me.
            Well, that's not going to stop me,
            Jerry. I'm just going to work a
            little bit harder, that's all, use a
            little bit more enterprise. And not
            count on anybody. That's where I
            made my mistake. I can see that now.

     PUPKIN picks up the pair of small suitcases.

                        PUPKIN
                  (glaring at LANGFORD)
            Come on, Rita. We're wasting our time.

                                   CUT TO:

79   EXT.   LANGFORD'S FRONT DOOR - DAY

     PUPKIN strides out with RITA following.     She casts LANGFORD
     an apologetic glance as she goes. The     door slams behind
     them. They walk down the path silently     for a few moments
     as the CAMERA PULLS UP, following them    in an OVERHEAD SHOT.
     We hear them start talking as they make    their way towards
     the gate.

                        RITA
                  (baffled and angry)
            What did you think was going to
            happen? You think he'd just ... ?
            What's the matter with you? (pause)
            You can't just walk into a guy's
            house! And what about me? What
            did you ...

                        PUPKIN
                  (interrupting in a calm
                  but firm voice)
            Shut up, Rita. I'm thinking.

                                   CUT TO:

80   EXT:   OUTSIDE THE U.N. PLAZA - DAY

                                   CUT TO:

81   INT:   A NEW MERCEDES BENZ - DAY

     MARSHA sits at the wheel of this lavishly appointed sedan,
     her face made up as though she were going to a fancy party.
     PUPKIN sits on the other side of the front seat. His ex-

pression has changed somewhat from the PUPKIN we have seen.
He is less wide-eyed, less innocent, tougher.

                 MARSHA
           (whining)
     How much longer?!?

                 PUPKIN
     Do you want him or not?

There is a pause.

                 MARSHA
     You sure he's in there?

                    PUPKIN
     Certain.

                 MARSHA
           (with obvious delight)
     My parents are going to be furious!

PUPKIN pulls a toy revolver from his jacket pocket and looks
it over. MARSHA glances at it.

                 MARSHA
     It looks real.

                 PUPKIN
     That's the whole point. (gesturing
     with his head towards the entrance
     of the building which is some 50 yards
     away) Pay attention.

MARSHA looks towards the entrance.   A few beats pass.

                 MARSHA
     What if he doesn't come down?

                    PUPKIN
     He will.

                 MARSHA
     But what if he doesn't?

                 PUPKIN
     We'll come back tomorrow.

                 MARSHA
     And wait again?

                 PUPKIN
     Look, you're going to have him all
     to yourself. What else do you want?

A MAN resembling LANGFORD walks out the entrance.

                    PUPKIN

            Is that him?!?

                        MARSHA
            No.

                        PUPKIN
            You sure?

                        MARSHA
            Sure I'm sure. That looks too much
            like him.

                        PUPKIN
            What do you mean?

                        MARSHA
            When it's him it doesn't look like him.

                        PUPKIN
            Keep watching.

     PUPKIN closes his eyes and rests for a moment.

                        MARSHA
            That's him.

     PUPKIN's eyes snap open. WE SEE LANGFORD, concealed in his
     trench coat, dark glasses and tightly pulled cap start walking
     east.

                        MARSHA
            What should I do?

                        PUPKIN
            Wait a second and follow him.

                                      CUT TO:

82   EXT:   A STREET GOING EAST - DAY

     LANGFORD is walking innocently towards his offices.      The
     Mercedes prowls a quarter of a block behind.

                                      CUT TO:

83   INT:   THE MERCEDES - DAY

                        MARSHA
            What about here?

                         PUPKIN
            Too busy.   Keep going.

                                      CUT TO:

84   EXT:   ANOTHER EASTBOUND STREET - DAY

     LANGFORD continues walking.      The street is practically

     empty.

                                    CUT TO:

85   INT:     MERCEDES - DAY

                        PUPKIN
            Go past him and stop.

                                    CUT TO:

86   EXT:     THE SAME EASTBOUND STREET - DAY

     WE STAY with LANGFORD as he walks.  WE SEE the Mercedes
     pull past him. Suddenly PUPKIN is IN THE FRAME, walking
     side by side with LANGFORD.

                        PUPKIN
            Just keep walking or I'll kill
            you right here.

     LANGFORD looks at PUPKIN in terror.        He falters a bit, out
     of fear.

                        PUPKIN
            I said keep walking. This is a gun
            in my pocket and I've got nothing
            to lose.

                        LANGFORD
                  (who keeps walking)
            What do you want?

                        PUPKIN
            Just keep walking and don't talk
            to anybody. I'll tell you what
            to do.

     A MAN    coming the other way stops and stares at LANGFORD
     out of    curiosity. PUPKIN and LANGFORD keep walking. They
     get to    where the Mercedes is waiting. PUPKIN jabs LANGFORD
     in the    ribs with the gun.

                         PUPKIN
            Get in!

                        LANGFORD
            Look, this is ...

                        PUPKIN
                  (interrupting)
            Just shut up and get in.

     LANGFORD gets in the front seat.     PUPKIN follows.

                                    CUT TO:

87   INT:     THE MERCEDES - DAY

     LANGFORD moves to the middle of the front seat.

                         MARSHA
            Hi, Jerry.

     LANGFORD looks over and recognizes MARSHA.        A CLOSE UP
     records his reaction of sheer terror.

                                   CUT TO:

88   EXT:   A BROWNSTONE-LINED STREET IN THE EAST EIGHTIES - DAY

     WE SEE LANGFORD get out of the Mercedes which is parked in
     front of a fire hydrant. LANGFORD follows MARSHA into a
     brownstone. PUPKIN walks behind LANGFORD.

                                   CUT TO:

89   INT:   MARSHA'S APARTMENT - DAY

     PUPKIN, LANGFORD and MARSHA enter. It is an absolutely
     stunning studio apartment, furnished lavishly by Marsha's
     parents for their daughter in antique furniture suitable
     for a woman of fifty. MARSHA has imprinted her own stamp
     on the apartment in two ways: First, the place is abso-
     lutely chaotic. Secondly, there are a number of blow-up
     pictures on the wall. A picture of LANGFORD sits on the
     bureau. There is a big brass bed with an ornate brass
     frame at the foot. LANGFORD stares at MARSHA and PUPKIN.
     PUPKIN closes the blinds and turns on the lights. MARSHA
     trains the gun on LANGFORD. PUPKIN finishes his work and
     takes the gun back.

                        PUPKIN
            I didn't like being so rough out
            there, Jerry. But I wanted you to
            know that I meant business. I didn't
            want anything happening to you over
            some misunderstanding.

     LANGFORD just stares at him, frozen with fear.

                        PUPKIN
            Now I know you're wondering    what
            this is all about. Actually     you've
            got nothing to worry about.     You
            just do what I tell you and    by, say,
            midnight, you'll be safe and    out of
            here. Of course if you try     anything
            clever, I'll kill you -- or    Marsha
            will. She knows how to use     this too.

                        LANGFORD
            You realize what you're saying.

                        PUPKIN
            Come on, Jerry. This isn't a spur

            of the moment thing.    Give me a little
            credit, will you.

     PUPKIN looks over to a small phone table with a chair next
     to it. He motions to it with his head.

                        PUPKIN
                  (to LANGFORD)
            Sit down.

     LANGFORD docilely sits by the phone.

                        PUPKIN
            Now, you're going to call your
            office and tell them this: that
            unless a man who identifies himself as
            the King is allowed on the show
            tonight as the first guest, they'll
            never see you alive again.

                       LANGFORD
            What?

                        PUPKIN
            I'll say it again ...

90   INT:   BERT THOMAS' OFFICE     - DAY

     It is a large office in two pieces. A SECRETARY sits in
     the smaller part next to the door of the larger section.
     Her phone is ringing. She answers.

            Bert Thomas! ... He's in a meeting,
            Mr. Langford ... I see.

91   INT:   A CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

     THOMAS, a young, trim executive in his late thirties, in
     modish dress, sits at the table with several other PEOPLE,
     including CATHY LONG. They are sipping coffee from con-
     tainers. There are memos and lists and other papers on
     the table. The SECRETARY stands at the doorway. THOMAS
     and the others are looking up at her.

            Yeah? Well, tell him I'll call him

            stop the bullshit ... what? ...
            Okay, I'm listening.

     to concern bordering on alarm.

            there. Tell him we'll do     anything he
            wants. Tell him to cool     it. Are you

     LANGFORD is standing awkwardly in the middle of the room,
     wearing a sweater that matches the patch of cloth we saw
     in the envelope MARSHA gave PUPKIN. PUPKIN is still
     training his pistol on LANGFORD and MARSHA is appraising
     the fit.

            No, he can not call me back. Don't

            ... NONE OF YOUR BUSINESS!

                                      CUT TO:

98   INT:   MARSHA'S APARTMENT - DAY

LANGFORD is seated on a chair whose back is pressed right
up against the high, ornate brass bedstead at the foot of
the bed. MARSHA trains the gun on LANGFORD now. PUPKIN
is unpacking a suitcase. He takes out a handsome blue suit,
ruffled shirt, a bow tie, black shoes, underwear, socks,
shaving equipment, soap, a hairbrush, a clothesbrush, a
small shoe shine kit, aftershave lotion, deodorant and a
dozen or so rolls of inch-and-a-half wide adhesive tape.
He removes this stuff from a suitcase that is barely big
enough to hold it -- so the mere packing of all this para-
phernalia into such a small space represents something of an
achievement. As he takes the stuff out, he talks to
LANGFORD, his back turned to him.

                 PUPKIN
     This wasn't an easy decision for
     me, Jerry, believe me. For one
     thing, I knew it meant we could never
     be friends again and that hurt me.
     It's hard to lose a friend, even one
     who has let you down. You always
     hope you can patch things up. You
     know, a guy like me doesn't make
     friends that easily.

PUPKIN pauses a moment, then turns to LANGFORD, his voice
filled with emotion.

                 PUPKIN
     Why didn't you just listen to the
     tape when I asked you? Then I
     wouldn't have to be doing all this.
     Was it really too much to expect --
     a few minutes of your time to listen
     to something I'd worked on my whole
     life?

LANGFORD's eyes shift rapidly.   He is obviously calculating
how to deal with PUPKIN.

                 LANGFORD
           (with disarming charm)
     Hey, if that's what's bothering you,
     let's go over to my office and listen
     to that tape right now.

                 PUPKIN
     Are you crazy, Jerry? Do you know
     what would happen to me?

MARSHA listens to this exchange a bit nervously.   Gesturing
to her gun, she says:

                 MARSHA
     Am I going to have to hold this
     thing all day?

PUPKIN sees she has lowered it practically to her side.

                 PUPKIN
           (to MARSHA)
     Just keep it on him. (to LANGFORD)
     You know, Jerry. Friendship is a two-
     way street. All that time I was
     worrying about you and your ratings
     and everything, you couldn't have
     cared less about me.

LANGFORD thinks rapidly for a beat or two.

                 LANGFORD
     You're right. You know that? I
     was thoughtless. It's just that
     when you're doing a big show, it's
     hard to tell who your friends really
     are. I was wrong. I apologize.
     Why don't we just shake hands and
     forget the whole thing?

                 PUPKIN
           (suspiciously)
     That's easy to say, Jerry.

                 LANGFORD
     But I mean it. I'll tell     them that
     the whole thing was a joke    and then
     we can go to my office and    listen to
     that tape. Come on. What      do you say?

LANGFORD rises with his hand extended toward PUPKIN.

                 MARSHA
           (to LANGFORD, sharply)
     Sit down!

LANGFORD looks to PUPKIN.

                 MARSHA
     I said sit!

LANGFORD reluctantly sits down.

                 PUPKIN
           (to MARSHA)
     What's the matter?     You heard
     what he said.

                 MARSHA
     All of a sudden, with a gun on him,
     he wants to make up and be friends.
     And, once he's out the door, what
     happens then?

                 PUPKIN
     What happens then, Jerry?

                        MARSHA
            You get to his office and they
            jump you, that's what happens, Rupert.

                        PUPKIN
            She's right, Jerry.

                        LANGFORD
            Not if I tell them not to. This is
            Jerry, Rupert, I give you my word.

                        PUPKIN
                  (to MARSHA)
            He gives me his word.

                        MARSHA
            Yeah? And what else? Come on,
            Rupert, I'm sick of waiting.

                        PUPKIN
            And what else, Jerry?

                        LANGFORD
            Come on, Rupert. My word's good
            enough, isn't it.

     PUPKIN stares at LANGFORD for a few beats. Then he shakes
     his head sadly and says in a very quiet, discouraged voice.

                        PUPKIN
            No, Jerry. It's not. (to MARSHA)
            Keep the gun up!

     PUPKIN comes over to LANGFORD with a few rolls of adhesive
     tape in his hand.

                        PUPKIN
            I'm sorry to do it this way, Jerry,
            but I'm no good at knots. Just put
            your arms up and out, okay?

     LANGFORD spreads his arms back against the brass bedstead.
     As PUPKIN goes to tape them, LANGFORD tries to grab him,
     but, with sudden, demonic force, PUPKIN pins him against
     the bedstead. They are practically nose to nose.

                        PUPKIN
            Oh, no, Jerry. None of that.      Now
            hold still.

      PATTEN, and his assistant, GIARDELLO.   They are in the
      midst of debate.

             Look, I tell you, the bureau is doing
             everything possible to locate Mr.
             Langford. Right now our men are out
             checking out every radical group in
             this city.

                        AN EXECUTIVE
             Radical?

                         PATTEN
             They're willing to sacrifice their
             leader in order to get their message
             across, aren't they? You've got to
             figure that this is a desperate outfit.
             I don't know who they are anymore than
             you do. But I do know I've got to
             stop them. Otherwise, what you're
             seeing here is just the first of a
             whole wave of these kinds of kidnappings.

                         THOMAS

             show.

                         PATTEN
             I'm only saying, Mr. Thomas, that we
             can't allow this to reach the public.
             When the kidnappers call in, of course
             you're going to be cooperative.
             Promise them anything they want.
             After all, this King character is
             going to have to show up sooner or
             later. And once we get our hands

             is.

      Late afternoon. MARSHA is setting the dining room table
      for two. She talks as she works.

                         MARSHA
             I've got so much to tell you I just
             don't know what to begin with. Are
             you okay?

      LANGFORD mumbles incoherently through his gag and tape.

                         MARSHA
             Good. Tell me if you're not.
             I guess you're wondering why I do
             stuff like this. I think it's
             because I'm a Leo, but my shrink says
             I'm pathologically rebellious and
             self-destructive. You don't think
             I'm self-destructive, do you?

      LANGFORD, mummified, again mumbles and struggles a bit in
      his bonds.

                         MARSHA
             I knew you wouldn't. That's 'cause
             you're the only person in the world
             who really understands me.

CATHY LONG and three other EXECUTIVES.

                 CROCKETT
     Can Randall* sub for Jerry?

[*Tony Randall is one of any number of substitute hosts.]

                 THOMAS
     His agent's calling us back but it looks
     good. I only told him Jerry's sick.

                 CROCKETT
     Well, if worse comes to worse, Canter
     can always carry it. (to CATHY LONG)
     Let me see your list.

CATHY LONG hands CROCKETT a blue piece of paper.   He
glances over it quickly.

                 CROCKETT
     Any one of these a writer?

                 THOMAS
           (pointing to a name on
           the list)
     McCabe. The Vanishing Siberian Tiger.

                 CROCKETT
     He's out.

                 CATHY LONG
     What if we don't run this King guy?
     Who'll fill the time?

                 CROCKETT
     We'll stretch the other guests. But
     I think we're going to wind up running
     him. For one thing, we've got to think
     about Jerry.

                 FIRST EXECUTIVE
     And from a news point of view, we've
     got a responsibility to air this story.

                 CROCKETT
     Exactly, Lou. (pause) I mean, who
     would you rather watch -- some tiger
     expert or a live kidnapper.

                 A SECOND EXECUTIVE
     But nobody's going to know he's a
     kidnapper. They'll think we've gone
     crazy.

                 CROCKETT
     Then they'll read about it in the papers
     tomorrow and, believe me, tomorrow night,
     everyone in America will be watching

             Jerry talk about his experience. And
             he can put this King guy on rerun.

                         THOMAS
             You're going to put him on twice?

                         A THIRD EXECUTIVE
             What if his stuff's unusable?

                         SECOND EXECUTIVE
             And remember what Patten said about ...

             Hold on. (pause) We can always edit
             the guy. And, as for a wave of these
             things, I just don't buy the idea
             that there are that many people out
             there crazy enough to spend their
             lives in prison for a few minutes
             on television.

131   INT:   THE TELEVISION STUDIO - NIGHT

      The theme song is playing.   BERT CANTER stands off-camera

at one side of the stage before a microphone.

                 CANTER
     Now! Direct from New York! It's the
     Jerry Langford Show with guest host
     Tony Randall and his special guests
     -- Olympic swimmer Mark Spitz, pundit
     Gore Vidal, the one and only Zsa Zsa
     Gabor and another of Jerry's taped
     exclusives, an interview with Prince
     Ranier of Monaco. As always, Rick
     Ross and the Orchestra and me, Bert
     Canter. And now ... say hello to
     Tony!!!!!!

                            CUT TO:

An APPLAUSE sign flashes like crazy. The AUDIENCE cheers
wildly. In the back, we notice a handful of TACTICAL
PATROLMEN scattered about. RANDALL strides on stage
briskly, accepting the cheers of the crowd with his arms
raised. He nods and then his eyes fix on those hastily
written outsized cue cards. He reads them with a mixture
of professionalism and wry distance, wanting to disown the
words without seeming silly.

                 RANDALL
     Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.
     Thank you. Thank you very much. I
     have some sad news for you. Earlier
     today, my writing staff was executed
     in Central Park by the network firing
     squad so there'll be no sensational
     Randall monologue this evening.

The AUDIENCE cheers derisively.

                 RANDALL
     No embarrassing displays of emotion,
     please. (the AUDIENCE laughs) Instead,
     we're going to do something a little
     bit different this evening -- a lot
     different if you ask me. We're going
     to give you a glimpse into the future.
     It isn't often that you can call
     someone a sure thing in the entertainment
     business. After all, the verdict is
     always in your hands. But I think
     tonight, after you've met my first
     guest, you'll agree with me that he's
     destined for greatness -- in one way
     or another. So will you please give
     your warmest greeting to the newest
     King of Comedy, Rupert Pupkin!!!!

The music plays. The APPLAUSE sign flashes. The AUDIENCE
applauds heartily -- and nobody appears to fill the
spotlight at the edge of the wings. The spotlight holds

      for what seems like an eternity.

133   INT:   THE STAGE - NIGHT

      Finally after what seems like an eternity, PUPKIN emerges,
      straightening his jacket a bit and trying to crane the
      kinks out of his neck. He is a bit tense but very high
      and in full command. As he delivers his monologue, PUPKIN
      is more confident, comfortable and self-assured than we
      have ever seen him.

                         PUPKIN
             Good evening, ladies and gentleman.
             Let me introduce myself. My name is
             Rupert Pupkin. I was born in Clifton,
             New Jersey, which was not, at that
             time, a federal offense. (laughter)
             Is there anyone here from Clifton?
             (silence) Good. We can all relax.
             Now, I'd like to begin by saying that
             my parents were too poor to afford me
             a childhood but the fact is nobody is
             allowed to be really poor in Clifton.
             Once you fall below eleven thousand
             you're exiled to Passaic. My parents
             did, in fact, put down the first two
             payments on my childhood. Then they
             tried to return me to the hospital
             as defective.   But, like everyone else
             I grew up in large part thanks to my
             mother. If she was only here today
             I'd say, "Hey, mom. What are you
             doing here? You've been dead for
             nine years?" (laughter) You should
             have seen my mother. She was wonderful
             -- blonde, beautiful, intelligent,
             alcoholic. (laughter) We used to
             drink milk together after school.
             Mine was homogenized. Hers was loaded.
             (laughter) Once she was picked up for
             speeding. They clocked her doing fifty
             -- in our garage. (laughter) When
             they tested her they found that her
             alcohol was two per cent blood. They
             took away her license and she died
             shortly afterwards. We used to joke
             together Mom and me, until the tears
             would stream down her face and she'd

             throw up. (laughter) And who would
             clean it up? Not Dad. He was too
             busy down at O'Grady's throwing up on
             his own. In fact, until I was sixteen,
             I thought throwing up was a sign of
             maturity. While the other kids were
             off in the woods sneaking cigarettes, I
             was hiding behind the house with my
             fingers down my throat. (laughter)
             I never got anywhere until one day,
             my father caught me. Just as he was
             giving me a final kick in the stomach,
             for luck, I managed to heave all
             over his new shoes. "That's it,"
             I thought. "I've made it. I'm
             finally a man!" (laughter) As it
             turned out, that was the only time my
             father ever paid any real attention
             to me. He was usually too busy out
             in the park playing ball with my
             sister, Rose. And, today thanks to
             those many hours of practice, my
             sister Rose has grown into a fine man.
             (laughter) Me, I wasn't especially
             interested in athletics. The only
             exercise I ever got was when the
             other kids picked on me. They used
             to beat me up once a week, usually
             Tuesday. After a while, the school
             worked it into the curriculum. And,
             if you knocked me out, you got extra
             credit. (laughter) Except there was
             this one kid who was afraid of me. I
             kept telling him, "Hit me! Hit me!
             What's the matter with you? Don't you
             want graduate?" As for me, I was
             the only kid in the history of the
             school to graduate in traction. The
             school nurse tucked my diploma into
             my sling. But my only real interest,
             right from the beginning, was show
             business. Even as a young man, I
             began at the very top, collecting
             autographs. (laughter)

134   INT:   MARSHA'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

      Dinner is over. MARSHA is sitting next to LANGFORD. As
      LANGFORD speaks, it is obvious that he is turning on the
      charm for strategic reasons.

                         LANGFORD
             That was a wonderful dinner, Marsha.
             I want you to know how much I enjoyed
             it.

                         MARSHA
             We can do it again.

             I'd like to show you my gratitude.
             But it's a little difficult, like this.

      LANGFORD indicates his bonds.

                         MARSHA.
                   (in a tone of intimacy)
             Let's say I took all this off.   What
             would you do to me? Tell me.

      finishing his monologue.

                         PUPKIN
             A lot of you are probably wondering
             why Jerry couldn't make it this
             evening. Well, he's tied up --
             and I'm the one who tied him.
             (laughter) You think I'm joking,
             but that's the only way I could break
             into show business -- by hijacking
             Jerry Langford. (laughter) I'm
             not kidding. Right now, Jerry
             Langford is strapped to a bedstead
             somewhere in the middle of this city.
             (laughter) Go ahead. Laugh. But
             the fact is ... I'm here. Tomorrow
             you'll know I wasn't kidding and
             you'll think I was crazy. But I
             figured it this way: better to be
             King for a Night than Schmuck for
             a Lifetime!!! (laughter) Good
             night ladies and gentlemen. God
             bless you.

      The AUDIENCE applauds heartily. The music plays. And TONY
      RANDALL salutes PUPKIN with a wave of his hand. PUPKIN
      goes off stage after soaking up the applause.

      inaudible conversation. And, close to the television set
      which hangs over the far end of the bar sits a MOUSY MAN
      with glasses, who looks like an accountant. He is sipping
      a beer, his eyes fixed on the set where the CBS late movie
      is just showing its logo. PUPKIN marches up to the bar.

                         PUPKIN
                   (urgently to RITA)
             Turn on Langford. Seven.

                          MOUSY MAN
             Hey!   I'm watching this.

      RITA keeps staring at PUPKIN.

                         PUPKIN
             Just turn it. Come on.

                         MOUSY MAN
             I was here first, mister. You can't
             just walk in like this. It isn't
             fair.

      RITA glances at the MAN. PUPKIN can't      wait. He vaults
      onto the bar and turns the set to the     Langford Show, just
      as, on screen, he walks from the wings     onto the stage to
      the applause of the studio audience.      Perched atop the bar,
      standing next to the image of himself,     PUPKIN looks down at
      RITA, a smile of pride and triumph on     his face.

                                      CUT TO:

145   MONTAGE -- NIGHT

      PUPKIN walking onto television screens in various homes
      across America -- in a chic New York living room, in a
      suburban bedroom, in the parlor of an Indiana farmhouse,
      in a kitchen where a COUPLE is in the middle of a raging
      domestic quarrel, in an otherwise dark bedroom where a
      COUPLE is in the throes of lovemaking, in a bar, a station
      house, in a television store window display.

                                      CUT TO:

146   INT:   MARSHA'S APARTMENT -- NIGHT

      MARSHA has just removed her dress and stands in      her bra and
      panties as LANGFORD unwraps the last tape from      about his
      ankles. The room is swimming in tape, like an       enormous
      boa constrictor gone mad. MARSHA moves towards       LANGFORD,
      her arms open.

                          MARSHA
             Oh, baby.   Baby.

      LANGFORD frees his ankles of tape just in time to side-step
      MARSHA and moves quickly to the dining room table where he
      grabs the gun. He trains it on her.

                         LANGFORD
             Stop!

      MARSHA moves toward him. He pulls the trigger, releasing
      a plastic pellet that hits MARSHA in the stomach, stinging her.

                         MARSHA
             Ow!

      LANGFORD glances down in horror at the gun which he now
      realizes is a toy and looks up in horror to see MARSHA,
      bigger than life, bearing down on him.

                         MARSHA
             Don't be afraid of Marsha, baby.

                                      CUT TO:

147   INT:   BAR-RESTAURANT - NIGHT

      The CUSTOMERS are watching the conclusion of Pupkin's
      monologue, along with the PLAINCLOTHESMEN and PUPKIN. WE
      COME IN a split second after a joke. The CUSTOMERS laugh,
      with the exception of the MOUSY MAN who is waiting, in bad
      humor, for Pupkin's act to finish. The PLAINCLOTHESMEN
      laugh reluctantly. PUPKIN, no longer standing on the bar,
      but back down with the others, watches with fascination.
      RITA watches grimly, occasionally glancing at PUPKIN.

                         PUPKIN on TV
             But I figured it this way: better to
             be King for a Night than Schmuck for
             a Lifetime. (audience and CUSTOMERS
             laugh)   Good night, ladies and
             gentlemen, and God bless you.

      The television audience applauds and the CUSTOMERS applaud
      and cheer in good humor except for the MOUSY MAN. The
      HALF-STEWED MAN leans across his WOMAN to yell at PUPKIN
      as the two FRIENDS in windbreakers congratulate PUPKIN at
      the same time. There is a brief moment of carnival
      excitement.

            HALF-STEWED MAN                FIRST FRIEND
      Hey, that's pretty good.             (to PUPKIN)

Schmuck for a Lifetime!      How do you think up all
(to the WOMAN) You know      that stuff?
who he's talkin' about?
Your brother!
                              SECOND FRIEND
      HALF-STEWED WOMAN       It's a trick, that's
What about your        all. Larry can do it
brother?                as good as him.

      HALF-STEWED MAN        MOUSY MAN
What about him?              Is it over now?

      HALF-STEWED WOMAN             FIRST FRIEND
He's another one.       He's funnier than Larry.
                        Larry just makes a lot
      HALF-STEWED MAN of faces.
(getting a little angry)
I told you to shut up about         MOUSY MAN
my brother. (to PUPKIN)       Well, if nobody
She doesn't know nuthin'.     minds ...

PUPKIN takes all this praise and excitement with a shy
smile of satisfaction, glancing at RITA from time to time
for her reaction. She merely stares at PUPKIN with a sad
expression on her face.

                 PUPKIN
     Come on, Rita. Don't spoil the party.
     (to the CUSTOMERS) Drinks all around
     on me.

                 HALF-STEWED MAN
           (in a loud voice, to HALF-
           STEWED WOMAN)
     What about the hundred and fifty?
     We never saw a penny outta your
     brother.

                 HALF-STEWED WOMAN
     That's because my brother is a family
     man, not like Phil.

The argument between the HALF-STEWED MAN and his WOMAN
continues at the end of the bar. The two FRIENDS have
resumed their intense conversation.

                 PUPKIN
           (to the two FRIENDS)
     What'll you have?

                  FIRST FRIEND
     I'm okay.   Thanks, pal.

                 SECOND FRIEND
     Me, too.

The MOUSY MAN has climbed up on the bar and has turned the
TV back to the late movie. He sits enthralled by a scene

of violence courtesy of Tony Curtis as the Boston
Strangler. PUPKIN looks down the bar at the STEWED COUPLE
to offer them drinks, but they are lost in an argument
over the relative merits of their brothers. PUPKIN turns
to the PLAINCLOTHESMEN.

                 PUPKIN
     I don't suppose you're allowed anything.
     (to RITA) I guess nobody's in a
     celebrating mood. How about you?
     You want something?

                 FIRST PLAINCLOTHESMAN
     It's getting time, Pupkin.

                 PUPKIN
     In a second.

                 RITA
           (in a sad, serious voice
           to PUPKIN)
     That was true, wasn't it? ... about
     the kidnapping.

PUPKIN nods and shrugs.

                 PUPKIN
     Now you can say you knew me.   That's
     something, anyway.

                 FIRST PLAINCLOTHESMAN
     Come on, Pupkin.

                 PUPKIN
           (to RITA, in a quiet,
           tender voice)
     I guess I've got go. Take care of
     yourself, will you. And when you're
     bored -- you know, when you're brushing
     your teeth or something, give me a
     thought, okay?

                 RITA
     Okay.

The PLAINCLOTHESMEN lead PUPKIN out of the bar. The two
FRIENDS are still buried in their intense, private
conversation. The PLAINCLOTHESMEN and PUPKIN walk past
the HALF-STEWED COUPLE.

                 HALF-STEWED WOMAN
     It's okay to talk about my sister,
     but we can't say nuthin' about Phil,
     is that it?

                 HALF-STEWED MAN
           (to PUPKIN)
     She's just had one too many.

      The PLAINCLOTHESMEN lead PUPKIN onto the street.

148   EXT:   THE BAR - NIGHT

      As they walk the few steps to the car, the FIRST
      PLAINCLOTHESMAN turns to PUPKIN.

                         FIRST    PLAINCLOTHESMAN
             I just don't get    it, Pupkin. You're
             gonna spend eight    years in the can --
             "minimum" -- and    for what?

                         SECOND PLAINCLOTHESMAN
             Yeah, Pupkin. You threw it all away.

                         PUPKIN
                   (vaguely)
             We'll see.

      WE CLOSE IN on PUPKIN, smiling.

                                       FADE TO:

149   INT:   THE JERRY LANGFORD SHOW STUDIO - NIGHT

      The STAGE MANAGER is counting down. At zero, he points to
      RICK ROSS who launches the orchestra into the Langford Show
      theme song. BERT CANTER, standing stage right, speaks into
      the mike.

                         CANTER
             And now! Direct from New York!
             The Jerry Langford Show, starring
             Jerry's special guest, out on bail,
             Rupert Pupkin, the kidnapping King
             of Comedy!!!!

      The AUDIENCE applauds mightily and the FINAL CREDITS roll.
      As they roll, the music to the Langford Show continues and
      WE WATCH a MONTAGE that shows PUPKIN progressively taping
      LANGFORD to the back of a brass bedstead on stage as the
      two of them talk and laugh. By the end of the MONTAGE,
      LANGFORD is once again mummified and PUPKIN, having
      finished, bows and smiles. WE CLOSE on a FREEZE-FRAME
      CLOSE UP of PUPKIN in ecstasy.

                                       FADE OUT.




December 15, 1976 draft
Screenplay by Paul D. Zimmerman
Klute

 


INT. DINING ROOM - TOM GRUNEMANN HOUSE - DAY

CLOSE SHOT of TOM GRUNEMANN, attractive young
executive, sitting at the head of the dining room
table carving a turkey for Thanksgiving Day dinner.
There are joyous sounds of celebration. The CAMERA
PANS around the table revealing the happy family
and guests. Among them are KLUTE and CABLE.

Camera stops at Mrs. Grunemann who sits at the foot
of the table opposite her husband. She smiles
across at him with pleasure. We cut to Tom
Grunemann smiling back at her. We cut back to a
closeup of Mrs. Grunemann  looking back at her
husband with love. We cut back to Tom Grunemann's
chair - only now it is empty. The joyous sounds
disappear on this cut. It appears that Tom
Grunemann has disappeared before our eyes. One
moment he is there, and the next moment he is gone.
The camera pans back down the table, only now it is
empty except for Grunemann's children and Mrs.
Grunemann. She is now dressed in something dark.
She and the three children sit eating another meal
in emptiness. She has changed from a joyous woman
to a woman bereaved.

INT. RESEARCH PLANT: ON ROSS - DAY

The industrial frontier. SPECIAL AGENT ROSS steps
into frame, glancing (perhaps idly, a little
impatiently) in this direction at some loud
industrial goings-on just beyond camera, then
returns toward GROUP.

The group includes CABLE and a YOUNGER FBI AGENT
with clipboard, to whom KLUTE is supplying
preliminary data. KLUTE's manner is somewhat
rumpled, awkward.

			KLUTE
	Klute. With a K. K - L - U -

			ROSS
	Are you with plant security,
	Sergeant?

			KLUTE
		(shakes head)
	Town Police.

			ROSS
	Then how are you involved?

			KLUTE
		(slowly)
	I know Tom Grunemann.

			ROSS
		(shortcutting again)
	You knew the subject Thomas
	Grunemann. How well?

			KLUTE
	We grew up together. Kids.

			ROSS
	Can you account for his
	disappearance in any way?

			KLUTE
	No.

			ROSS
	Did he recently appear to you
	agitated or depressed?
		(aside to younger Agent,
		recording)
	-- indicates no -- Did he voice to
	you grievance or discontent with
	his research work here? Indicates
	no. Moral or sexual problems or
	peculiarities? --

			KLUTE
	No.

			ROSS
	Marital problems in general?
	Indicates possibly -- am I right
	Sergeant?

			KLUTE
	Everybody's got some, I guess.

			ROSS
	Did he ever mention specifically a
	girl or woman in New York?

			KLUTE
	No.

			ROSS
	Examine this letter please.
		(continues)
	We recovered that from the shredder
	-- the plant disposal and
	incinerator system. Grunemann
	apparently typed it Friday, before
	he left, decided not to send it,
	tossed it away. We've already
	contacted the New York Police; they
	think they know the girl in
	question.

C.U. KLUTE

Klute reads. We see a controlled incredulity and
revulsion.

			ROSS (CONT'D)
	He never mentioned this type thing
	to you? You didn't know he had
	these interests?

INT. GRUNEMANN HOUSE: C.U. HOLLY - DAY

HOLLY thrusts the letter back toward camera, toward
KLUTE crying out -

			HOLLY
	My husband was not like that! My
	God, Klute.

			KLUTE
	It looks like he sent her quite a
	few of those Holly -- the girl --
	she recalls six or seven letters
	like --

			HOLLY
		(calmly)
	-- No. I mean sure a little rough
	stuff, but just what people usually
	-- No, I would've said we were
	pretty good.
		(pause)
	Johnnie I don't understand. I just
	don't understand.

Klute nods. She is talking for both of them. Klute
looks out the window to the children playing
outside. CAMERA PANS out window to Klute's POV of
children playing on a cold winter day. The trees
are stripped bare.

EXT. RESEARCH PLANT

Tree lined area, lush and green - Summer.

INT. RESEARCH PLANT: DIRECTOR'S OFFICE - DAY

CAMERA pulls back inside window to Klute staring
outside, as if still pondering the fate of Tom
Grunemann. The group in the office includes ROSS
(holding a report), TRASK, a New York detective,
Cable, and the plant director, STREIGER.

			ROSS
	-- has disclosed no evidence of
	crime or criminal intent within the
	jurisdiction of this bureau, and
	since subject Thom --

			CABLE
		(turns sharply,
		interrupts)
	It's been almost a year! Tom
	Grunemann's been missing for a
	year. And all the FBI has to offer
	is a report that must bore even
	you.

			ROSS
		(restraint)
	Well sir.

			STREIGER
	Are you closing the case?

			ROSS
	No sir, we don't state that. We're
	countin --

			CABLE
	But you don't find it worth much
	effort.

			ROSS
		(injured dignity)
	Well Mr. Cable, you've got me here
	from the Bureau. You got Lieutenant
	Trask here from New York
	representing his department and I
	don't frankly consider --

			STREIGER
		(moderating, suggesting)
	Why couldn't you ever find out
	anything from the girl?

			ROSS
		(refers the question)
	Trask --

			TRASK
		(summarizes from notes)
	We first hold her under
	surveillance expectin your boy
	Grunemann to show up there. Didn't.
	Then we bagged -- we arrested her
	on a CP charge, convicted, two
	month's women's city prison, offer
	to reduce sentence, she cooperated.
		(counts)
	Four interrogations. She thought
	she remembered Grunemann -- from
	those letters from before, she made
	that connection -- but she hadn't
	seen him since and couldn't
	identify his photograph and she --

			STREIGER
	Why not?

			TRASK
	Oh a good call girl, she'll turn
	six-seven hundred tricks a year.
	The faces get blurred.
		(resumes)
	And since then, recent months,
	she's reported several, you know,
	incidents: like breather calls,
	anonymous phone calls, also
	somebody maybe following her,
	watching her, things like that. So
	it's I guess you could say,
	conceivable Grunemann's still
	around there, just hangin around
	her, spooking her. But you know,
	that --

He shakes his head, gestures doubtingly. Ross caps
it.

			ROSS
	The subject got emotionallv
	disturbed; he just dropped out.
	There's thousands.

			STREIGER
	Inspector we understand your
	position; ours is a little
	different. We have an investment in
	Tom Grunemann. The Company has an
	investment, and we feel entitled to
	investigate for ourselves.

			ROSS
	Private investigation, you mean.
	Yes sir, of course you're entitled,
	and there's some very competent --

			STREIGER
	Klute offered us his services;
	we've accepted.

Pause. Ross and Trask look at Klute - more than a
bit startled - then at each other. Klute just looks
uneasy.

			STREIGER (CONT'D)
	Klute knew Tom. He has a great many
	ideas about the case --

			ROSS
		(sourly)
	Yes sir, we know he --

			STREIGER
	We'd expect him to work in
	cooperation with you. He'd report
	to each of you and to our Company's
	New York office, to Pete -- Pete
	goes there on a regular schedule
	back and forth, and --

			ROSS
		(tactfully)
	Mr. Streiger, speaking frankly --
	we've appreciated the Sergeant's
	interest you know, all along. Here,
	locally. But New York, that's -
	well --

			TRASK
		(to Klute, leniently)
	Ever done any missing person's
	work?

			ROSS
	Spent much time in the city?
		(to others)
	You see, I have to wonder --
	speaking frankly; the Sergeant
	knows I'm only speaking frankly -

			CABLE
	You wonder why we thought of Klute?
	Frankly? He's interested.

INT/EXT. WIDE SHOT: PENNSYLVANIA COUNTRYSIDE - DAY

Verdant Pennsylvania farmland. Early morning. Near
at hand an open field set about with bee hutches
and patched with mist.

A FIGURE, a shadow (Klute's actually) moves across
frame from the left, blanking in. We reorient to -

INT. BEDROOM - KLUTES HOUSE - DAY

We see that we've been looking out from the bedroom
window of this house. Klute turns to rolltop desk
in bedroom and picture of Tom Grunemann, picture of
Bree Daniel, and other material he has collected on
the case. He puts them in his suitcase and closes
the suitcase. He shuts rolltop desk.

INT. KLUTE'S HOUSE - DAY

We follow Klute through the house with suitcase. He
puts away a last dish, shutting off water, gas, and
electricity, and so on -- takes a last look around 
- reaches for the door handle. WE CUT TO --

INT. COMMERCIAL AUDITION - SOUND STAGE - DAY

A section of wall, a door coming open -- and the
FIGURE of BREE entering and standing. We have gone
from the warm sunlight of the country to mustv
darkness.

She appears chic, poised, and perfect as a magazine
picture.
But as she gets used to the darkness and her eyes
focus on a line of equally beautiful girls sitting
and waiting in folding chairs along a wall, we see
that she is a great deal less certain of demeanor.
Assailable. WE CUT TO -

EXT. KLUTE'S HOUSEYARD, HOUSE, BARN - DAY

Klute, stepping out, closes, locks and checks the
house door, then moves on to his car -- a vintage
Plymouth -- and tosses in his suitcase; and then
takes a last turn around the yard itself; props
open the cover of a beehutch, and lets down the
rail gate of a sidefield. He approaches to roll
shut his barn door -- and on this action we CUT
again TO --

INT. COMMERCIAL AUDITION - SOUNDSTAGE - DAY

			DIRECTOR (O.S.)
		(hastily)
	Honey, no, we don't have too many.

She slaps the cup down, hurls herself forward --
SWISH PAN -- onto a MALE ACTOR, thrusting him down
to the floor, her hands at his throat. As we WIDEN
TO INCLUDE DIRECTOR AND MORE OF SCENE, and as the
Director reads from script, supplying a narrator
voice -

			DIRECTOR (CONT'D)
	Now before it comes to that, let's
	have a look, et cetera, et cetera --
	OK -

Bree and the Male Actor relax slightly, as -

ANGLE TO REVEAL ROOM, OTHERS

We reestablish the scene -- a few pieces of film
equipment -- and the congery of other ACTORS and 
ACTRESSES preparing to read for parts. As the
Director approaches, counsels Bree -- all of this
quick and consecutive --

			DIRECTOR (CONT'D)
	-- Honey you make it look a little
	real. It should have, you know,
	that fun to it.
		(beat)

			BREE
	Strangle him to death funny?

			DIRECTOR
	Well we go from this into stomach
	diagrams. It can't be too -- look
	let's try it again from -

-- but then he glances at his watch, and at the
others waiting their turn.

			DIRECTOR (CONT'D)
	No -- just give us the faces at the
	end, would you?

Bree and the Male Actor set their cheeks together,
beaming half-moon smiles to camera, hold it for a
moment, as the Director reads again -

			DIRECTOR (CONT'D)
		(reads)
	-- And another family saved by Elso
	tablets. OK --
		(brightly)
	Thank you very much.

-- and holds out his hands for their scripts, at
the same time as he summons from a list in his
other hand --

			DIRECTOR (CONT'D)
	Pierce -- Danner -

BREE passes a new group of beautiful girls sitting
in line waiting their turn as she exits as brightly
as possible.

EXT. NEW YORK SIDEWALK: PEDESTRIANS - DAY

They trudge along the sidewalk -- the herd, the
late-afternoon crush. A LONG-LENS shot, the crowd
compacted. We see BREE milling along with the rest.
She maneuvers to a sidewalk PHONE BOOTH, enters. We
see her deposit, dial.

INT. PHONE BOOTH, BREE - DAY

She is connected (to her registry).

			BREE
	Bree Daniel, any messages?
		(waits -- none)
	OK, thanks.

She waits for a moment. Then makes a curious, small
gesture of her hand -- deposits another dime, dials
again, is answered.

			BREE (CONT'D)
	Trina? Bree. Do I? Oh no, just a
	commercial I thought I might get,
	that's all.
		(quickly, more brightly)
	Well I'd take a quick thirty, hon.
	Do you have a commuter for me?
	Wait.

As she prepares to write it down, we CUT BACK TO -

EXT. KLUTE'S HOUSEYARD: KLUTE - DAY

Klute finishes rolling shut, and padlocks, the barn
door. He returns to his car, sits in (leaving door
open) starts engine. Again -- one last time -- the
look around. Then he pulls the door shut, pulls
out. And on this we CUT TO --

INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR - DAY

A GROUP -- middle-aged Couple, Child, Bellman with
suitcases -- wait to descend in elevator as BREE
gets off. We TRACK with her along corridor to a
door. She checks number and knocks.

REVERSE: THROUGH DOOR TO BREE

A MAN opens the door. We neither see or hear him
clearly -- he is foreground, defocused. His shirt
is untucked. Bree cocks her head, greets him
cutely.

			BREE
	Hullo.

He mumbles some kind of greeting, steps back. She
pauses a moment in the door (casing, instantly) --
then quite confident, friendly, provocative all at
once --

			BREE (CONT'D)
	Ooh, I knew I'd like you.

-- and CUT TO --

EXT. CENTER OF TOWN: KLUTE DRIVING - DAY

Klute's car draws through the business section of
town, moves on --

INT. HOTEL ROOM: BREE - DAY

C.U. BREE (the Man out of frame and unheard-from)
as she bargains gaily -- and at the same time a
little watchfully.

			BREE
	Lover, that's got to be a little
	extra. I mean it sounds very
	exciting, what you speak of, you've
	got me all excited. But something
	special like that, you know it's
	got to cost a little more, mm?

-- and CUT TO --

INT. CAR: KLUTE DRIVING - DAY

Klute has laid his jacket aside, rolled his
sleeves, is eating the last of a vending machine
sandwich. The CAR RADIO is on. He leans forward,
tuning it from --

			1ST ANNC'R
		(energetic)
	--R - W - M, radio's voice is the
	Shippensburg Valley, on a beautiful
	clear warm Thurs --

-- to --

			2ND ANNC'R
		(rural)
	-- Tucky Wonder Beans picking up a
	half cent over yesterday's price at-

-- and CUT TO --

INT. C.U. ON BREE, MAN (HOTEL BED) - DAY

The Man's face is buried against her neck, her
labors over her. She cries out ecstatically,
transportedly -- it would seem at the edge of
orgasm --

			BREE
	Oh lover, oh it's too much -- oh
	you thrill me -- yes, like that,
	it's -- oh it's beautiful, oh --

-- and at the same time refers privately to her
wristwatch. And CUT TO --

EXT. WIDE SHOT: ACCESS RAMP OF TURNPIKE - LUSH
HILLY COUNTRY - DAY

KLUTE'S CAR

As Klute's car drives onto the turnpike surrounded 
by green country, we ZOOM into a close shot of
Klute through the windshield of his car. And then
in what seems like a continuous shot we ZOOM back
to a wide angle revealing Klute caught in the
endless line of cars in a typical traffic jam at
the entrance to New York City, surrounded by
smoggy, grey, urban skies.

INT. CITY MULTILAYERED PARKING BUILDING - KLUTE'S
CAR - NIGHT

KLUTE sits inside his car as it is mechanically
lifted into the air. It looks as if he is being
manipulated by a robot.

EXT. STREET: OUTSIDE THE BROWNSTONE - NIGHT

BREE moves along street, returning home,
apprehensive of the one or two other distant
FIGURES. She turns in at one of the Brownstones.

INT. STAIRWELL OF BROWNSTONE - NIGHT

We watch Bree as she mounts to the top floor, the
door of her apartment, barren, isolated,
frightened.

INT. BREE'S APTARTMENT - NIGHT

BREE unlocks the door, switches on a light, cases
the apartment for a moment before entering,
securing chain-lock, putting aside her things.
There is a RECORD PLAYER near the first interior
doorway. She switches it as she moves by. By time
the first record has dropped, she has the shower
turned on, is getting rid of her dress. We CUT BACK
TO --

EXT. EMPTY STREET: KLUTE - NIGHT

Klute walks, as before, carrying his suitcase. We
see him slow, concernedly looking toward --

INT. BREE'S APARTMENT: ON BREE - NIGHT

Bree sits on a studio couch, near the record
player, with a QUILT huddled over and around her,
her back against the wall. The MUSIC is classical,
curiously -- the sound of a HARPSICHORD. She is
more or less expressionless -- but trembling
violently, shaking.

FRONT WINDOW SIGN BEING REMOVED WHICH READS "FOR
RENT" - STORE - INQUIRE CRAWICZ, DAY

INT. BREE's APARTMENT: BREE - DAY

Bree moves about energetically, preparing to set
out on rounds. A KNOCK on the door. She startled,
then approaches to door, to peep-hole, lifts lid
aside.

THROUGH PEEPHOLE TO KLUTE FACE

Klute's face is somewhat distorted by the peephole
lens; he is gazing mildly about the landing.

BREE

			BREE
		(through door, curtly)
	What is it?

			KLUTE (O.S.)
	Miss Daniel? My name is Klute --
	John Klute --

She turns the door handle , parts the door about
three inches, looks through at him. He starts to
enter.

			KLUTE (CONT'D)
	Can I talk to you?

-- and the door crunches against its chain-lock. He
stops perforce, a bit startled. A pause. A slice of
Bree's face looks coldly out at him. He summons a
smile.

			BREE
	What about?

			KLUTE
	My name's John Klute.

			BREE
	You said that.

			KLUTE
	I'm an investigator. I'd like to
	ask you some questions about Tom
	Grunemann.

She tightens again.

			BREE
	Who?

			KLUTE
	Tom Grunemann. He wrote you some
	letters.

			BREE
		(innocently)
	Gee.

			KLUTE
	He was a research engineer at the
	Tuscarora Laboratories in
	Pennsylvania. He disappeared from
	there last April. I've been hired
	to look for him.

			BREE
	Why?

			KLUTE
	You know what I'm talking about.
	Miss Daniel.

			BREE
	Honest?

			KLUTE
	Will you let me ask you some
	questions?

			BREE
		(gumbo-southern)
	Dew yew hayuv ah-dentifikyshun?

He takes out a folded letter and a wallet and
passes them both through to her. Silence. She
examines them with care, then appears to soften a
little; even smiles slightly.

			BREE (CONT'D)
	You're not police or FBI; you're
	just a private investigator?

			KLUTE
	Mm.

			BREE
	And you just want to ask me a few
	questions?

			KLUTE
	Mm.

She smiles again, hands the letter and wallet back
out, closes the door (doesn't slam, just closes).
Klute looks at it blankly for a time, starts to
knock again, decides not to -- turns and descends
the stairs.

BREE

Bree listens through the door to his departing foot
steps. They fade from hearing. She hastens to
assemble her properties.

EXT. FRONT DOOR - DAY

Klute comes out door and descends the stairs at the
same even pace -- he walks into the vacant store
below.

INT. BASEMENT STORE - DAY

It had once been a Boutique that sold happy
clothes. There are some psychedelic posters and a
few remnants of its former identity. Klute's
suitcase is propped open on a cot behind a counter.
The ceilings are low, forcing Klute to stoop as he
enters. He seems out of place and out of scale. A
case containing a tape recorder stands on the
floor. On the table are a FOLDER of Klute's notes,
and a paper bag. Klute enters and deliberately
resumes his settling in. From the paper bag he sets
aside an electric FAN, then lifts out from the
shopping bag a cheap tin ALARM CLOCK and begins
winding it.

INT. BREE'S APARTMENT - DAY

Bree has shifted position to a window, is looking
down at the street. She sees - and we hear - SOUND
OF BUS APPROACHING, distantly. She grabs her
properties, whips out the door.

EXT. ON DOOR OF BROWNSTONE - DAY

Bree skids to a stop just inside the door, scans
quickly out in one direction then the other (in
case Klute has been waiting in ambush on the
sidewalk) then races -- PAN -- to BUS AT CURB --
makes it, pulls herself aboard --

INT. KLUTE'S APARTMENT: KLUTE - DAY

Klute has been watching from his window. We hear
the BUS PULLING AWAY. He turns back, plugs in the
electric fan. Then hoists the TAPE RECORDER,
unsnaps the cover. We see clearly what it is.

INT. AGENCY OFFICE - DAY

BREE is showing her notebook to an AGENT. He leans
forward courteously, occasionally stroking his
forehead with his fingertips -- a nice man with a
headache.

			BREE
	-- and I take acting classes with
	Lee Tainter --

			AGENT
	-- Lee, yes --

			BREE
	-- and I was in two of his workshop
	type productions, Uncle Vanya and
	the girl in Five Characters --
		(indicates picture)
	-- here -- and then of course I
	have the modeling and the
	demonstrator work, the trade-fair
	work -- but naturally I feel ready
	for something more, well you know,
	sustain --

			AGENT
	Well, thanks very much for coming
	in.

She starts for the door -- he's already turning
away -- then ducks back, hands him one of her
Glossies, laughing prettily at her own
forgetfulness.

			BREE
		(beautifully -- the
		business)
	Thank you very much.

EXT. STREET - DAY

BREE comes out, pauses with notebook to cross out,
the call completed, checks the list of those
remaining, sets forth again. We hear TRASK'S VOICE
OVER, very quick, very clipped.

			TRASK (V.O.)
	Man, just a poor pretty little
	hooker, like to be an actress --

INT. MISSING PERSONS BUREAU - DAY

CLOSEUP photograph of dead man. It is replaced with
series of photgraphs of dead men. CAMERA pulls back
to reveal KLUTE flipping through the file of the
unidentified dead.

			TRASK (V.O.)
	What you lookin' to get from her?
	You think she's got Grunemann hid
	somewhere, the attic, feedin him
	soup? Or maybe he's hidin in a dark
	alley and he'll jump on her and you
	jump on him. And third place, even
	if she does know somethin' she's
	right, she don't have to talk to
	you. You don't have police power,
	you can't make her.

KLUTE closes the file.

			KLUTE
	That's a lot of people to die
	unknown.

			TRASK
	Unknown, unidentified and unwanted.
	And there's more every day man,
	there's more everyday.

As KLUTE slowly walks away we bring in TELEPHONE
RING and BREE VOICE, OVER answering.

			BREE VOICE
	Bree Daniel.
		(then)
	Yeah, hi hon.

EXT. BREE APARTMENT - NIGHT

Camera is looking up through lighted window outside
at BREE on phone.

			BREE
	Oh hon, I just don't know. I'm
	trying to stay out of it.

EXT. KLUTE APARTMENT - NIGHT

CAMERA pans down from BREE's window to KLUTE's
window at the bottom revealing KLUTE at tape
recorder. The TAPE RECORDER is going, its light
winking. KLUTE holds headset against one ear, makes
a note or two. We hear BREE's and other GIRL'S
VOICES, UNDER, FILTERED.

			GIRL'S VOICE
	-- comes in with these other yulds
	maybe two or three times a year,
	and five big ones baby, just one
	evening.

			BREE VOICE
	Marta, thanks, and I'd love to
	party with you hon, but --

Klute sets down the headset (we drop the VOICES far
under, INDISTINGUISHABLE), makes a note, and thumbs
open the box of a fresh reel; the present reel is
near the end. We establish a pile of ALREADY
RECORDED TAPES. We CUT BACK TO --

INT. BREE APARTMENT: BREE ON PHONE - NIGHT

			BREE
	Well try to get someone else Marty
	and if I change my mind -- sure
	hon, bye.

She hangs up, starts away. The PHONE RINGS AGAIN.
She tries to ignore it. It persists. She finally
turns back to answer it, and we CUT TO --

INT. CASTING OFFICE - AD AGENCY - DAY

CAMERA STARTS on huge photo montage of the Family
of Man and pans down to a group of beautiful girls
sitting on a bench below. They are dwarfed by the
enormous picture. Each one clutches an almost
identical portfolio of pictures in her lap. Camera
pans down row of portfolios until it stops at BREE 
- impatiently waiting her turn. WE CONTINUE THE
TELEPHONE VOICES OVER, WILD TRACK STYLE. The MAN'S
VOICE is thick with drink, and emotion. First the
click, then --

			BREE VOICE
	Bree Daniel --

			MAN'S VOICE
	Oh God baby, oh God I really love
	you.

			BREE VOICE
	That's nice; who is this?

			MAN'S VOICE
	I really love you baby, you know
	that?

A CLICK, and the MAN'S VOICE CONTINUING, trailing
into helpless sobs --

			MAN'S VOICE (CONT'D)
	Hello? Hello? Oh my God, hello?

EXT. STREET: BREE

Bree comes out from the building (note possible
costume change; not necessarily consecutive
action), checks off on her list continues on her
way -- as we CONTINUE WILD TRACK STYLE VOICES.
Starting with a CLICK and --

			BREE VOICE
	Bree Daniel.

			2ND MAN'S VOICE
		(nicely)
	Bree -- Frank Hanley, you remember,
	Fayetterville?

			BREE VOICE
	Oh yeah, hi Frank, sure.

			2ND MAN'S VOICE
	Well I'm in town, like to see you.

			BREE VOICE
	Well Frank that's awful nice but
	I'm out of action, sort of, you
	know --

We FADE THIS CONVERSATION UNDER BUT HOLD,
CONTINUING, as --

BREE PASSES CAMERA -- and we PAN TO SHOT OF KLUTE,
at corner, unseen by her and apparently in
surveillance of her. Then he too turns out of
frame, and we CUT TO --

INT. PENN STATION - DAY

CAMERA is looking down at an enormous gift package
on a platform. There is a sound of a recorded
fanfare and with the pull of a string the package
is opened revealing a brand new LINCOLN CONTINENTAL
CONVERTIBLE. People applaud and the car starts to
revolve. At the wheel of the car sits BREE. We CUT
to a shot through the windshield of car --

BREE'S POV

A sea of staring faces revolves around her. We
cross fade with SPANGLER VOICE OVER (as if
recalling a case record).

			SPANGLER (V.O.)
	Bree Daniel, Caucasian, twenty
	eight, good physical health, no
	narcotics record, presenting an
	unusually strong personality some
	ways, high intelligence, a high
	bracket call girl.

EXT. WOMEN'S PRISON ROOF - CAGED IN RECREATION AREA

SPANGLER, a prison psychiatrist, sits on a bench
eating a sandwich partially wrapped in wax paper
and sipping from a carton of milk. He is obviously
a man pressed for time. KLUTE sits beside him.
Across from them some prisoners are taking their
exercise. Through the metallic netting that
surrounds them, we see the skyline of New York
City. It only dramatizes more the sense of being
caged.

			SPANGLER
	-- Usual case history -- this isn't
	a medical confidence, it's all of
	them -- broken family, lonely,
	confused, crummy childhood, early
	promiscuity, formal prostitution
	beginning in her teens, income
	twenty-five to thirty thousand a
	year.
		(notes Klute's reaction)
	Oh they don't keep the money: they
	get rid of it, they get pimps. Why?
		(stabs at record)
	Why do you want to know all this?

			KLUTE
	I want to know how Tom Grunemann
	got mixed up in it.

			SPANGLER
	Not unusual.

			KLUTE
	Did she talk about him to you?

			SPANGLER
	About his letters -- that's all she
	remembered. Quite violent material,
	I'd say, obsessive, a quite sick
	man. But that's not unusual either.

			KLUTE
	Has she talked with you since
	prison?

			SPANGLER
	No. She had every good intention of
	it -- coming to me as a private
	patient, getting out of the life,
	devoting herself to an acting
	career.

			KLUTE
	I think she's trying that.

			SPANGLER
	Oh sure they try. The idea of a
	better life.  But they don't really
	know much about life: They get
	confused -- or scared or frustrated
	or bored -- they pop back to the
	one thing they can handle.
	The trick. The trick. Men in bed.
	Not men in general, not life, not
	love, not even real sex -- it
	avoids all that. Just the trick,
	the transaction.

INT. PENN STATION - DAY

POV world revolving around BREE through windshield
of car. The circular motion slows down and then
stops. Cut to BREE getting out of car and walking
off platform. She looks a bit shaky. She is stopped
by one of the spectators.

			MAN
		(tapping her)
	We had a bet on - if you were real
	or not. I won.

She looks at him in disgust and crosses to phone
booth.

INT. PHONE BOOTH - DAY

			BREE
		(on phone)
	Marta --

INT. CHURCH DISCOTHEQUE - NIGHT

We are in the interior of what was once a church
and is now a discotheque. Interior is painted
purple; the record player stands on the altar over
the crowd. Pews are massed around the dance floor.
Stained glass windows are lighted from behind and
are circled with light bulbs that flash on and off.
For all of its obviously bizarre visual quality,
there is a sense of relaxation. It is a late night
gathering place of many who belong to the sexual
underworld of the city.

BREE and the OTHER GIRL advance to a pew. A MAN
sitting there (the other girl's pimp) with a THIRD
GIRL. BREE's companion greet him shyly, tenderly:
she and BREE sit down, join in conversation.

PULL BACK SLOWLY -- other pews, other girls and a
few men, the sisterhood -- To --

BAR AREA IN BACK (WHAT ONCE MUST HAVE BEEN THE
VESTIBULE OF THE CRURCH)

Among the people around the bar, pimps, whores, and
a sprinkling of hopeful Johns and curiosity
seekers. The camera picks a familiar face: CABLE.
He watches BREE with a mixture of amusement and
contempt. A GIRL comes over to him and tries to
proposition him. They appear to be discussing
price. Just as she thinks it is set, he walks away.

INT. KLUTE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

CLOSEUP photograph of TOM GRUNEMANN pinned to a
large piece of beaverboard KLUTE has placed on a
wall. CAMERA PANS over various pictures and pieces
of evidence KLUTE has pinned up in an attempt to
make some sense from the puzzle of TOM GRUNMIANN's
disappearance. CAMERA PANS over to KLUTE sitting on
cot looking up at the pieces of the puzzle. There
is a heated TV dinner in front of him.

The TAPE RECORDER reels start turning (sound
powered), the recording light starts winding (as
BREE, above, dials). KLUTE pays it scant attention 
- he can catch up with the news anytime. He sits
manfully in front of the TV dinner, starts peeling
back the foil --

INT. BREE'S APARTMENT: BREE - NIGHT

She holds the phone, is answered. Her voice more
natural, a little shy, a little covert.

			BREE
	Hi. Bree.
		(is greeted)
	Hi. Well I could come over tonight 
	- if you'd like -- if there's no
	one else.
		(laughs diffidently)
	I really want to just talk to you.

INT. KLUTE'S APARTMENT: KLUTE - NIGHT

The tape-recorder continues turning and winking as
the conversation upstairs continues. KLUTE looks at
TV dinner. He reaches for the headset of the
taperecorder, holds it loosely against one ear. He
exhibits a measure of new interest. The TAPE
RECORDER stops running. He immediately rewinds, and
starts listening through it again. We CUT TO --

EXT. GARMENT DISTRICT - NIGHT

Large, dark buildings -- a DIM-LIGHTED WINDOW
showing at an upper floor of one -- the street
otherwise by and large deserted. A TAXI draws in, a
FIGURE IN EVENING DRESS (Bree) gets out, approaches
the building, glances around, either secretly or
apprehensively -- presses a buzzer, waits, gets
answering CLICKS, enters the dark hallway of the
building, starts upstairs.

EXT. ACROSS THE STREET - NIGHT

KLUTE shifts into view, looking in the direction
Bree's gone, a little puzzled all in all. He
doesn't immediately follow; he waits.

INT. GARMENT BUILDING - CUTTING ROOMS - NIGHT

We look past RACKS OF CLOTHING, as BREE arrives up
the dark stairway into dark rooms -- the scene,
mysterious, a little sinister. She seems fearful of
it herself, advances slowly, looking around, calls 
-

			BREE
	Hi? -_

ANGLE PAST MR. FABER, TO BREE

Mr. Faber is SILHOUETTED for a moment, standing,
watching her, from along an alleyway of garments.
She sees him, is startled then relieved.

			BREE (CONT'D)
	Oh --

He moves toward her.

REVERSE ANGLE, TO MR. FABER

Mr. Faber is a man of 65 or so, rather handsome,
and for this occasion very spruce, very erect, very
nattily turned out. Bree complains cheerfully.

			BREE (CONT'D)
	You scared me, Mr. Faber.

He smiles, kisses her cheek, tests the fabric of
her evening dress -- (in passing, as a matter of
expertise).

			MR. FABER
	Good material, not too good cut.
	I'd do better for you.

Then he turns, lifts down a WOMAN'S DRESS CAPE,
carrying it -- graciously gestures her to precede
him --

CORNER OF CUTTING ROOM

A dim pool of light here. A private area here,
sectioned off by rows of garments. A couch, rug,
coffee table, a chair or two -- a place for Buyers
to take their ease. BREE and MR. FABER enter. Her
manner is suddenly elegant, assured, regal; his
befits a man of the world. He fits the cloak around
her shoulders and gestures to the couch; she sits.
He pours a glass of wine for her, for himself. She
speaks with a neat continental accent -- doing it
fairly well, really -- a member of the
international set.

			BREE
	Oh thank you.

He sits in the chair opposite, sips his wine.

			MR. FABER
	Enjoy.
		(then)
	Well --

			BREE
		(diffident)
	It's good to see you. Well -- could
	we do it first and then just talk?

			MR. FABER
	Sure dear, yes.

			BREE
	Well -- well I'm just back. And --
	I must tell you -- something quite
	wonderful.

			MR. FABER
		(intently)
	Yes?

			BREE
	And Cannes was quite fun, quite;
	and we played baccarat and
	chemindefer and there was a nice
	little Italian marquis quite
	enthusiastic for me -- but a young
	man can be so silly --

			MR. FABER
	Mm.

			BREE
	And then one night -- at the gaming
	tables -- well I just saw him. A
	stranger -- looking at me -- and I
	knew suddenly that all my life I'd
	been --

She hesitates strangely, her fingers at the neck of
the cape. Faintly --

			BREE (CONT'D)
	-- May I? It's so --

			MR. FABER
		(quickly)
	Please --

She stands, unloosing the cloak, letting it fall on
the couch. But she doesn't sit again -- begins to
move here and there about the enclosure, her hands
wandering about her dress and body -- an erotic
restlessness.

			BREE
	Not young; he wasn't young -- gray
	at the temples, he -- well actually
	he looked like you.

			MR. FABER
		(tensely)
	Yes?

			BREE
	And nobody could tell me who he was
	-- an exiled prince or a mercenary
	or a bullfighter or -- but I felt
	it stirring inside me, this -- this
	wild, pagan feeling --

EXT. GARMENT BUILDING DOOR - NIGHT

KLUTE arrives from across the street. It takes him
a while (with a 'loid' probably) to slip the lock.
He eases door open, moves inside --

INT. CORNER OF CUTTING ROOM: BREE - NIGHT

BREE is farther along in her narrative, more
fervent in manner. MR. FABER sits at the edge of
his seat, ducking his head now and then in
pleasure, but making no move to molest her.

			BREE
	And next day at the beach -- our
	beach pavilion -- I saw him again,
	his eyes burning into me. I was
	helpless. Without his even speaking
	to me, without his even touching, I
	knew that somehow -- somehow --

She casts away an accessory garment. Mr. Faber
burns her with his eyes --

INT. GARMENT BUILDING - CUTTING ROOMS - NIGHT

KLUTE mounts into view at the head of the stairs,
prowls along the aisles of clothing, looking --
sees --

POV PAST GARMENT RACKS TO MR. FABER

Klute sees Mr. Faber first -- clearly a senior
citizen -- sitting transfixed, fastened in some
private dream. Then BREE drifts into view -- stands
-- lets fall the evening dress about her ankles,
poses -- drifts out of view again --

KLUTE

Klute watches in that direction a moment longer. In
his expression a certain curiosity -- a prurience --
but rather more strongly, disappointment, a measure
of disgust. Not his affair. He turns away from it,
into camera, and --

EXT. BREE'S BROWNSTONE - NIGHT

Near the entrance, outside the door to KLUTE's
apartment below. We open on BREE. She shouts
angrily, miserably --

			BREE
	Whyn't you just cut out?

We WIDEN TO INCLUDE KLUTE. Now she begins to get
it. He turns, opens door to his room below. She
comes slowly down steps.

INT. KLUTE'S ROOM - DAY

She steps in the door, looks slowly around at his
various appurtenances -- the bed, the necktie over
the mirror, etc. -- and then, the TAPE RECORDER and
then the STACK OF TAPE BOXES. Softly, venomously --

			BREE
	Oh you bastard.

But then she adjusts -- a frightened but matter-of
fact hooker --

			BREE (CONT'D)
	Is it the shakedown hon? You picked
	a loser, I just don't have it.

			KLUTE
	No, I'm look --

			BREE
		(vehemently again)
	If I was taking calls full time
	would I be living in this kip? I'd
	be back on Park Avenue; I could
	support the whole National Guard!

			KLUTE
		(gestures upward)
	Could I ask some questions?

			BREE
	Or you'll get me shoved back in the
	brig you mean; another month with
	the bull-dykes.

She seems to have expressed it; the balance of
power. She turns, goes out, heads upstairs. Klute
unhurriedly takes up his folder of notes, then
follows.

INT. BREE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Bree disposes her belongings. Klute moves to table.
There is a group of plants on the table that long
since died of neglect. He notices them and the
disorganization of the room without comment, opens
his folder, rummages for the photographs. Then,
exasperatedly --

			BREE
	Look, I told the police everything:
	I don't even remember the schlub!

Klute doesn't respond. Klute sets out a photograph
for her to look at.

INSERT: PHOTOGRAPH TOM GRUNEMANN

KLUTE, BREE

			BREE
	They showed me that one. I
	understand it's Grunemann, but I
	told them, I just don't remember.

Klute tosses down a second photograph.

INSERT: SECOND PHOTOGRAPH

Tom Grunemann, Elaine Grunemann, two daughters.

BREE, KLUTE

			BREE
		(cool)
	A family sort of man.

Klute grunts, meaning 'yes'. She echoes his grunt,
meaning we don't know what. He tosses another --

INSERT: WIDE PHOTOGRAPH - COMPANY PICNIC

An everybody-over-here, fellow-employees, sort of
picture. (Including the figures of Streiger and
Cable among many others, male and female.) The
usual impedimenta -- picnic baskets, balls, bats, a
held sign: 'Tole-American'. KLUTE'S FINGER
indicates --

			KLUTE (V.O.)
	-- Tom, again.

KLUTE, BREE

She looks at the picture briefly, at him
questioningly.

			KLUTE
	Company outing or picnic or
	something like that.

			BREE
	Isn't that sweet.
		(then)
	Well it could be any one of them
	bubi; I get to see them all.

She separates from Klute, around the table (but
remains standing, restless). Klute puts photo
aside, prepares to take notes, as she pleads --

			BREE (CONT'D)
	Look -- please -- will you just try
	to get it from my side? A year ago.
	I was in the life fulltime. I was
	living on Park with leather
	furniture and a million dresses.
	Then they dropped on me, the fuzz,
	they caged me -- they started
	asking me about a man, some man,
	I'm supposed to have seen a year
	before that. Two years ago, two. He
	could be in Yemen!

She waits for Klute to respond -- he doodles
permissively on his pad of paper -- she goes on.

			BREE (CONT'D)
	A name. Grunemann. Nothing. And
	they showed me pictures like this
	and they meant nothing. Then they
	asked me, well had I been getting
	letters, from someone out there in
	Cabbageville --

			KLUTE
	-- Tuscarora --

			BREE
	All right, yes, I had been. Those
	sick, wild letters -- I'm watching
	you, gonna follow you, gonna punish
	you, kill you et cetera. Well, they
	said, all right that's Grunemann.
	So try to remember when you and he 
	- when -- well I don't know, there
	was that dumper once, he sounded
	like that dumper --
		(explains)
	Dumpers; they get their kicks
	beating you up. A man hired me
	once, then tried to really kill me 
	- that'd be about two years ago.

Without warning she wheels to the open windows, and
shouts out full-voiced -- both startling and
somewhat intriguing Klute --

			BREE (CONT'D)
		(shouts)
	OK Tommy-baby, Allie-Allie-in-free
	kid, I got the gumdrops.

Turns around again, to Klute. Cheerfully --

			BREE (CONT'D)
	You remind me of my uncle.

			KLUTE
	What?
		(then --)
	What do you remember about that --
	dumper?

			BREE
	Nothing. Except he wasn't kidding.
	Usually it's a fakeout, you
	probably know. They pretend to tie
	you up, and you wear a dress with a
	cloth belt and they pretend to whip
	you or you --
		(beat)
	Hell it's their money. I'll hang
	from the shower rod and whistle
	Maytime. Except this guy was really
	tripped out on it; he --

			KLUTE
	But you can't say that Dumper was
	Tom Grunemann.

			BREE
	I can't say he was anybody!

A brief pause. Klute sorts his notes. She may take
it that he's packing to leave -- hopes so anyhow.
For an instant we see the undefended girl
underneath --

			BREE (CONT'D)
	So -- OK -- that's all?

Then again she changes manner -- remembering a
practical problem, approaching it as a matter-of
fact hooker.

			BREE (CONT'D)
	Well could I have them back now
	hon? -- those tape recordings
	you've got downstairs -- OK? -- and
	if you want you can have a good
	time and I'll have a good time and--

			KLUTE
	What about everything since?

She draws back again. Up to now she's been
reasonably on top of things. Starting now we see
her driven toward the things she'd really rather
not talk about -- and increasingly more shaken.

			KLUTE (CONT'D)
		(prompts)
	Everything that's happened since
	Tom Grunemann disappeared. The
	phone calls and the --

			BREE
	Just phone calls, right? They ring,
	you answer, they don't say
	anything, just blank. Kids getting
	kicks. Burglars looking for an
	empty apartment. I mean there is
	nothing that proves --

			KLUTE
	What about the other things you've
	reported? --
		(consulting notes)
	-- being followed on the --

			BREE
		(interrupts -- awkwardly)
	Look -- I'm sorry -- I've led
	everybody wrong. I mean yes, I get
	those feelings, but that's just me,
	that's just feelings.
		(beat)
	I'm sure this will amuse you;
	I'm scared of the dark. And
	sometimes I get shook up, I hear
	people or -- well, I'll come out in
	the morning and think someone's
	been prying at my mailbox, or
	there's a little -- trash outside
	my door and I wonder if someone
	left it there for -- do you see? --
	things other people wouldn't even
	notice. Well that's not real, it's
	just nerves; it's got nothing to do
	with --

The PHONE RINGS. She startles. Then approaches with
some difficulty -- but then answers with complete
calm in her Smith-girl voice.

			BREE (CONT'D)
	Bree Daniel.
		(listens. Brightly)
	Oh yes, Ted Carlin, how is Ted?
		(listens)
	Oh, well, thank you very much but
	maybe the next time you're in town?
		(listens)
	Well I just love Ted and I'd love
	to meet you -- you have a very nice
	voice -- but I just --
		(listens, grows impatient)
	Well I'm having a chat with a very
	nice cop. Actually not a real cop;
	he's a private inves --

A BUZZING from the phone; the connection abruptly
broken. She hangs up, recites.

			KLUTE
	Is that how you get most of your
	dates? Someone gives your name to
	someone else?

			BREE
	Most of them.

			KLUTE
	Is that how you met the Dumper? --
	Someone else gave --

			BREE
	How would I remember?

			KLUTE
	How else do you meet them? Pimps?
		(a beat)

			BREE
		(patient)
	You're very square. Pimps don't get
	you dates, cookie; they just take
	the money.

Klute takes up the slip of paper previously given
him by Trask. In the same manner as before --

			KLUTE
	I have some names the police gave
	me. Frank Ligourin. Will you tell
	me what --

			BREE
		(trembling)
	Look, I'm sure this'll amuse you
	too. Ilia trying to get away from
	all that.

			KLUTE
	What about the old gentleman the
	other night, Mr. Faber?

She freezes again, looking at him. Then savagely --

			BREE
	You saw that, goddamn you? You saw
	it? He's seventy. His wife's dead.
	He started cutting garments at
	fourteen. His whole life, he's
	maybe had a week's vacation, I'm
	all he has and he never, never
	touches me, and what harm in it,
	what --

She chokes -- then goes on --

			BREE (CONT'D)
	Klute, tell me, what's your bag?
	Are you a talker, or a button man
	or a doubler, or maybe you like
	them very young -- children -- or
	get your chest walked around with
	high-heeled shoes, or have us watch
	you tinkle? Or --

			KLUTE
		(under)
	-- OK --

			BREE
	-- You want to wear women's
	clothes, or you get off ripping
	things --

She grabs up the company picture, raging on --

			BREE (CONT'D)
	-- you perverted hypocrite square
	bastards.

			KLUTE
	OK.

Something in his inflection -- very slight --
cautions her. She falls silent as suddenly as she
began. Then cheerfully --

			BREE
	Gee I hope this doesn't make my
	cold any worse.

			KLUTE
	Tell me about Frank Ligourin.

			BREE
		(casual, pleasant)
	Mm? Oh, he was my old man. We broke
	up.

She wanders away toward a bureau. Her shirt seems
to itch her; she scratches her ribs. Then opens
drawer, takes out a different shirt as --

			KLUTE
	When?
		(beat)
	When did you and Ligourin break up?

She pulls off her shirt, unhooks her brassiere and
discards it, apparently quite unselfconscious.
Klute reacts; then, carefully maintaining his cool 
-

			KLUTE (CONT'D)
	Mind not doing that?

She turns to him in total innocence, holding the
shirt rather carelessly in front of her -- a new
attack.

			BREE
	What? This?

			KLUTE
	-- OK?

			BREE
		(ingenuously)
	I thought you could trick me for
	those tapes. Don't you get lonely
	in that little green room? Or let
	me get you someone; I have terrific
	friends, wild.

			KLUTE
	No thanks.

At this point -- or about this point -- Klute takes
note of something. A little above her. He grows
more watchful, but containing it carefully. We
don't understand the change in his manner -- or
even notice; she doesn't. In mock dismay --

			BREE
	Gee. I've had men pay two hundred
	dollars for me -- here, you're
	turning down a freebie.
		(pause)
	You can get a perfectly good
	dishwasher for that.

He has risen, is approaching her slowly -- carrying
his notes as if to check something. She is hopeful
again --

			BREE (CONT'D)
	You've changed your mind? You do
	want to play?

			KLUTE
		(quietly, steadily)
	I don't want you to look up.
	There's someone on the skylight.

She gasps, terrified -- immediately -- almost
beyond control. He taps the pencil on his notes.

			KLUTE (CONT'D)
	Easy -- pretend you're looking here-
		(more insistently)
	-- here.

She manages to take hold of a corner of the notes,
trembling. He goes on --

			KLUTE (CONT'D)
	Now I'm going to walk around -- you
	just keep talking, straight
	through, straight through.

He strolls away from her. His destination is the
area of the door -- out of view from the skylight --
from where he can head for the roof. But he doesn't
head that way directly -- first takes a turn in
another direction, his bearing casual. Prompting --

			KLUTE (CONT'D)
	Tell me about acting -- what are
	you doing tomorrow -- where do you
	go?

			BREE
		(manages, barely)
	I go on rounds.

			KLUTE
	Rounds, what are they? -- don't
	watch me, keep talking.

			BREE
	You go see agents -- or Equity
	calls, open casting calls. And ad
	agencies -- commercials -- you
	don't get work, you just go around.

Klute has strolled out of view from above --
instantly flattens himself against the wall, eases
the door open, about to slip and charge. As Bree
labors on --

			BREE (CONT'D)
	And they're always polite -- show
	people -- they say thank you very
	much. You lie there covered with
	blood, smiling, they say --

INT. LANDING AND LADDER TO ROOF - NIGHT

FOOTSTEPS across the roof above, as the watcher
discovers Klute's ruse. Klute opens the door --
climbs ladder to roof.

EXT. ROOFTOPS - NIGHT

-- Klute out, looking around --

EXT. ROOFTOPS: PAST KLUTE TO FLEEING FIGURE - NIGHT

The figure -- the man -- scissoring over the low
walls where one brownstone joins another. Klute
gives chase -- over ridges, past water tanks,
oddments of roof furniture --

EXT. SEVERAL ROOFTOPS BEYOND - NIGHT

The FIGURE races to a roof door disappearing into
abandoned building.

INT. STAIRWELL - ABANDONED BUILDING

CAMERA follows KLUTE as he cautiously makes his way
down the stairwell of the boarded up old
brownstone. He gets to the first floor. He can see
no exit in the building. He opens door that leads
to a narrow staircase into the cellar.

INT. CELLAR - ABANDONED BROWNSTONE

It is as black as a dungeon and as low. He lights a
match, but sees no one. There is a sound of
movement coming from the floor above, He runs up
the steps to the floor above and sees a very faint
light coming through one of the closed apartment
doors. Carefully takes out a gun and then with one
quick movement he breaks through the door.

INT. ABANDONED APARTMENT

The walls, ceiling, floors are entirely covered
with crudely painted psychedelic signs and sayings.
The room is lighted by some candies stuck in
bottles. Sitting on a blanket on the floor are
several teenaged boys and girls having a pot party.
They have obviously made a clubhouse for themselves
in the abandoned house. It is a MOOT POINT whether
they or KLUTE is more stunned at the sight that
faces them. He puts his gun away in embarrassment.
Again he has been made to feel like an awkward
peeping tom in this hidden world of the city.

INT. CELLAR - ABANDONED BUILDING

CAMERA wanders restlessly through the blackness and
stops at a pinpoint of light coming through a low 
door. CAMERA goes through opening into long narrow
furnace room with the ceiling so low that an
ordinary man could not stand up. We hear the sound
of breathing. CAMERA follows the sound through the
darkness revealing a sweaty man huddled in the
corner looking like some strange animal from a
painting by Bosch. It is Cable.

INT. BREE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Bree has wrapped herself in the quilt -- standing
up against a corner shivering, immobilized. We hear
KLUTE'S FOOTSTEPS DESCENDING -- she flinches -- he
enters.

			KLUTE
	I couldn't get him.

He sees her condition. Gently --

			KLUTE (CONT'D)
	It's all right.

He reaches to touch her -- she quails away from
him.

			BREE
	Well do you think it was him?

			KLUTE
	What do you think?

			BREE
	Can't you get him?

			KLUTE
	Maybe, if you tell me the things
	you haven't.

			BREE
		(pause)
	You asked me where I got that date
	with the dumper -- Frank sent me on
	it.

			KLUTE
	Do you know where he got the
	dumper?

			BREE
	He never told me.

			KLUTE
	Well, let's go down and ask him.

EXT. CENTRAL PARK WEST BUILDINGS - DAY

A shot catching the edge of CENTRAL PARK itself --
our first small view of greenery -- to the tall, be
limousined APARTMENT BUILDINGS OF C.P.W. The
FIGURES OF KLUTE, BREE walking upstreet, turning
under one of the canopies -- (Klute carries a
zipper book-case).

INT. APARTMENT HOUSE LOBBY - ON DOORMAN AT PHONE -
DAY

The DOORMAN hangs up the brass house-phone, smiles
and gestures them graciously into the (self
service) ELEVATOR. We see Klute -- without making
too much of it -- taking in the mirrors and marble
work.

INT. ELEVATOR (MOVING): KLUTE, BREE

She breaks the silence.

			BREE
	What did you expect? Frankie still
	has a good string, three girls.
	Figure three hundred a week from
	each.

			KLUTE
	Is that what you gave him?

Silence.

INT. LIGOURIN'S APARTMENT: ON DOOR - DAY

The BUZZER sounding, FRANK LIGOURIN crossing to
open the door for BREE, KLUTE. Cheerful,
hospitable, nice, unpretentious.

			FRANK
	Bree -- hi -- come in, come in.

The point of this one brief shot -- Bree's face --
in the instant after Frank has spoken and before
she enters, with Klute following. Her half-second
of hesitation. This is someone who gets to her
somehow -- probably always will.

WIDER LIGOURIN'S APT: THREESHOT - DAY

The apartment is as expected -- but not overdone; a
certain small amount of someone-lives-here litter.
A few, large but not very good, ABSTRACTIONS on the
walls. There is a large TABLE covered over with
photographs and mock-ups of magazine pages, a felt
board or easel with lettering samples -- Frank's
props really.

			BREE
	Frank -- Klute.

			FRANK
		(shakes hands)
	Hi. Come in.
		(leads them in, indicating
		table)
	I was just catching up some work --
	mocking up the photographs.
		(to Klute)
	I used to be a photographer myself 
	- Bree tell you? -- Before I got in
	the publishing.

			BREE
	Frank, he knows you're a pimp. He
	knows you were my pimp.

Short silence. Then with the tact of a gentleman
dealing with rude, difficult woman --

			FRANK
	Well Bree, maybe you'd rather --

He gestures gently to indicate outside. She nods
once. He escorts her in that direction, OUT the
door, closing it behind them.

INT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE LIGOURIN'S APARTMENT - DAY

He escorts her to the elevator, pushes the down
button for her. In silence so far. Then, quietly --
as one who knows the other's thoughts --

			FRANK
	How's it been?

She shrugs a shoulder at him, looks away. He goes
on in the same quiet voice.

			FRANK (CONT'D)
	With me Bree it's eternally the
	same. Toward you. I guess you know
	that.

			BREE
	Yeah Frank, I know that.

She yanks at the elevator doors. But the elevator's
not here yet. She turns away sharply into the door
marked "Stairway". He turns back to his apartment.

INT. LIGOURIN'S APARTMENT - DAY

Frank reenters, with the calm smile of troop
chaplain.

			FRANK
	I've always respected Bree.
		(then)
	I'd like to make something clear.

			KLUTE
	I've just got a few --

			FRANK
	I'd like to make something clear. I
	don't go after a girl; a girl comes
	to me. Her choice. Right?

He gestures Klute to one chair, sits in another,
waits calmly, attentively.

			KLUTE
	I'm looking for a man. Tom
	Grunemann.
		(no response, whatever)
	Bree thinks he may have been the
	dumper -- that call she had two
	years ago. She says you sent her on
	it.

			FRANK
	Two years ago? Sorry.

			KLUTE
	They tell me you use narcotics.
	Could I bring someone around to
	look at your arms?

			FRANK
	Look -- dad -- I may stand better
	with the cops than you.

Klute waits.

			FRANK (CONT'D)
	OK, a family matter. Between the
	girls. I had two other cows --
		(corrects himself)
	-- two other girls besides Bree.

			KLUTE
	She told me.

			FRANK
	OK and one of them  Jane McKenna --
	she blows a little jealous of Bree 
	- you know? -- Bree comes first?
	And evidently she knew the freak ---
	that he was a dumper -- she conned
	me into passing him to Bree, you
	know, so Bree'd get hurt. I didn't
	know. Till afterwards.

			KLUTE
	Why didn't you tell Bree,
	afterwards?

			FRANK
		(a little shocked)
	You don't tell them. That one of
	their own in-laws laid a dumper on
	them?
		(shakes head)
	Peace in the family.
		(pause)
	Beyond that, I don't know. All she
	wrote.

			KLUTE
	I'd like to talk with Jane McKenna.

			FRANK
		(smiles)
	Would I be telling you all this?
	She copped out long ago. She
	committed suicide Baxter.

INT. APARTMENT HOUSE LOBBY: BREE - DAY

BREE sits, looks with curiosity at housewives her
age -- bringing their children in from the park, as
if trying to imagine what their lives could be
like. KLUTE emerges from elevator.

EXT. STREET (TWO SHOT) - DAY

			BREE
	Did you like my friend Frankie?

			KLUTE
	No.

			BREE
	Didn't he tell you what you wanted?

			KLUTE
	It didn't go anywhere.
		(then)
	But that's not why --

			BREE
	About the dumper, didn't he tell
	you that?

			KLUTE
	It was Jane McKenna who sent you
	the dumper.

			BREE
		(coldly)
	Well -- she's dead.

At the corner he slows, starts unzipping his
bookcase as if indicating a change of route.

			BREE (CONT'D)
	I thought you were going back to
	the apartment.

			KLUTE
		(he shakes his head)
	You said you wanted these.

He hands over the TAPE-REELS.

			BREE
	Oh golly, oh just what I've always
	dreamed of, dirty phone calls.
		(then)
	How come?

			KLUTE
	You told me what you could. I guess
	I'm through with your part of it.

			BREE
		(grudgingly)
	Is there anything more I could --

			KLUTE
	I don't see anything, do you?

			BREE
	What're you gonna do next?

			KLUTE
	Try some other ways.
		(starts off)

			BREE
	What do I do meanwhile? -- wait for
	that clown to fall through the
	skylight on me?

			KLUTE
	And I don't think that was Tom.

			BREE
	You said it was!

			KLUTE
	No, I said what did you think.

			BREE
	Oh -- wait -- oh I get it. You said
	that just to keep me scared. So I'd
	tell you everything I -- oh clever;
	oh you smart, tricky hick.

			KLUTE
	Well --

			BREE
		(harshly)
	Hey, but did we get to you, Klute?
	A little?

			KLUTE
	Yeah, you got to me.

			BREE
	-- Us city folks? The sin, the
	glitter, the wickedness?

			KLUTE
	Oh. No. Not that way. I'd say it
	was more -- I don't know --
		(hunts the word)
	-- too bad? Pathetic?

			BREE
	Goodbye.

She turns smartly away, deposits the tapes in
passing in a litter box, departs. Klute looks after
her for a moment, then turns on his way. Then --

EXT. POV THROUGH LITTERBOX IN FOREGROUND TO POV OF
FIGURES OF KLUTE, BREE - DAY

This shot holds both in view for a moment, until
they both disappear separately in the traffic.
CAMERA moves in slightly on litterbox as a man's
hand comes into frame and removes the tapes.

INT. KLUTE'S APARTMENT: KLUTE - NIGHT

Klute, in pajama bottoms, lies in bed. A miserably
hot humid night. KNOCK at the door. He answers.
BREE stands in the doorway in bare feet.

			BREE
	What the hell do you mean,
	pathetic?

She walks in past him, sits down on the edge of his
bed.

			KLUTE
	It's kind of late.

			BREE
	It got lonely upstairs. There's
	someone on the roof.

He takes her seriously, starts to move.

			BREE (CONT'D)
	Oh, don't be a doo-doo.

			KLUTE
	Not much point to this, is there?

			BREE
		(placidly)
	Ezra, I'm lots better than you're
	used to. Tell me -- the other
	night, watching me with Mr. Faber --
	wasn't your tongue a little bit
	hanging out?

			KLUTE
	Mm.

			BREE
	So you're not too different from
	him, or the chap on the roof, or
	Tommy-baby --

He starts for the bed, as if to lift her onto her
feet. She takes off her robe and swings her legs
up, and under the sheet.

			BREE (CONT'D)
	Look, if you don't use it somebody
	else just will. And you've done
	your whole bit with me, your entire
	duty, and so now this is my thing.
	So enjoy, Mr. Faber would say,
	enjoy.

Under the sheet she unlooses her pajama bottoms,
kicks them away, starts unbuttoning the shirt.

			KLUTE
	Bree -- thanks -- I don't want to.

			BREE
	Oh don't be all hypocrite. Or do
	you really like other kicks? Is it
	more just having power over
	someone? -- so you don't really
	need to --

He tries to rebutton the pajama shirt. She catches
his hand, thrusts it underneath. In grief and anger
--

			BREE (CONT'D)
	Who the hell are you, buttoning me
	up?

					  QUICK
					  DISSOLVE --

UPSHOT, C.U.

Their bodies lock together descending toward camera
--

					  DISSOLVE --

DOWNSHOT, C.U. SAME ACTION

Her hands slide about his shoulders. She is
laughing softly, affectionately, mockingly --

			BREE
	I knew it, I knew it, a killer.

					  DISSOLVE --

C.U., HER FACE

-- triumphantly, contemptuously, orgiastically --

			BREE
	Oh lover -- oh you thrill me -- oh,
	it's beautiful -- oh yes, yes -- oh
	like that, like that, yes --

					  DISSOLVE --

FACES

Klute gasps deeply -- entering orgasm. As soon as
she hears it, judges it, she drops her hands from
his shoulders, stills her own movements, lies
utterly passive, smiling calmly, letting him finish
for himself. He can't stop -- cries out -- cries
out again, burying his face against her -- is done.

Then he slowly raises up, shuddering, looking down
at her. He knows what she's done to him, is
helpless to do anything back. He rolls slowly out
of the embrace of her legs and lies silently --
looking upward, very much as we saw him at start of
scene.

FAVORIVG BREE

She waits, still smiling, for a while. But she's
not done with him yet. She rolls to lie with her
upper body on his, trailing her fingers across his
face. Affectionately, as a good whore --

			BREE (CONT'D)
	What's the matter hon? You were
	great. Terrific. A tiger.

			KLUTE
	Thanks.

			BREE
	Well what're you down about? You
	mean because you didn't get me
	there?
		(pause, comfortingly)
	You can't expect that. I mean
	Frank, yes, he'd get me there all
	the time -- but never with a John.

She sits up, gropes her pajamas from the floor,
puts them on. In the same fond tone --

			BREE (CONT'D)
	And I'm sorry I can't stay and
	learn your special little games.
	And I certainly don't want you to
	feel bad about this -- losing your
	virtue all of a sudden -- because I
	sort of knew you would. As I said,
	like everyone, right?

She has the pajamas and robe on, pauses near the
door --

			BREE (CONT'D)
	Besides - you can always tell
	yourself you made me come
	downstairs. Ta, luv.

INT. THEATRE: READING SCENE - DAY

A WIDE SHOT. An open casting call in an Off
Broadway Theatre. Darkness, except for the work
light onstage. A small GROUP there -- onstage --
including the figure of BREE. Just offstage, the
figures of DIRECTOR (JANG) and a PRODUCER. And the
rest of the theatre, the audience section, dotted
with the heads of ACTORS, ACTRESSES waiting for
their turns. Bree's voice rings out across the
gloom.

			BREE
	-- Why?

CLOSER, ONSTAGE

The others stand rigid as statues, facing dead
front -- an experimental drama, clearly -- all
holding scripts, as Bree hastens from one to
another, fiercely, imploringly --

			BREE (CONT'D)
	Why -- please, why? -- Why lose,
	why look? Why hate and give and
	want and love? Why get, grieve, g --

			JANG
		(loudly, cheerfully)
	Thank you very much.

All break posture, start offstage, while Bree,
caught in mid-stride, clowns it a little.

			BREE
	-- gug -- gug --

-- then toward Jang, a bit succinctly, indicating
script --

			BREE (CONT'D)
	Why? -- I want to know what.

			JANG
		(laughs tolerantly)
	No, that was very good everybody.
	Do we have all your resumes?

			PRODUCER
		(from list)
	Booth -- Osman -- Zuff -- Anjeris
	Chaka.

WIDER, near stage front.

Bree shrugs, steps down off stage with the others.
Bree finds Jang's hand out for her script, smiles
wanly, turns it over, continues on out of scene.

She finds something - someone -- impeding her way.
Looks up.

PAST BREE TO KLUTE

Klute has edged out into the aisle to intercept
her.

EXT. THEATRE ENTRANCE: GREENWICH VILLAGE - DAY

Bree comes out, turns.

			KLUTE
	You asked if there was anything
	more you could help me with.

			BREE
	When?

Pause. Impasse.

			KLUTE
	I've checked the records of Jane
	McKenna's death -- I can't get
	anything special. But Frank
	Ligourin had another girl you said,
	besides McKenna and you.

			BREE
	Arlyn Page.

			KLUTE
	Did she and Jane McKenna know each
	other?

			BREE
	Frankie kept them in the same
	apartment: it cut his travel-time.

			KLUTE
	Then maybe Arlyn Page knew the
	Dumper too.

			BREE
	Arlyn had a very big habit - heroin
	- she's the one who started Frank.
	She's strung out now; you won't
	find her.

			KLUTE
	You could help me find her. You
	know the people.
		(as she turns away)
	I'll pay you a hundred dollars.

			BREE
	I can make that in a lunch break!
		(then)
	Look, Hiram, you're sure it isn't
	just me? -- you decided you liked
	it, after all, the other night;
	you'll hang around for seconds?

			KLUTE
	Don't worry.

She examines him -- shrugs -- turns, proceeds along
the sidewalk, Klute accompanying --

EXT. DISCOTHEQUE - NIGHT

In the small hours. The same place seen previously,
the gathering place. KLUTE, BREE arriving and
entering.

INT. DISCOTHEQUE - NIGHT

Klute and Bree head toward the rear. Her arrival
causes a little stir. She exchanges greetings with
one or two, is watched by others.

			BREE
	Joanie -- Mike, hi --
		(to another, a Negro girl)
	Hi Pat.

			PAT
		(giggles)
	Hey Bree honey, who you got?

			BREE
	A new daddy. I'n he cute?

Bree leads on to where --

PAST KLUTE, BREE TO TRINA

TRINA sits alone at a rear table -- anything but a
whore in appearance -- a quietly beautiful,
immaculately dressed woman of about thirty.

			BREE (CONT'D)
	Trina this is Klute. I told you
	about him.

			TRINA
	Oh yes Mr. Klute -- won't you both
	join me?
		(as they sit)
	And how do you like our fair city?
	There's so much here don't you
	think? The museums and the books
	and the foreign films -- Bree, have
	you seen the Godard film?

			BREE
	Uh uh.

			TRINA
	Oh you've got to. He does such fun
	things with imagery. And I've been
	reading The Fall --
		(to Klute, enunciating
		carefully)
	-- The Fall by Ahlbair Camoo --
	it's the same thing, you know the
	imagery --

			BREE
		(patiently)
	Trina honey, he just wants to find
	Arlyn Page.

Trina undergoes a change of demeanor. Flatly --

			TRINA
	Why? She's a junkie.

			BREE
		(prods gently)
	She was with you after she left
	Frank.

			TRINA
	Well she's not now.
		(then quavering --)
	I did everything for Arlyn. I loved
	Arlyn I took her right into my
	apartment, my own sweet apartment
	on First. But she wouldn't stay off
	it -- the junk -- and I wept and I
	pleaded and I held her in my arms -
	and she started taking things, my
	things, and selling them for horse.
	My clothes.
	We could've had everything
	together, everything -- and then
	the bitch sold
	my mink!

INT. ANOTHER LATE NIGHT SPOT - NIGHT

We dolly with KLUTE & BREE as they walk in front of
a row of tables. This night spot is totally black
except for a series of huge slide projections on
the wall in back of the tables. The slides, which
change every few seconds are elegant
representations of the beautiful people living the
good life as seen in such magazines as VOGUE, TOWN
& COUNTRY & HARPERS BAZAAR. The customers sitting
in the darkness below provide a direct contrast to
the pictures in back. The silhouette figures of
BREE & KLUTE stop at a table seating three people,
two call girls and a pimp. CAMERA moves in.

			FIRST GIRL
	Arlyn Page?

			SECOND GIRL
	You'll never catch up; she's
	grooved out.

			BREE
	Gil?

The pimp looks distrustfully at Klute who reassures
--

			KLUTE
	I'm not looking for her personally 
	- someone she might know about.

			PIMP
		(shrugs; to Bree)
	Try Janie Dale.

INT. JANIE DALE'S PENTHOUSE

It is a very small penthouse. KLUTE & BREE stand in
the small living room waiting for JANIE DALE. There
are two very casually dressed prostitutes sitting
around the living room. One sits at an upright
piano playing of all things STRANGERS IN THE NIGHT.
Another one sits on a couch talking to a Wall
Street Broker who is spending his lunch hour. KLUTE
finds himself staring down into a pile of
pornography magazines on the coffee table. BREE is
amused at his discomfort.
JANIE DALE, the madame, who has been on the phone
in the back, puts the receiver down and crosses to
the girl on the couch. JANIE looks and talks a bit
like Lauren Bacall.

			JANIE DALE
		(to girl on couch)
	It's old Mr. Clean from Cleveland.
	He wants to know when he can fly in
	and clean up the apartment and see
	you. I told him I have all the
	cleaning equipment and that he can
	come anytime, but it's up to you.

GIRL on couch rises.

			GIRL
	You know he wants us to be
	dominant.

			JANIE DALE
	Tell him that he'd better have his
	ass in here by one o'clock on
	Monday afternoon or you won't let
	him clean the bathroom floor, and
	tell him the price has gone up
	twenty bucks -- Old Dutcn
	Cleanser's not as cheap as it used
	to be.

She shrugs and turns to KLUTE & BREE.

			JANIE DALE (CONT'D)
	You wanted to know about Arlyn,
	honey? I had to let her go dear.
	Arlyn stopped being reliable.
		(explains to Klute)
	I deal with a high type client,
	business people, you understand? I
	can't send them someone that's all
	the time half zonked out.

			KLUTE
	Do you know where she went?

			JANIE DALE
	Try Momma Reese.

THIS IS A CHEAPER APARTIENT THAN JANIE DALE'S

The girls look cheaper, and the customers, rather
than Wall Street lawyers and brokers, look more
like out of town salesmen who stay at local motor
inns.

MOMMA REESE is older than JANIE DALE, heavier and
with no pretense at chic. She indicates that she
has not seen ARLYN in some time.

			MOMMA REESE
	Try Bill Azure. If you can find
	him.

INT. EIGHT AVENUE BAR - ABOUT 4 IN THE MORNING

This is a hangout where black and white pimps wait
to meet their whores after their night of street
walking. This streetwalker world is far removed
from the world of the call girl or the world of
Janie Dale. CAMERA pans past a group of pimps at
the bar taking bet on whose girls have made the
most money that night. CAMERA then goes on to
reveal KLUTE talking to another pimp (Azure). Azure
represents a clear step down from Frank Ligourin. 

We catch only part of their dialogue.

			AZURE
	-- a couple weeks then she'd drift
	off a couple of weeks, you know
	what I mean?

			KLUTE
	Have you heard from her recently?

			AZURE
	She liked me all right but she had
	what she liked better, you know
	what I mean?

We START FADE SOUND as Klute repeats --

			KLUTE
	Have you heard from her recently?

-- and CUT TO --

INT. LINGERIE SHOP: PROPRIETRESS, BREE, KLUTE

			PROPRIETRESS
	-- She'd come in and I'd let her
	have something. Why not; she'd been
	a good customer, a beautiful
	person, a beautiful beautiful
	person.

Again we fade sound a little before picture, then
CUT TO --

EXT. OUTSIDE ADULT MOVIE THEATER: KLUTE,
STREETWALKERS - DAY OR NIGHT

Outside Theatre or Bookstore - Peepshow; an 8th
Avenue establishment. SILENT ACTION this (or VOICES
UNDER). Klute confers with one girl who summons and
consults another. They seem to know of Arlyn --
haven't seen her recently -- refer him elsewhere --

EXT. APARTMENT HOUSE: MRS. VASEK, KLUTE - DAY

A shabby place in a shabby neighborhood. Mrs.
Vasek, the landlady, shifts barrels at the same
time that she barks at Klute, in heavy accent.

			MRS. VASEK
	The whore, yeah. I threw out.

			KLUTE
	Do you know where she went from
	here?

			MRS. VASEK
	Live like animals. Her and the man.
	Out.

			KLUTE
		(reacts)
	Was she living with a man?

We see Klute persisting - DISSOLVE

EXT. WIDE SHOT: SLUM STREET - DAY

We still HOLD WIDE to establish the scene. This is
a genuine slum. We see Bree, Klute move along
street. We see Bree drop back a little, Klute
waiting for her to catch up.

EXT. STREET: BREE, KLUTE

			KLUTE
	What's the matter?

			BREE
		(glances about)
	What the hell do you think's the
	matter.
		(then suggests)
	I could wait for you someplace.

			KLUTE
	If Arlyn Page is living with Tom
	Grunemann --

			BREE
		(eagerly)
	-- Then you don't need me.

			KLUTE
	But if it's someone else I do.

He starts on, simply assuming that she'll follow.
(There is a degree of acquaintanceship in their
manners now - a reluctant collaboration.)

			BREE
	You sure pull a lot of mileage out
	of a hundred dollars.

-- and follows on. He checks numbers, then crosses
street diagonally toward a half-framed house.

INT. NEWARK HOUSE - DAY

A downshot from second floor level toward the entry
way where KLUTE & BREE appear. KLUTE strikes a
match to inspect the names of tenants. He and Bree
climb through stench and litter to the second floor
-- a door. From somewhere near at hand come the
sounds of someone RETCHING. A square of wood has
been sawed out of the door itself, removing handle
and lock -- light sifts through. Klute hesitates,
decides against knocking, pushes in.

INT. ARLYN'S APARTMENT - DAY

The retching sounds are coming from the connecting
room. No one visible here. A very few barren pieces
of furniture. We hear ARLYN'S VOICE ask from the
next room --

			ARLYN (O.S.)
	Cappy?

ARLYN enters rather eagerly. She sees Klute first,
then Bree -- recognizes her -- retires flat against
a wall, holding one palm outwards to shield her
face. She is unbelievably gaunt. Inside one elbow,
looking rather like a birthmark, we see a lacework
of purple where her veins have pulped together.

			BREE
	Arlyn? Honey?
		(then)
	Look, it's all right.

From the connecting room a MAN'S VOICE (Berger's)
calling out hoarsely.

			BERGER (O.S.)
	Is it Cappy? Cappy? --

			BREE
	Arlyn, it's all right.

BERGER hastens, stumbles, into the doorframe
carrying a CAR-RADIO with wires dangling, speaks
before he sees them.

			BERGER
	Cappy, I got a radio!

He stops for an instant face-to-face with Klute.
Then turns, plunges out of view again. Arlyn breaks
after.

			ARLYN
	No --

We hear the MUMBLE and WHISPER of their voices from
the connecting room (as she reassures him). Bree
looks inquiringly at Klute (is that Grunemann?): he
shakes his head. Pause, then ARLYN reenters,
wrapping her fingers together timidly -- wanting
them out -- her only purpose.

			ARLYN (CONT'D)
	Bree -- honey - please, we're
	waiting for someone.

			BREE
	Arlyn, he just wanted to ask some
	questions -- something you could
	help us about.

			ARLYN
	Can't you see I'm strung out?
		(cries out)
	Please, we're waiting for it --
	he's got to have it!

			KLUTE
	We'll go. Just something you could
	tell us, first.

Arlyn seems to accept the bargain. He indicates to
Bree to proceed, stands away a little. Arlyn covers
her elbow with one hand. Bree manages as best she
can.

			BREE
	Honey, a couple of years ago, with
	Jane and Frankie? -- Jane sent me a
	Dumper --

			ARLYN
	Please, if he sees you, he won't
	come!

			BREE
	Arlyn, just tell me, did Jane have
	a dumper, one of her regular Johns?

			ARLYN
	What about him? Yes.

			BREE
	Did he come around often?

Klute hands Grunemann's picture to Bree: Bree shows
it to Arlyn. Arlyn inspects it, then uncertainly,
weakly --

			ARLYN
	No. He was an older man hon. The
	dumper was older.

			KLUTE
	Do you remember his name? What can
	you tell me about him?

We hear FOOTSTEPS - UNDER, DIMLY - mounting the
stairs. Bree notices them first, Klute persisting
with Arlyn --

			BERGER (O.S.)
		(shouts desperately)
	Arlyn, get them out.

			ARLYN
	Please, I am begging you.

			KLUTE
	It's important.

			ARLYN
	That's not the Dumper, that's all!
	He was an older man!

			KLUTE
	Can you give me any more
	description than that?

Arlyn catches the footsteps, dodges past him toward
the door, intending to reassure --

			ARLYN
	Cappy? --

-- as the pusher, CAPPY, steps in. All of this is
very quick, simultaneous, a confusion of voices.
CAPPY takes one look at Klute --

			ARLYN (CONT'D)
	It's all right, they're all right --

-- turns and runs.

			BERGER (O.S.)
	Cappy? -- Cappy?

Cappy's FOOTSTEPS race away down the stairs. BERGER
plunges out from the connecting room, still
carrying the car radio, shouting, pursuing --

			BERGER (CONT'D)
	Cappy it's all right! I got a radio
	-- don't run, don't --

We hear him STUMBLE AND FALL on the stairs outside,
the sound of body reeling down. Arlyn shrieks and
races after: Klute and Bree follow.

INT. HOUSE: LOWER HALL - DAY

We see BERGER lying at the foot of the stairs. As
Arlyn clatters down toward him, Berger sways up
onto his knees. His nose is bloodied, he cries.
Arlyn casts herself on her knees beside him, pulls
his face against her, croons to him, soothes and
tends him.

			ARLYN
	Oh baby -- no it's all right -- oh
	my baby baby baby --

Klute and Bree are only a half-step behind. Klute
offers to assist: Arlyn puts him away ferociously.

			ARLYN (CONT'D)
	Get out!
		(to Berger, again)
	Don't cry my baby; I'll find him,
	I'll get it. Baby, baby, don't cry.
		(to Klute savagely,
		incoherently)
	Leave us alone! Get out and get out
	and leave us alone!
		(to Berger)
	My honey, my baby, my baby --

We DISSOLVE TO --

INT. SUBWAY TRAIN: REFLECTION IN WINDOW OF BREE AND
KLUTE SITTING SIDE BY SIDE

CAMERA moves in closer so we only see reflection of
BREE looking at herself and at the world seeming to
speed by at an inhuman pace as the lights of the
tunnel zoom past her face. What she sees is the
figure of a woman with life screaming past her out
of control.

INT. SUBWAY

SUBWAY slows to a stop and a door opens. BREE sits
with KLUTE staring at the open door and then
without warning - gets up and runs off the train.
The door closes, leaving KLUTE locked in the train.

SUBWAY EXIT

SHOT of BREE's feet rushing up the stairs in
darkness and then quick cut to her face as she hits
the sunlight. She pauses for a moment - relieved to
be out of the darkness.

EXT. ROOFTOP OF BREE'S BROWNSTONE - NIGHT

CAMERA pans from night view of New York City to
KLUTE sitting on the rooftop alone as if trying to
comprehend all he has seen, the mystery of TOM
GRUNEMANN's disappearance in this world and the
mysteries of the behavior of BREE.

SKYLIGHT INTO BREE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Alongside of him the skylight of BREE's apartment
lights up. He looks through the skylight and sees
BREE enter her apartment. He can hear BREE talking
to somebody, and then he sees that she is talking
to FRANK LIGOURIN.

KLUTE watches through the skylight and hears bits
and pieces of the scene between BREE and FRANK. He
sees the same kind of symbiosis, the same kind of
parody of loving that he saw between ARLYN &
BERGER. As the scene becomes more intimate he
leaves.

INT. CABLE'S (CITY) OFFICE: ON KLUTE - DAY

The pristine, antiseptic, elegance off CABLE'S
office is in its own way as unreal and dehumanized
as the sexual underworld KLUTE has been exploring
with BREE, and KLUTE looks as out of place in the
one as he does in the other. TRASK sits beside
KLUTE facing CABLE who is impeccably dressed. He is
the total image of the executive in control.

			CABLE
	She wouldn't be reliable anyhow --
	a narcotics addict.

			KLUTE
	I believed her, Pete.

			TRASK
	He's right you know. Waiting for
	the pusher, she'd tell you
	anything.

			KLUTE
	I believed her: the Dumper was not
	Tom Grunemann.

			CABLE
	All right, suppose it wasn't Tom
	Grunemann; where does that get you?

			KLUTE
		(smiles ruefully)
	It's where it doesn't get me. I've
	got nothing left that connects to
	anything.

			CABLE
	Then, close the case.

			KLUTE
	I better keep looking.

			CABLE
	Where, how?

			KLUTE
		(the best he can offer)
	I could try Arlyn Page again. She
	saw much more of the Dumper than
	Bree Daniel.

			CABLE
	You just finished telling me she
	had nothing to offer. Not Tom, you
	said, the Dumper was clearly not
	Tom.

			KLUTE
	It's got to make sense some way.

CABLE'S SECRETARY appears for a moment tapping her
watch significantly.

			SECRETARY
	Mr. Cable -- they are meeting in
	Mr. Camara's office.

			CABLE
	Yes Evvie, thanks. Gentlemen, I'm
	sorry.

They rise, dismissed. He sorts a paper or two,
continues to Klute.

			CABLE (CONT'D)
	I'm flying back out to Pennsylvania
	Friday; I'll fill them in on
	things.

			KLUTE
	How is it back there?

			CABLE
	I think you're homesick.
		(reflects)
	I'll be out at my camp over the
	weekend. Nice right now, that touch
	of fall in the air, that skim of
	frost in the early mornings, very
	peaceful.
		(briskly again)
	John, I'll be back here again
	Thursday; I'll be in touch.
	Lieutenant, thank you.

KLUTE and TRASK depart.

CABLE closes the door and returns to his desk. He
pulls out a tape recorder from a drawer in his
desk, rewinds it and turns it on. We hear a
playback of the previous scene with KLUTE and
TRASK. He stands at the window listening with some
satisfaction; as if listening to what KLUTE
revealed keeps him in control of the situation.

EXT. WINDOW - CABLE'S OFFICE - DAY

The CAMERA pulls back from a CU of CABLE standing
at the window to a wide angle looking at CABLE
through the window. The window is 30 or 40 stories
high. The wide angle lens almost makes the building
look like it is standing on point, and CABLE, a man
suspended in space.

EXT. WIDE SHOT: DOCKS - DAY

A TUGBOAT has pulled in. The SOUND of its heavy
ENGINES, IDLING, runs underneath this entire
sequence. A POLICE VEHICLE or two has parked at the
head of the dock. We see several figures on the
rear deck of the tug, but it's not clear at this
distance what they're doing. The POLICE CAR WITH
KLUTE arrives. He dismounts and proceeds from dock
to tug-deck.

EXT. TUGBOAT DECK: GROUP - DAY

TRASK glances toward Klute as he arrives, but
doesn't greet him. His attention, like the others,
is directed downward and

off-scene (to the surface of the water actually,
just outboard of the tug). We see beside Trask TWO
Uniformed Cops (SUGARMAN and SPENCE) and DECKHANDS.
And we hear, along with the throbbing of the
engines, a stirring about of the water and a
peculiar third noise -- rather commingled with the
engines -- which we can't at first identify.

Klute joins the group, watches.

SPENCE brings into view, and shakes out, a giant
neoprene body bag. INSTRUCTIONS among the group AD
LIB, UNDER --

			TRASK
		(toward Klute)
	They were bringing a freighter down
	through Kill Van Kull; propellers
	washed it up on top.

SUGARMAN brings into view a METAL BASKET attached
with short ropes. He complains --

			SUGARMAN
	Why didn't you bring it up on deck?

			DECKHAND
	Would you bring it up on deck?

They slip the basket downward, out of frame (into
the water).

			DECKHAND (CONT'D)
		(to other)
	Mickey, get something. Get the eels
	off.

			SPENCE
		(calmly)
	They'll drop off theirselves when
	she comes out.

We CUT TO -

BERGER - DAY

We see Berger sitting huddled against the tugboat
cabin -- we haven't seen him before -- with his
hands bunched in front of his mouth. We identify
the noise which may have puzzled us before -- his
SOBBING.

DOWNSHOT: SURFAICE OF WATER, BASKET, BODY

We catch a fleeting glimpse of the body being
lifted, just before it breaks the surface of the
water.

FAVORING KLUTE

Klute looks on as EFFECTS trace the processing of
the body. SPENCE kneels down out of frame to slide
the bag around it. TRASK kneels down to make a
brief examination -- straightens again. To Klute --

			TRASK
	It'll go to the Examiner. But I
	don't see nothin that means nothin.

We MOVE WITH KLUTE as he turns and moves away a few
feet along deck. Here he stands. Then SUGARMAN
moves into view holding a clipboard. Routinely --

			SUGARMAN
	You help us with ID? We can't get
	nothin from him.

He indicates the direction of Berger. Klute
examines the clipboard data.

			KLUTE
	Arlyn Page was probably an alias.
	She went by the names Terry Arlyn
	and June Price. She may have been
	from Pittsburgh, someone told me. I
	can give you a list of people who
	knew her, if that would help to --

			SUGARMAN
	No point, thanks.

			KLUTE
	Is he claiming the body?

			SUGARMAN
	Uh uh, that'd mean funeral
	expenses.

He spits, moves back in the direction of the group;
Klute continues to stand. BERGER moves in his
direction. Brokenly --

			BERGER
	Man could you help me?

Klute doesn't understand his purport, reacts
instantly, sympathetically --

			KLUTE
	Yeah, what?

			BERGER
	You know, help me out. That's my
	baby there, dead. I got to get up.

Klute stares at him -- a quiet horror -- as Berger
insists --

			BERGER (CONT'D)
	Man you don't know what that does
	to me, my baby dead --

			KLUTE
	-- You've got to get up.

			BERGER
	Yeah.

Klute shoves a bill in his hand, turns away very
sharply, off the tugboat.

EXT. DOCK: KLUTE - DAY

Klute walks a longer distance this time, sits down
on one of the pilings of the dock. Watching him we
see what might be a profound awe and grief at all
these things -- but is, in fact, a good deal more.

EFFECTS, O.S. as Police Vehicles are loaded, driven
away and as tug toots, runs up engines, puts out
again.

TRASK moves into scene, sits on another piling,
looks at him speculatively. Silence. Then --

			TRASK
	That's how the other one died, you
	know. In the water.

			KLUTE
		(nods)
	I looked it up.

Then -- (we are assuming a complete understanding
here between Klute and Trask, non-verbal. What
Trask is asking, in effect, is: is this meaningful?
Do we both suspect the same man?)

			TRASK
	Well?

			KLUTE
	Yeah.

INT. BREE'S APARTMENT - DAY

It is late afternoon, but BREE is in her pajamas
curled up in her bed. There are some magazines
scattered around the bed and the television set is
on an old movie. There are cracker crumbs in the
bed and a cup of coffee and an open jar of peanut
butter with the knife sticking out of the jar on
the floor by the bed. It would seem that BREE has
spent most of the day in bed. She looks like an
unkempt child. The phone is ringing, but she does
not answer it. The phone no sooner stops than the
door bell rings. Reluctantly she gets out of bed
and goes to the door. She looks through the spy
hole and sees Klute's face. She undoes two locks
and an obviously new chain and bolt and opens the
door.

			BREE
	Well hello -- come on in.

He barely enters the room. His manner is cool and
remote.

			KLUTE
	I thought you ought to know, Arlyn
	Page is dead.

			BREE
	How?

			KLUTE
	The same as Jane McKenna.

			BREE
		(she betrays no reaction)
	Thanks for the jolly news. I
	thought maybe you'd left town by
	now. You kind of just disappeared.
	But you boys from Tuscarora have a
	habit of disappearing, don't you?

Klute looks around the disorderly room. The plants
in the windowsill have never been in worse shape.
They look as if she deliberately let them die of
thirst.

			KLUTE
	The next few weeks I would like to
	know where you are all the time.

			BREE
		(harshly)
	Why?

			KLUTE
	Just let me know when you are going
	out and where --

			BREE
	What if i go out on tricks - you
	wanna come along? You could sit and
	read the National Geographic.

			KLUTE
	How can you do it to yourself?

			BREE
		(coolly)
	I don't get you.

			KLUTE
	Ligourin: How could you do it?

			BREE
	I told you before, you wouldn't
	understand.

			KLUTE
	You're right, I don't understand.
	Explain it to me.
		(pause)
	You were scared. Arlyn Page, that
	scared you. Well it should; that's
	death.
	So what did you do, you ran
	straight for it, death. Ligourin
	kills women.

			BREE
	No.

			KLUTE
	No, no you're right, I'm sorry. He
	uses women; he lets them kill
	themselves. Is that how you want
	it?

			BREE
	Arlyn was a junkie; I'm not on
	junk!

			KLUTE
	No, you can find some other way.
		(beat)
	Explain it to me. Bree, show me any
	sense to --

			BREE
		(screams, incoherently)
	You get the Christ out! You dumb
	stupid bastard, you don't know
	anything, you square, you get out!
	I don't have to show you anything;
	you get out!

Klute goes.

INT. KLUTE'S APARTMENT - DAY

The empty apartment. He enters, switches a light on
(dusk), tosses aside jacket, bookcase, etc., then
sits down on the edge of his bed, with one foot
propped up on it.

FOOTSTEPS and A RAP at the door. He looks up, but
doesn't move, doesn't answer. BREE opens it,
enters. There are tear-tracks down her face, but
she's no longer crying. She tries to smile, tries
to explain her wants. Then with the unhurried,
graven composure of absolute desperation, she sits
on the edge of the bed.

			BREE
	If I asked you something, would you
	not laugh? -- asked you to look at
	something?

She pushes up her sleeve, points at tiny spot on
her arm - a freckle. He peers at it then at her
puzzledly.

			BREE (CONT'D)
		(apologetic)
	I thought it was maybe changing
	shape or something.

Klute looks at it again. Judiciously --

He shows her a spot or two on his own forearm. She
compares, is reassured. Embarrassedly, she tries to
smile. It is unsuccessful. She gets up and moves
about. Her manner in general is totally unguarded,
honest, undramatic, searching.

			BREE (CONT'D)
	Look -- I hate everybody; and I'm
	sorry for everybody; and I'm scared
	all the time.

He only grunts. A sound like 'OK' or 'all right' --
an invitation to leave. But she won't be driven
away. More urgently, helplessly:

			BREE (CONT'D)
	Look, I don't know either. It's
	like the only thing I know how to
	do -- I feel safe.

She's left the door a little ajar. He widens it for
her.

			KLUTE
	It's been a full day.

She pushes it out of his hand, pushes it shut. A
little more angrily:

			BREE
	Please.

			KLUTE
	We did this before.

			BREE
	No.
		(then)
	Well all right. But you want to and
	I want you to and we both know it
	and all right.

			KLUTE
		(evenly, slowly)
	I don't like getting splashed.

She accepts it decently. Tries to smile again,
nods.

			BREE
	OK ----- OK

She gestures, tries to find something more to say,
moves by degrees toward the door -- and would
succeed in leaving. But then:

			KLUTE
	--- Bree ---

Standing still, she starts again to cry -- and
bravely to keep the crying to herself. The child
bereft. He contends with himself, then crosses to
her, puts his arms around her, soothes her hair. A
completely asexual gesture at this point, a giving
of comfort. She clings, trembles, burrows. Then --
a SERIES OF DISSOLVES: The street outside, at
different times of night interposed, with Bree and
Klute at different times of love, As Follows:

EXT. THE STREET - DAY

The street as we saw it just previously... still
daylight... still somewhat populated, but drawing
toward dusk.

					  DISSOLVE:

INT. KLUTE'S APARTMENT: BPEE, KLUTE - NIGHT

Darkness now, or close to dark; the room heavily
shadowed. Bree and Klute sit together on the bed.
He still strokes her hair. He has pulled a blanket
around her shoulders. The transaction is still not
overtly sexual, but the tenderness is more overt.
He rubs his cheek against her forehead. She herself
is quieter, comforted. She begins to stir against
him.

					  DISSOLVE:

EXT. THE STREET - NIGHT

The street at night. Eleven o'clock, let's say.
Some lit windows; a single car moving past.

					  DISSOLVE:

EXT. THE STREET - NIGHT

All the windows dark this time. The deepest night,
just before the sky begins to lighten.

					  DISSOLVE:

INT. KLUTE'S APARTMENT: BREE, KLUTE - NIGHT

Klute is alseep -- more or less -- on his stomach.
Bree beside him lies awake. She trails her fingers
about his back. A rather tentative, exploratory
business. Her expression is more wondering than
anything else -- what does she have here, and can
she get used to it?

					  DISSOLVE:

EXT. THE STREET - DAY (DAWN)

The street's first stirrings. From not far off, the
sounds of trash cans being collected.

					  DISSOLVE:

INT. KLUTE'S APARTMENT: BREE, KLUTE - DAY (DAWN)

Klute half sits up in bed. Bree is fast asleep with
her head pillowed on his midsection. Some humor in
this shot: he wants to move but doesn't want to
wake her. At a point he risks it, reaches out for
something beside the bed. Her eyes open
immediately. He puts his hand on her face, trying
gently to press her back.

			KLUTE
	Go back to sleep.

But she takes his hand -- and retains it -- rolls
onto her back. Still relaxed, but a little more
separate, thoughtful -- a mixture of the Bree we've
seen before and the Bree we've glimpsed, the
possible Bree. She observes:

			BREE
	I'm still scared.
		(beat)
	I mean different but still.
		(frowns)
	Look, I made it very clear from the
	start, you're a yokel, you don't
	excite me, you don't even interest
	me, and so I only have one question
	which is what the hell are you
	doing in my bed?

			KLUTE
	My bed.

She grins, then starts to reach for him, still
receptive -- then feels another (and genuine) pang,
turns her head away sharply.

			BREE
	Oh!

He looks at her with concern, but only caresses
her. She manages to explain --

			BREE (CONT'D)
	I am scared. The things I do. The
	things I could do to you.

			KLUTE
	Mm.

			BREE
	No, not just 'mm'. You don't know
	what I --

He settles himself beside her, makes overtures. She
responds, but:

			BREE (CONT'D)
	Oh boy, say, you think you're
	pretty good.

			KLUTE
	Yup.

She pretends to bite -- they tussle -- she feels a
suddenly growing excitement, seizes him. Fiercely,
welcomingly, full out.

			BREE
	Oh --

And we cut directly to:

INT. SPANGLER'S OFFICE: BREE, SPANGLER - DAY

Bree standing, angry, antagonistic, demanding. In a
way -- a Bree-like way -- she's seized psychiatry
by the throat.

			BREE
	The son of a bitch seduced me!

She waits. Spangler says nothing.

			BREE (CONT'D)
	I know: it's ridiculous. But it's
	tearing me up and I don't know why.
	And look, all right, I came here
	didn't I? And if I have to, I'll
	keep coming here, the works, and
	talk about my mummy and my daddy
	and I'll even pay for it, but will
	you kindly for God's sakes say
	something?

			SPANGLER
		(smiles)
	I'd just be guessing.

			BREE
	Guess!

			SPANGLER
	Maybe this wasn't just a trick.
	Maybe you're in danger of real
	love, real involve --

			BREE
		(primly, distintly)
	I do not love him.

			SPANGLER
		(undeterred, suggests)
	You've spent your life avoiding
	this. You'll try hard to deny it;
	you're quite likely to destroy it.

					  WE CUT TO:

EXT. THE PLAZA OF LINCOLN CENTER

Sunlight is beaming on the graceful fountains and
elegant architecture.
Groups of cheerful tourists are admiring the
civilized monuments to man's search for culture.
CAMERA pans to ugly street across the way revealing
Klute approaching and entering a dingy warehouse
topped by an absurdly placed copy of the Statue of
Liberty. This is the municipal storehouse.

INT. MUNICIPAL STOREHOUSE - DAY

The abrupt cut from the bright sunlight leaves us
in almost total darkness as we follow KLUTE. We are
in a huge storeroom. As we grow accustomed to the
darkness we see bits and pieces of incongruous
objects scattered along Klute's path - old pieces
of furniture, lamps, piggy banks, etc. - the
remnants of the lives of the plundered, the
destroyed and the dispossessed. Some is stolen
property, some evidence for homicide cases, and
some the unclaimed possessions of the unclaimed
dead.

A CUSTODIAN -- an ancient retainer sort, a civil
servant, leads KLUTE into an old elevator cage.

INT. ELEVATOR

Klute and Custodian as elevator ascends; looking up
the elevator shaft through the open cage we see a
series of doors hanging over space seeming to lead
nowhere. The whole sequence has the feeling of a
dream of being lost in a black limbo.

Klute and Custodian leave elevator on higher floor
and walk down the long very low corridor past rows
of locked vault doors. The Custodian stops at one
and opens it. We are in a small dungeon-like room
filled with banks of files from floor to ceiling.
The Custodian counts to himself --

			CUSTODIAN
	Four -- five -- what number'd I
	say?

			KLUTE
	Four ninety-seven, Jane McKenna

Custodian finds it, unlocks for Klute's inspection.
Reaches for paper Klute's holding.

			CUSTODIAN
	-- And I keep the authorization,
	please.

			KLUTE
	I thought there'd be more.

Klute pokes through a small collection of personal
effects -- perhaps an ankle bracelet, rabbits foot,
faded snapshot of a child, some letters, pitiful
remnants of Jane McKenna's life. Klute closes the
drawer, and the front of the drawer is marked
McKENNA, JANE?

Over the visual material of Klute's trip through
the warehouse we hear WILD TRACK VOICE OVER bits
and pieces of BREE talking with the psychiatrist.

			BREE (V.O.)
	All right. Loneliness.
		(space)
	Well -- separated. From other
	people. Forgotten.
		(space)
	Well, as if I can be here, I can go
	through the motions, right? But the
	truth is, I don't belong.

			SPANGLER (V.O.)
		(prompts mildly)
	Don't belong?

			BREE (V.O.)
		(snappishly)
	Do you always have to repeat?

			SPANGLER (V.O.)
	Sorry.
		(then)

			BREE (V.O.)
	Well it's more than loneliness.
	Hate. People hating me -- and
	watching me and following and
	waiting to hurt me -- you know? I'm
	all screwed up.

			SPANGLER (V.O.)
	You think people hate you.

			BREE (V.O.)
	The truth is I hate them: they must
	hate me. All right, the money.
		(pause)
	All right, not the money. A kind of
	put-on.
	It gets things back together.
		(pause)
	Well let's say I'd go to one of
	these cattle-calls, a tryout. I
	mean before -- before I got this
	job -- and they'd always say thank
	you very much and i'd feel, you
	know, brought down. They didn't
	want me.

			SPANGLER (V.O.)
	Didn't want you.

			BREE (V.O.)
		(snaps)
	I said that.
		(resumes)
	Well, so you have a choice. You can
	either feel lonely -- you know, the
	hate -- or --
		(then more rapidly,
		plunging)
	So you take a call and go to a
	hotel room and there's some John
	you've never seen before, but he
	wants you. He must, he's paying for
	it.
		(beat)
	And usually they're nervous and
	that's all right, too, because
	you're not; you know this thing.
	And then for a while, boy, they
	really pay attention, you're all
	there is.
		(beat)
	And it's not real and you don't
	have to even like them -- you can
	even hate them, it's all right, it
	safe -- you know?

INT. PROJECTION ROOM - MISSING PERSONS BUREAU

On the left a portion of the original obscene
letter. On the right a series of comparison
documents -- beginning with a portion of a personal
letter. We hear TRASK'S, KLUTE'S VOICES OVER, and
occasionally cut to them as --

			TRASK'S VOICE
		(skipping, summarizing)
	All right, there's Tom Grunemann,
	you're right, different margins,
	different spacing absolutely,
	sloppy, right.

			KLUTE'S VOICE
	Mm.

			TRASK'S VOICE
	All right, try this next guy.

The right-hand document is switched.

KLUTE, TRASK

Klute reacts.

			TRASK
	Think this is our guy?

			KLUTE
	I don't know. It looks familiar to
	me.

			TRASK
	Thought it might. It's off an
	arrest report you typed two years
	ago. Man you wanted samples of
	everybody.

Then -- with subdued satisfaction, switching the
projector again.

			TRASK (CONT'D)
	Now the next cat. Mm?

SCREEN; DOCUMENTS

			TRASK'S VOICE
	Same margins top and sides. He does
	best with his middle fingers; you
	get fainter registration from
	outside keys like Q, A, L, P and
	like that. Next thing look around
	apostrophes, how he hits the space
	bar before --

KLUTE & TRASK - STARING AT PROJECTIONS

			KLUTE
	But what reason could he have? What
	possible reason?

			TRASK
	Unless he was involved with
	Grunemann's disappearance.

			KLUTE
	I knew Tom never wrote that letter.

			TRASK
	What else do you know?

			KLUTE
	I never could believe that Tom was
	a split personality. I never
	believed he was a Dumper; and I
	don't believe he disappeared of his
	own volition; and I don't believe
	he's alive.

			TRASK
	We have some very tentative
	circumstantial evidence of freeky
	behavior, but there's no evidence
	of murder - there's not even a
	body.

			KLUTE
	I don't believe Tom's alive.

As Klute talks he paces back and forth in the
darkness. He crosses in front of the lighted
screen; the letters projected on the screen ripple
over his face.

			KLUTE (CONT'D)
	But why? Why?

INT. MISSING PERSONS BUREAU

Klute and Trask are seen entering from the
Projection Room. In the background we see an old
black woman sitting in front of the picture file of
unidentified dead, carefully studying each picture.

In the foreground Klute sits down at a phone and
dials.

			KLUTE
	Yes, Mr. Cable's office, please.

CAMERA goes in close on Klute.

			CABLE'S VOICE
		(through telephone)
	John, how are you?

			KLUTE
	I'll be sending you on a report
	tonight.

			CABLE'S VOICE
	It's a beautiful day in Tuscarora -
	I don't envy you that humidity in
	the city.

			KLUTE
	It's not so bad.

There is a silence. Both Klute and Cable seem to be
waiting for one or the other to make the next move.

			KLUTE (CONT'D)
	Would you like to know what's in
	it? The report.

			CABLE'S VOICE
		(obligingly)
	What's in it?

			KLUTE
	I think Tom Grunemann's dead. I've
	been a lot of places - I've asked a
	lot of people. I've found no proof
	he's around. I've found no proof he
	was ever around.

			CABLE VOICE
	How do you go from that to the idea
	Tom's dead? Suicide you're
	suggesting? He killed himself?

			KLUTE
		(plodding, unemphatic)
	He could've been murdered.

			CABLE'S VOICE
	I'm sure the FBI and the Police
	explored that possibility.

			KLUTE
	No. They never did, really. But
	that's what I'm going to recommend.
	The next step. Unless something --

			CABLE'S VOICE
	Have you discussed this with them?

			KLUTE
	It's in the report.

			CABLE'S VOICE
	Do they have the report? Have you
	discussed it with them?

			KLUTE
	I wanted to give it to you first.

			CABLE'S VOICE
	All right. All right --
		(then)
	John, just sit tight will you? I'll
	read your report, I'll discuss it
	with the others. I'll be back next
	Thursday, we'll talk the whole
	thing over then. Nothing til
	Thursday, all right?

			KLUTE
	All right.

			CABLE'S VOICE
	Thank you. Goodbye, John.

			KLUTE
	Goodbye, Pete.

Klute hangs up.

			KLUTE (CONT'D)
	He was always at their house on
	holidays. Tom and Holly always had
	him, over on holidays. Tom felt
	sorry for him - his whole life was
	work. Tom felt sorry for him.

The old black lady motions to Trask who crosses to
her. She points to a picture in the file. She has
obviously found her missing person among the
photographs of the unidentified dead. She starts to
stand but then sits again, obviously shaken.
Klute crosses to her and gently helps her out of
the chair. He sees in her face the same sense of
loss he feels for his friend.

EXT. OUTDOOR MARKETS - EIGHT AVENUE - NIGHT

KLUTE & BREE

Bree examining and feeling fruit in some imitation
of a very shrewd and experienced housewife shopper.
She is obviously enjoying her sense of domesticity,
and Klute is amused by her enjoyment.

OUTDOOR NURSERY - EIGHT AVENUE - NEXT TO MARKET

The nursery is an absurdly cheerful spot of
greenery in the midst of the dirty chaos of the
avenue.

Klute and Bree wander through the plants.

			BREE
	I saw Mr. Faber.
		(beat)
	You remember Mr. Faber, don't you?

			KLUTE
		(controlledly)
	Yeah.

			BREE
	Is that all you have to say?

			KLUTE
	What am I supposed to say?

			BREE
	Well, I told him I wouldn't - uh -
	go there any more.
		(pause)
	I know it's tough to understand,
	but it wasn't easy. You see, he was
	nice to me. I mean, it wasn't just
	him. I got something out of it too
	I guess. Anyway, I told him I
	wouldn't go there anymore.

She is like a child awaiting praise from her
teacher. Klute says nothing. They continue walking
among the plants and he picks up a few that she had
admired.

			KLUTE
	Well, here's your gold star.

Considering his contempt for all the dead plant
life he has seen in her apartment in the past, she
is pleased by this act of belief in her.

			BREE
	Spangler says we have a
	relationship.

			KLUTE
	What?

			BREE
	You and I -- a relationship.

			KLUTE
	I was wondering what that was.

			BREE
		(beat)
	Hell there's nothing so mysterious
	about the square life.

EXT. BROWNSTONE ENTRYWAY - NIGHT

Bree, Klute approach unhurriedly along the
sidewalk. She is holding his arm, HUMS to herself,
enjoys the evening.

INT. STAIRWALL - NIGHT

We follow them up.

INT. ANGLE INTO BREE APARTMENT - NIGHT

The apartment is a shambles -- furniture
overturned, decorations ripped from the wall,
bedding scattered and ripped.

INT. BREE APARTMENT - NIGHT

Klute jettisons the grocery bags, thrusts himself
inside, looks quickly about, finds no one. Bree
follows more slowly, whispering:

			BREE
	Oh Jesus. Oh Jesus.

			KLUTE
	Don't touch anything.

He moves quickly to the rear of the apartment,
looks at the rear window which has been broken
inward in a litter of glass -- then returns to the
table at the front of the apartment; his folders.
Bree cracks wise, unsteadily.

			BREE
	You suppose he's a married fella?

ANGLE TO TABLE; FOLDERS

The contents of the folders have been spilled
across the table and -- we ZOOM IN -- the
photographs of Tom Grunemann sorted out and ripped
apart, Even the COMPANY PICNIC photograph has been
painstakingly torn, specifically to destroy the
image of Grunemann in the front row.

KLUTE

He stands, looking down, taking no notice as --

			BREE
	He got in my clothing!

Then a moment later, she cries out again, more
sharply:

			BREE (CONT'D)
	Oh. Oh.

He turns quickly. She is holding out, at arms
length, a pair of her underpants. With a disgust so
extreme she can only laugh.

			BREE (CONT'D)
	Oh look what he did in them.

			KLUTE
	Drop it.

She doesn't respond. He seizes her arm, shakes the
garment back onto the floor. She starts to gag,
slaps her hand over her mouth, starts for the
bathroom. Klute yanks her back.

			KLUTE (CONT'D)
	Stay out of there.

She twists free of his hands, backs away. The same
elementary terror we've seen before.

			KLUTE (CONT'D)
	Listen to me: It's all right. I've
	been expecting something.

			BREE
		(full out, vengefully)
	My God, I thought it was over. And
	here I am, daddy, right back at the
	start.

			KLUTE
	Bree --

			BREE
	Right back at the start, right?

			KLUTE
	Go down in my room.

			BREE
	You said it was over, right? You
	said not to worry any more, all
	over, right?

She's broken for the door; it's questionable that
she's even heard him. He hasn't time to pursue --
shouts again --

			KLUTE
	Go down in my room and wait.

Then he turns back into the apartment.

INT. BREE'S APARTMENT - DAY

A DOWNSHOT TO UNDERPANTS (as if from Klute's POV,
connecting directly to the previous shot) -- then a
FLASHBULB goes off and a hand and pair of tongs
enter frame and flip the garment into a collecting
box and we widen to reveal that it's now daylight
and the scene has been invaded by POLICE
TECHNICIANS. One is a photographer; another, a
fingerprint man, is spraying surfaces with a can of
fixative. In the foreground Klute and Trask are
talking with Ross, the FBI man. Ross is looking
through a dossier on Cable that Klute has compiled.
Over the following conversation we show CLOSEUPS of
material in the dossier. It contains photographs of
Cable and his life from childhood to the present -
including pictures of him with his mother and
father - she a very dominant looking lady and he a
very passive looking man;
also graduation pictures and pictures with his
former wife taken when he was still a very young
man. They are the personal images of a life time.

			ROSS
		(to Klute)
	But if Cable killed Grunemann why
	would he get you hired to look for
	Grunemann?

			KLUTE
	Because he knew I couldn't leave
	the case alone. And this way at
	least he'd keep track of it. And
	me.

			ROSS
	What about Grunemann's letters to
	the girl, everything like that?

			TRASK
	Cable's letters, Cable's phone
	calls. Cable's everything else.
	He's been a Dumper a long time. He
	just passed off his own peculiar
	habits on the other man -- it kept
	things goin'.

			ROSS
	OK, pretend I believe you. Tell me
	how you get an indictment.

			TRASK
	Can't. Yet. Oh we got everythin'
	else: first rate evidence Cable
	typed those dumper letters to Bree
	Daniel. And Jane McKenna: Klute
	found a couple in her personal
	remains. We got dates of Cable's
	trips here coincidin' with phone
	calls to Bree Daniel, also the
	dates of death of McKenna and Page.
	We got some hints of his personal
	history. His father, unsuccessful
	salesman, committed suicide when he
	was 13. His mother pinned all her
	hopes on her son. He won a national
	science youth award at the age of
	eight. They had no money, but she
	hired special tutors for him in the
	summer time. She saw a good thing.
	He graduated from high school at 14
	-- college at 16 -- no friends --
	The kids in his class thought of
	him as a freak. He got his Ph.D. at
	18 -- married at age 21 to his then
	employer's daughter. The marriage
	lasted 4 weeks. Her father had it
	annulled. She says he was impotent.
	World War II he got in bad trouble
	about a German girl, no details. We
	think we know why he killed
	Grunemann -- he found out Cable was
	a dumper; Cable couldn't take that.
	We think we know why he killed
	McKenna -- she wanted to blackmail
	him for it. All fine. But we got no
	body, no direct witnesses, we can't
	go any-damn-where.

			KLUTE
	That's the reason i told him we had
	no evidence Tom was still alive. We
	wanted to shake him into another
	phone call or another letter. It
	didn't work out just that way.

The Technicians, meanwhile have packed to depart.
The first Technician scoops the torn up photographs
into another collecting box. Trask retrieves the
company outing photograph.

			TRASK
	Gov, want to leave me that one. How
	come he got to play with this one,
	anyway.

			KLUTE
	I left them here. I was doing some
	work here.

Trask eyes Klute for a moment, as if a querying his
relationship with Bree. Klute is clearly
unresponsive. Trask resumes.

			TRASK
	It's damn lucky you didn't have the
	dossier on Cable here.

			KLUTE
	Nobody's seen that.

			TRASK
	If we get anything from the lab,
	we'll have it by noon. And just
	think -- all he really had to do
	was write us a letter.

			ROSS
	Sounds to me you better shake him
	again. Put him in a spot he has to
	do something more -- but this time
	give him a time and a place to do
	it.

			KLUTE
	He called this morning from
	Tuscarora. Asked me to meet him at
	3:00 at the downtown heliport. He's
	on his way to Chicago.

			TRASK
	He sure chalks up a lot of flight
	time.

Klute starts gathering his papers we CUT TO --

INT. STAIRWELL: BREE - DAY

Bree coming up the stairs meets the Technicians
coming down -- stands aside to let them pass --
starts up again and comes face to face with Klute.
On her part we see a wish to be reconciled -- a
shyness mixed with defiance -- but Klute's manner
is arduous. She smiles nervously, asks --

			BREE
	Ah, Schmendrick -- what's the scam?

			KLUTE
	Those were police laboratory
	people, they've been over the
	apartment.

			BREE
		(mock delight)
	Oh zippidy-doo, they'll find my
	fingerprints.
		(then)
	Can I go in? I need some stuff.

He nods; she starts by. Then --

			KLUTE
	Where'd you spend last night?

			BREE
	With Trina.

			KLUTE
	I called Trina.

			BREE
	Maybe I wasn't there when you
	called.

			KLUTE
	Bree, what's actually happened? It
	wasn't that bad.

			BREE
		(cuts in harshly)
	How do you know how bad it was?

			KLUTE
	Why couldn't you stay here with me?

			BREE
	Because I didn't want to be
	touched! I didn't think you'd get
	that!

Pause. Then, evenly --

			KLUTE
	Trask wants to talk with you.

She starts on, then turns back toward him -- rather
pleadingly --

			BREE
	Hey -- look officer -- I can
	explain everything. It was just --
	you know, everything all of a --

			KLUTE
	Trask wants to talk with you.

She continues on up; Klute continues down.

INT. BREE'S APARTMENT - DAY

Entering without greeting Trask (his manner is not
uncivil but simply neutral, unreacting, Cop-like)
she quickly gathers up a few properties, a change
of shoes.

			TRASK
	Miss Daniel, be sensible, you find
	another place till we get things
	cleaned up.

			BREE
		(brightly)
	Oh well that shouldn't take you
	more than another, oh, two and a
	half or three years, should it?

			TRASK
	A few more days. We know who did
	this.

			BREE
	So do I.

			TRASK
	No, not Grunemann. He's dead. The
	man that killed him -- also prob'ly
	Jane McKenna, also Arlyn Page.

She spins around -- mute -- terrified.

			BREE
		(manages)
	Arlyn and Jane commited suicide. He
	said they commited suicide.

			TRASK
	Now there's a picture I'd like you
	to --

			BREE
	You said someone killed them, you
	said you know who, you said that.

			TRASK
	Well we're pretty --

			BREE
	Why isn't he locked up?

			TRASK
	We don't want to just lock him up;
	we want a conviction, we wanted him
	to do something more.

			BREE
	Is that why Klute didn't tell me?

			TRASK
	I guess he figured it was better.

			BREE
	What was better? I made better
	bait?

			TRASK
	No, that's not --

			BREE
	Is that what he set me up for?
	Everything he's told me from the
	beginning? -- don't worry, don't --

			TRASK
		(coldly)
	From the beginning I don't know why
	the hell he's messin with you. If
	he was me he'd know better. If he
	was even a city boy he'd know
	better. You're a whore Miss Daniel,
	that's the truth of it, right? Now
	somethin I'd like you to look at.

			BREE
	I don't have to look at anything. I
	don't have --

			TRASK
	Here please.

He coerces her to the table and unrolls the Company
outing picture. (We see the rip extending up
through the image of Tom Grunemann in the front
row.)

			BREE
	Oh no.

			TRASK
	Like for you to look for the man.

			BREE
	Grunemann? I've looked at him a --

Trask has clamped his thumb over the torn image of
Grunemann, indicates with the other hand --

			TRASK
	No. Not Grunemann. The Dumper. Just
	look around -- I said look for the
	Dumper.

We see her comply -- her eyes moving over the rows
of faces. Then we see her stiffen, hear her gasp --

			BREE
	Oh! --

-- and WE CUT TO --

INT. DOWNTOWN HELIPORT - DAY

Cable welcomes Klute. His outer manner is warm,
voluble, congratulatory --

			CABLE
	Sorry we had to meet here. But I'm
	pressed for time.

			KLUTE
	Well there's a couple --

			CABLE
	I read your report. I had to go
	along with it -- the idea of this
	being a wild goose chase, Tom being
	nowhere around --

			KLUTE
	Well as a matter of --

			CABLE
	I've been up country, you know my
	summer place, my camp. I don't even
	have a telephone there. This
	morning they sent a messenger out,
	that you'd been trying to call me.

			KLUTE
	Yeah.

			CABLE
	I'm on my way to Chicago. Very
	important meeting tonight. Well --
	any new developments?

			KLUTE
	Yeah, two things Pete, that --

			CABLE
	You said Trask was arranging
	laboratory work. Police laboratory.
	Anything from that?

			KLUTE
	Yeah. It wasn't Tom.

			CABLE
	I'm sorry. I don't understand.

			KLUTE
	It wasn't Tom that broke in the
	room.

			CABLE
	It has to be Tom. You said he
	ripped up his own pictures, he --

			KLUTE
	Not Tom. Whoever it was left a kind
	of souvenir, I told you, in her
	clothing. Semen. The laboratory got
	a blood group reading from that.
	The man was blood type 0; Tom was
	an AB.

			CABLE
		(slowly)
	Some mistake perhaps that --

			KLUTE
	No. No mistake Pete. It doesn't
	prove who it was -- but proves it
	wasn't Tom.

			CABLE
	You must be discouraged.

			KLUTE
		(prosaically)
	Not too bad. This brings back that
	Dumper in the picture.

			CABLE
	That who?

			KLUTE
	Dumper, the man Bree Daniel
	mentioned and Arlyn Page knew and
	Jane McKenna knew.

			CABLE
	You said he was no possible
	connection with Tom. The Page girl
	told you that, not Tom.

			KLUTE
	Someone's been doing all these
	things.

			CABLE
	You were hired to look for Tom, not
	someone.

			KLUTE
	Pete, I've got a chance to buy Jane
	McKenna's black book.

			CABLE
	What?

			KLUTE
	Call-girls generally keep a book,
	you know, a list of their clients.
	Sometimes, if a girl retires,
	she'll even sell it worth good
	money. Jane McKenna had a black
	book; when she died it was stolen.
	I've been after it a long time.

			CABLE
	You were hired to look for Tom.

			KLUTE
	I'm meeting a man tomorrow night.
	He wants to meet me on East-River
	Drive -- he wants five hundred
	dollars for the book. Can you get
	that for me Pete?

Sometime -- right along about now -- it privately
comes to Cable that Klute may know everything and
that he, Cable, may be being trapped.

			CABLE
	I can't follow you.

			KLUTE
	Will the Company put up five
	hundred dollars to get Jane
	McKenna's list of clients?

			CABLE
	No. It's ridiculous. This has
	nothing to do with Tom Grunemann.

			KLUTE
		(shrugs, stolidly)
	It probably has the Dumper's name.
	It might give us some kind of new
	lead.
		(beat)
	I want a look at it anyhow.

			CABLE
	Klute, the Company's interest is
	Tom Grunemann. Solely and
	exclusively. You say you can't find
	Tom; all right, I'll see that
	you're paid off; the case is
	closed.

			KLUTE
	All right, but I'm going to see
	that list.

HELICOPTER FLIGHT is announced over loud speaker
and Cable and Klute walk onto field.

EXT. HELICOPTER FIELD

People are boarding helicopter.

			CABLE
	Why would they deal with you? You
	don't know these people.

Klute is momentarily at a loss -- not a question
he'd prepared for -- improvises.

			KLUTE
	No, but Bree does. She's
	negotiating for me. Bree Daniel.

Cable takes an instant to compute the thing. Then --

			CABLE
	I can talk it over; possibly I can
	get the money. When are you meeting
	the man?

			KLUTE
	Tomorrow evening, nine. East River
	Drive and 73rd Street.

			CABLE
	Suppose I meet you there a half
	hour before.

			KLUTE
	Just send me a money order.

			CABLE
	No, I'd -- like to be in on it.

ATTENDANT comes over to motion Cable onto the
helicopter.

Klute smiles awkwardly, raises his hand in a
goodbye gesture.

			KLUTE
	Well --

			CABLE
	Tomorrow. See you tomorrow night.

INT. HELICOPTER

Cable sits down next to window. The helicopter
begins to rise. CAMERA goes into a medium close
shot of Cable against the helicopter window. The
helicopter ascends in front of a very tall office
building made up of endless glass squares. A
telephoto lens brings the glass squares of the
building directly against Cable's head and
shoulders giving us the feeling that Cable is
almost levitating by himself. As one floor after
another disappears behind him we see an almost
manic exhultation in Cable's face; as if he is on
top of things once more.

EXT. STREET OUTSIDE BROWNSTONE - DAY

We bring Klute along street, and into the
Brownstone.

INT. STAIRWELL - DAY

Klute climbs the stairs to Bree's apartment --
knocks. He waits. No answer. He calls once --

			KLUTE
	Bree?

No answer. He starts downstairs again -- then turns
back, unlocks the door himself, enters.

INT. BREE'S APARTMENT - DAY

The room is still disordered. Bree and Frank
Ligourin look at him, silently. Bree has been
assembling armfuls of dresses to carry away with
her. Frank sits nearby in a chair. Klute smiles a
little -- almost apologetically.

			KLUTE
	I'm always getting surprises.

Bree doesn't answer. She sets the armload of
dresses over the back of a chair, moves aside to
get others. Frank smiles cautiously, ruefully. Then
--

			KLUTE (CONT'D)
	I don't want you to do this.

He still doesn't extract an answer. She returns
with other dresses.

			KLUTE (CONT'D)
	Please. I said I don't want you to
	do this.

			BREE
		(tight, small)
	Trask said I should move. Let's not
	make a thing of it.

He continues to look at her; she continues to
gather possessions. Then trying to smile, to deal
with it casually --

			BREE (CONT'D)
	Look, too much is going on here.
	I'm moving in with another girl,
	that's all. Just for a while.

			FRANK
		(helpfully)
	That's right. This other girl's got
	a very big apartment, big, plenty
	of room.
		(then)
	Look, it's not necessarily how it
	looks, right? It's --

He thinks better of continuing. Klute looks from
him back to Bree. He speaks gravely, spacing his
words -- unable to speak any faster.

			KLUTE
	No. Please. Not with this son of a
	bitch.

Frank rises, both nervous and offended -- but
dealing with Klute as between civilized men.
Smiling.

			FRANK
	Klute, let's handle it like
	grownups? I mean we're all grown up
	now, right?
		(ventures forward)
	-- we all respect each other, you
	know what I mean? -- I respect you,
	Bree respects you -- you could say,
	it just didn't work out between you
	and she. But you got to respect her
	too -- you know, her best
	interests, best for her --

Klute hits him, pursues, recovers, and starts to
beat him. BLOOD thickly descends the side of
Frank's face, as he struggles away. Bree is
screaming. Bree grabs at him from behind. He
thrusts her off. But it allows Frank to break away
through the still-open door. Klute pursues.

INT. LANDING AT DOOR - DAY

Frank clatters down a stairs as Klute arrives in
the doorframe, and as Bree, behind Klute, screams --

			BREE
	No!

Klute is restrained -- restrains himself. Frank has
faced around on the stairs, still bleeding
extravagantly from his torn scalp. Earnestly --

			FRANK
	Hey, I'm gonna get you dropped.

Klute start's out after him -- Frank vaults away
down the stairs -- we hear him stumbling and
running -- Klute faces sharply around into the
apartment.

INT. BREE'S APARTMENT - DAY

PAST KLUTE TO BREE. She is running away from him
again, to a corner of the apartment, fumbling at a
sewing basket. He starts in, after her.

			KLUTE
		(indistinctly)
	Please --

TWO SHOT

She swings about as he overtakes her, holding a
pair of scissors -- simply and transcendently
terrified. She strikes at him, slashing his
forearm. He and she stand in absolute silence. He
looks down at the stain of blood spreading through
the fabric of his jacket sleeve. Then he turns out
of the room and down the stairs.

EXT. BREE'S BROWNSTONE - DAY

Klute comes out of door -- goes down steps to his
own apartment. A passerby stops him for directions
and doesn't seem to notice the blood on his sleeve.
Klute goes into his apartment.

INT. BREE'S APARTMENT: BREE - DAY

Bree is in the middle of dialing the phone. Her
hands are shaking; she misdials -- holds down the
receiver for a moment then starts again.

INT. KLUTE'S APARTMENT: KLUTE - DAY

Klute stands in silence for a moment or two -- then
takes rather more note of his forearm. (Not
urgently but practically; it behooves him to stop
bleeding.) He turns toward the bathroom, pulling
his jacket off with the other hand.

INT. BREE'S APARTMENT: BREE - DAY

Bree speaks to the phone, trying to make a simple
point, trying to keep her voice even.

			BREE
	-- until he gets back.
		(beat)
	Yes I heard you, I understand that.
	I said I'm going to come over, I'll
	wait until he gets back.

She hangs up before the other party can object in
detail -- takes up her purse and goes out, not even
closing the door behind her.

INT. KLUTE'S APARTMENT: BATHROOM: KLUTE - DAY

Klute has knotted a hand-towel around his forearm,
now uses teeth and fingers to pull the ends tight.
Then -- intending to clean up -- he takes up a
washcloth, reaches for the faucet --

EXT. BREE'S BROWNSTONE - DAY

Bree comes out of door - goes down steps -
hesitates in front of Klute's apartment struggling
with the question of whether to knock. CAMERA pulls
back to reveal we are watching her through the
windshield of a car in the parking lot across the
street. CAMERA pulls back further to reveal the
back of Cable's head as he sits in the car watching
her. Bree starts to knock on Klute's door but stops
herself and walks down the street. Cable's head
moves out of the shot. We hear the sound of the car
door opening and closing. Through the windshield we
see Cable cross in front of the car and start to
follow Bree down the street.

INT. KLUTE'S APARTMENT: BATHRO0M: KLUTE - DAY

Klute finishes mopping up. SOUND OF TELEPHONE. He
turns back out of the bathroom and answers it.

			KLUTE
	Hello?
		(listens, then soberly - )
	Trask, I don't get that.

EXT. STREET: BREE - DAY

Bree is about a quarter block away from the
Brownstone now, hurrying. She waves in the
direction of a cab, misses it, continues on. We CUT
TO --

EXT. STREET: CABLE - DAY

Cable stands looking after her, hesitates over
choice of action, decides to follow.

EXT. STREET: FIGURES: PAST BREE TO CABLE - DAY

We establish the distance between them -- Cable 100
or so feet behind her, unnoticed by her,
maintaining about the same pace, not -- at this
point -- trying to overtake (perhaps waiting for
less populated surroundings) We CUT BACK TO --

INT. KLUTE'S APARTMENT: KLUTE - DAY

Klute continues his phone conversation, short
spoken.

			KLUTE
	Who told you, his secretary?
		(listens)
	Has someone checked his hotel? He
	always stays at the --
		(then)
	I'll look around, I'll call you
	back.

He hangs up. First he checks out the windows (but -
if we want to be accurate - from mid room, without
directly approaching the windows themselves). Then
he secures a pistol from his jacket (and folds the
jacket itself over his arm to conceal it, as a
matter of public decorum), and goes on out.

INT. STAIRWELL: KLUTE - DAY

Klute's manner, over the next few minutes, exhibits
an absolute, untheatrical, care and competence. A
man -- Cable -- may in fact be hiding here
somewhere to kill him. He sets about checking the
likely places -- first of all the lower hallway,
then the stairwell itself, moving steadily
unalarmedly up.

At the top he notes -- but still without main
concern that Bree's door is open. He calls ahead --

			KLUTE
	Bree --

INT. BREE'S APARTMENT: KLUTE - DAY

He enters, puzzles, starts checking around (quite
thoroughly; she might be hiding from him). We CUT
BACK TO --

EXT. STREETS: BREE; FIGURE OF CABLE - DAY

Bree moves past CONSTRUCTION WORK, through one of
those temporary pedestrian passageways. Behind her,
nearer than before we see the FIGURE OF CABLE.

INT. STAIRWELL - DAY

Klute comes quickly back downstairs, back into his
room, takes up the phone. Through the still-open
door we watch him begin dialing -- then CUT TO --

INT. SPANGLER'S (OUTER) OFFICE - DAY

Bree sits isolated on the waiting-room couch. She
may have been here for fifteen minutes -- or an
hour. She turns the pages of a magazine -- one
handed, without even lifting it from the coffee
table, with an absolute lack of interest, a
mechanical gesture.

We hear FOOTSTEPS approaching directly toward where
we are watching Bree sit.

			LELA (O.S.)
	Mrs. Daniel --

WIDER - TWO SHOT

Bree looks up in a kind of frozen terror, as the
Secretary smiles nicely -- lovingly down at her.

			LELA
	-- I have to close up now. Leave
	your name and number with his
	message service, Mrs. Daniel, and
	why don't you just go home and wait
	until he --

			BREE
	No.

			LELA
	Well I have to close up now.

			BREE
	Look -- could I use your phone?

			LELA
	Yes indeed.

			BREE
	Look. I almost killed my -- I
	almost killed someone.

			LELA
		(the same tone,
		completely)
	Well I'm certain Doctor Spangler
	will want to talk with you; excuse
	me.

Bree moves to the desk and telephone. But we move
with the Secretary as she moves into Spangler's
inner office and switches out the lights
(establishing TIME CHANGE: dusk now) and as we
hear, O.S., the sound of DIALING and BREE'S VOICE --

			BREE (O.S.)
	Is Mr. Faber there?
		(beat)
	Mr. Faber Senior.

INT. GARMENT BUILDING: FABER'S OFFICE: FABER - DAY
(NIGHT)

Mr. Faber's phone buzzes; he picks it up.

			FABER
	Yes?
		(then, glancing about)
	Bree?

INT. SPANGLER (OUTER) OFFICE: BREE ON PHONE - DAY
(NIGHT)

			BREE
		(haltingly)
	-- I'm -- I just have to talk to
	someone. I'm just a little way
	across town --

FABER, ON PHONE (OFFICE)

			FABER
	Yes - yes dear, yes -- maybe half
	an hour, sure, yes.

He hangs up. An ancient stirring, a kind of
triumph. He glances about, then tightens his tie.
Then it comes to him, after all -- he takes note of
himself -- he leans forward against his desk and
rubs his forehead with old bony fingers. We CUT TO 
-

INT. KLUTE'S APARTMENT - DAY (NIGHT)

KLUTE on phone.

			KLUTE
	Trina, will you call me if you hear
	from, her? Will you check other
	people she might call? Yeah, if it
	wasn't trouble I wouldn't ask vou.

He hangs up, immediately starts to dial again, then
pauses to check a list he's laid out by the
telephone. While he's doing this, his PHONE RINGS.

			KLUTE (CONT'D)
	Yeah?
		(then)
	Nothing yet, Trask; I'm going down
	the list. I've tried Spangler's
	office and Spangler's home; I just
	get his message service. I'll keep--
		(interrupted -- listens --
		then -- grimly)
	I may have steered Cable that way.
	I told him Bree was dealing for me,
	for Jane McKenna's book. Have you
	found any --

He is interrupted again -- Trask wasting no words
on his end of things -- nods once --

			KLUTE (CONT'D)
	Yeah.

-- and depresses the receiver just long enough to
clear the connection, and starts dialing again --
We CUT TO --

INT. STAIRWAY OF GARMENT BUILDING - DAY (NIGHT)

Quitting time. As Bree enters from street level,
employees are coming down the stairs, pushing past
her. She continues up on until at one point -- one
more officious or more communicative than the
others informs her --

			FOREMAN
	Lady, it's closing up there.

			BREE
	What?

			FOREMAN
	We're closing up, quitting time,
	Fabers.

			BREE
		(unsurely)
	I have an appointment with Mr.
	Faber.

			FOREMAN
	Oh, yeah.

He lets her pass, glances after her like the
others, continues on his way.

INT. GARMENT BUILDING: FABER RECEPTION AREA - DAY
(NIGHT)

Bree arrives at the head of the stairs -- as still
others press past her on their way down -- and
comes more or less directly up against the thickset
RECEPTIONIST. She is packing her purse, preparing
to depart, looks somewhat challengingly at Bree --
who sees no way to avoid the issue.

			BREE
	I have an appointment with Mr.
	Faber.

			RECEPTIONIST
	In there.
		(turns, bawls)
	Mr. Faber --

Bree goes on nervously in the direction indicated,
toward --

A CORNER OF OFFICES: NATHAN FABER

NATHAN stands bending over a bench with back to
camera, conferring with another man as Bree
approaches -- looking to us, as to her, exactly
like his father. We hear the Receptionist's VOICE
repeating --

			RECEPTIONIST (CONT'D) (O.S.)
			(CONT'D)
	Mr. Faber --

As Bree nears him, he straightens and turns -- a
much younger man. Bree stops short, recognizing the
error.

			NATHAN
	Yes?

			BREE
	I'm sorry -- Mr. Faber Senior.

			NATHAN
		(calmly)
	My father went home about fifteen
	minutes ago; he wasn't feeling too
	good.

She has already started away. He calls after her
evenly --

			NATHAN (CONT'D)
	Can I help you?

She looks back quickly, smiles nervously --

			BREE
	It wasn't important.

But we hold on him for a moment as she continues
out of scene -- until he turns away to other
matters. Then --

RECEPTION AREA: RECEPTIONIST, BREE

Bree returns toward Receptionist, awkwardly --

			BREE
	Did Mr. Faber leave a message for
	me or anything? Mr. Faber Senior?
	Bree Daniel.

			RECEPTIONIST
	Oh, I thought that was for
	tomorrow.

The Receptionist riffles through a stack of
assorted envelopes -- hands one out to Bree -- and
promptly takes her way off. Out. Bree starts to
open the envelope then and there -- but OTHERS
continue to move past her. She seeks a more private
place.

ROWS OF GARMENTS

Bree shelters herself out of sight from everyone
else -- though we continue to hear INTERMITTENT
VOICES, O.S. and continue to maintain the sense of
other presences.

We see her open the envelope --

CLOSER: BREE, ENVELOPE

She finds nothing inside but money -- bills
totaling fifty dollars. We see her looking for a
message, finding nothing. It comes to her slowly
that she's been paid off and avoided. She bites her
lips in pain. She pushes back out of hiding --

RECEPTIONIST AREA

-- back to the reception area again. (By now this
immediate scene has emptied, though we catch sight
of a figure or two at scene-start, moving through
the background, and continue to hear an occasional
NOISE or VOICE O.S.)

Bree looks about for someone -- then scouts for a
pencil, finds one in a desk (or bench) drawer,
starts to readdress the envelope (to direct it back
to Mr. Faber). Then she breaks off from that, takes
up a PHONE instead, dials -- waits -- then --

			BREE
	Bree Daniel. Has he called in yet?
	Well if he does, I'm at --
		(reads phone)
	-- two seven eight, three one
	hundred, and I guess I can wait
	here five minutes; then I'll try
	from somewhere else.
		(impatiently)
	Just tell him Bree Daniel; he knows
	who.

She hangs up, goes back to readdressing the
envelope. FOOTSTEPS are approaching in her
direction. She glances up apologetically.

			BREE (CONT'D)
	Mr. Faber, I just wanted to leave
	this for your father, and I
	wondered if you'd --

She pauses --

ANGLE PAST BREE TO CABLE

Cable hastens toward her along a lane of garments.
In this brief glimpse a ludicrous and terrifying
figure -- a noise, a gesticulation (actually the
gesture is arms out, palms downward, intended as a
quieting gesture; and the hissing noise is intended
as a shushing). Bree cries out, turns to run --

			BREE (CONT'D)
	Someone --

-- as we immediately, even as she's turning, CUT TO
--

INT. KLUTE'S APARTMENT: KLUTE - DAY (NIGHT)

Klute speaks quietly but with terrible urgency into
the phone (dealing evidently with an ethically
skittish message service at the other end).

			KLUTE
	Did she leave a number?
		(beat)
	This is a police call; don't make
	me take time to prove it. Did she
	leave a number? What is the number?
		(beat)
	What is the number? --

INT. GARMENT BUILDING - DAY (NIGHT)

Cable and Bree. They are at some remove from the
site of Cable's first appearance; there are other
evidences of time-lapse. Cable's manner is that of
slightly-strained patience -- a civility -- an
attempt now and then to smile. Bree watches his
every slight gesture, quivers to make a break for
it, tries throughout to buy time.

			CABLE
	Can't we talk together reasonably,
	just -- ordinarily?
		(beat)
	I know you're expecting some kind
	of -- extravagant behavior, but
	believe me -- do you believe me? --

			BREE
	Yes -- all right --

			CABLE
	-- We can talk --

			BREE
	-- Yes.

			CABLE
	All right, then, an ordinary
	matter. I'm a quite well off man, I
	have a -- position to respect. I
	would feel personally uncomfortable
	to be connected with a -- certain
	kind of woman, I'm sure you
	understand. Do you? Well I'd like
	to buy Jane McKenna's book.

He looks at her discerningly. She seems not to have
followed his exposition. He tries patiently to
clarify it.

			CABLE (CONT'D)
	Her black book, Jane McKenna's, her
	list of -- of persons. I was told
	you're negotiating for it on behalf
	of --

The PHONE RINGS, an explosive noise. Bree startles.
It has been put on night-ring, to sound all over
the loft, and the noise is deafening. But -- the
most bizarre element is Cable's absolute lack of
response to it. It rings and rings as he talks and
talks -- in the same expository tone as before,
without raising his voice. It drowns out most of
his words -- at most we catch only odd phrases of
all the following -- but he seems not to hear it
any more than the clamor of other things torturing
his soul.

			CABLE (CONT'D)
	That was what Klute told me -- you
	were negotiating for him to buy
	that list. And I'm in a position to
	pay a good deal more for it than he
	can. Do you understand? I'd like
	you to acquire it on my --
		(beat)
	Miss Daniel, do you not understand?
		(beat)
	Miss Daniel, I can't tell whether
	you understand me.
		(beat - still reasonably)
	Is this something Klute just
	invented? Is this a trap for me,
	Miss Daniel; does Klute know about
	me?

He turns and lifts a phone (one of the extension
phones situated around the loft) -- though up to
now he's given no evidence of even hearing the
ringing. He just stands holding the phone for a
time, then lowers it back on the receiver. With a
sort of absolute quiet --

			CABLE (CONT'D)
	You have no idea what I'm talking
	about.

			BREE
	Yes -- Jane McKenna's book -- I
	could make a phone call.

			CABLE
	No, you're frightened, you're
	pretending. Well -- Klute knows
	about me then. Does everybody know,
	can you tell me?

			BREE
	Yes.

			CABLE
	Then it doesn't matter what I do
	any more, does it?

Pause. Then he shudders slightly.

			CABLE (CONT'D)
	You people know nothing about pain.

We CUT TO --

EXT. STREETS - DAY (NIGHT)

We see Klute -- probably in MLS -- running along
street. He tries for a cab -- misses it -- halts
the next by expedient of cutting bodily in front of
it. The Driver starts to lean out to object. Klute
mashes him back inside, enters the cab. We CUT BACK
TO --

INT. GARMENT BUILDING - DAY (NIGHT)

MLS, the two FIGURES: CABLE, BREE. They are
somewhat separated -- Cable has gone to look down
from one of the arched windows of the loft, while
Bree remains in place. She is a prisoner, we can
suppose -- when we cut closer we'll see her eyes
continually shifting, her mind calculating her
chances -- but he hasn't molested her. He bears her
no animus at this point. His manner is rather
quiet, undetermined. He feels some relief that the
thing is, in effect, over -- and some puzzlement
about what to do (with either her or himself) now.
He returns toward her.

CLOSER: BREE, CABLE

Nearing her again, he gestures several times,
apologetically, seeking words.

			CABLE
	I've got no idea what I shall do.

He happens too close; she can't avoid shrinking.

			CABLE (CONT'D)
	I'm not going to hurt you,
	absolutely, I'm not.

			BREE
	Will you let me go then?

He seems not to have heard the request. He sits for
a moment. An intellectual interest, a curiosity.
(Meanwhile, perhaps, we see her starting to slip
her shoes off, in hopes of running.)

			CABLE
	It puzzles me so badly. I've done
	terrible things but I can't
	consider myself a terrible man.
	I've killed three people and I'd
	still want to say it was accident,
	do you see?

			BREE
		(tries again, slowly)
	If you'll let me go I could tell
	them what --

			CABLE
		(unhearing, resumes)
	Tom Grunemann discovered me -- we
	were here on business together, he
	discovered me with Jane McKenna.
	Then I suppose it was the -- the
	contempt I saw in his face and the
	certainty that sooner or later he'd
	use it against me. Within the
	Company. I endured that as long as
	I could, do you see?

			BREE
	I'm sorry, I'm just frightened.
	Yes.

			CABLE
	Excuse me Miss Daniel?

			BREE
	I said yes, I see.

			CABLE
		(doubtingly)
	Oh no, I don't think --

			BREE
	Tell me. I'll listen.
		(pause)
	I just want you to tell me.

He rises, approaches her -- apparently taken in,
credulous, grateful, wondering --

			CABLE
	You're willing to listen? You want
	me just to keep talking?

He hits her.

			CABLE (CONT'D)
	That's what you do, isn't it; you
	make a man feel accepted.
	That's what you all do. Your stock
	in trade a man's weakness.

He hits her again.

			CABLE (CONT'D)
	Why don't you ask for mercy? My
	God, what mercy has anyone given
	me?

INT. ELEVATOR - KLUTE ASCENDING - DAY (NIGHT)

EXT. GARMENT BUILDING ROOF (DIRECTLY ABOVE FABER
LOFT) - DAY (NIGHT)

Klute has gun out - as he carefully makes his way
across the roof. Man in hotel window across street
holding drink - watches him with amused curiosity.
Klute spots entrance to stairway.

INT. GARMENT BUILDING: KLUTE - DAY (NIGHT)

Klute goes downstairs to back entrance of Faber
loft. He slips inside. He hears THE SOUNDS OF THE
BEATING -- a stirring of feet and indistinct impact
sounds, a murmur of voices (but all quite muted,
undramatic). He maneuvers through lanes of
garments, trying to gain a line of sight. He
understands what's going on, strains to intervene,
but can't disclose himself. At a point, he drops to
hands and knees, slides underneath the garment
racks, drawing closer to Cable, trying to gain
position. We intersperse his progress with further
Bree-Cable fragments, as for instance --

FRAGMENT: CABLE, BREE

			CABLE
	You're a person of no value, you
	have no value --

KLUTE, SHIFTING CLOSER

Klute works his way steadily closer -- under
steadily increasing pressure, as the pursuit and
beating continue as SOUNDS, O.S. Even close at hand
the noises are ambiguous -- the clatter of
footsteps, grunts, a slap of flesh -- rather than
distinct. Once or twice we hear CABLE'S VOICE
clearly enough to make out words --

			CABLE (CONT'D)
	-- Is that contempt? Is it?
		(then)
	No, I'm the one who feels contempt.

-- and once or twice a CRY from Bree.

Klute tries to gain aim --

P.O.V. TO BREE, CABLE

-- but Cable is too close upon her, and they are
too steadily in motion.

KLUTE

Klute moves on -- moves on -- gains position --
springs.

CABLE

Cable catches the sound, whirls, screams --

P.O.V. TO KLUTE

Klute closes with him, knocks loose Cable's pistol 
- contends for it again, knocks it loose again.
EFFECT -- under -- SIRENS.

CABLE, KLUTE

Cable breaks loose, backs a step -- backs another
step -- and then, turns and runs unhesitant against
one of the windows, exploding it outward with him,
both frame and glass.

EXT. WIDE SHOT: BUILDINGS - DAY (NIGHT)

We see the body tracing its quick path down the
dark side of the building.

EXT. DOWNSHOT FROM LOFT TO STREET (KLUTE'S P.O.V.) -
DAY (NIGHT)

EXT. BASE OF BUILDING: CABLE'S BODY - DAY (NIGHT)

The sound of SIRENS a little LOUDER.

INT. GARMENT BUILDING: KLUTE, BREE - DAY (NIGHT)

Klute turns from looking down, moves to where Bree
kneels on the floor. He hunkers down.
In a gentle-enough VOICE, but matter-of-factly
withal -- as if to a child --

			KLUTE
	Come on.
		(pause)
	Come on.

(Note: also shoot in MSL, without dialogue, with
SIRENS O.S. full up.) Then we CUT TO --

INT. KLUTE'S APARTMENT - DAY

KLUTE is packing to leave. We follow him about as
he carries clothing from closet and bureau, folds
it into his suitcase on the table. We hear the
familiar FOOTSTEPS on the stairs. Bree's KNOCK. He
lets her in, keeps on about his business. His
expression is sober; hers is quite tentative.

			BREE
	Hi.

He doesn't at least expel her. She ventures in,
sits on the table, swings her heels, watches him
pack. His arm impairs him. At length --

			KLUTE
	I got a call from Ross this
	morning. Cable owned a plot of
	woodland -- he'd go there on
	weekends. They found Tom
	Grunemann's body buried there.
	They've notified his wife.

			BREE
	Oh.
		(pause; then sharply --)
	Well it wasn't us city people that
	did it -- your fine rosy-cheeked
	country boy.

			KLUTE
	Mm.

			BREE
	You're going back?

			KLUTE
	Mm.

Pause. She compresses her lips, slips down from the
table, starts smartly out of the room.

			KLUTE (CONT'D)
	Wait.

She returns and sits on the table again, waits. But
Klute doesn't seem about to say anything more --
goes on packing.

			BREE 
	Well suppose I hadn't come
	downstairs. Would you just have
	folded up and sneaked away?

			KLUTE 
		(slowly)
	No. I was going to come up. I
	wanted to ask you to marry me.
		(pause)

			BREE 
	You wanted to, or you are?

			KLUTE 
	I am.

			BREE 
	You could at least look at me!

He complies, stands and looks, folding a necktie.
But now she finds she has to look away. Somewhat
brokenly --

			BREE (CONT'D)
	Look -- yes. I mean thanks, but --
	don't you think we better be
	realistic?

			KLUTE 
	About what?

			BREE 
	Look at me. I'm pretty and sort of
	clever and very well intentioned,
	and dear God I'd tear your heart
	out!

			KLUTE 
	I don't think so.

He resumes packing, continues through the
following.

			BREE 
	How can you not think so? You know
	the things I can do.

			KLUTE 
		(unclearly)
	They don't scare me any more.

			BREE
	What?

			KLUTE 
	Doesn't scare me. I think we could
	handle it.

Thereafter he guards his silence, staunchly goes on
packing, as she comes at the thing from various
sharp angles. 

			BREE 
	Please, I'm a city person. I'm sure
	it's just as good as here but I'm a
	city person, that's all, I am!
		(pause)
	Hell I know what it's like. I was
	in Jersey once: the frogs go bra-a
	p all night!
		(pause)
	What'im I supposed to do? Mend your
	socks and sing in the church choir?
		(pause, choking) )
	Do you not believe I love you? I'm
	honestly, honestly just --

He has almost finished packing -- returns toward
the suitcase with the tin CLOCK and electric FAN,
tries to fit them in as conversation continues.

			BREE (CONT'D)
	Look, why should it be yes or no?
	Can't we keep it going and see? I
	mean we can keep in touch and visit
	each other and see. People do that,
	that's realistic.

			KLUTE 
	OK.

			BREE
		(bitterly)
	You don't believe that either, do
	you? Why can't you see my side?

			KLUTE 
	Can you use these?

He sets the fan beside her, hands her the LOUDLY
TICKING clock. She holds it in her lap, numbly.
He's packed -- closes various drawers, leaving in
good order -- snaps the suitcase shut, lifts it
stiffly down from the table. She remains sitting.

			BREE
	Can I carry something for you, to
	the car?
		(he shakes his head)
	Will you kiss me?

			KLUTE 
	No. I'm sore.

He moves to the door, pauses, half-smiles --

			KLUTE (CONT'D)
	Well --

She smiles back. He goes. We hear the entryway door
opening and closing.

She slips down off the table. We CUT TO --

EXT STREET OUTSIDE BROWNSTONE - DAY

Klute is, let's say, about seventy feet on his way
when she appears at the front door, calls after
him.

			BREE 
	Hey.

He turns around and stops. He walks slowly back to
her.

CLOSER: BREE, KLUTE

He arrives in proximity to her. Then the following
events in more or less the following order:

He looks at her inquiringly. She responds by
sitting down, plunk, on the grubby front step of
the Brownstone.

Having stood for some time -- during which she has
offered only twitching motions of her hands -- he
sets down the suitcase.

Having set down the suitcase, but derived no
answer, he reaches out one arm, and leans against
the building front.

She nearly arrives at the level of statement.
Fretfully, indecisively --

			BREE
	Oh heck --
		(pause)
	Oh heck --

Then, as a man not to be dallied with, he picks up
the suitcase again. She looks at him strickenly,
but it doesn't precipitate her into speech.

He puts it down again.

And then -- then, after all, goddamit, he reaches
out, grabs her wrist, and simply hauls her along,
suitcase in one hand, Bree in the other. As she
yanks, shouts, struggles --

			BREE (CONT'D)
	I haven't decided yet!
		(beat)
	I haven't decided yet!
		(beat)
	I haven't decided yet! --

			  THE END
INT. DINING ROOM - TOM GRUNEMANN HOUSE - DAY

CLOSE SHOT of TOM GRUNEMANN, attractive young
executive, sitting at the head of the dining room
table carving a turkey for Thanksgiving Day dinner.
There are joyous sounds of celebration. The CAMERA
PANS around the table revealing the happy family
and guests. Among them are KLUTE and CABLE.

Camera stops at Mrs. Grunemann who sits at the foot
of the table opposite her husband. She smiles
across at him with pleasure. We cut to Tom
Grunemann smiling back at her. We cut back to a
closeup of Mrs. Grunemann  looking back at her
husband with love. We cut back to Tom Grunemann's
chair - only now it is empty. The joyous sounds
disappear on this cut. It appears that Tom
Grunemann has disappeared before our eyes. One
moment he is there, and the next moment he is gone.
The camera pans back down the table, only now it is
empty except for Grunemann's children and Mrs.
Grunemann. She is now dressed in something dark.
She and the three children sit eating another meal
in emptiness. She has changed from a joyous woman
to a woman bereaved.

INT. RESEARCH PLANT: ON ROSS - DAY

The industrial frontier. SPECIAL AGENT ROSS steps
into frame, glancing (perhaps idly, a little
impatiently) in this direction at some loud
industrial goings-on just beyond camera, then
returns toward GROUP.

The group includes CABLE and a YOUNGER FBI AGENT
with clipboard, to whom KLUTE is supplying
preliminary data. KLUTE's manner is somewhat
rumpled, awkward.

			KLUTE
	Klute. With a K. K - L - U -

			ROSS
	Are you with plant security,
	Sergeant?

			KLUTE
		(shakes head)
	Town Police.

			ROSS
	Then how are you involved?

			KLUTE
		(slowly)
	I know Tom Grunemann.

			ROSS
		(shortcutting again)
	You knew the subject Thomas
	Grunemann. How well?

			KLUTE
	We grew up together. Kids.

			ROSS
	Can you account for his
	disappearance in any way?

			KLUTE
	No.

			ROSS
	Did he recently appear to you
	agitated or depressed?
		(aside to younger Agent,
		recording)
	-- indicates no -- Did he voice to
	you grievance or discontent with
	his research work here? Indicates
	no. Moral or sexual problems or
	peculiarities? --

			KLUTE
	No.

			ROSS
	Marital problems in general?
	Indicates possibly -- am I right
	Sergeant?

			KLUTE
	Everybody's got some, I guess.

			ROSS
	Did he ever mention specifically a
	girl or woman in New York?

			KLUTE
	No.

			ROSS
	Examine this letter please.
		(continues)
	We recovered that from the shredder
	-- the plant disposal and
	incinerator system. Grunemann
	apparently typed it Friday, before
	he left, decided not to send it,
	tossed it away. We've already
	contacted the New York Police; they
	think they know the girl in
	question.

C.U. KLUTE

Klute reads. We see a controlled incredulity and
revulsion.

			ROSS (CONT'D)
	He never mentioned this type thing
	to you? You didn't know he had
	these interests?

INT. GRUNEMANN HOUSE: C.U. HOLLY - DAY

HOLLY thrusts the letter back toward camera, toward
KLUTE crying out -

			HOLLY
	My husband was not like that! My
	God, Klute.

			KLUTE
	It looks like he sent her quite a
	few of those Holly -- the girl --
	she recalls six or seven letters
	like --

			HOLLY
		(calmly)
	-- No. I mean sure a little rough
	stuff, but just what people usually
	-- No, I would've said we were
	pretty good.
		(pause)
	Johnnie I don't understand. I just
	don't understand.

Klute nods. She is talking for both of them. Klute
looks out the window to the children playing
outside. CAMERA PANS out window to Klute's POV of
children playing on a cold winter day. The trees
are stripped bare.

EXT. RESEARCH PLANT

Tree lined area, lush and green - Summer.

INT. RESEARCH PLANT: DIRECTOR'S OFFICE - DAY

CAMERA pulls back inside window to Klute staring
outside, as if still pondering the fate of Tom
Grunemann. The group in the office includes ROSS
(holding a report), TRASK, a New York detective,
Cable, and the plant director, STREIGER.

			ROSS
	-- has disclosed no evidence of
	crime or criminal intent within the
	jurisdiction of this bureau, and
	since subject Thom --

			CABLE
		(turns sharply,
		interrupts)
	It's been almost a year! Tom
	Grunemann's been missing for a
	year. And all the FBI has to offer
	is a report that must bore even
	you.

			ROSS
		(restraint)
	Well sir.

			STREIGER
	Are you closing the case?

			ROSS
	No sir, we don't state that. We're
	countin --

			CABLE
	But you don't find it worth much
	effort.

			ROSS
		(injured dignity)
	Well Mr. Cable, you've got me here
	from the Bureau. You got Lieutenant
	Trask here from New York
	representing his department and I
	don't frankly consider --

			STREIGER
		(moderating, suggesting)
	Why couldn't you ever find out
	anything from the girl?

			ROSS
		(refers the question)
	Trask --

			TRASK
		(summarizes from notes)
	We first hold her under
	surveillance expectin your boy
	Grunemann to show up there. Didn't.
	Then we bagged -- we arrested her
	on a CP charge, convicted, two
	month's women's city prison, offer
	to reduce sentence, she cooperated.
		(counts)
	Four interrogations. She thought
	she remembered Grunemann -- from
	those letters from before, she made
	that connection -- but she hadn't
	seen him since and couldn't
	identify his photograph and she --

			STREIGER
	Why not?

			TRASK
	Oh a good call girl, she'll turn
	six-seven hundred tricks a year.
	The faces get blurred.
		(resumes)
	And since then, recent months,
	she's reported several, you know,
	incidents: like breather calls,
	anonymous phone calls, also
	somebody maybe following her,
	watching her, things like that. So
	it's I guess you could say,
	conceivable Grunemann's still
	around there, just hangin around
	her, spooking her. But you know,
	that --

He shakes his head, gestures doubtingly. Ross caps
it.

			ROSS
	The subject got emotionallv
	disturbed; he just dropped out.
	There's thousands.

			STREIGER
	Inspector we understand your
	position; ours is a little
	different. We have an investment in
	Tom Grunemann. The Company has an
	investment, and we feel entitled to
	investigate for ourselves.

			ROSS
	Private investigation, you mean.
	Yes sir, of course you're entitled,
	and there's some very competent --

			STREIGER
	Klute offered us his services;
	we've accepted.

Pause. Ross and Trask look at Klute - more than a
bit startled - then at each other. Klute just looks
uneasy.

			STREIGER (CONT'D)
	Klute knew Tom. He has a great many
	ideas about the case --

			ROSS
		(sourly)
	Yes sir, we know he --

			STREIGER
	We'd expect him to work in
	cooperation with you. He'd report
	to each of you and to our Company's
	New York office, to Pete -- Pete
	goes there on a regular schedule
	back and forth, and --

			ROSS
		(tactfully)
	Mr. Streiger, speaking frankly --
	we've appreciated the Sergeant's
	interest you know, all along. Here,
	locally. But New York, that's -
	well --

			TRASK
		(to Klute, leniently)
	Ever done any missing person's
	work?

			ROSS
	Spent much time in the city?
		(to others)
	You see, I have to wonder --
	speaking frankly; the Sergeant
	knows I'm only speaking frankly -

			CABLE
	You wonder why we thought of Klute?
	Frankly? He's interested.

INT/EXT. WIDE SHOT: PENNSYLVANIA COUNTRYSIDE - DAY

Verdant Pennsylvania farmland. Early morning. Near
at hand an open field set about with bee hutches
and patched with mist.

A FIGURE, a shadow (Klute's actually) moves across
frame from the left, blanking in. We reorient to -

INT. BEDROOM - KLUTES HOUSE - DAY

We see that we've been looking out from the bedroom
window of this house. Klute turns to rolltop desk
in bedroom and picture of Tom Grunemann, picture of
Bree Daniel, and other material he has collected on
the case. He puts them in his suitcase and closes
the suitcase. He shuts rolltop desk.

INT. KLUTE'S HOUSE - DAY

We follow Klute through the house with suitcase. He
puts away a last dish, shutting off water, gas, and
electricity, and so on -- takes a last look around 
- reaches for the door handle. WE CUT TO --

INT. COMMERCIAL AUDITION - SOUND STAGE - DAY

A section of wall, a door coming open -- and the
FIGURE of BREE entering and standing. We have gone
from the warm sunlight of the country to mustv
darkness.

She appears chic, poised, and perfect as a magazine
picture.
But as she gets used to the darkness and her eyes
focus on a line of equally beautiful girls sitting
and waiting in folding chairs along a wall, we see
that she is a great deal less certain of demeanor.
Assailable. WE CUT TO -

EXT. KLUTE'S HOUSEYARD, HOUSE, BARN - DAY

Klute, stepping out, closes, locks and checks the
house door, then moves on to his car -- a vintage
Plymouth -- and tosses in his suitcase; and then
takes a last turn around the yard itself; props
open the cover of a beehutch, and lets down the
rail gate of a sidefield. He approaches to roll
shut his barn door -- and on this action we CUT
again TO --

INT. COMMERCIAL AUDITION - SOUNDSTAGE - DAY

			DIRECTOR (O.S.)
		(hastily)
	Honey, no, we don't have too many.

She slaps the cup down, hurls herself forward --
SWISH PAN -- onto a MALE ACTOR, thrusting him down
to the floor, her hands at his throat. As we WIDEN
TO INCLUDE DIRECTOR AND MORE OF SCENE, and as the
Director reads from script, supplying a narrator
voice -

			DIRECTOR (CONT'D)
	Now before it comes to that, let's
	have a look, et cetera, et cetera --
	OK -

Bree and the Male Actor relax slightly, as -

ANGLE TO REVEAL ROOM, OTHERS

We reestablish the scene -- a few pieces of film
equipment -- and the congery of other ACTORS and 
ACTRESSES preparing to read for parts. As the
Director approaches, counsels Bree -- all of this
quick and consecutive --

			DIRECTOR (CONT'D)
	-- Honey you make it look a little
	real. It should have, you know,
	that fun to it.
		(beat)

			BREE
	Strangle him to death funny?

			DIRECTOR
	Well we go from this into stomach
	diagrams. It can't be too -- look
	let's try it again from -

-- but then he glances at his watch, and at the
others waiting their turn.

			DIRECTOR (CONT'D)
	No -- just give us the faces at the
	end, would you?

Bree and the Male Actor set their cheeks together,
beaming half-moon smiles to camera, hold it for a
moment, as the Director reads again -

			DIRECTOR (CONT'D)
		(reads)
	-- And another family saved by Elso
	tablets. OK --
		(brightly)
	Thank you very much.

-- and holds out his hands for their scripts, at
the same time as he summons from a list in his
other hand --

			DIRECTOR (CONT'D)
	Pierce -- Danner -

BREE passes a new group of beautiful girls sitting
in line waiting their turn as she exits as brightly
as possible.

EXT. NEW YORK SIDEWALK: PEDESTRIANS - DAY

They trudge along the sidewalk -- the herd, the
late-afternoon crush. A LONG-LENS shot, the crowd
compacted. We see BREE milling along with the rest.
She maneuvers to a sidewalk PHONE BOOTH, enters. We
see her deposit, dial.

INT. PHONE BOOTH, BREE - DAY

She is connected (to her registry).

			BREE
	Bree Daniel, any messages?
		(waits -- none)
	OK, thanks.

She waits for a moment. Then makes a curious, small
gesture of her hand -- deposits another dime, dials
again, is answered.

			BREE (CONT'D)
	Trina? Bree. Do I? Oh no, just a
	commercial I thought I might get,
	that's all.
		(quickly, more brightly)
	Well I'd take a quick thirty, hon.
	Do you have a commuter for me?
	Wait.

As she prepares to write it down, we CUT BACK TO -

EXT. KLUTE'S HOUSEYARD: KLUTE - DAY

Klute finishes rolling shut, and padlocks, the barn
door. He returns to his car, sits in (leaving door
open) starts engine. Again -- one last time -- the
look around. Then he pulls the door shut, pulls
out. And on this we CUT TO --

INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR - DAY

A GROUP -- middle-aged Couple, Child, Bellman with
suitcases -- wait to descend in elevator as BREE
gets off. We TRACK with her along corridor to a
door. She checks number and knocks.

REVERSE: THROUGH DOOR TO BREE

A MAN opens the door. We neither see or hear him
clearly -- he is foreground, defocused. His shirt
is untucked. Bree cocks her head, greets him
cutely.

			BREE
	Hullo.

He mumbles some kind of greeting, steps back. She
pauses a moment in the door (casing, instantly) --
then quite confident, friendly, provocative all at
once --

			BREE (CONT'D)
	Ooh, I knew I'd like you.

-- and CUT TO --

EXT. CENTER OF TOWN: KLUTE DRIVING - DAY

Klute's car draws through the business section of
town, moves on --

INT. HOTEL ROOM: BREE - DAY

C.U. BREE (the Man out of frame and unheard-from)
as she bargains gaily -- and at the same time a
little watchfully.

			BREE
	Lover, that's got to be a little
	extra. I mean it sounds very
	exciting, what you speak of, you've
	got me all excited. But something
	special like that, you know it's
	got to cost a little more, mm?

-- and CUT TO --

INT. CAR: KLUTE DRIVING - DAY

Klute has laid his jacket aside, rolled his
sleeves, is eating the last of a vending machine
sandwich. The CAR RADIO is on. He leans forward,
tuning it from --

			1ST ANNC'R
		(energetic)
	--R - W - M, radio's voice is the
	Shippensburg Valley, on a beautiful
	clear warm Thurs --

-- to --

			2ND ANNC'R
		(rural)
	-- Tucky Wonder Beans picking up a
	half cent over yesterday's price at-

-- and CUT TO --

INT. C.U. ON BREE, MAN (HOTEL BED) - DAY

The Man's face is buried against her neck, her
labors over her. She cries out ecstatically,
transportedly -- it would seem at the edge of
orgasm --

			BREE
	Oh lover, oh it's too much -- oh
	you thrill me -- yes, like that,
	it's -- oh it's beautiful, oh --

-- and at the same time refers privately to her
wristwatch. And CUT TO --

EXT. WIDE SHOT: ACCESS RAMP OF TURNPIKE - LUSH
HILLY COUNTRY - DAY

KLUTE'S CAR

As Klute's car drives onto the turnpike surrounded 
by green country, we ZOOM into a close shot of
Klute through the windshield of his car. And then
in what seems like a continuous shot we ZOOM back
to a wide angle revealing Klute caught in the
endless line of cars in a typical traffic jam at
the entrance to New York City, surrounded by
smoggy, grey, urban skies.

INT. CITY MULTILAYERED PARKING BUILDING - KLUTE'S
CAR - NIGHT

KLUTE sits inside his car as it is mechanically
lifted into the air. It looks as if he is being
manipulated by a robot.

EXT. STREET: OUTSIDE THE BROWNSTONE - NIGHT

BREE moves along street, returning home,
apprehensive of the one or two other distant
FIGURES. She turns in at one of the Brownstones.

INT. STAIRWELL OF BROWNSTONE - NIGHT

We watch Bree as she mounts to the top floor, the
door of her apartment, barren, isolated,
frightened.

INT. BREE'S APTARTMENT - NIGHT

BREE unlocks the door, switches on a light, cases
the apartment for a moment before entering,
securing chain-lock, putting aside her things.
There is a RECORD PLAYER near the first interior
doorway. She switches it as she moves by. By time
the first record has dropped, she has the shower
turned on, is getting rid of her dress. We CUT BACK
TO --

EXT. EMPTY STREET: KLUTE - NIGHT

Klute walks, as before, carrying his suitcase. We
see him slow, concernedly looking toward --

INT. BREE'S APARTMENT: ON BREE - NIGHT

Bree sits on a studio couch, near the record
player, with a QUILT huddled over and around her,
her back against the wall. The MUSIC is classical,
curiously -- the sound of a HARPSICHORD. She is
more or less expressionless -- but trembling
violently, shaking.

FRONT WINDOW SIGN BEING REMOVED WHICH READS "FOR
RENT" - STORE - INQUIRE CRAWICZ, DAY

INT. BREE's APARTMENT: BREE - DAY

Bree moves about energetically, preparing to set
out on rounds. A KNOCK on the door. She startled,
then approaches to door, to peep-hole, lifts lid
aside.

THROUGH PEEPHOLE TO KLUTE FACE

Klute's face is somewhat distorted by the peephole
lens; he is gazing mildly about the landing.

BREE

			BREE
		(through door, curtly)
	What is it?

			KLUTE (O.S.)
	Miss Daniel? My name is Klute --
	John Klute --

She turns the door handle , parts the door about
three inches, looks through at him. He starts to
enter.

			KLUTE (CONT'D)
	Can I talk to you?

-- and the door crunches against its chain-lock. He
stops perforce, a bit startled. A pause. A slice of
Bree's face looks coldly out at him. He summons a
smile.

			BREE
	What about?

			KLUTE
	My name's John Klute.

			BREE
	You said that.

			KLUTE
	I'm an investigator. I'd like to
	ask you some questions about Tom
	Grunemann.

She tightens again.

			BREE
	Who?

			KLUTE
	Tom Grunemann. He wrote you some
	letters.

			BREE
		(innocently)
	Gee.

			KLUTE
	He was a research engineer at the
	Tuscarora Laboratories in
	Pennsylvania. He disappeared from
	there last April. I've been hired
	to look for him.

			BREE
	Why?

			KLUTE
	You know what I'm talking about.
	Miss Daniel.

			BREE
	Honest?

			KLUTE
	Will you let me ask you some
	questions?

			BREE
		(gumbo-southern)
	Dew yew hayuv ah-dentifikyshun?

He takes out a folded letter and a wallet and
passes them both through to her. Silence. She
examines them with care, then appears to soften a
little; even smiles slightly.

			BREE (CONT'D)
	You're not police or FBI; you're
	just a private investigator?

			KLUTE
	Mm.

			BREE
	And you just want to ask me a few
	questions?

			KLUTE
	Mm.

She smiles again, hands the letter and wallet back
out, closes the door (doesn't slam, just closes).
Klute looks at it blankly for a time, starts to
knock again, decides not to -- turns and descends
the stairs.

BREE

Bree listens through the door to his departing foot
steps. They fade from hearing. She hastens to
assemble her properties.

EXT. FRONT DOOR - DAY

Klute comes out door and descends the stairs at the
same even pace -- he walks into the vacant store
below.

INT. BASEMENT STORE - DAY

It had once been a Boutique that sold happy
clothes. There are some psychedelic posters and a
few remnants of its former identity. Klute's
suitcase is propped open on a cot behind a counter.
The ceilings are low, forcing Klute to stoop as he
enters. He seems out of place and out of scale. A
case containing a tape recorder stands on the
floor. On the table are a FOLDER of Klute's notes,
and a paper bag. Klute enters and deliberately
resumes his settling in. From the paper bag he sets
aside an electric FAN, then lifts out from the
shopping bag a cheap tin ALARM CLOCK and begins
winding it.

INT. BREE'S APARTMENT - DAY

Bree has shifted position to a window, is looking
down at the street. She sees - and we hear - SOUND
OF BUS APPROACHING, distantly. She grabs her
properties, whips out the door.

EXT. ON DOOR OF BROWNSTONE - DAY

Bree skids to a stop just inside the door, scans
quickly out in one direction then the other (in
case Klute has been waiting in ambush on the
sidewalk) then races -- PAN -- to BUS AT CURB --
makes it, pulls herself aboard --

INT. KLUTE'S APARTMENT: KLUTE - DAY

Klute has been watching from his window. We hear
the BUS PULLING AWAY. He turns back, plugs in the
electric fan. Then hoists the TAPE RECORDER,
unsnaps the cover. We see clearly what it is.

INT. AGENCY OFFICE - DAY

BREE is showing her notebook to an AGENT. He leans
forward courteously, occasionally stroking his
forehead with his fingertips -- a nice man with a
headache.

			BREE
	-- and I take acting classes with
	Lee Tainter --

			AGENT
	-- Lee, yes --

			BREE
	-- and I was in two of his workshop
	type productions, Uncle Vanya and
	the girl in Five Characters --
		(indicates picture)
	-- here -- and then of course I
	have the modeling and the
	demonstrator work, the trade-fair
	work -- but naturally I feel ready
	for something more, well you know,
	sustain --

			AGENT
	Well, thanks very much for coming
	in.

She starts for the door -- he's already turning
away -- then ducks back, hands him one of her
Glossies, laughing prettily at her own
forgetfulness.

			BREE
		(beautifully -- the
		business)
	Thank you very much.

EXT. STREET - DAY

BREE comes out, pauses with notebook to cross out,
the call completed, checks the list of those
remaining, sets forth again. We hear TRASK'S VOICE
OVER, very quick, very clipped.

			TRASK (V.O.)
	Man, just a poor pretty little
	hooker, like to be an actress --

INT. MISSING PERSONS BUREAU - DAY

CLOSEUP photograph of dead man. It is replaced with
series of photgraphs of dead men. CAMERA pulls back
to reveal KLUTE flipping through the file of the
unidentified dead.

			TRASK (V.O.)
	What you lookin' to get from her?
	You think she's got Grunemann hid
	somewhere, the attic, feedin him
	soup? Or maybe he's hidin in a dark
	alley and he'll jump on her and you
	jump on him. And third place, even
	if she does know somethin' she's
	right, she don't have to talk to
	you. You don't have police power,
	you can't make her.

KLUTE closes the file.

			KLUTE
	That's a lot of people to die
	unknown.

			TRASK
	Unknown, unidentified and unwanted.
	And there's more every day man,
	there's more everyday.

As KLUTE slowly walks away we bring in TELEPHONE
RING and BREE VOICE, OVER answering.

			BREE VOICE
	Bree Daniel.
		(then)
	Yeah, hi hon.

EXT. BREE APARTMENT - NIGHT

Camera is looking up through lighted window outside
at BREE on phone.

			BREE
	Oh hon, I just don't know. I'm
	trying to stay out of it.

EXT. KLUTE APARTMENT - NIGHT

CAMERA pans down from BREE's window to KLUTE's
window at the bottom revealing KLUTE at tape
recorder. The TAPE RECORDER is going, its light
winking. KLUTE holds headset against one ear, makes
a note or two. We hear BREE's and other GIRL'S
VOICES, UNDER, FILTERED.

			GIRL'S VOICE
	-- comes in with these other yulds
	maybe two or three times a year,
	and five big ones baby, just one
	evening.

			BREE VOICE
	Marta, thanks, and I'd love to
	party with you hon, but --

Klute sets down the headset (we drop the VOICES far
under, INDISTINGUISHABLE), makes a note, and thumbs
open the box of a fresh reel; the present reel is
near the end. We establish a pile of ALREADY
RECORDED TAPES. We CUT BACK TO --

INT. BREE APARTMENT: BREE ON PHONE - NIGHT

			BREE
	Well try to get someone else Marty
	and if I change my mind -- sure
	hon, bye.

She hangs up, starts away. The PHONE RINGS AGAIN.
She tries to ignore it. It persists. She finally
turns back to answer it, and we CUT TO --

INT. CASTING OFFICE - AD AGENCY - DAY

CAMERA STARTS on huge photo montage of the Family
of Man and pans down to a group of beautiful girls
sitting on a bench below. They are dwarfed by the
enormous picture. Each one clutches an almost
identical portfolio of pictures in her lap. Camera
pans down row of portfolios until it stops at BREE 
- impatiently waiting her turn. WE CONTINUE THE
TELEPHONE VOICES OVER, WILD TRACK STYLE. The MAN'S
VOICE is thick with drink, and emotion. First the
click, then --

			BREE VOICE
	Bree Daniel --

			MAN'S VOICE
	Oh God baby, oh God I really love
	you.

			BREE VOICE
	That's nice; who is this?

			MAN'S VOICE
	I really love you baby, you know
	that?

A CLICK, and the MAN'S VOICE CONTINUING, trailing
into helpless sobs --

			MAN'S VOICE (CONT'D)
	Hello? Hello? Oh my God, hello?

EXT. STREET: BREE

Bree comes out from the building (note possible
costume change; not necessarily consecutive
action), checks off on her list continues on her
way -- as we CONTINUE WILD TRACK STYLE VOICES.
Starting with a CLICK and --

			BREE VOICE
	Bree Daniel.

			2ND MAN'S VOICE
		(nicely)
	Bree -- Frank Hanley, you remember,
	Fayetterville?

			BREE VOICE
	Oh yeah, hi Frank, sure.

			2ND MAN'S VOICE
	Well I'm in town, like to see you.

			BREE VOICE
	Well Frank that's awful nice but
	I'm out of action, sort of, you
	know --

We FADE THIS CONVERSATION UNDER BUT HOLD,
CONTINUING, as --

BREE PASSES CAMERA -- and we PAN TO SHOT OF KLUTE,
at corner, unseen by her and apparently in
surveillance of her. Then he too turns out of
frame, and we CUT TO --

INT. PENN STATION - DAY

CAMERA is looking down at an enormous gift package
on a platform. There is a sound of a recorded
fanfare and with the pull of a string the package
is opened revealing a brand new LINCOLN CONTINENTAL
CONVERTIBLE. People applaud and the car starts to
revolve. At the wheel of the car sits BREE. We CUT
to a shot through the windshield of car --

BREE'S POV

A sea of staring faces revolves around her. We
cross fade with SPANGLER VOICE OVER (as if
recalling a case record).

			SPANGLER (V.O.)
	Bree Daniel, Caucasian, twenty
	eight, good physical health, no
	narcotics record, presenting an
	unusually strong personality some
	ways, high intelligence, a high
	bracket call girl.

EXT. WOMEN'S PRISON ROOF - CAGED IN RECREATION AREA

SPANGLER, a prison psychiatrist, sits on a bench
eating a sandwich partially wrapped in wax paper
and sipping from a carton of milk. He is obviously
a man pressed for time. KLUTE sits beside him.
Across from them some prisoners are taking their
exercise. Through the metallic netting that
surrounds them, we see the skyline of New York
City. It only dramatizes more the sense of being
caged.

			SPANGLER
	-- Usual case history -- this isn't
	a medical confidence, it's all of
	them -- broken family, lonely,
	confused, crummy childhood, early
	promiscuity, formal prostitution
	beginning in her teens, income
	twenty-five to thirty thousand a
	year.
		(notes Klute's reaction)
	Oh they don't keep the money: they
	get rid of it, they get pimps. Why?
		(stabs at record)
	Why do you want to know all this?

			KLUTE
	I want to know how Tom Grunemann
	got mixed up in it.

			SPANGLER
	Not unusual.

			KLUTE
	Did she talk about him to you?

			SPANGLER
	About his letters -- that's all she
	remembered. Quite violent material,
	I'd say, obsessive, a quite sick
	man. But that's not unusual either.

			KLUTE
	Has she talked with you since
	prison?

			SPANGLER
	No. She had every good intention of
	it -- coming to me as a private
	patient, getting out of the life,
	devoting herself to an acting
	career.

			KLUTE
	I think she's trying that.

			SPANGLER
	Oh sure they try. The idea of a
	better life.  But they don't really
	know much about life: They get
	confused -- or scared or frustrated
	or bored -- they pop back to the
	one thing they can handle.
	The trick. The trick. Men in bed.
	Not men in general, not life, not
	love, not even real sex -- it
	avoids all that. Just the trick,
	the transaction.

INT. PENN STATION - DAY

POV world revolving around BREE through windshield
of car. The circular motion slows down and then
stops. Cut to BREE getting out of car and walking
off platform. She looks a bit shaky. She is stopped
by one of the spectators.

			MAN
		(tapping her)
	We had a bet on - if you were real
	or not. I won.

She looks at him in disgust and crosses to phone
booth.

INT. PHONE BOOTH - DAY

			BREE
		(on phone)
	Marta --

INT. CHURCH DISCOTHEQUE - NIGHT

We are in the interior of what was once a church
and is now a discotheque. Interior is painted
purple; the record player stands on the altar over
the crowd. Pews are massed around the dance floor.
Stained glass windows are lighted from behind and
are circled with light bulbs that flash on and off.
For all of its obviously bizarre visual quality,
there is a sense of relaxation. It is a late night
gathering place of many who belong to the sexual
underworld of the city.

BREE and the OTHER GIRL advance to a pew. A MAN
sitting there (the other girl's pimp) with a THIRD
GIRL. BREE's companion greet him shyly, tenderly:
she and BREE sit down, join in conversation.

PULL BACK SLOWLY -- other pews, other girls and a
few men, the sisterhood -- To --

BAR AREA IN BACK (WHAT ONCE MUST HAVE BEEN THE
VESTIBULE OF THE CRURCH)

Among the people around the bar, pimps, whores, and
a sprinkling of hopeful Johns and curiosity
seekers. The camera picks a familiar face: CABLE.
He watches BREE with a mixture of amusement and
contempt. A GIRL comes over to him and tries to
proposition him. They appear to be discussing
price. Just as she thinks it is set, he walks away.

INT. KLUTE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

CLOSEUP photograph of TOM GRUNEMANN pinned to a
large piece of beaverboard KLUTE has placed on a
wall. CAMERA PANS over various pictures and pieces
of evidence KLUTE has pinned up in an attempt to
make some sense from the puzzle of TOM GRUNMIANN's
disappearance. CAMERA PANS over to KLUTE sitting on
cot looking up at the pieces of the puzzle. There
is a heated TV dinner in front of him.

The TAPE RECORDER reels start turning (sound
powered), the recording light starts winding (as
BREE, above, dials). KLUTE pays it scant attention 
- he can catch up with the news anytime. He sits
manfully in front of the TV dinner, starts peeling
back the foil --

INT. BREE'S APARTMENT: BREE - NIGHT

She holds the phone, is answered. Her voice more
natural, a little shy, a little covert.

			BREE
	Hi. Bree.
		(is greeted)
	Hi. Well I could come over tonight 
	- if you'd like -- if there's no
	one else.
		(laughs diffidently)
	I really want to just talk to you.

INT. KLUTE'S APARTMENT: KLUTE - NIGHT

The tape-recorder continues turning and winking as
the conversation upstairs continues. KLUTE looks at
TV dinner. He reaches for the headset of the
taperecorder, holds it loosely against one ear. He
exhibits a measure of new interest. The TAPE
RECORDER stops running. He immediately rewinds, and
starts listening through it again. We CUT TO --

EXT. GARMENT DISTRICT - NIGHT

Large, dark buildings -- a DIM-LIGHTED WINDOW
showing at an upper floor of one -- the street
otherwise by and large deserted. A TAXI draws in, a
FIGURE IN EVENING DRESS (Bree) gets out, approaches
the building, glances around, either secretly or
apprehensively -- presses a buzzer, waits, gets
answering CLICKS, enters the dark hallway of the
building, starts upstairs.

EXT. ACROSS THE STREET - NIGHT

KLUTE shifts into view, looking in the direction
Bree's gone, a little puzzled all in all. He
doesn't immediately follow; he waits.

INT. GARMENT BUILDING - CUTTING ROOMS - NIGHT

We look past RACKS OF CLOTHING, as BREE arrives up
the dark stairway into dark rooms -- the scene,
mysterious, a little sinister. She seems fearful of
it herself, advances slowly, looking around, calls 
-

			BREE
	Hi? -_

ANGLE PAST MR. FABER, TO BREE

Mr. Faber is SILHOUETTED for a moment, standing,
watching her, from along an alleyway of garments.
She sees him, is startled then relieved.

			BREE (CONT'D)
	Oh --

He moves toward her.

REVERSE ANGLE, TO MR. FABER

Mr. Faber is a man of 65 or so, rather handsome,
and for this occasion very spruce, very erect, very
nattily turned out. Bree complains cheerfully.

			BREE (CONT'D)
	You scared me, Mr. Faber.

He smiles, kisses her cheek, tests the fabric of
her evening dress -- (in passing, as a matter of
expertise).

			MR. FABER
	Good material, not too good cut.
	I'd do better for you.

Then he turns, lifts down a WOMAN'S DRESS CAPE,
carrying it -- graciously gestures her to precede
him --

CORNER OF CUTTING ROOM

A dim pool of light here. A private area here,
sectioned off by rows of garments. A couch, rug,
coffee table, a chair or two -- a place for Buyers
to take their ease. BREE and MR. FABER enter. Her
manner is suddenly elegant, assured, regal; his
befits a man of the world. He fits the cloak around
her shoulders and gestures to the couch; she sits.
He pours a glass of wine for her, for himself. She
speaks with a neat continental accent -- doing it
fairly well, really -- a member of the
international set.

			BREE
	Oh thank you.

He sits in the chair opposite, sips his wine.

			MR. FABER
	Enjoy.
		(then)
	Well --

			BREE
		(diffident)
	It's good to see you. Well -- could
	we do it first and then just talk?

			MR. FABER
	Sure dear, yes.

			BREE
	Well -- well I'm just back. And --
	I must tell you -- something quite
	wonderful.

			MR. FABER
		(intently)
	Yes?

			BREE
	And Cannes was quite fun, quite;
	and we played baccarat and
	chemindefer and there was a nice
	little Italian marquis quite
	enthusiastic for me -- but a young
	man can be so silly --

			MR. FABER
	Mm.

			BREE
	And then one night -- at the gaming
	tables -- well I just saw him. A
	stranger -- looking at me -- and I
	knew suddenly that all my life I'd
	been --

She hesitates strangely, her fingers at the neck of
the cape. Faintly --

			BREE (CONT'D)
	-- May I? It's so --

			MR. FABER
		(quickly)
	Please --

She stands, unloosing the cloak, letting it fall on
the couch. But she doesn't sit again -- begins to
move here and there about the enclosure, her hands
wandering about her dress and body -- an erotic
restlessness.

			BREE
	Not young; he wasn't young -- gray
	at the temples, he -- well actually
	he looked like you.

			MR. FABER
		(tensely)
	Yes?

			BREE
	And nobody could tell me who he was
	-- an exiled prince or a mercenary
	or a bullfighter or -- but I felt
	it stirring inside me, this -- this
	wild, pagan feeling --

EXT. GARMENT BUILDING DOOR - NIGHT

KLUTE arrives from across the street. It takes him
a while (with a 'loid' probably) to slip the lock.
He eases door open, moves inside --

INT. CORNER OF CUTTING ROOM: BREE - NIGHT

BREE is farther along in her narrative, more
fervent in manner. MR. FABER sits at the edge of
his seat, ducking his head now and then in
pleasure, but making no move to molest her.

			BREE
	And next day at the beach -- our
	beach pavilion -- I saw him again,
	his eyes burning into me. I was
	helpless. Without his even speaking
	to me, without his even touching, I
	knew that somehow -- somehow --

She casts away an accessory garment. Mr. Faber
burns her with his eyes --

INT. GARMENT BUILDING - CUTTING ROOMS - NIGHT

KLUTE mounts into view at the head of the stairs,
prowls along the aisles of clothing, looking --
sees --

POV PAST GARMENT RACKS TO MR. FABER

Klute sees Mr. Faber first -- clearly a senior
citizen -- sitting transfixed, fastened in some
private dream. Then BREE drifts into view -- stands
-- lets fall the evening dress about her ankles,
poses -- drifts out of view again --

KLUTE

Klute watches in that direction a moment longer. In
his expression a certain curiosity -- a prurience --
but rather more strongly, disappointment, a measure
of disgust. Not his affair. He turns away from it,
into camera, and --

EXT. BREE'S BROWNSTONE - NIGHT

Near the entrance, outside the door to KLUTE's
apartment below. We open on BREE. She shouts
angrily, miserably --

			BREE
	Whyn't you just cut out?

We WIDEN TO INCLUDE KLUTE. Now she begins to get
it. He turns, opens door to his room below. She
comes slowly down steps.

INT. KLUTE'S ROOM - DAY

She steps in the door, looks slowly around at his
various appurtenances -- the bed, the necktie over
the mirror, etc. -- and then, the TAPE RECORDER and
then the STACK OF TAPE BOXES. Softly, venomously --

			BREE
	Oh you bastard.

But then she adjusts -- a frightened but matter-of
fact hooker --

			BREE (CONT'D)
	Is it the shakedown hon? You picked
	a loser, I just don't have it.

			KLUTE
	No, I'm look --

			BREE
		(vehemently again)
	If I was taking calls full time
	would I be living in this kip? I'd
	be back on Park Avenue; I could
	support the whole National Guard!

			KLUTE
		(gestures upward)
	Could I ask some questions?

			BREE
	Or you'll get me shoved back in the
	brig you mean; another month with
	the bull-dykes.

She seems to have expressed it; the balance of
power. She turns, goes out, heads upstairs. Klute
unhurriedly takes up his folder of notes, then
follows.

INT. BREE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Bree disposes her belongings. Klute moves to table.
There is a group of plants on the table that long
since died of neglect. He notices them and the
disorganization of the room without comment, opens
his folder, rummages for the photographs. Then,
exasperatedly --

			BREE
	Look, I told the police everything:
	I don't even remember the schlub!

Klute doesn't respond. Klute sets out a photograph
for her to look at.

INSERT: PHOTOGRAPH TOM GRUNEMANN

KLUTE, BREE

			BREE
	They showed me that one. I
	understand it's Grunemann, but I
	told them, I just don't remember.

Klute tosses down a second photograph.

INSERT: SECOND PHOTOGRAPH

Tom Grunemann, Elaine Grunemann, two daughters.

BREE, KLUTE

			BREE
		(cool)
	A family sort of man.

Klute grunts, meaning 'yes'. She echoes his grunt,
meaning we don't know what. He tosses another --

INSERT: WIDE PHOTOGRAPH - COMPANY PICNIC

An everybody-over-here, fellow-employees, sort of
picture. (Including the figures of Streiger and
Cable among many others, male and female.) The
usual impedimenta -- picnic baskets, balls, bats, a
held sign: 'Tole-American'. KLUTE'S FINGER
indicates --

			KLUTE (V.O.)
	-- Tom, again.

KLUTE, BREE

She looks at the picture briefly, at him
questioningly.

			KLUTE
	Company outing or picnic or
	something like that.

			BREE
	Isn't that sweet.
		(then)
	Well it could be any one of them
	bubi; I get to see them all.

She separates from Klute, around the table (but
remains standing, restless). Klute puts photo
aside, prepares to take notes, as she pleads --

			BREE (CONT'D)
	Look -- please -- will you just try
	to get it from my side? A year ago.
	I was in the life fulltime. I was
	living on Park with leather
	furniture and a million dresses.
	Then they dropped on me, the fuzz,
	they caged me -- they started
	asking me about a man, some man,
	I'm supposed to have seen a year
	before that. Two years ago, two. He
	could be in Yemen!

She waits for Klute to respond -- he doodles
permissively on his pad of paper -- she goes on.

			BREE (CONT'D)
	A name. Grunemann. Nothing. And
	they showed me pictures like this
	and they meant nothing. Then they
	asked me, well had I been getting
	letters, from someone out there in
	Cabbageville --

			KLUTE
	-- Tuscarora --

			BREE
	All right, yes, I had been. Those
	sick, wild letters -- I'm watching
	you, gonna follow you, gonna punish
	you, kill you et cetera. Well, they
	said, all right that's Grunemann.
	So try to remember when you and he 
	- when -- well I don't know, there
	was that dumper once, he sounded
	like that dumper --
		(explains)
	Dumpers; they get their kicks
	beating you up. A man hired me
	once, then tried to really kill me 
	- that'd be about two years ago.

Without warning she wheels to the open windows, and
shouts out full-voiced -- both startling and
somewhat intriguing Klute --

			BREE (CONT'D)
		(shouts)
	OK Tommy-baby, Allie-Allie-in-free
	kid, I got the gumdrops.

Turns around again, to Klute. Cheerfully --

			BREE (CONT'D)
	You remind me of my uncle.

			KLUTE
	What?
		(then --)
	What do you remember about that --
	dumper?

			BREE
	Nothing. Except he wasn't kidding.
	Usually it's a fakeout, you
	probably know. They pretend to tie
	you up, and you wear a dress with a
	cloth belt and they pretend to whip
	you or you --
		(beat)
	Hell it's their money. I'll hang
	from the shower rod and whistle
	Maytime. Except this guy was really
	tripped out on it; he --

			KLUTE
	But you can't say that Dumper was
	Tom Grunemann.

			BREE
	I can't say he was anybody!

A brief pause. Klute sorts his notes. She may take
it that he's packing to leave -- hopes so anyhow.
For an instant we see the undefended girl
underneath --

			BREE (CONT'D)
	So -- OK -- that's all?

Then again she changes manner -- remembering a
practical problem, approaching it as a matter-of
fact hooker.

			BREE (CONT'D)
	Well could I have them back now
	hon? -- those tape recordings
	you've got downstairs -- OK? -- and
	if you want you can have a good
	time and I'll have a good time and--

			KLUTE
	What about everything since?

She draws back again. Up to now she's been
reasonably on top of things. Starting now we see
her driven toward the things she'd really rather
not talk about -- and increasingly more shaken.

			KLUTE (CONT'D)
		(prompts)
	Everything that's happened since
	Tom Grunemann disappeared. The
	phone calls and the --

			BREE
	Just phone calls, right? They ring,
	you answer, they don't say
	anything, just blank. Kids getting
	kicks. Burglars looking for an
	empty apartment. I mean there is
	nothing that proves --

			KLUTE
	What about the other things you've
	reported? --
		(consulting notes)
	-- being followed on the --

			BREE
		(interrupts -- awkwardly)
	Look -- I'm sorry -- I've led
	everybody wrong. I mean yes, I get
	those feelings, but that's just me,
	that's just feelings.
		(beat)
	I'm sure this will amuse you;
	I'm scared of the dark. And
	sometimes I get shook up, I hear
	people or -- well, I'll come out in
	the morning and think someone's
	been prying at my mailbox, or
	there's a little -- trash outside
	my door and I wonder if someone
	left it there for -- do you see? --
	things other people wouldn't even
	notice. Well that's not real, it's
	just nerves; it's got nothing to do
	with --

The PHONE RINGS. She startles. Then approaches with
some difficulty -- but then answers with complete
calm in her Smith-girl voice.

			BREE (CONT'D)
	Bree Daniel.
		(listens. Brightly)
	Oh yes, Ted Carlin, how is Ted?
		(listens)
	Oh, well, thank you very much but
	maybe the next time you're in town?
		(listens)
	Well I just love Ted and I'd love
	to meet you -- you have a very nice
	voice -- but I just --
		(listens, grows impatient)
	Well I'm having a chat with a very
	nice cop. Actually not a real cop;
	he's a private inves --

A BUZZING from the phone; the connection abruptly
broken. She hangs up, recites.

			KLUTE
	Is that how you get most of your
	dates? Someone gives your name to
	someone else?

			BREE
	Most of them.

			KLUTE
	Is that how you met the Dumper? --
	Someone else gave --

			BREE
	How would I remember?

			KLUTE
	How else do you meet them? Pimps?
		(a beat)

			BREE
		(patient)
	You're very square. Pimps don't get
	you dates, cookie; they just take
	the money.

Klute takes up the slip of paper previously given
him by Trask. In the same manner as before --

			KLUTE
	I have some names the police gave
	me. Frank Ligourin. Will you tell
	me what --

			BREE
		(trembling)
	Look, I'm sure this'll amuse you
	too. Ilia trying to get away from
	all that.

			KLUTE
	What about the old gentleman the
	other night, Mr. Faber?

She freezes again, looking at him. Then savagely --

			BREE
	You saw that, goddamn you? You saw
	it? He's seventy. His wife's dead.
	He started cutting garments at
	fourteen. His whole life, he's
	maybe had a week's vacation, I'm
	all he has and he never, never
	touches me, and what harm in it,
	what --

She chokes -- then goes on --

			BREE (CONT'D)
	Klute, tell me, what's your bag?
	Are you a talker, or a button man
	or a doubler, or maybe you like
	them very young -- children -- or
	get your chest walked around with
	high-heeled shoes, or have us watch
	you tinkle? Or --

			KLUTE
		(under)
	-- OK --

			BREE
	-- You want to wear women's
	clothes, or you get off ripping
	things --

She grabs up the company picture, raging on --

			BREE (CONT'D)
	-- you perverted hypocrite square
	bastards.

			KLUTE
	OK.

Something in his inflection -- very slight --
cautions her. She falls silent as suddenly as she
began. Then cheerfully --

			BREE
	Gee I hope this doesn't make my
	cold any worse.

			KLUTE
	Tell me about Frank Ligourin.

			BREE
		(casual, pleasant)
	Mm? Oh, he was my old man. We broke
	up.

She wanders away toward a bureau. Her shirt seems
to itch her; she scratches her ribs. Then opens
drawer, takes out a different shirt as --

			KLUTE
	When?
		(beat)
	When did you and Ligourin break up?

She pulls off her shirt, unhooks her brassiere and
discards it, apparently quite unselfconscious.
Klute reacts; then, carefully maintaining his cool 
-

			KLUTE (CONT'D)
	Mind not doing that?

She turns to him in total innocence, holding the
shirt rather carelessly in front of her -- a new
attack.

			BREE
	What? This?

			KLUTE
	-- OK?

			BREE
		(ingenuously)
	I thought you could trick me for
	those tapes. Don't you get lonely
	in that little green room? Or let
	me get you someone; I have terrific
	friends, wild.

			KLUTE
	No thanks.

At this point -- or about this point -- Klute takes
note of something. A little above her. He grows
more watchful, but containing it carefully. We
don't understand the change in his manner -- or
even notice; she doesn't. In mock dismay --

			BREE
	Gee. I've had men pay two hundred
	dollars for me -- here, you're
	turning down a freebie.
		(pause)
	You can get a perfectly good
	dishwasher for that.

He has risen, is approaching her slowly -- carrying
his notes as if to check something. She is hopeful
again --

			BREE (CONT'D)
	You've changed your mind? You do
	want to play?

			KLUTE
		(quietly, steadily)
	I don't want you to look up.
	There's someone on the skylight.

She gasps, terrified -- immediately -- almost
beyond control. He taps the pencil on his notes.

			KLUTE (CONT'D)
	Easy -- pretend you're looking here-
		(more insistently)
	-- here.

She manages to take hold of a corner of the notes,
trembling. He goes on --

			KLUTE (CONT'D)
	Now I'm going to walk around -- you
	just keep talking, straight
	through, straight through.

He strolls away from her. His destination is the
area of the door -- out of view from the skylight --
from where he can head for the roof. But he doesn't
head that way directly -- first takes a turn in
another direction, his bearing casual. Prompting --

			KLUTE (CONT'D)
	Tell me about acting -- what are
	you doing tomorrow -- where do you
	go?

			BREE
		(manages, barely)
	I go on rounds.

			KLUTE
	Rounds, what are they? -- don't
	watch me, keep talking.

			BREE
	You go see agents -- or Equity
	calls, open casting calls. And ad
	agencies -- commercials -- you
	don't get work, you just go around.

Klute has strolled out of view from above --
instantly flattens himself against the wall, eases
the door open, about to slip and charge. As Bree
labors on --

			BREE (CONT'D)
	And they're always polite -- show
	people -- they say thank you very
	much. You lie there covered with
	blood, smiling, they say --

INT. LANDING AND LADDER TO ROOF - NIGHT

FOOTSTEPS across the roof above, as the watcher
discovers Klute's ruse. Klute opens the door --
climbs ladder to roof.

EXT. ROOFTOPS - NIGHT

-- Klute out, looking around --

EXT. ROOFTOPS: PAST KLUTE TO FLEEING FIGURE - NIGHT

The figure -- the man -- scissoring over the low
walls where one brownstone joins another. Klute
gives chase -- over ridges, past water tanks,
oddments of roof furniture --

EXT. SEVERAL ROOFTOPS BEYOND - NIGHT

The FIGURE races to a roof door disappearing into
abandoned building.

INT. STAIRWELL - ABANDONED BUILDING

CAMERA follows KLUTE as he cautiously makes his way
down the stairwell of the boarded up old
brownstone. He gets to the first floor. He can see
no exit in the building. He opens door that leads
to a narrow staircase into the cellar.

INT. CELLAR - ABANDONED BROWNSTONE

It is as black as a dungeon and as low. He lights a
match, but sees no one. There is a sound of
movement coming from the floor above, He runs up
the steps to the floor above and sees a very faint
light coming through one of the closed apartment
doors. Carefully takes out a gun and then with one
quick movement he breaks through the door.

INT. ABANDONED APARTMENT

The walls, ceiling, floors are entirely covered
with crudely painted psychedelic signs and sayings.
The room is lighted by some candies stuck in
bottles. Sitting on a blanket on the floor are
several teenaged boys and girls having a pot party.
They have obviously made a clubhouse for themselves
in the abandoned house. It is a MOOT POINT whether
they or KLUTE is more stunned at the sight that
faces them. He puts his gun away in embarrassment.
Again he has been made to feel like an awkward
peeping tom in this hidden world of the city.

INT. CELLAR - ABANDONED BUILDING

CAMERA wanders restlessly through the blackness and
stops at a pinpoint of light coming through a low 
door. CAMERA goes through opening into long narrow
furnace room with the ceiling so low that an
ordinary man could not stand up. We hear the sound
of breathing. CAMERA follows the sound through the
darkness revealing a sweaty man huddled in the
corner looking like some strange animal from a
painting by Bosch. It is Cable.

INT. BREE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Bree has wrapped herself in the quilt -- standing
up against a corner shivering, immobilized. We hear
KLUTE'S FOOTSTEPS DESCENDING -- she flinches -- he
enters.

			KLUTE
	I couldn't get him.

He sees her condition. Gently --

			KLUTE (CONT'D)
	It's all right.

He reaches to touch her -- she quails away from
him.

			BREE
	Well do you think it was him?

			KLUTE
	What do you think?

			BREE
	Can't you get him?

			KLUTE
	Maybe, if you tell me the things
	you haven't.

			BREE
		(pause)
	You asked me where I got that date
	with the dumper -- Frank sent me on
	it.

			KLUTE
	Do you know where he got the
	dumper?

			BREE
	He never told me.

			KLUTE
	Well, let's go down and ask him.

EXT. CENTRAL PARK WEST BUILDINGS - DAY

A shot catching the edge of CENTRAL PARK itself --
our first small view of greenery -- to the tall, be
limousined APARTMENT BUILDINGS OF C.P.W. The
FIGURES OF KLUTE, BREE walking upstreet, turning
under one of the canopies -- (Klute carries a
zipper book-case).

INT. APARTMENT HOUSE LOBBY - ON DOORMAN AT PHONE -
DAY

The DOORMAN hangs up the brass house-phone, smiles
and gestures them graciously into the (self
service) ELEVATOR. We see Klute -- without making
too much of it -- taking in the mirrors and marble
work.

INT. ELEVATOR (MOVING): KLUTE, BREE

She breaks the silence.

			BREE
	What did you expect? Frankie still
	has a good string, three girls.
	Figure three hundred a week from
	each.

			KLUTE
	Is that what you gave him?

Silence.

INT. LIGOURIN'S APARTMENT: ON DOOR - DAY

The BUZZER sounding, FRANK LIGOURIN crossing to
open the door for BREE, KLUTE. Cheerful,
hospitable, nice, unpretentious.

			FRANK
	Bree -- hi -- come in, come in.

The point of this one brief shot -- Bree's face --
in the instant after Frank has spoken and before
she enters, with Klute following. Her half-second
of hesitation. This is someone who gets to her
somehow -- probably always will.

WIDER LIGOURIN'S APT: THREESHOT - DAY

The apartment is as expected -- but not overdone; a
certain small amount of someone-lives-here litter.
A few, large but not very good, ABSTRACTIONS on the
walls. There is a large TABLE covered over with
photographs and mock-ups of magazine pages, a felt
board or easel with lettering samples -- Frank's
props really.

			BREE
	Frank -- Klute.

			FRANK
		(shakes hands)
	Hi. Come in.
		(leads them in, indicating
		table)
	I was just catching up some work --
	mocking up the photographs.
		(to Klute)
	I used to be a photographer myself 
	- Bree tell you? -- Before I got in
	the publishing.

			BREE
	Frank, he knows you're a pimp. He
	knows you were my pimp.

Short silence. Then with the tact of a gentleman
dealing with rude, difficult woman --

			FRANK
	Well Bree, maybe you'd rather --

He gestures gently to indicate outside. She nods
once. He escorts her in that direction, OUT the
door, closing it behind them.

INT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE LIGOURIN'S APARTMENT - DAY

He escorts her to the elevator, pushes the down
button for her. In silence so far. Then, quietly --
as one who knows the other's thoughts --

			FRANK
	How's it been?

She shrugs a shoulder at him, looks away. He goes
on in the same quiet voice.

			FRANK (CONT'D)
	With me Bree it's eternally the
	same. Toward you. I guess you know
	that.

			BREE
	Yeah Frank, I know that.

She yanks at the elevator doors. But the elevator's
not here yet. She turns away sharply into the door
marked "Stairway". He turns back to his apartment.

INT. LIGOURIN'S APARTMENT - DAY

Frank reenters, with the calm smile of troop
chaplain.

			FRANK
	I've always respected Bree.
		(then)
	I'd like to make something clear.

			KLUTE
	I've just got a few --

			FRANK
	I'd like to make something clear. I
	don't go after a girl; a girl comes
	to me. Her choice. Right?

He gestures Klute to one chair, sits in another,
waits calmly, attentively.

			KLUTE
	I'm looking for a man. Tom
	Grunemann.
		(no response, whatever)
	Bree thinks he may have been the
	dumper -- that call she had two
	years ago. She says you sent her on
	it.

			FRANK
	Two years ago? Sorry.

			KLUTE
	They tell me you use narcotics.
	Could I bring someone around to
	look at your arms?

			FRANK
	Look -- dad -- I may stand better
	with the cops than you.

Klute waits.

			FRANK (CONT'D)
	OK, a family matter. Between the
	girls. I had two other cows --
		(corrects himself)
	-- two other girls besides Bree.

			KLUTE
	She told me.

			FRANK
	OK and one of them  Jane McKenna --
	she blows a little jealous of Bree 
	- you know? -- Bree comes first?
	And evidently she knew the freak ---
	that he was a dumper -- she conned
	me into passing him to Bree, you
	know, so Bree'd get hurt. I didn't
	know. Till afterwards.

			KLUTE
	Why didn't you tell Bree,
	afterwards?

			FRANK
		(a little shocked)
	You don't tell them. That one of
	their own in-laws laid a dumper on
	them?
		(shakes head)
	Peace in the family.
		(pause)
	Beyond that, I don't know. All she
	wrote.

			KLUTE
	I'd like to talk with Jane McKenna.

			FRANK
		(smiles)
	Would I be telling you all this?
	She copped out long ago. She
	committed suicide Baxter.

INT. APARTMENT HOUSE LOBBY: BREE - DAY

BREE sits, looks with curiosity at housewives her
age -- bringing their children in from the park, as
if trying to imagine what their lives could be
like. KLUTE emerges from elevator.

EXT. STREET (TWO SHOT) - DAY

			BREE
	Did you like my friend Frankie?

			KLUTE
	No.

			BREE
	Didn't he tell you what you wanted?

			KLUTE
	It didn't go anywhere.
		(then)
	But that's not why --

			BREE
	About the dumper, didn't he tell
	you that?

			KLUTE
	It was Jane McKenna who sent you
	the dumper.

			BREE
		(coldly)
	Well -- she's dead.

At the corner he slows, starts unzipping his
bookcase as if indicating a change of route.

			BREE (CONT'D)
	I thought you were going back to
	the apartment.

			KLUTE
		(he shakes his head)
	You said you wanted these.

He hands over the TAPE-REELS.

			BREE
	Oh golly, oh just what I've always
	dreamed of, dirty phone calls.
		(then)
	How come?

			KLUTE
	You told me what you could. I guess
	I'm through with your part of it.

			BREE
		(grudgingly)
	Is there anything more I could --

			KLUTE
	I don't see anything, do you?

			BREE
	What're you gonna do next?

			KLUTE
	Try some other ways.
		(starts off)

			BREE
	What do I do meanwhile? -- wait for
	that clown to fall through the
	skylight on me?

			KLUTE
	And I don't think that was Tom.

			BREE
	You said it was!

			KLUTE
	No, I said what did you think.

			BREE
	Oh -- wait -- oh I get it. You said
	that just to keep me scared. So I'd
	tell you everything I -- oh clever;
	oh you smart, tricky hick.

			KLUTE
	Well --

			BREE
		(harshly)
	Hey, but did we get to you, Klute?
	A little?

			KLUTE
	Yeah, you got to me.

			BREE
	-- Us city folks? The sin, the
	glitter, the wickedness?

			KLUTE
	Oh. No. Not that way. I'd say it
	was more -- I don't know --
		(hunts the word)
	-- too bad? Pathetic?

			BREE
	Goodbye.

She turns smartly away, deposits the tapes in
passing in a litter box, departs. Klute looks after
her for a moment, then turns on his way. Then --

EXT. POV THROUGH LITTERBOX IN FOREGROUND TO POV OF
FIGURES OF KLUTE, BREE - DAY

This shot holds both in view for a moment, until
they both disappear separately in the traffic.
CAMERA moves in slightly on litterbox as a man's
hand comes into frame and removes the tapes.

INT. KLUTE'S APARTMENT: KLUTE - NIGHT

Klute, in pajama bottoms, lies in bed. A miserably
hot humid night. KNOCK at the door. He answers.
BREE stands in the doorway in bare feet.

			BREE
	What the hell do you mean,
	pathetic?

She walks in past him, sits down on the edge of his
bed.

			KLUTE
	It's kind of late.

			BREE
	It got lonely upstairs. There's
	someone on the roof.

He takes her seriously, starts to move.

			BREE (CONT'D)
	Oh, don't be a doo-doo.

			KLUTE
	Not much point to this, is there?

			BREE
		(placidly)
	Ezra, I'm lots better than you're
	used to. Tell me -- the other
	night, watching me with Mr. Faber --
	wasn't your tongue a little bit
	hanging out?

			KLUTE
	Mm.

			BREE
	So you're not too different from
	him, or the chap on the roof, or
	Tommy-baby --

He starts for the bed, as if to lift her onto her
feet. She takes off her robe and swings her legs
up, and under the sheet.

			BREE (CONT'D)
	Look, if you don't use it somebody
	else just will. And you've done
	your whole bit with me, your entire
	duty, and so now this is my thing.
	So enjoy, Mr. Faber would say,
	enjoy.

Under the sheet she unlooses her pajama bottoms,
kicks them away, starts unbuttoning the shirt.

			KLUTE
	Bree -- thanks -- I don't want to.

			BREE
	Oh don't be all hypocrite. Or do
	you really like other kicks? Is it
	more just having power over
	someone? -- so you don't really
	need to --

He tries to rebutton the pajama shirt. She catches
his hand, thrusts it underneath. In grief and anger
--

			BREE (CONT'D)
	Who the hell are you, buttoning me
	up?

					  QUICK
					  DISSOLVE --

UPSHOT, C.U.

Their bodies lock together descending toward camera
--

					  DISSOLVE --

DOWNSHOT, C.U. SAME ACTION

Her hands slide about his shoulders. She is
laughing softly, affectionately, mockingly --

			BREE
	I knew it, I knew it, a killer.

					  DISSOLVE --

C.U., HER FACE

-- triumphantly, contemptuously, orgiastically --

			BREE
	Oh lover -- oh you thrill me -- oh,
	it's beautiful -- oh yes, yes -- oh
	like that, like that, yes --

					  DISSOLVE --

FACES

Klute gasps deeply -- entering orgasm. As soon as
she hears it, judges it, she drops her hands from
his shoulders, stills her own movements, lies
utterly passive, smiling calmly, letting him finish
for himself. He can't stop -- cries out -- cries
out again, burying his face against her -- is done.

Then he slowly raises up, shuddering, looking down
at her. He knows what she's done to him, is
helpless to do anything back. He rolls slowly out
of the embrace of her legs and lies silently --
looking upward, very much as we saw him at start of
scene.

FAVORIVG BREE

She waits, still smiling, for a while. But she's
not done with him yet. She rolls to lie with her
upper body on his, trailing her fingers across his
face. Affectionately, as a good whore --

			BREE (CONT'D)
	What's the matter hon? You were
	great. Terrific. A tiger.

			KLUTE
	Thanks.

			BREE
	Well what're you down about? You
	mean because you didn't get me
	there?
		(pause, comfortingly)
	You can't expect that. I mean
	Frank, yes, he'd get me there all
	the time -- but never with a John.

She sits up, gropes her pajamas from the floor,
puts them on. In the same fond tone --

			BREE (CONT'D)
	And I'm sorry I can't stay and
	learn your special little games.
	And I certainly don't want you to
	feel bad about this -- losing your
	virtue all of a sudden -- because I
	sort of knew you would. As I said,
	like everyone, right?

She has the pajamas and robe on, pauses near the
door --

			BREE (CONT'D)
	Besides - you can always tell
	yourself you made me come
	downstairs. Ta, luv.

INT. THEATRE: READING SCENE - DAY

A WIDE SHOT. An open casting call in an Off
Broadway Theatre. Darkness, except for the work
light onstage. A small GROUP there -- onstage --
including the figure of BREE. Just offstage, the
figures of DIRECTOR (JANG) and a PRODUCER. And the
rest of the theatre, the audience section, dotted
with the heads of ACTORS, ACTRESSES waiting for
their turns. Bree's voice rings out across the
gloom.

			BREE
	-- Why?

CLOSER, ONSTAGE

The others stand rigid as statues, facing dead
front -- an experimental drama, clearly -- all
holding scripts, as Bree hastens from one to
another, fiercely, imploringly --

			BREE (CONT'D)
	Why -- please, why? -- Why lose,
	why look? Why hate and give and
	want and love? Why get, grieve, g --

			JANG
		(loudly, cheerfully)
	Thank you very much.

All break posture, start offstage, while Bree,
caught in mid-stride, clowns it a little.

			BREE
	-- gug -- gug --

-- then toward Jang, a bit succinctly, indicating
script --

			BREE (CONT'D)
	Why? -- I want to know what.

			JANG
		(laughs tolerantly)
	No, that was very good everybody.
	Do we have all your resumes?

			PRODUCER
		(from list)
	Booth -- Osman -- Zuff -- Anjeris
	Chaka.

WIDER, near stage front.

Bree shrugs, steps down off stage with the others.
Bree finds Jang's hand out for her script, smiles
wanly, turns it over, continues on out of scene.

She finds something - someone -- impeding her way.
Looks up.

PAST BREE TO KLUTE

Klute has edged out into the aisle to intercept
her.

EXT. THEATRE ENTRANCE: GREENWICH VILLAGE - DAY

Bree comes out, turns.

			KLUTE
	You asked if there was anything
	more you could help me with.

			BREE
	When?

Pause. Impasse.

			KLUTE
	I've checked the records of Jane
	McKenna's death -- I can't get
	anything special. But Frank
	Ligourin had another girl you said,
	besides McKenna and you.

			BREE
	Arlyn Page.

			KLUTE
	Did she and Jane McKenna know each
	other?

			BREE
	Frankie kept them in the same
	apartment: it cut his travel-time.

			KLUTE
	Then maybe Arlyn Page knew the
	Dumper too.

			BREE
	Arlyn had a very big habit - heroin
	- she's the one who started Frank.
	She's strung out now; you won't
	find her.

			KLUTE
	You could help me find her. You
	know the people.
		(as she turns away)
	I'll pay you a hundred dollars.

			BREE
	I can make that in a lunch break!
		(then)
	Look, Hiram, you're sure it isn't
	just me? -- you decided you liked
	it, after all, the other night;
	you'll hang around for seconds?

			KLUTE
	Don't worry.

She examines him -- shrugs -- turns, proceeds along
the sidewalk, Klute accompanying --

EXT. DISCOTHEQUE - NIGHT

In the small hours. The same place seen previously,
the gathering place. KLUTE, BREE arriving and
entering.

INT. DISCOTHEQUE - NIGHT

Klute and Bree head toward the rear. Her arrival
causes a little stir. She exchanges greetings with
one or two, is watched by others.

			BREE
	Joanie -- Mike, hi --
		(to another, a Negro girl)
	Hi Pat.

			PAT
		(giggles)
	Hey Bree honey, who you got?

			BREE
	A new daddy. I'n he cute?

Bree leads on to where --

PAST KLUTE, BREE TO TRINA

TRINA sits alone at a rear table -- anything but a
whore in appearance -- a quietly beautiful,
immaculately dressed woman of about thirty.

			BREE (CONT'D)
	Trina this is Klute. I told you
	about him.

			TRINA
	Oh yes Mr. Klute -- won't you both
	join me?
		(as they sit)
	And how do you like our fair city?
	There's so much here don't you
	think? The museums and the books
	and the foreign films -- Bree, have
	you seen the Godard film?

			BREE
	Uh uh.

			TRINA
	Oh you've got to. He does such fun
	things with imagery. And I've been
	reading The Fall --
		(to Klute, enunciating
		carefully)
	-- The Fall by Ahlbair Camoo --
	it's the same thing, you know the
	imagery --

			BREE
		(patiently)
	Trina honey, he just wants to find
	Arlyn Page.

Trina undergoes a change of demeanor. Flatly --

			TRINA
	Why? She's a junkie.

			BREE
		(prods gently)
	She was with you after she left
	Frank.

			TRINA
	Well she's not now.
		(then quavering --)
	I did everything for Arlyn. I loved
	Arlyn I took her right into my
	apartment, my own sweet apartment
	on First. But she wouldn't stay off
	it -- the junk -- and I wept and I
	pleaded and I held her in my arms -
	and she started taking things, my
	things, and selling them for horse.
	My clothes.
	We could've had everything
	together, everything -- and then
	the bitch sold
	my mink!

INT. ANOTHER LATE NIGHT SPOT - NIGHT

We dolly with KLUTE & BREE as they walk in front of
a row of tables. This night spot is totally black
except for a series of huge slide projections on
the wall in back of the tables. The slides, which
change every few seconds are elegant
representations of the beautiful people living the
good life as seen in such magazines as VOGUE, TOWN
& COUNTRY & HARPERS BAZAAR. The customers sitting
in the darkness below provide a direct contrast to
the pictures in back. The silhouette figures of
BREE & KLUTE stop at a table seating three people,
two call girls and a pimp. CAMERA moves in.

			FIRST GIRL
	Arlyn Page?

			SECOND GIRL
	You'll never catch up; she's
	grooved out.

			BREE
	Gil?

The pimp looks distrustfully at Klute who reassures
--

			KLUTE
	I'm not looking for her personally 
	- someone she might know about.

			PIMP
		(shrugs; to Bree)
	Try Janie Dale.

INT. JANIE DALE'S PENTHOUSE

It is a very small penthouse. KLUTE & BREE stand in
the small living room waiting for JANIE DALE. There
are two very casually dressed prostitutes sitting
around the living room. One sits at an upright
piano playing of all things STRANGERS IN THE NIGHT.
Another one sits on a couch talking to a Wall
Street Broker who is spending his lunch hour. KLUTE
finds himself staring down into a pile of
pornography magazines on the coffee table. BREE is
amused at his discomfort.
JANIE DALE, the madame, who has been on the phone
in the back, puts the receiver down and crosses to
the girl on the couch. JANIE looks and talks a bit
like Lauren Bacall.

			JANIE DALE
		(to girl on couch)
	It's old Mr. Clean from Cleveland.
	He wants to know when he can fly in
	and clean up the apartment and see
	you. I told him I have all the
	cleaning equipment and that he can
	come anytime, but it's up to you.

GIRL on couch rises.

			GIRL
	You know he wants us to be
	dominant.

			JANIE DALE
	Tell him that he'd better have his
	ass in here by one o'clock on
	Monday afternoon or you won't let
	him clean the bathroom floor, and
	tell him the price has gone up
	twenty bucks -- Old Dutcn
	Cleanser's not as cheap as it used
	to be.

She shrugs and turns to KLUTE & BREE.

			JANIE DALE (CONT'D)
	You wanted to know about Arlyn,
	honey? I had to let her go dear.
	Arlyn stopped being reliable.
		(explains to Klute)
	I deal with a high type client,
	business people, you understand? I
	can't send them someone that's all
	the time half zonked out.

			KLUTE
	Do you know where she went?

			JANIE DALE
	Try Momma Reese.

THIS IS A CHEAPER APARTIENT THAN JANIE DALE'S

The girls look cheaper, and the customers, rather
than Wall Street lawyers and brokers, look more
like out of town salesmen who stay at local motor
inns.

MOMMA REESE is older than JANIE DALE, heavier and
with no pretense at chic. She indicates that she
has not seen ARLYN in some time.

			MOMMA REESE
	Try Bill Azure. If you can find
	him.

INT. EIGHT AVENUE BAR - ABOUT 4 IN THE MORNING

This is a hangout where black and white pimps wait
to meet their whores after their night of street
walking. This streetwalker world is far removed
from the world of the call girl or the world of
Janie Dale. CAMERA pans past a group of pimps at
the bar taking bet on whose girls have made the
most money that night. CAMERA then goes on to
reveal KLUTE talking to another pimp (Azure). Azure
represents a clear step down from Frank Ligourin. 

We catch only part of their dialogue.

			AZURE
	-- a couple weeks then she'd drift
	off a couple of weeks, you know
	what I mean?

			KLUTE
	Have you heard from her recently?

			AZURE
	She liked me all right but she had
	what she liked better, you know
	what I mean?

We START FADE SOUND as Klute repeats --

			KLUTE
	Have you heard from her recently?

-- and CUT TO --

INT. LINGERIE SHOP: PROPRIETRESS, BREE, KLUTE

			PROPRIETRESS
	-- She'd come in and I'd let her
	have something. Why not; she'd been
	a good customer, a beautiful
	person, a beautiful beautiful
	person.

Again we fade sound a little before picture, then
CUT TO --

EXT. OUTSIDE ADULT MOVIE THEATER: KLUTE,
STREETWALKERS - DAY OR NIGHT

Outside Theatre or Bookstore - Peepshow; an 8th
Avenue establishment. SILENT ACTION this (or VOICES
UNDER). Klute confers with one girl who summons and
consults another. They seem to know of Arlyn --
haven't seen her recently -- refer him elsewhere --

EXT. APARTMENT HOUSE: MRS. VASEK, KLUTE - DAY

A shabby place in a shabby neighborhood. Mrs.
Vasek, the landlady, shifts barrels at the same
time that she barks at Klute, in heavy accent.

			MRS. VASEK
	The whore, yeah. I threw out.

			KLUTE
	Do you know where she went from
	here?

			MRS. VASEK
	Live like animals. Her and the man.
	Out.

			KLUTE
		(reacts)
	Was she living with a man?

We see Klute persisting - DISSOLVE

EXT. WIDE SHOT: SLUM STREET - DAY

We still HOLD WIDE to establish the scene. This is
a genuine slum. We see Bree, Klute move along
street. We see Bree drop back a little, Klute
waiting for her to catch up.

EXT. STREET: BREE, KLUTE

			KLUTE
	What's the matter?

			BREE
		(glances about)
	What the hell do you think's the
	matter.
		(then suggests)
	I could wait for you someplace.

			KLUTE
	If Arlyn Page is living with Tom
	Grunemann --

			BREE
		(eagerly)
	-- Then you don't need me.

			KLUTE
	But if it's someone else I do.

He starts on, simply assuming that she'll follow.
(There is a degree of acquaintanceship in their
manners now - a reluctant collaboration.)

			BREE
	You sure pull a lot of mileage out
	of a hundred dollars.

-- and follows on. He checks numbers, then crosses
street diagonally toward a half-framed house.

INT. NEWARK HOUSE - DAY

A downshot from second floor level toward the entry
way where KLUTE & BREE appear. KLUTE strikes a
match to inspect the names of tenants. He and Bree
climb through stench and litter to the second floor
-- a door. From somewhere near at hand come the
sounds of someone RETCHING. A square of wood has
been sawed out of the door itself, removing handle
and lock -- light sifts through. Klute hesitates,
decides against knocking, pushes in.

INT. ARLYN'S APARTMENT - DAY

The retching sounds are coming from the connecting
room. No one visible here. A very few barren pieces
of furniture. We hear ARLYN'S VOICE ask from the
next room --

			ARLYN (O.S.)
	Cappy?

ARLYN enters rather eagerly. She sees Klute first,
then Bree -- recognizes her -- retires flat against
a wall, holding one palm outwards to shield her
face. She is unbelievably gaunt. Inside one elbow,
looking rather like a birthmark, we see a lacework
of purple where her veins have pulped together.

			BREE
	Arlyn? Honey?
		(then)
	Look, it's all right.

From the connecting room a MAN'S VOICE (Berger's)
calling out hoarsely.

			BERGER (O.S.)
	Is it Cappy? Cappy? --

			BREE
	Arlyn, it's all right.

BERGER hastens, stumbles, into the doorframe
carrying a CAR-RADIO with wires dangling, speaks
before he sees them.

			BERGER
	Cappy, I got a radio!

He stops for an instant face-to-face with Klute.
Then turns, plunges out of view again. Arlyn breaks
after.

			ARLYN
	No --

We hear the MUMBLE and WHISPER of their voices from
the connecting room (as she reassures him). Bree
looks inquiringly at Klute (is that Grunemann?): he
shakes his head. Pause, then ARLYN reenters,
wrapping her fingers together timidly -- wanting
them out -- her only purpose.

			ARLYN (CONT'D)
	Bree -- honey - please, we're
	waiting for someone.

			BREE
	Arlyn, he just wanted to ask some
	questions -- something you could
	help us about.

			ARLYN
	Can't you see I'm strung out?
		(cries out)
	Please, we're waiting for it --
	he's got to have it!

			KLUTE
	We'll go. Just something you could
	tell us, first.

Arlyn seems to accept the bargain. He indicates to
Bree to proceed, stands away a little. Arlyn covers
her elbow with one hand. Bree manages as best she
can.

			BREE
	Honey, a couple of years ago, with
	Jane and Frankie? -- Jane sent me a
	Dumper --

			ARLYN
	Please, if he sees you, he won't
	come!

			BREE
	Arlyn, just tell me, did Jane have
	a dumper, one of her regular Johns?

			ARLYN
	What about him? Yes.

			BREE
	Did he come around often?

Klute hands Grunemann's picture to Bree: Bree shows
it to Arlyn. Arlyn inspects it, then uncertainly,
weakly --

			ARLYN
	No. He was an older man hon. The
	dumper was older.

			KLUTE
	Do you remember his name? What can
	you tell me about him?

We hear FOOTSTEPS - UNDER, DIMLY - mounting the
stairs. Bree notices them first, Klute persisting
with Arlyn --

			BERGER (O.S.)
		(shouts desperately)
	Arlyn, get them out.

			ARLYN
	Please, I am begging you.

			KLUTE
	It's important.

			ARLYN
	That's not the Dumper, that's all!
	He was an older man!

			KLUTE
	Can you give me any more
	description than that?

Arlyn catches the footsteps, dodges past him toward
the door, intending to reassure --

			ARLYN
	Cappy? --

-- as the pusher, CAPPY, steps in. All of this is
very quick, simultaneous, a confusion of voices.
CAPPY takes one look at Klute --

			ARLYN (CONT'D)
	It's all right, they're all right --

-- turns and runs.

			BERGER (O.S.)
	Cappy? -- Cappy?

Cappy's FOOTSTEPS race away down the stairs. BERGER
plunges out from the connecting room, still
carrying the car radio, shouting, pursuing --

			BERGER (CONT'D)
	Cappy it's all right! I got a radio
	-- don't run, don't --

We hear him STUMBLE AND FALL on the stairs outside,
the sound of body reeling down. Arlyn shrieks and
races after: Klute and Bree follow.

INT. HOUSE: LOWER HALL - DAY

We see BERGER lying at the foot of the stairs. As
Arlyn clatters down toward him, Berger sways up
onto his knees. His nose is bloodied, he cries.
Arlyn casts herself on her knees beside him, pulls
his face against her, croons to him, soothes and
tends him.

			ARLYN
	Oh baby -- no it's all right -- oh
	my baby baby baby --

Klute and Bree are only a half-step behind. Klute
offers to assist: Arlyn puts him away ferociously.

			ARLYN (CONT'D)
	Get out!
		(to Berger, again)
	Don't cry my baby; I'll find him,
	I'll get it. Baby, baby, don't cry.
		(to Klute savagely,
		incoherently)
	Leave us alone! Get out and get out
	and leave us alone!
		(to Berger)
	My honey, my baby, my baby --

We DISSOLVE TO --

INT. SUBWAY TRAIN: REFLECTION IN WINDOW OF BREE AND
KLUTE SITTING SIDE BY SIDE

CAMERA moves in closer so we only see reflection of
BREE looking at herself and at the world seeming to
speed by at an inhuman pace as the lights of the
tunnel zoom past her face. What she sees is the
figure of a woman with life screaming past her out
of control.

INT. SUBWAY

SUBWAY slows to a stop and a door opens. BREE sits
with KLUTE staring at the open door and then
without warning - gets up and runs off the train.
The door closes, leaving KLUTE locked in the train.

SUBWAY EXIT

SHOT of BREE's feet rushing up the stairs in
darkness and then quick cut to her face as she hits
the sunlight. She pauses for a moment - relieved to
be out of the darkness.

EXT. ROOFTOP OF BREE'S BROWNSTONE - NIGHT

CAMERA pans from night view of New York City to
KLUTE sitting on the rooftop alone as if trying to
comprehend all he has seen, the mystery of TOM
GRUNEMANN's disappearance in this world and the
mysteries of the behavior of BREE.

SKYLIGHT INTO BREE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Alongside of him the skylight of BREE's apartment
lights up. He looks through the skylight and sees
BREE enter her apartment. He can hear BREE talking
to somebody, and then he sees that she is talking
to FRANK LIGOURIN.

KLUTE watches through the skylight and hears bits
and pieces of the scene between BREE and FRANK. He
sees the same kind of symbiosis, the same kind of
parody of loving that he saw between ARLYN &
BERGER. As the scene becomes more intimate he
leaves.

INT. CABLE'S (CITY) OFFICE: ON KLUTE - DAY

The pristine, antiseptic, elegance off CABLE'S
office is in its own way as unreal and dehumanized
as the sexual underworld KLUTE has been exploring
with BREE, and KLUTE looks as out of place in the
one as he does in the other. TRASK sits beside
KLUTE facing CABLE who is impeccably dressed. He is
the total image of the executive in control.

			CABLE
	She wouldn't be reliable anyhow --
	a narcotics addict.

			KLUTE
	I believed her, Pete.

			TRASK
	He's right you know. Waiting for
	the pusher, she'd tell you
	anything.

			KLUTE
	I believed her: the Dumper was not
	Tom Grunemann.

			CABLE
	All right, suppose it wasn't Tom
	Grunemann; where does that get you?

			KLUTE
		(smiles ruefully)
	It's where it doesn't get me. I've
	got nothing left that connects to
	anything.

			CABLE
	Then, close the case.

			KLUTE
	I better keep looking.

			CABLE
	Where, how?

			KLUTE
		(the best he can offer)
	I could try Arlyn Page again. She
	saw much more of the Dumper than
	Bree Daniel.

			CABLE
	You just finished telling me she
	had nothing to offer. Not Tom, you
	said, the Dumper was clearly not
	Tom.

			KLUTE
	It's got to make sense some way.

CABLE'S SECRETARY appears for a moment tapping her
watch significantly.

			SECRETARY
	Mr. Cable -- they are meeting in
	Mr. Camara's office.

			CABLE
	Yes Evvie, thanks. Gentlemen, I'm
	sorry.

They rise, dismissed. He sorts a paper or two,
continues to Klute.

			CABLE (CONT'D)
	I'm flying back out to Pennsylvania
	Friday; I'll fill them in on
	things.

			KLUTE
	How is it back there?

			CABLE
	I think you're homesick.
		(reflects)
	I'll be out at my camp over the
	weekend. Nice right now, that touch
	of fall in the air, that skim of
	frost in the early mornings, very
	peaceful.
		(briskly again)
	John, I'll be back here again
	Thursday; I'll be in touch.
	Lieutenant, thank you.

KLUTE and TRASK depart.

CABLE closes the door and returns to his desk. He
pulls out a tape recorder from a drawer in his
desk, rewinds it and turns it on. We hear a
playback of the previous scene with KLUTE and
TRASK. He stands at the window listening with some
satisfaction; as if listening to what KLUTE
revealed keeps him in control of the situation.

EXT. WINDOW - CABLE'S OFFICE - DAY

The CAMERA pulls back from a CU of CABLE standing
at the window to a wide angle looking at CABLE
through the window. The window is 30 or 40 stories
high. The wide angle lens almost makes the building
look like it is standing on point, and CABLE, a man
suspended in space.

EXT. WIDE SHOT: DOCKS - DAY

A TUGBOAT has pulled in. The SOUND of its heavy
ENGINES, IDLING, runs underneath this entire
sequence. A POLICE VEHICLE or two has parked at the
head of the dock. We see several figures on the
rear deck of the tug, but it's not clear at this
distance what they're doing. The POLICE CAR WITH
KLUTE arrives. He dismounts and proceeds from dock
to tug-deck.

EXT. TUGBOAT DECK: GROUP - DAY

TRASK glances toward Klute as he arrives, but
doesn't greet him. His attention, like the others,
is directed downward and

off-scene (to the surface of the water actually,
just outboard of the tug). We see beside Trask TWO
Uniformed Cops (SUGARMAN and SPENCE) and DECKHANDS.
And we hear, along with the throbbing of the
engines, a stirring about of the water and a
peculiar third noise -- rather commingled with the
engines -- which we can't at first identify.

Klute joins the group, watches.

SPENCE brings into view, and shakes out, a giant
neoprene body bag. INSTRUCTIONS among the group AD
LIB, UNDER --

			TRASK
		(toward Klute)
	They were bringing a freighter down
	through Kill Van Kull; propellers
	washed it up on top.

SUGARMAN brings into view a METAL BASKET attached
with short ropes. He complains --

			SUGARMAN
	Why didn't you bring it up on deck?

			DECKHAND
	Would you bring it up on deck?

They slip the basket downward, out of frame (into
the water).

			DECKHAND (CONT'D)
		(to other)
	Mickey, get something. Get the eels
	off.

			SPENCE
		(calmly)
	They'll drop off theirselves when
	she comes out.

We CUT TO -

BERGER - DAY

We see Berger sitting huddled against the tugboat
cabin -- we haven't seen him before -- with his
hands bunched in front of his mouth. We identify
the noise which may have puzzled us before -- his
SOBBING.

DOWNSHOT: SURFAICE OF WATER, BASKET, BODY

We catch a fleeting glimpse of the body being
lifted, just before it breaks the surface of the
water.

FAVORING KLUTE

Klute looks on as EFFECTS trace the processing of
the body. SPENCE kneels down out of frame to slide
the bag around it. TRASK kneels down to make a
brief examination -- straightens again. To Klute --

			TRASK
	It'll go to the Examiner. But I
	don't see nothin that means nothin.

We MOVE WITH KLUTE as he turns and moves away a few
feet along deck. Here he stands. Then SUGARMAN
moves into view holding a clipboard. Routinely --

			SUGARMAN
	You help us with ID? We can't get
	nothin from him.

He indicates the direction of Berger. Klute
examines the clipboard data.

			KLUTE
	Arlyn Page was probably an alias.
	She went by the names Terry Arlyn
	and June Price. She may have been
	from Pittsburgh, someone told me. I
	can give you a list of people who
	knew her, if that would help to --

			SUGARMAN
	No point, thanks.

			KLUTE
	Is he claiming the body?

			SUGARMAN
	Uh uh, that'd mean funeral
	expenses.

He spits, moves back in the direction of the group;
Klute continues to stand. BERGER moves in his
direction. Brokenly --

			BERGER
	Man could you help me?

Klute doesn't understand his purport, reacts
instantly, sympathetically --

			KLUTE
	Yeah, what?

			BERGER
	You know, help me out. That's my
	baby there, dead. I got to get up.

Klute stares at him -- a quiet horror -- as Berger
insists --

			BERGER (CONT'D)
	Man you don't know what that does
	to me, my baby dead --

			KLUTE
	-- You've got to get up.

			BERGER
	Yeah.

Klute shoves a bill in his hand, turns away very
sharply, off the tugboat.

EXT. DOCK: KLUTE - DAY

Klute walks a longer distance this time, sits down
on one of the pilings of the dock. Watching him we
see what might be a profound awe and grief at all
these things -- but is, in fact, a good deal more.

EFFECTS, O.S. as Police Vehicles are loaded, driven
away and as tug toots, runs up engines, puts out
again.

TRASK moves into scene, sits on another piling,
looks at him speculatively. Silence. Then --

			TRASK
	That's how the other one died, you
	know. In the water.

			KLUTE
		(nods)
	I looked it up.

Then -- (we are assuming a complete understanding
here between Klute and Trask, non-verbal. What
Trask is asking, in effect, is: is this meaningful?
Do we both suspect the same man?)

			TRASK
	Well?

			KLUTE
	Yeah.

INT. BREE'S APARTMENT - DAY

It is late afternoon, but BREE is in her pajamas
curled up in her bed. There are some magazines
scattered around the bed and the television set is
on an old movie. There are cracker crumbs in the
bed and a cup of coffee and an open jar of peanut
butter with the knife sticking out of the jar on
the floor by the bed. It would seem that BREE has
spent most of the day in bed. She looks like an
unkempt child. The phone is ringing, but she does
not answer it. The phone no sooner stops than the
door bell rings. Reluctantly she gets out of bed
and goes to the door. She looks through the spy
hole and sees Klute's face. She undoes two locks
and an obviously new chain and bolt and opens the
door.

			BREE
	Well hello -- come on in.

He barely enters the room. His manner is cool and
remote.

			KLUTE
	I thought you ought to know, Arlyn
	Page is dead.

			BREE
	How?

			KLUTE
	The same as Jane McKenna.

			BREE
		(she betrays no reaction)
	Thanks for the jolly news. I
	thought maybe you'd left town by
	now. You kind of just disappeared.
	But you boys from Tuscarora have a
	habit of disappearing, don't you?

Klute looks around the disorderly room. The plants
in the windowsill have never been in worse shape.
They look as if she deliberately let them die of
thirst.

			KLUTE
	The next few weeks I would like to
	know where you are all the time.

			BREE
		(harshly)
	Why?

			KLUTE
	Just let me know when you are going
	out and where --

			BREE
	What if i go out on tricks - you
	wanna come along? You could sit and
	read the National Geographic.

			KLUTE
	How can you do it to yourself?

			BREE
		(coolly)
	I don't get you.

			KLUTE
	Ligourin: How could you do it?

			BREE
	I told you before, you wouldn't
	understand.

			KLUTE
	You're right, I don't understand.
	Explain it to me.
		(pause)
	You were scared. Arlyn Page, that
	scared you. Well it should; that's
	death.
	So what did you do, you ran
	straight for it, death. Ligourin
	kills women.

			BREE
	No.

			KLUTE
	No, no you're right, I'm sorry. He
	uses women; he lets them kill
	themselves. Is that how you want
	it?

			BREE
	Arlyn was a junkie; I'm not on
	junk!

			KLUTE
	No, you can find some other way.
		(beat)
	Explain it to me. Bree, show me any
	sense to --

			BREE
		(screams, incoherently)
	You get the Christ out! You dumb
	stupid bastard, you don't know
	anything, you square, you get out!
	I don't have to show you anything;
	you get out!

Klute goes.

INT. KLUTE'S APARTMENT - DAY

The empty apartment. He enters, switches a light on
(dusk), tosses aside jacket, bookcase, etc., then
sits down on the edge of his bed, with one foot
propped up on it.

FOOTSTEPS and A RAP at the door. He looks up, but
doesn't move, doesn't answer. BREE opens it,
enters. There are tear-tracks down her face, but
she's no longer crying. She tries to smile, tries
to explain her wants. Then with the unhurried,
graven composure of absolute desperation, she sits
on the edge of the bed.

			BREE
	If I asked you something, would you
	not laugh? -- asked you to look at
	something?

She pushes up her sleeve, points at tiny spot on
her arm - a freckle. He peers at it then at her
puzzledly.

			BREE (CONT'D)
		(apologetic)
	I thought it was maybe changing
	shape or something.

Klute looks at it again. Judiciously --

He shows her a spot or two on his own forearm. She
compares, is reassured. Embarrassedly, she tries to
smile. It is unsuccessful. She gets up and moves
about. Her manner in general is totally unguarded,
honest, undramatic, searching.

			BREE (CONT'D)
	Look -- I hate everybody; and I'm
	sorry for everybody; and I'm scared
	all the time.

He only grunts. A sound like 'OK' or 'all right' --
an invitation to leave. But she won't be driven
away. More urgently, helplessly:

			BREE (CONT'D)
	Look, I don't know either. It's
	like the only thing I know how to
	do -- I feel safe.

She's left the door a little ajar. He widens it for
her.

			KLUTE
	It's been a full day.

She pushes it out of his hand, pushes it shut. A
little more angrily:

			BREE
	Please.

			KLUTE
	We did this before.

			BREE
	No.
		(then)
	Well all right. But you want to and
	I want you to and we both know it
	and all right.

			KLUTE
		(evenly, slowly)
	I don't like getting splashed.

She accepts it decently. Tries to smile again,
nods.

			BREE
	OK ----- OK

She gestures, tries to find something more to say,
moves by degrees toward the door -- and would
succeed in leaving. But then:

			KLUTE
	--- Bree ---

Standing still, she starts again to cry -- and
bravely to keep the crying to herself. The child
bereft. He contends with himself, then crosses to
her, puts his arms around her, soothes her hair. A
completely asexual gesture at this point, a giving
of comfort. She clings, trembles, burrows. Then --
a SERIES OF DISSOLVES: The street outside, at
different times of night interposed, with Bree and
Klute at different times of love, As Follows:

EXT. THE STREET - DAY

The street as we saw it just previously... still
daylight... still somewhat populated, but drawing
toward dusk.

					  DISSOLVE:

INT. KLUTE'S APARTMENT: BPEE, KLUTE - NIGHT

Darkness now, or close to dark; the room heavily
shadowed. Bree and Klute sit together on the bed.
He still strokes her hair. He has pulled a blanket
around her shoulders. The transaction is still not
overtly sexual, but the tenderness is more overt.
He rubs his cheek against her forehead. She herself
is quieter, comforted. She begins to stir against
him.

					  DISSOLVE:

EXT. THE STREET - NIGHT

The street at night. Eleven o'clock, let's say.
Some lit windows; a single car moving past.

					  DISSOLVE:

EXT. THE STREET - NIGHT

All the windows dark this time. The deepest night,
just before the sky begins to lighten.

					  DISSOLVE:

INT. KLUTE'S APARTMENT: BREE, KLUTE - NIGHT

Klute is alseep -- more or less -- on his stomach.
Bree beside him lies awake. She trails her fingers
about his back. A rather tentative, exploratory
business. Her expression is more wondering than
anything else -- what does she have here, and can
she get used to it?

					  DISSOLVE:

EXT. THE STREET - DAY (DAWN)

The street's first stirrings. From not far off, the
sounds of trash cans being collected.

					  DISSOLVE:

INT. KLUTE'S APARTMENT: BREE, KLUTE - DAY (DAWN)

Klute half sits up in bed. Bree is fast asleep with
her head pillowed on his midsection. Some humor in
this shot: he wants to move but doesn't want to
wake her. At a point he risks it, reaches out for
something beside the bed. Her eyes open
immediately. He puts his hand on her face, trying
gently to press her back.

			KLUTE
	Go back to sleep.

But she takes his hand -- and retains it -- rolls
onto her back. Still relaxed, but a little more
separate, thoughtful -- a mixture of the Bree we've
seen before and the Bree we've glimpsed, the
possible Bree. She observes:

			BREE
	I'm still scared.
		(beat)
	I mean different but still.
		(frowns)
	Look, I made it very clear from the
	start, you're a yokel, you don't
	excite me, you don't even interest
	me, and so I only have one question
	which is what the hell are you
	doing in my bed?

			KLUTE
	My bed.

She grins, then starts to reach for him, still
receptive -- then feels another (and genuine) pang,
turns her head away sharply.

			BREE
	Oh!

He looks at her with concern, but only caresses
her. She manages to explain --

			BREE (CONT'D)
	I am scared. The things I do. The
	things I could do to you.

			KLUTE
	Mm.

			BREE
	No, not just 'mm'. You don't know
	what I --

He settles himself beside her, makes overtures. She
responds, but:

			BREE (CONT'D)
	Oh boy, say, you think you're
	pretty good.

			KLUTE
	Yup.

She pretends to bite -- they tussle -- she feels a
suddenly growing excitement, seizes him. Fiercely,
welcomingly, full out.

			BREE
	Oh --

And we cut directly to:

INT. SPANGLER'S OFFICE: BREE, SPANGLER - DAY

Bree standing, angry, antagonistic, demanding. In a
way -- a Bree-like way -- she's seized psychiatry
by the throat.

			BREE
	The son of a bitch seduced me!

She waits. Spangler says nothing.

			BREE (CONT'D)
	I know: it's ridiculous. But it's
	tearing me up and I don't know why.
	And look, all right, I came here
	didn't I? And if I have to, I'll
	keep coming here, the works, and
	talk about my mummy and my daddy
	and I'll even pay for it, but will
	you kindly for God's sakes say
	something?

			SPANGLER
		(smiles)
	I'd just be guessing.

			BREE
	Guess!

			SPANGLER
	Maybe this wasn't just a trick.
	Maybe you're in danger of real
	love, real involve --

			BREE
		(primly, distintly)
	I do not love him.

			SPANGLER
		(undeterred, suggests)
	You've spent your life avoiding
	this. You'll try hard to deny it;
	you're quite likely to destroy it.

					  WE CUT TO:

EXT. THE PLAZA OF LINCOLN CENTER

Sunlight is beaming on the graceful fountains and
elegant architecture.
Groups of cheerful tourists are admiring the
civilized monuments to man's search for culture.
CAMERA pans to ugly street across the way revealing
Klute approaching and entering a dingy warehouse
topped by an absurdly placed copy of the Statue of
Liberty. This is the municipal storehouse.

INT. MUNICIPAL STOREHOUSE - DAY

The abrupt cut from the bright sunlight leaves us
in almost total darkness as we follow KLUTE. We are
in a huge storeroom. As we grow accustomed to the
darkness we see bits and pieces of incongruous
objects scattered along Klute's path - old pieces
of furniture, lamps, piggy banks, etc. - the
remnants of the lives of the plundered, the
destroyed and the dispossessed. Some is stolen
property, some evidence for homicide cases, and
some the unclaimed possessions of the unclaimed
dead.

A CUSTODIAN -- an ancient retainer sort, a civil
servant, leads KLUTE into an old elevator cage.

INT. ELEVATOR

Klute and Custodian as elevator ascends; looking up
the elevator shaft through the open cage we see a
series of doors hanging over space seeming to lead
nowhere. The whole sequence has the feeling of a
dream of being lost in a black limbo.

Klute and Custodian leave elevator on higher floor
and walk down the long very low corridor past rows
of locked vault doors. The Custodian stops at one
and opens it. We are in a small dungeon-like room
filled with banks of files from floor to ceiling.
The Custodian counts to himself --

			CUSTODIAN
	Four -- five -- what number'd I
	say?

			KLUTE
	Four ninety-seven, Jane McKenna

Custodian finds it, unlocks for Klute's inspection.
Reaches for paper Klute's holding.

			CUSTODIAN
	-- And I keep the authorization,
	please.

			KLUTE
	I thought there'd be more.

Klute pokes through a small collection of personal
effects -- perhaps an ankle bracelet, rabbits foot,
faded snapshot of a child, some letters, pitiful
remnants of Jane McKenna's life. Klute closes the
drawer, and the front of the drawer is marked
McKENNA, JANE?

Over the visual material of Klute's trip through
the warehouse we hear WILD TRACK VOICE OVER bits
and pieces of BREE talking with the psychiatrist.

			BREE (V.O.)
	All right. Loneliness.
		(space)
	Well -- separated. From other
	people. Forgotten.
		(space)
	Well, as if I can be here, I can go
	through the motions, right? But the
	truth is, I don't belong.

			SPANGLER (V.O.)
		(prompts mildly)
	Don't belong?

			BREE (V.O.)
		(snappishly)
	Do you always have to repeat?

			SPANGLER (V.O.)
	Sorry.
		(then)

			BREE (V.O.)
	Well it's more than loneliness.
	Hate. People hating me -- and
	watching me and following and
	waiting to hurt me -- you know? I'm
	all screwed up.

			SPANGLER (V.O.)
	You think people hate you.

			BREE (V.O.)
	The truth is I hate them: they must
	hate me. All right, the money.
		(pause)
	All right, not the money. A kind of
	put-on.
	It gets things back together.
		(pause)
	Well let's say I'd go to one of
	these cattle-calls, a tryout. I
	mean before -- before I got this
	job -- and they'd always say thank
	you very much and i'd feel, you
	know, brought down. They didn't
	want me.

			SPANGLER (V.O.)
	Didn't want you.

			BREE (V.O.)
		(snaps)
	I said that.
		(resumes)
	Well, so you have a choice. You can
	either feel lonely -- you know, the
	hate -- or --
		(then more rapidly,
		plunging)
	So you take a call and go to a
	hotel room and there's some John
	you've never seen before, but he
	wants you. He must, he's paying for
	it.
		(beat)
	And usually they're nervous and
	that's all right, too, because
	you're not; you know this thing.
	And then for a while, boy, they
	really pay attention, you're all
	there is.
		(beat)
	And it's not real and you don't
	have to even like them -- you can
	even hate them, it's all right, it
	safe -- you know?

INT. PROJECTION ROOM - MISSING PERSONS BUREAU

On the left a portion of the original obscene
letter. On the right a series of comparison
documents -- beginning with a portion of a personal
letter. We hear TRASK'S, KLUTE'S VOICES OVER, and
occasionally cut to them as --

			TRASK'S VOICE
		(skipping, summarizing)
	All right, there's Tom Grunemann,
	you're right, different margins,
	different spacing absolutely,
	sloppy, right.

			KLUTE'S VOICE
	Mm.

			TRASK'S VOICE
	All right, try this next guy.

The right-hand document is switched.

KLUTE, TRASK

Klute reacts.

			TRASK
	Think this is our guy?

			KLUTE
	I don't know. It looks familiar to
	me.

			TRASK
	Thought it might. It's off an
	arrest report you typed two years
	ago. Man you wanted samples of
	everybody.

Then -- with subdued satisfaction, switching the
projector again.

			TRASK (CONT'D)
	Now the next cat. Mm?

SCREEN; DOCUMENTS

			TRASK'S VOICE
	Same margins top and sides. He does
	best with his middle fingers; you
	get fainter registration from
	outside keys like Q, A, L, P and
	like that. Next thing look around
	apostrophes, how he hits the space
	bar before --

KLUTE & TRASK - STARING AT PROJECTIONS

			KLUTE
	But what reason could he have? What
	possible reason?

			TRASK
	Unless he was involved with
	Grunemann's disappearance.

			KLUTE
	I knew Tom never wrote that letter.

			TRASK
	What else do you know?

			KLUTE
	I never could believe that Tom was
	a split personality. I never
	believed he was a Dumper; and I
	don't believe he disappeared of his
	own volition; and I don't believe
	he's alive.

			TRASK
	We have some very tentative
	circumstantial evidence of freeky
	behavior, but there's no evidence
	of murder - there's not even a
	body.

			KLUTE
	I don't believe Tom's alive.

As Klute talks he paces back and forth in the
darkness. He crosses in front of the lighted
screen; the letters projected on the screen ripple
over his face.

			KLUTE (CONT'D)
	But why? Why?

INT. MISSING PERSONS BUREAU

Klute and Trask are seen entering from the
Projection Room. In the background we see an old
black woman sitting in front of the picture file of
unidentified dead, carefully studying each picture.

In the foreground Klute sits down at a phone and
dials.

			KLUTE
	Yes, Mr. Cable's office, please.

CAMERA goes in close on Klute.

			CABLE'S VOICE
		(through telephone)
	John, how are you?

			KLUTE
	I'll be sending you on a report
	tonight.

			CABLE'S VOICE
	It's a beautiful day in Tuscarora -
	I don't envy you that humidity in
	the city.

			KLUTE
	It's not so bad.

There is a silence. Both Klute and Cable seem to be
waiting for one or the other to make the next move.

			KLUTE (CONT'D)
	Would you like to know what's in
	it? The report.

			CABLE'S VOICE
		(obligingly)
	What's in it?

			KLUTE
	I think Tom Grunemann's dead. I've
	been a lot of places - I've asked a
	lot of people. I've found no proof
	he's around. I've found no proof he
	was ever around.

			CABLE VOICE
	How do you go from that to the idea
	Tom's dead? Suicide you're
	suggesting? He killed himself?

			KLUTE
		(plodding, unemphatic)
	He could've been murdered.

			CABLE'S VOICE
	I'm sure the FBI and the Police
	explored that possibility.

			KLUTE
	No. They never did, really. But
	that's what I'm going to recommend.
	The next step. Unless something --

			CABLE'S VOICE
	Have you discussed this with them?

			KLUTE
	It's in the report.

			CABLE'S VOICE
	Do they have the report? Have you
	discussed it with them?

			KLUTE
	I wanted to give it to you first.

			CABLE'S VOICE
	All right. All right --
		(then)
	John, just sit tight will you? I'll
	read your report, I'll discuss it
	with the others. I'll be back next
	Thursday, we'll talk the whole
	thing over then. Nothing til
	Thursday, all right?

			KLUTE
	All right.

			CABLE'S VOICE
	Thank you. Goodbye, John.

			KLUTE
	Goodbye, Pete.

Klute hangs up.

			KLUTE (CONT'D)
	He was always at their house on
	holidays. Tom and Holly always had
	him, over on holidays. Tom felt
	sorry for him - his whole life was
	work. Tom felt sorry for him.

The old black lady motions to Trask who crosses to
her. She points to a picture in the file. She has
obviously found her missing person among the
photographs of the unidentified dead. She starts to
stand but then sits again, obviously shaken.
Klute crosses to her and gently helps her out of
the chair. He sees in her face the same sense of
loss he feels for his friend.

EXT. OUTDOOR MARKETS - EIGHT AVENUE - NIGHT

KLUTE & BREE

Bree examining and feeling fruit in some imitation
of a very shrewd and experienced housewife shopper.
She is obviously enjoying her sense of domesticity,
and Klute is amused by her enjoyment.

OUTDOOR NURSERY - EIGHT AVENUE - NEXT TO MARKET

The nursery is an absurdly cheerful spot of
greenery in the midst of the dirty chaos of the
avenue.

Klute and Bree wander through the plants.

			BREE
	I saw Mr. Faber.
		(beat)
	You remember Mr. Faber, don't you?

			KLUTE
		(controlledly)
	Yeah.

			BREE
	Is that all you have to say?

			KLUTE
	What am I supposed to say?

			BREE
	Well, I told him I wouldn't - uh -
	go there any more.
		(pause)
	I know it's tough to understand,
	but it wasn't easy. You see, he was
	nice to me. I mean, it wasn't just
	him. I got something out of it too
	I guess. Anyway, I told him I
	wouldn't go there anymore.

She is like a child awaiting praise from her
teacher. Klute says nothing. They continue walking
among the plants and he picks up a few that she had
admired.

			KLUTE
	Well, here's your gold star.

Considering his contempt for all the dead plant
life he has seen in her apartment in the past, she
is pleased by this act of belief in her.

			BREE
	Spangler says we have a
	relationship.

			KLUTE
	What?

			BREE
	You and I -- a relationship.

			KLUTE
	I was wondering what that was.

			BREE
		(beat)
	Hell there's nothing so mysterious
	about the square life.

EXT. BROWNSTONE ENTRYWAY - NIGHT

Bree, Klute approach unhurriedly along the
sidewalk. She is holding his arm, HUMS to herself,
enjoys the evening.

INT. STAIRWALL - NIGHT

We follow them up.

INT. ANGLE INTO BREE APARTMENT - NIGHT

The apartment is a shambles -- furniture
overturned, decorations ripped from the wall,
bedding scattered and ripped.

INT. BREE APARTMENT - NIGHT

Klute jettisons the grocery bags, thrusts himself
inside, looks quickly about, finds no one. Bree
follows more slowly, whispering:

			BREE
	Oh Jesus. Oh Jesus.

			KLUTE
	Don't touch anything.

He moves quickly to the rear of the apartment,
looks at the rear window which has been broken
inward in a litter of glass -- then returns to the
table at the front of the apartment; his folders.
Bree cracks wise, unsteadily.

			BREE
	You suppose he's a married fella?

ANGLE TO TABLE; FOLDERS

The contents of the folders have been spilled
across the table and -- we ZOOM IN -- the
photographs of Tom Grunemann sorted out and ripped
apart, Even the COMPANY PICNIC photograph has been
painstakingly torn, specifically to destroy the
image of Grunemann in the front row.

KLUTE

He stands, looking down, taking no notice as --

			BREE
	He got in my clothing!

Then a moment later, she cries out again, more
sharply:

			BREE (CONT'D)
	Oh. Oh.

He turns quickly. She is holding out, at arms
length, a pair of her underpants. With a disgust so
extreme she can only laugh.

			BREE (CONT'D)
	Oh look what he did in them.

			KLUTE
	Drop it.

She doesn't respond. He seizes her arm, shakes the
garment back onto the floor. She starts to gag,
slaps her hand over her mouth, starts for the
bathroom. Klute yanks her back.

			KLUTE (CONT'D)
	Stay out of there.

She twists free of his hands, backs away. The same
elementary terror we've seen before.

			KLUTE (CONT'D)
	Listen to me: It's all right. I've
	been expecting something.

			BREE
		(full out, vengefully)
	My God, I thought it was over. And
	here I am, daddy, right back at the
	start.

			KLUTE
	Bree --

			BREE
	Right back at the start, right?

			KLUTE
	Go down in my room.

			BREE
	You said it was over, right? You
	said not to worry any more, all
	over, right?

She's broken for the door; it's questionable that
she's even heard him. He hasn't time to pursue --
shouts again --

			KLUTE
	Go down in my room and wait.

Then he turns back into the apartment.

INT. BREE'S APARTMENT - DAY

A DOWNSHOT TO UNDERPANTS (as if from Klute's POV,
connecting directly to the previous shot) -- then a
FLASHBULB goes off and a hand and pair of tongs
enter frame and flip the garment into a collecting
box and we widen to reveal that it's now daylight
and the scene has been invaded by POLICE
TECHNICIANS. One is a photographer; another, a
fingerprint man, is spraying surfaces with a can of
fixative. In the foreground Klute and Trask are
talking with Ross, the FBI man. Ross is looking
through a dossier on Cable that Klute has compiled.
Over the following conversation we show CLOSEUPS of
material in the dossier. It contains photographs of
Cable and his life from childhood to the present -
including pictures of him with his mother and
father - she a very dominant looking lady and he a
very passive looking man;
also graduation pictures and pictures with his
former wife taken when he was still a very young
man. They are the personal images of a life time.

			ROSS
		(to Klute)
	But if Cable killed Grunemann why
	would he get you hired to look for
	Grunemann?

			KLUTE
	Because he knew I couldn't leave
	the case alone. And this way at
	least he'd keep track of it. And
	me.

			ROSS
	What about Grunemann's letters to
	the girl, everything like that?

			TRASK
	Cable's letters, Cable's phone
	calls. Cable's everything else.
	He's been a Dumper a long time. He
	just passed off his own peculiar
	habits on the other man -- it kept
	things goin'.

			ROSS
	OK, pretend I believe you. Tell me
	how you get an indictment.

			TRASK
	Can't. Yet. Oh we got everythin'
	else: first rate evidence Cable
	typed those dumper letters to Bree
	Daniel. And Jane McKenna: Klute
	found a couple in her personal
	remains. We got dates of Cable's
	trips here coincidin' with phone
	calls to Bree Daniel, also the
	dates of death of McKenna and Page.
	We got some hints of his personal
	history. His father, unsuccessful
	salesman, committed suicide when he
	was 13. His mother pinned all her
	hopes on her son. He won a national
	science youth award at the age of
	eight. They had no money, but she
	hired special tutors for him in the
	summer time. She saw a good thing.
	He graduated from high school at 14
	-- college at 16 -- no friends --
	The kids in his class thought of
	him as a freak. He got his Ph.D. at
	18 -- married at age 21 to his then
	employer's daughter. The marriage
	lasted 4 weeks. Her father had it
	annulled. She says he was impotent.
	World War II he got in bad trouble
	about a German girl, no details. We
	think we know why he killed
	Grunemann -- he found out Cable was
	a dumper; Cable couldn't take that.
	We think we know why he killed
	McKenna -- she wanted to blackmail
	him for it. All fine. But we got no
	body, no direct witnesses, we can't
	go any-damn-where.

			KLUTE
	That's the reason i told him we had
	no evidence Tom was still alive. We
	wanted to shake him into another
	phone call or another letter. It
	didn't work out just that way.

The Technicians, meanwhile have packed to depart.
The first Technician scoops the torn up photographs
into another collecting box. Trask retrieves the
company outing photograph.

			TRASK
	Gov, want to leave me that one. How
	come he got to play with this one,
	anyway.

			KLUTE
	I left them here. I was doing some
	work here.

Trask eyes Klute for a moment, as if a querying his
relationship with Bree. Klute is clearly
unresponsive. Trask resumes.

			TRASK
	It's damn lucky you didn't have the
	dossier on Cable here.

			KLUTE
	Nobody's seen that.

			TRASK
	If we get anything from the lab,
	we'll have it by noon. And just
	think -- all he really had to do
	was write us a letter.

			ROSS
	Sounds to me you better shake him
	again. Put him in a spot he has to
	do something more -- but this time
	give him a time and a place to do
	it.

			KLUTE
	He called this morning from
	Tuscarora. Asked me to meet him at
	3:00 at the downtown heliport. He's
	on his way to Chicago.

			TRASK
	He sure chalks up a lot of flight
	time.

Klute starts gathering his papers we CUT TO --

INT. STAIRWELL: BREE - DAY

Bree coming up the stairs meets the Technicians
coming down -- stands aside to let them pass --
starts up again and comes face to face with Klute.
On her part we see a wish to be reconciled -- a
shyness mixed with defiance -- but Klute's manner
is arduous. She smiles nervously, asks --

			BREE
	Ah, Schmendrick -- what's the scam?

			KLUTE
	Those were police laboratory
	people, they've been over the
	apartment.

			BREE
		(mock delight)
	Oh zippidy-doo, they'll find my
	fingerprints.
		(then)
	Can I go in? I need some stuff.

He nods; she starts by. Then --

			KLUTE
	Where'd you spend last night?

			BREE
	With Trina.

			KLUTE
	I called Trina.

			BREE
	Maybe I wasn't there when you
	called.

			KLUTE
	Bree, what's actually happened? It
	wasn't that bad.

			BREE
		(cuts in harshly)
	How do you know how bad it was?

			KLUTE
	Why couldn't you stay here with me?

			BREE
	Because I didn't want to be
	touched! I didn't think you'd get
	that!

Pause. Then, evenly --

			KLUTE
	Trask wants to talk with you.

She starts on, then turns back toward him -- rather
pleadingly --

			BREE
	Hey -- look officer -- I can
	explain everything. It was just --
	you know, everything all of a --

			KLUTE
	Trask wants to talk with you.

She continues on up; Klute continues down.

INT. BREE'S APARTMENT - DAY

Entering without greeting Trask (his manner is not
uncivil but simply neutral, unreacting, Cop-like)
she quickly gathers up a few properties, a change
of shoes.

			TRASK
	Miss Daniel, be sensible, you find
	another place till we get things
	cleaned up.

			BREE
		(brightly)
	Oh well that shouldn't take you
	more than another, oh, two and a
	half or three years, should it?

			TRASK
	A few more days. We know who did
	this.

			BREE
	So do I.

			TRASK
	No, not Grunemann. He's dead. The
	man that killed him -- also prob'ly
	Jane McKenna, also Arlyn Page.

She spins around -- mute -- terrified.

			BREE
		(manages)
	Arlyn and Jane commited suicide. He
	said they commited suicide.

			TRASK
	Now there's a picture I'd like you
	to --

			BREE
	You said someone killed them, you
	said you know who, you said that.

			TRASK
	Well we're pretty --

			BREE
	Why isn't he locked up?

			TRASK
	We don't want to just lock him up;
	we want a conviction, we wanted him
	to do something more.

			BREE
	Is that why Klute didn't tell me?

			TRASK
	I guess he figured it was better.

			BREE
	What was better? I made better
	bait?

			TRASK
	No, that's not --

			BREE
	Is that what he set me up for?
	Everything he's told me from the
	beginning? -- don't worry, don't --

			TRASK
		(coldly)
	From the beginning I don't know why
	the hell he's messin with you. If
	he was me he'd know better. If he
	was even a city boy he'd know
	better. You're a whore Miss Daniel,
	that's the truth of it, right? Now
	somethin I'd like you to look at.

			BREE
	I don't have to look at anything. I
	don't have --

			TRASK
	Here please.

He coerces her to the table and unrolls the Company
outing picture. (We see the rip extending up
through the image of Tom Grunemann in the front
row.)

			BREE
	Oh no.

			TRASK
	Like for you to look for the man.

			BREE
	Grunemann? I've looked at him a --

Trask has clamped his thumb over the torn image of
Grunemann, indicates with the other hand --

			TRASK
	No. Not Grunemann. The Dumper. Just
	look around -- I said look for the
	Dumper.

We see her comply -- her eyes moving over the rows
of faces. Then we see her stiffen, hear her gasp --

			BREE
	Oh! --

-- and WE CUT TO --

INT. DOWNTOWN HELIPORT - DAY

Cable welcomes Klute. His outer manner is warm,
voluble, congratulatory --

			CABLE
	Sorry we had to meet here. But I'm
	pressed for time.

			KLUTE
	Well there's a couple --

			CABLE
	I read your report. I had to go
	along with it -- the idea of this
	being a wild goose chase, Tom being
	nowhere around --

			KLUTE
	Well as a matter of --

			CABLE
	I've been up country, you know my
	summer place, my camp. I don't even
	have a telephone there. This
	morning they sent a messenger out,
	that you'd been trying to call me.

			KLUTE
	Yeah.

			CABLE
	I'm on my way to Chicago. Very
	important meeting tonight. Well --
	any new developments?

			KLUTE
	Yeah, two things Pete, that --

			CABLE
	You said Trask was arranging
	laboratory work. Police laboratory.
	Anything from that?

			KLUTE
	Yeah. It wasn't Tom.

			CABLE
	I'm sorry. I don't understand.

			KLUTE
	It wasn't Tom that broke in the
	room.

			CABLE
	It has to be Tom. You said he
	ripped up his own pictures, he --

			KLUTE
	Not Tom. Whoever it was left a kind
	of souvenir, I told you, in her
	clothing. Semen. The laboratory got
	a blood group reading from that.
	The man was blood type 0; Tom was
	an AB.

			CABLE
		(slowly)
	Some mistake perhaps that --

			KLUTE
	No. No mistake Pete. It doesn't
	prove who it was -- but proves it
	wasn't Tom.

			CABLE
	You must be discouraged.

			KLUTE
		(prosaically)
	Not too bad. This brings back that
	Dumper in the picture.

			CABLE
	That who?

			KLUTE
	Dumper, the man Bree Daniel
	mentioned and Arlyn Page knew and
	Jane McKenna knew.

			CABLE
	You said he was no possible
	connection with Tom. The Page girl
	told you that, not Tom.

			KLUTE
	Someone's been doing all these
	things.

			CABLE
	You were hired to look for Tom, not
	someone.

			KLUTE
	Pete, I've got a chance to buy Jane
	McKenna's black book.

			CABLE
	What?

			KLUTE
	Call-girls generally keep a book,
	you know, a list of their clients.
	Sometimes, if a girl retires,
	she'll even sell it worth good
	money. Jane McKenna had a black
	book; when she died it was stolen.
	I've been after it a long time.

			CABLE
	You were hired to look for Tom.

			KLUTE
	I'm meeting a man tomorrow night.
	He wants to meet me on East-River
	Drive -- he wants five hundred
	dollars for the book. Can you get
	that for me Pete?

Sometime -- right along about now -- it privately
comes to Cable that Klute may know everything and
that he, Cable, may be being trapped.

			CABLE
	I can't follow you.

			KLUTE
	Will the Company put up five
	hundred dollars to get Jane
	McKenna's list of clients?

			CABLE
	No. It's ridiculous. This has
	nothing to do with Tom Grunemann.

			KLUTE
		(shrugs, stolidly)
	It probably has the Dumper's name.
	It might give us some kind of new
	lead.
		(beat)
	I want a look at it anyhow.

			CABLE
	Klute, the Company's interest is
	Tom Grunemann. Solely and
	exclusively. You say you can't find
	Tom; all right, I'll see that
	you're paid off; the case is
	closed.

			KLUTE
	All right, but I'm going to see
	that list.

HELICOPTER FLIGHT is announced over loud speaker
and Cable and Klute walk onto field.

EXT. HELICOPTER FIELD

People are boarding helicopter.

			CABLE
	Why would they deal with you? You
	don't know these people.

Klute is momentarily at a loss -- not a question
he'd prepared for -- improvises.

			KLUTE
	No, but Bree does. She's
	negotiating for me. Bree Daniel.

Cable takes an instant to compute the thing. Then --

			CABLE
	I can talk it over; possibly I can
	get the money. When are you meeting
	the man?

			KLUTE
	Tomorrow evening, nine. East River
	Drive and 73rd Street.

			CABLE
	Suppose I meet you there a half
	hour before.

			KLUTE
	Just send me a money order.

			CABLE
	No, I'd -- like to be in on it.

ATTENDANT comes over to motion Cable onto the
helicopter.

Klute smiles awkwardly, raises his hand in a
goodbye gesture.

			KLUTE
	Well --

			CABLE
	Tomorrow. See you tomorrow night.

INT. HELICOPTER

Cable sits down next to window. The helicopter
begins to rise. CAMERA goes into a medium close
shot of Cable against the helicopter window. The
helicopter ascends in front of a very tall office
building made up of endless glass squares. A
telephoto lens brings the glass squares of the
building directly against Cable's head and
shoulders giving us the feeling that Cable is
almost levitating by himself. As one floor after
another disappears behind him we see an almost
manic exhultation in Cable's face; as if he is on
top of things once more.

EXT. STREET OUTSIDE BROWNSTONE - DAY

We bring Klute along street, and into the
Brownstone.

INT. STAIRWELL - DAY

Klute climbs the stairs to Bree's apartment --
knocks. He waits. No answer. He calls once --

			KLUTE
	Bree?

No answer. He starts downstairs again -- then turns
back, unlocks the door himself, enters.

INT. BREE'S APARTMENT - DAY

The room is still disordered. Bree and Frank
Ligourin look at him, silently. Bree has been
assembling armfuls of dresses to carry away with
her. Frank sits nearby in a chair. Klute smiles a
little -- almost apologetically.

			KLUTE
	I'm always getting surprises.

Bree doesn't answer. She sets the armload of
dresses over the back of a chair, moves aside to
get others. Frank smiles cautiously, ruefully. Then
--

			KLUTE (CONT'D)
	I don't want you to do this.

He still doesn't extract an answer. She returns
with other dresses.

			KLUTE (CONT'D)
	Please. I said I don't want you to
	do this.

			BREE
		(tight, small)
	Trask said I should move. Let's not
	make a thing of it.

He continues to look at her; she continues to
gather possessions. Then trying to smile, to deal
with it casually --

			BREE (CONT'D)
	Look, too much is going on here.
	I'm moving in with another girl,
	that's all. Just for a while.

			FRANK
		(helpfully)
	That's right. This other girl's got
	a very big apartment, big, plenty
	of room.
		(then)
	Look, it's not necessarily how it
	looks, right? It's --

He thinks better of continuing. Klute looks from
him back to Bree. He speaks gravely, spacing his
words -- unable to speak any faster.

			KLUTE
	No. Please. Not with this son of a
	bitch.

Frank rises, both nervous and offended -- but
dealing with Klute as between civilized men.
Smiling.

			FRANK
	Klute, let's handle it like
	grownups? I mean we're all grown up
	now, right?
		(ventures forward)
	-- we all respect each other, you
	know what I mean? -- I respect you,
	Bree respects you -- you could say,
	it just didn't work out between you
	and she. But you got to respect her
	too -- you know, her best
	interests, best for her --

Klute hits him, pursues, recovers, and starts to
beat him. BLOOD thickly descends the side of
Frank's face, as he struggles away. Bree is
screaming. Bree grabs at him from behind. He
thrusts her off. But it allows Frank to break away
through the still-open door. Klute pursues.

INT. LANDING AT DOOR - DAY

Frank clatters down a stairs as Klute arrives in
the doorframe, and as Bree, behind Klute, screams --

			BREE
	No!

Klute is restrained -- restrains himself. Frank has
faced around on the stairs, still bleeding
extravagantly from his torn scalp. Earnestly --

			FRANK
	Hey, I'm gonna get you dropped.

Klute start's out after him -- Frank vaults away
down the stairs -- we hear him stumbling and
running -- Klute faces sharply around into the
apartment.

INT. BREE'S APARTMENT - DAY

PAST KLUTE TO BREE. She is running away from him
again, to a corner of the apartment, fumbling at a
sewing basket. He starts in, after her.

			KLUTE
		(indistinctly)
	Please --

TWO SHOT

She swings about as he overtakes her, holding a
pair of scissors -- simply and transcendently
terrified. She strikes at him, slashing his
forearm. He and she stand in absolute silence. He
looks down at the stain of blood spreading through
the fabric of his jacket sleeve. Then he turns out
of the room and down the stairs.

EXT. BREE'S BROWNSTONE - DAY

Klute comes out of door -- goes down steps to his
own apartment. A passerby stops him for directions
and doesn't seem to notice the blood on his sleeve.
Klute goes into his apartment.

INT. BREE'S APARTMENT: BREE - DAY

Bree is in the middle of dialing the phone. Her
hands are shaking; she misdials -- holds down the
receiver for a moment then starts again.

INT. KLUTE'S APARTMENT: KLUTE - DAY

Klute stands in silence for a moment or two -- then
takes rather more note of his forearm. (Not
urgently but practically; it behooves him to stop
bleeding.) He turns toward the bathroom, pulling
his jacket off with the other hand.

INT. BREE'S APARTMENT: BREE - DAY

Bree speaks to the phone, trying to make a simple
point, trying to keep her voice even.

			BREE
	-- until he gets back.
		(beat)
	Yes I heard you, I understand that.
	I said I'm going to come over, I'll
	wait until he gets back.

She hangs up before the other party can object in
detail -- takes up her purse and goes out, not even
closing the door behind her.

INT. KLUTE'S APARTMENT: BATHROOM: KLUTE - DAY

Klute has knotted a hand-towel around his forearm,
now uses teeth and fingers to pull the ends tight.
Then -- intending to clean up -- he takes up a
washcloth, reaches for the faucet --

EXT. BREE'S BROWNSTONE - DAY

Bree comes out of door - goes down steps -
hesitates in front of Klute's apartment struggling
with the question of whether to knock. CAMERA pulls
back to reveal we are watching her through the
windshield of a car in the parking lot across the
street. CAMERA pulls back further to reveal the
back of Cable's head as he sits in the car watching
her. Bree starts to knock on Klute's door but stops
herself and walks down the street. Cable's head
moves out of the shot. We hear the sound of the car
door opening and closing. Through the windshield we
see Cable cross in front of the car and start to
follow Bree down the street.

INT. KLUTE'S APARTMENT: BATHRO0M: KLUTE - DAY

Klute finishes mopping up. SOUND OF TELEPHONE. He
turns back out of the bathroom and answers it.

			KLUTE
	Hello?
		(listens, then soberly - )
	Trask, I don't get that.

EXT. STREET: BREE - DAY

Bree is about a quarter block away from the
Brownstone now, hurrying. She waves in the
direction of a cab, misses it, continues on. We CUT
TO --

EXT. STREET: CABLE - DAY

Cable stands looking after her, hesitates over
choice of action, decides to follow.

EXT. STREET: FIGURES: PAST BREE TO CABLE - DAY

We establish the distance between them -- Cable 100
or so feet behind her, unnoticed by her,
maintaining about the same pace, not -- at this
point -- trying to overtake (perhaps waiting for
less populated surroundings) We CUT BACK TO --

INT. KLUTE'S APARTMENT: KLUTE - DAY

Klute continues his phone conversation, short
spoken.

			KLUTE
	Who told you, his secretary?
		(listens)
	Has someone checked his hotel? He
	always stays at the --
		(then)
	I'll look around, I'll call you
	back.

He hangs up. First he checks out the windows (but -
if we want to be accurate - from mid room, without
directly approaching the windows themselves). Then
he secures a pistol from his jacket (and folds the
jacket itself over his arm to conceal it, as a
matter of public decorum), and goes on out.

INT. STAIRWELL: KLUTE - DAY

Klute's manner, over the next few minutes, exhibits
an absolute, untheatrical, care and competence. A
man -- Cable -- may in fact be hiding here
somewhere to kill him. He sets about checking the
likely places -- first of all the lower hallway,
then the stairwell itself, moving steadily
unalarmedly up.

At the top he notes -- but still without main
concern that Bree's door is open. He calls ahead --

			KLUTE
	Bree --

INT. BREE'S APARTMENT: KLUTE - DAY

He enters, puzzles, starts checking around (quite
thoroughly; she might be hiding from him). We CUT
BACK TO --

EXT. STREETS: BREE; FIGURE OF CABLE - DAY

Bree moves past CONSTRUCTION WORK, through one of
those temporary pedestrian passageways. Behind her,
nearer than before we see the FIGURE OF CABLE.

INT. STAIRWELL - DAY

Klute comes quickly back downstairs, back into his
room, takes up the phone. Through the still-open
door we watch him begin dialing -- then CUT TO --

INT. SPANGLER'S (OUTER) OFFICE - DAY

Bree sits isolated on the waiting-room couch. She
may have been here for fifteen minutes -- or an
hour. She turns the pages of a magazine -- one
handed, without even lifting it from the coffee
table, with an absolute lack of interest, a
mechanical gesture.

We hear FOOTSTEPS approaching directly toward where
we are watching Bree sit.

			LELA (O.S.)
	Mrs. Daniel --

WIDER - TWO SHOT

Bree looks up in a kind of frozen terror, as the
Secretary smiles nicely -- lovingly down at her.

			LELA
	-- I have to close up now. Leave
	your name and number with his
	message service, Mrs. Daniel, and
	why don't you just go home and wait
	until he --

			BREE
	No.

			LELA
	Well I have to close up now.

			BREE
	Look -- could I use your phone?

			LELA
	Yes indeed.

			BREE
	Look. I almost killed my -- I
	almost killed someone.

			LELA
		(the same tone,
		completely)
	Well I'm certain Doctor Spangler
	will want to talk with you; excuse
	me.

Bree moves to the desk and telephone. But we move
with the Secretary as she moves into Spangler's
inner office and switches out the lights
(establishing TIME CHANGE: dusk now) and as we
hear, O.S., the sound of DIALING and BREE'S VOICE --

			BREE (O.S.)
	Is Mr. Faber there?
		(beat)
	Mr. Faber Senior.

INT. GARMENT BUILDING: FABER'S OFFICE: FABER - DAY
(NIGHT)

Mr. Faber's phone buzzes; he picks it up.

			FABER
	Yes?
		(then, glancing about)
	Bree?

INT. SPANGLER (OUTER) OFFICE: BREE ON PHONE - DAY
(NIGHT)

			BREE
		(haltingly)
	-- I'm -- I just have to talk to
	someone. I'm just a little way
	across town --

FABER, ON PHONE (OFFICE)

			FABER
	Yes - yes dear, yes -- maybe half
	an hour, sure, yes.

He hangs up. An ancient stirring, a kind of
triumph. He glances about, then tightens his tie.
Then it comes to him, after all -- he takes note of
himself -- he leans forward against his desk and
rubs his forehead with old bony fingers. We CUT TO 
-

INT. KLUTE'S APARTMENT - DAY (NIGHT)

KLUTE on phone.

			KLUTE
	Trina, will you call me if you hear
	from, her? Will you check other
	people she might call? Yeah, if it
	wasn't trouble I wouldn't ask vou.

He hangs up, immediately starts to dial again, then
pauses to check a list he's laid out by the
telephone. While he's doing this, his PHONE RINGS.

			KLUTE (CONT'D)
	Yeah?
		(then)
	Nothing yet, Trask; I'm going down
	the list. I've tried Spangler's
	office and Spangler's home; I just
	get his message service. I'll keep--
		(interrupted -- listens --
		then -- grimly)
	I may have steered Cable that way.
	I told him Bree was dealing for me,
	for Jane McKenna's book. Have you
	found any --

He is interrupted again -- Trask wasting no words
on his end of things -- nods once --

			KLUTE (CONT'D)
	Yeah.

-- and depresses the receiver just long enough to
clear the connection, and starts dialing again --
We CUT TO --

INT. STAIRWAY OF GARMENT BUILDING - DAY (NIGHT)

Quitting time. As Bree enters from street level,
employees are coming down the stairs, pushing past
her. She continues up on until at one point -- one
more officious or more communicative than the
others informs her --

			FOREMAN
	Lady, it's closing up there.

			BREE
	What?

			FOREMAN
	We're closing up, quitting time,
	Fabers.

			BREE
		(unsurely)
	I have an appointment with Mr.
	Faber.

			FOREMAN
	Oh, yeah.

He lets her pass, glances after her like the
others, continues on his way.

INT. GARMENT BUILDING: FABER RECEPTION AREA - DAY
(NIGHT)

Bree arrives at the head of the stairs -- as still
others press past her on their way down -- and
comes more or less directly up against the thickset
RECEPTIONIST. She is packing her purse, preparing
to depart, looks somewhat challengingly at Bree --
who sees no way to avoid the issue.

			BREE
	I have an appointment with Mr.
	Faber.

			RECEPTIONIST
	In there.
		(turns, bawls)
	Mr. Faber --

Bree goes on nervously in the direction indicated,
toward --

A CORNER OF OFFICES: NATHAN FABER

NATHAN stands bending over a bench with back to
camera, conferring with another man as Bree
approaches -- looking to us, as to her, exactly
like his father. We hear the Receptionist's VOICE
repeating --

			RECEPTIONIST (CONT'D) (O.S.)
			(CONT'D)
	Mr. Faber --

As Bree nears him, he straightens and turns -- a
much younger man. Bree stops short, recognizing the
error.

			NATHAN
	Yes?

			BREE
	I'm sorry -- Mr. Faber Senior.

			NATHAN
		(calmly)
	My father went home about fifteen
	minutes ago; he wasn't feeling too
	good.

She has already started away. He calls after her
evenly --

			NATHAN (CONT'D)
	Can I help you?

She looks back quickly, smiles nervously --

			BREE
	It wasn't important.

But we hold on him for a moment as she continues
out of scene -- until he turns away to other
matters. Then --

RECEPTION AREA: RECEPTIONIST, BREE

Bree returns toward Receptionist, awkwardly --

			BREE
	Did Mr. Faber leave a message for
	me or anything? Mr. Faber Senior?
	Bree Daniel.

			RECEPTIONIST
	Oh, I thought that was for
	tomorrow.

The Receptionist riffles through a stack of
assorted envelopes -- hands one out to Bree -- and
promptly takes her way off. Out. Bree starts to
open the envelope then and there -- but OTHERS
continue to move past her. She seeks a more private
place.

ROWS OF GARMENTS

Bree shelters herself out of sight from everyone
else -- though we continue to hear INTERMITTENT
VOICES, O.S. and continue to maintain the sense of
other presences.

We see her open the envelope --

CLOSER: BREE, ENVELOPE

She finds nothing inside but money -- bills
totaling fifty dollars. We see her looking for a
message, finding nothing. It comes to her slowly
that she's been paid off and avoided. She bites her
lips in pain. She pushes back out of hiding --

RECEPTIONIST AREA

-- back to the reception area again. (By now this
immediate scene has emptied, though we catch sight
of a figure or two at scene-start, moving through
the background, and continue to hear an occasional
NOISE or VOICE O.S.)

Bree looks about for someone -- then scouts for a
pencil, finds one in a desk (or bench) drawer,
starts to readdress the envelope (to direct it back
to Mr. Faber). Then she breaks off from that, takes
up a PHONE instead, dials -- waits -- then --

			BREE
	Bree Daniel. Has he called in yet?
	Well if he does, I'm at --
		(reads phone)
	-- two seven eight, three one
	hundred, and I guess I can wait
	here five minutes; then I'll try
	from somewhere else.
		(impatiently)
	Just tell him Bree Daniel; he knows
	who.

She hangs up, goes back to readdressing the
envelope. FOOTSTEPS are approaching in her
direction. She glances up apologetically.

			BREE (CONT'D)
	Mr. Faber, I just wanted to leave
	this for your father, and I
	wondered if you'd --

She pauses --

ANGLE PAST BREE TO CABLE

Cable hastens toward her along a lane of garments.
In this brief glimpse a ludicrous and terrifying
figure -- a noise, a gesticulation (actually the
gesture is arms out, palms downward, intended as a
quieting gesture; and the hissing noise is intended
as a shushing). Bree cries out, turns to run --

			BREE (CONT'D)
	Someone --

-- as we immediately, even as she's turning, CUT TO
--

INT. KLUTE'S APARTMENT: KLUTE - DAY (NIGHT)

Klute speaks quietly but with terrible urgency into
the phone (dealing evidently with an ethically
skittish message service at the other end).

			KLUTE
	Did she leave a number?
		(beat)
	This is a police call; don't make
	me take time to prove it. Did she
	leave a number? What is the number?
		(beat)
	What is the number? --

INT. GARMENT BUILDING - DAY (NIGHT)

Cable and Bree. They are at some remove from the
site of Cable's first appearance; there are other
evidences of time-lapse. Cable's manner is that of
slightly-strained patience -- a civility -- an
attempt now and then to smile. Bree watches his
every slight gesture, quivers to make a break for
it, tries throughout to buy time.

			CABLE
	Can't we talk together reasonably,
	just -- ordinarily?
		(beat)
	I know you're expecting some kind
	of -- extravagant behavior, but
	believe me -- do you believe me? --

			BREE
	Yes -- all right --

			CABLE
	-- We can talk --

			BREE
	-- Yes.

			CABLE
	All right, then, an ordinary
	matter. I'm a quite well off man, I
	have a -- position to respect. I
	would feel personally uncomfortable
	to be connected with a -- certain
	kind of woman, I'm sure you
	understand. Do you? Well I'd like
	to buy Jane McKenna's book.

He looks at her discerningly. She seems not to have
followed his exposition. He tries patiently to
clarify it.

			CABLE (CONT'D)
	Her black book, Jane McKenna's, her
	list of -- of persons. I was told
	you're negotiating for it on behalf
	of --

The PHONE RINGS, an explosive noise. Bree startles.
It has been put on night-ring, to sound all over
the loft, and the noise is deafening. But -- the
most bizarre element is Cable's absolute lack of
response to it. It rings and rings as he talks and
talks -- in the same expository tone as before,
without raising his voice. It drowns out most of
his words -- at most we catch only odd phrases of
all the following -- but he seems not to hear it
any more than the clamor of other things torturing
his soul.

			CABLE (CONT'D)
	That was what Klute told me -- you
	were negotiating for him to buy
	that list. And I'm in a position to
	pay a good deal more for it than he
	can. Do you understand? I'd like
	you to acquire it on my --
		(beat)
	Miss Daniel, do you not understand?
		(beat)
	Miss Daniel, I can't tell whether
	you understand me.
		(beat - still reasonably)
	Is this something Klute just
	invented? Is this a trap for me,
	Miss Daniel; does Klute know about
	me?

He turns and lifts a phone (one of the extension
phones situated around the loft) -- though up to
now he's given no evidence of even hearing the
ringing. He just stands holding the phone for a
time, then lowers it back on the receiver. With a
sort of absolute quiet --

			CABLE (CONT'D)
	You have no idea what I'm talking
	about.

			BREE
	Yes -- Jane McKenna's book -- I
	could make a phone call.

			CABLE
	No, you're frightened, you're
	pretending. Well -- Klute knows
	about me then. Does everybody know,
	can you tell me?

			BREE
	Yes.

			CABLE
	Then it doesn't matter what I do
	any more, does it?

Pause. Then he shudders slightly.

			CABLE (CONT'D)
	You people know nothing about pain.

We CUT TO --

EXT. STREETS - DAY (NIGHT)

We see Klute -- probably in MLS -- running along
street. He tries for a cab -- misses it -- halts
the next by expedient of cutting bodily in front of
it. The Driver starts to lean out to object. Klute
mashes him back inside, enters the cab. We CUT BACK
TO --

INT. GARMENT BUILDING - DAY (NIGHT)

MLS, the two FIGURES: CABLE, BREE. They are
somewhat separated -- Cable has gone to look down
from one of the arched windows of the loft, while
Bree remains in place. She is a prisoner, we can
suppose -- when we cut closer we'll see her eyes
continually shifting, her mind calculating her
chances -- but he hasn't molested her. He bears her
no animus at this point. His manner is rather
quiet, undetermined. He feels some relief that the
thing is, in effect, over -- and some puzzlement
about what to do (with either her or himself) now.
He returns toward her.

CLOSER: BREE, CABLE

Nearing her again, he gestures several times,
apologetically, seeking words.

			CABLE
	I've got no idea what I shall do.

He happens too close; she can't avoid shrinking.

			CABLE (CONT'D)
	I'm not going to hurt you,
	absolutely, I'm not.

			BREE
	Will you let me go then?

He seems not to have heard the request. He sits for
a moment. An intellectual interest, a curiosity.
(Meanwhile, perhaps, we see her starting to slip
her shoes off, in hopes of running.)

			CABLE
	It puzzles me so badly. I've done
	terrible things but I can't
	consider myself a terrible man.
	I've killed three people and I'd
	still want to say it was accident,
	do you see?

			BREE
		(tries again, slowly)
	If you'll let me go I could tell
	them what --

			CABLE
		(unhearing, resumes)
	Tom Grunemann discovered me -- we
	were here on business together, he
	discovered me with Jane McKenna.
	Then I suppose it was the -- the
	contempt I saw in his face and the
	certainty that sooner or later he'd
	use it against me. Within the
	Company. I endured that as long as
	I could, do you see?

			BREE
	I'm sorry, I'm just frightened.
	Yes.

			CABLE
	Excuse me Miss Daniel?

			BREE
	I said yes, I see.

			CABLE
		(doubtingly)
	Oh no, I don't think --

			BREE
	Tell me. I'll listen.
		(pause)
	I just want you to tell me.

He rises, approaches her -- apparently taken in,
credulous, grateful, wondering --

			CABLE
	You're willing to listen? You want
	me just to keep talking?

He hits her.

			CABLE (CONT'D)
	That's what you do, isn't it; you
	make a man feel accepted.
	That's what you all do. Your stock
	in trade a man's weakness.

He hits her again.

			CABLE (CONT'D)
	Why don't you ask for mercy? My
	God, what mercy has anyone given
	me?

INT. ELEVATOR - KLUTE ASCENDING - DAY (NIGHT)

EXT. GARMENT BUILDING ROOF (DIRECTLY ABOVE FABER
LOFT) - DAY (NIGHT)

Klute has gun out - as he carefully makes his way
across the roof. Man in hotel window across street
holding drink - watches him with amused curiosity.
Klute spots entrance to stairway.

INT. GARMENT BUILDING: KLUTE - DAY (NIGHT)

Klute goes downstairs to back entrance of Faber
loft. He slips inside. He hears THE SOUNDS OF THE
BEATING -- a stirring of feet and indistinct impact
sounds, a murmur of voices (but all quite muted,
undramatic). He maneuvers through lanes of
garments, trying to gain a line of sight. He
understands what's going on, strains to intervene,
but can't disclose himself. At a point, he drops to
hands and knees, slides underneath the garment
racks, drawing closer to Cable, trying to gain
position. We intersperse his progress with further
Bree-Cable fragments, as for instance --

FRAGMENT: CABLE, BREE

			CABLE
	You're a person of no value, you
	have no value --

KLUTE, SHIFTING CLOSER

Klute works his way steadily closer -- under
steadily increasing pressure, as the pursuit and
beating continue as SOUNDS, O.S. Even close at hand
the noises are ambiguous -- the clatter of
footsteps, grunts, a slap of flesh -- rather than
distinct. Once or twice we hear CABLE'S VOICE
clearly enough to make out words --

			CABLE (CONT'D)
	-- Is that contempt? Is it?
		(then)
	No, I'm the one who feels contempt.

-- and once or twice a CRY from Bree.

Klute tries to gain aim --

P.O.V. TO BREE, CABLE

-- but Cable is too close upon her, and they are
too steadily in motion.

KLUTE

Klute moves on -- moves on -- gains position --
springs.

CABLE

Cable catches the sound, whirls, screams --

P.O.V. TO KLUTE

Klute closes with him, knocks loose Cable's pistol 
- contends for it again, knocks it loose again.
EFFECT -- under -- SIRENS.

CABLE, KLUTE

Cable breaks loose, backs a step -- backs another
step -- and then, turns and runs unhesitant against
one of the windows, exploding it outward with him,
both frame and glass.

EXT. WIDE SHOT: BUILDINGS - DAY (NIGHT)

We see the body tracing its quick path down the
dark side of the building.

EXT. DOWNSHOT FROM LOFT TO STREET (KLUTE'S P.O.V.) -
DAY (NIGHT)

EXT. BASE OF BUILDING: CABLE'S BODY - DAY (NIGHT)

The sound of SIRENS a little LOUDER.

INT. GARMENT BUILDING: KLUTE, BREE - DAY (NIGHT)

Klute turns from looking down, moves to where Bree
kneels on the floor. He hunkers down.
In a gentle-enough VOICE, but matter-of-factly
withal -- as if to a child --

			KLUTE
	Come on.
		(pause)
	Come on.

(Note: also shoot in MSL, without dialogue, with
SIRENS O.S. full up.) Then we CUT TO --

INT. KLUTE'S APARTMENT - DAY

KLUTE is packing to leave. We follow him about as
he carries clothing from closet and bureau, folds
it into his suitcase on the table. We hear the
familiar FOOTSTEPS on the stairs. Bree's KNOCK. He
lets her in, keeps on about his business. His
expression is sober; hers is quite tentative.

			BREE
	Hi.

He doesn't at least expel her. She ventures in,
sits on the table, swings her heels, watches him
pack. His arm impairs him. At length --

			KLUTE
	I got a call from Ross this
	morning. Cable owned a plot of
	woodland -- he'd go there on
	weekends. They found Tom
	Grunemann's body buried there.
	They've notified his wife.

			BREE
	Oh.
		(pause; then sharply --)
	Well it wasn't us city people that
	did it -- your fine rosy-cheeked
	country boy.

			KLUTE
	Mm.

			BREE
	You're going back?

			KLUTE
	Mm.

Pause. She compresses her lips, slips down from the
table, starts smartly out of the room.

			KLUTE (CONT'D)
	Wait.

She returns and sits on the table again, waits. But
Klute doesn't seem about to say anything more --
goes on packing.

			BREE 
	Well suppose I hadn't come
	downstairs. Would you just have
	folded up and sneaked away?

			KLUTE 
		(slowly)
	No. I was going to come up. I
	wanted to ask you to marry me.
		(pause)

			BREE 
	You wanted to, or you are?

			KLUTE 
	I am.

			BREE 
	You could at least look at me!

He complies, stands and looks, folding a necktie.
But now she finds she has to look away. Somewhat
brokenly --

			BREE (CONT'D)
	Look -- yes. I mean thanks, but --
	don't you think we better be
	realistic?

			KLUTE 
	About what?

			BREE 
	Look at me. I'm pretty and sort of
	clever and very well intentioned,
	and dear God I'd tear your heart
	out!

			KLUTE 
	I don't think so.

He resumes packing, continues through the
following.

			BREE 
	How can you not think so? You know
	the things I can do.

			KLUTE 
		(unclearly)
	They don't scare me any more.

			BREE
	What?

			KLUTE 
	Doesn't scare me. I think we could
	handle it.

Thereafter he guards his silence, staunchly goes on
packing, as she comes at the thing from various
sharp angles. 

			BREE 
	Please, I'm a city person. I'm sure
	it's just as good as here but I'm a
	city person, that's all, I am!
		(pause)
	Hell I know what it's like. I was
	in Jersey once: the frogs go bra-a
	p all night!
		(pause)
	What'im I supposed to do? Mend your
	socks and sing in the church choir?
		(pause, choking) )
	Do you not believe I love you? I'm
	honestly, honestly just --

He has almost finished packing -- returns toward
the suitcase with the tin CLOCK and electric FAN,
tries to fit them in as conversation continues.

			BREE (CONT'D)
	Look, why should it be yes or no?
	Can't we keep it going and see? I
	mean we can keep in touch and visit
	each other and see. People do that,
	that's realistic.

			KLUTE 
	OK.

			BREE
		(bitterly)
	You don't believe that either, do
	you? Why can't you see my side?

			KLUTE 
	Can you use these?

He sets the fan beside her, hands her the LOUDLY
TICKING clock. She holds it in her lap, numbly.
He's packed -- closes various drawers, leaving in
good order -- snaps the suitcase shut, lifts it
stiffly down from the table. She remains sitting.

			BREE
	Can I carry something for you, to
	the car?
		(he shakes his head)
	Will you kiss me?

			KLUTE 
	No. I'm sore.

He moves to the door, pauses, half-smiles --

			KLUTE (CONT'D)
	Well --

She smiles back. He goes. We hear the entryway door
opening and closing.

She slips down off the table. We CUT TO --

EXT STREET OUTSIDE BROWNSTONE - DAY

Klute is, let's say, about seventy feet on his way
when she appears at the front door, calls after
him.

			BREE 
	Hey.

He turns around and stops. He walks slowly back to
her.

CLOSER: BREE, KLUTE

He arrives in proximity to her. Then the following
events in more or less the following order:

He looks at her inquiringly. She responds by
sitting down, plunk, on the grubby front step of
the Brownstone.

Having stood for some time -- during which she has
offered only twitching motions of her hands -- he
sets down the suitcase.

Having set down the suitcase, but derived no
answer, he reaches out one arm, and leans against
the building front.

She nearly arrives at the level of statement.
Fretfully, indecisively --

			BREE
	Oh heck --
		(pause)
	Oh heck --

Then, as a man not to be dallied with, he picks up
the suitcase again. She looks at him strickenly,
but it doesn't precipitate her into speech.

He puts it down again.

And then -- then, after all, goddamit, he reaches
out, grabs her wrist, and simply hauls her along,
suitcase in one hand, Bree in the other. As she
yanks, shouts, struggles --

			BREE (CONT'D)
	I haven't decided yet!
		(beat)
	I haven't decided yet!
		(beat)
	I haven't decided yet! --

        FADE IN:

        OVER the opening strains of "I LOVE YOU, CALIFORNIA," a
        MONTAGE:  a mixture of headlines, newsreel footage and
        live action.  Economy Booming!  Postwar Optimism!  L.A.:
        City of the Future!  But most prominent among them:
        GANGLAND!  Police photographers document crime scenes.
        The meat wagon hauls ex-button men to the morgue.  Where
        will it end?


        EXT. L.A. SKYLINE - SUNSET

        Palm trees in silhouette against a cherry sky.  City
        lights twinkle.  Los Angeles.  A place where anything is
        possible.  A place where dreams come true.  As the sky
        darkens, triple-kleig lights begin to sweep back and
        forth.


        EXT. MANSION (HANCOCK PARK) - NIGHT

        The KLEIG LIGHTS are out front.  Valets hurry to park a
        line of elegant cars.

                                MAYOR (V.O.)
                  Ladies and gentlemen, I give you
                  the future of Los Angeles!


        INT. HANCOCK PARK MANSION - BALLROOM - NIGHT

        The MAYOR yanks a cloth to reveal a MODEL of L.A. criss-
        crossed by an elaborate FREEWAY SYSTEM.  The CROWD oohs.
        A COUNCILMAN claps.  A SOCIETY MATRON nods her approval.

        PIERCE PATCHETT, 50, tuxedoed, watches off to one side.
        A behind-the-scenes power broker, Patchett exudes
        authority much more so than the Mayor does.

                                MAYOR
                  The Arroyo Seco freeway is just
                  the beginning.  We're planning
                  freeways from Downtown to Santa
                  Monica, from the South Bay to the
                  San Fernando Valley.  Twenty
                  minutes to work or play is the
                  longest you'll have to travel.

        More applause.  One REPORTER asks a little too loudly...

                                REPORTER
                  How many bodies you think Mickey
                  Cohen'll be able to hide in all
                  that cement?

        The Mayor wears a plastic smile, ignores it.


        INT. THE MOCAMBO - NIGHT

        A CLUB PHOTOGRAPHER pops snapshots, but the real action
        is on the floor where MICKEY COHEN does a wicked "Lindy
        Hop" with THREE different GIRLS at once.  A fireplug of a
        man, he hardly seems a public menace.  Nearby is his
        bodyguard JOHNNY STOMPANATO.  Over it all:

                                HUDGEONS (V.O.)
                  Meyer Harris Cohen, Mickey C to
                  his fans.  He's the big moocher,
                  local L.A. color to the nth
                  degree.  You know Mickey.  He runs
                  dope, rackets and prostitution.
                  He kills a dozen people a year.
                  But who you may not know is
                  bodyguard Johnny Stompanato.

        His hair in a slick pompadour, Stompanato keeps an eye on
        Cohen and comes onto a CIGARETTE GIRL at the same time.

                                HUDGEONS (V.O.)
                  Johnny's handsome, ladies, but the
                  real attraction is below the belt.
                  Second only to Steve Cochran, he's
                  sometimes known as 'Oscar' because
                  of his Academy Award-size
                  appendage.

        Mickey works a sweat on the dance floor.  A bottle of
        champagne pops; Stompanato reacts, nearly draws a pistol
        from his shoulder holster.  As he laughs at himself...


        INT. HUSH-HUSH MAGAZINE OFFICE - DAY

        Lurid page one headlines cover the wall where SID
        HUDGEONS types.  The essence of sleaze, Sid is the
        publisher-photographer-writer of Hush-Hush magazine and
        keeper of inside dirt supreme.  As he continues...

                                HUDGEONS (V.O.)
                  Remember, dear readers, you heard
                  it here first, off the record, on
                  the Q.T. and very Hush-Hush.


        INT. HANCOCK PARK MANSION - BALLROOM - NIGHT

        The party continues.  The Mayor has moved off to the side
        with the power brokers.  Patchett is a presence.

                                MAYOR
                  We're selling an image, gentlemen.
                  Beautiful weather.  Affordable
                  housing.
                         (re:  model)
                  Trouble-free transportation.  And
                  the best police department in the
                  world to keep it all running
                  smoothly.


        EXT. STOREFRONT - NIGHT

        A dozen people watch a display windoe TELEVISION as it
        rolls the opening of the hit show "Badge of Honor."  Over
        familiar THEME MUSIC, "Sgt. Joe Reno" (actor BRETT CHASE)
        walks the streets of Los Angeles.

                                CHASE (V.O.)
                  My name?  Joe Reno.  The city?
                  Los Angeles.  A big town.  Full of
                  all sorts of people.  It's my job
                  to help them.  I like what I do.
                  I'm a cop.


        INT. HANCOCK PARK MANSION - BALLROOM - NIGHT

        The Mayor continues.

                                MAYOR
                  But with a second rate Al Capone
                  out there, L.A. looks like Chicago
                  in the '30s.  Something has to be
                  done.

        As Pierce Patchett nods sagely.


        INT. OLYMPIC AUDITORIUM - NIGHT

        Wrestler GORGEOUS GEORGE primps and poses before flatten-
        ing an opponent with a drop kick.


        INT. MOVIE THEATER - NIGHT

        An enthusiastic crowd adjusts their 3-D glasses.


        EXT. COHEN MANSION (BEVERLY HILLS) - DAY

        In monogrammed silk pajamas, Mickey Cohen answers the
        door, his pet BULLDOG Mickey Jr. at his feet.  The police
        are waiting.  REPORTERS' flashbulbs pop.

                                POLICE OFFICER
                  Mr. Cohen, you're under arrest.

                                COHEN
                  Bullshit.  What's the charge?

                                POLICE OFFICER
                  Non-payment of federal income tax.

                                COHEN
                  Bullshit.


        EXT. GRAUMAN'S CHINESE - DAY

        JOHN WAYNE gets his hand prints in the sidewalk.


        EXT. WESTCHESTER BEAN FIELD - DAY

        MIGRANT WORKERS hurry to finish the harvest.  We PAN
        TO CONSTRUCTION WORKERS who wait impatiently with bull-
        dozers under a "Spirit of the Future" BANNER.  As the
        last picker leaves the field, the bulldozers move in,
        leveling the bean rows to make way for a housing tract.


        EXT. FEDERAL COURTHOUSE - STEPS - DAY

        Flashbulbs pop as Mickey Cohen exits and starts down
        the steps.  Accompanied by his LAWYERS, bodyguard
        Stompanato and mob lieutenants DEUCE PERKINS and NATE
        JANKLOW, Cohen ignores REPORTERS' shouts.

                                REPORTER
                  How's your bullshit now, Mickey?!

        As Cohen gets into a waiting car, the media turn their
        attention to District Attorney ELLIS LOEW.  A singularly
        ambitious man, Loew loves the spotlight.

                                LOEW
                  Today is an auspicious one for the
                  city of Los Angeles.  Mickey Cohen
                  has just been sentenced to ten
                  years in federal prison for
                  failure to pay income tax.
                  As the District Attorney for Los
                  Angeles County, it is my pleasure
                  to declare our great city
                  organized crime free.  It is truly
                  the dawning of a new day.

        The SONG ENDS and so does the MONTAGE.


        INT. PACKARD (ACROSS FROM BULLOCKS WILSHIRE) - NIGHT

        December 24th.  Wendell "BUD" WHITE, 30, stares at the
        enormous Christmas tree on the deco platform over
        Bullocks' entrance.  An LAPD cop, Bud's rep as the
        toughest man on the force has been well earned.  In the
        back seat, with cases of Walker Black and Cutty Sark, is
        Bud's partner -- DICK STENSLAND.  Older, but also a tough
        hump, "Stens" sucks on a pint of Old Crow.

        The passenger door opens and Mickey Cohen bodyguard
        Johnny Stompanato slides in.  Guinea handsome, Johnny
        wears his curls in a tight pompadour.  With his boss
        behind bars, he's out of work.  Bud just stares at him.

                                STOMPANATO
                  Officer White.  I heard you got a
                  hard-on for wife beaters.

                                BUD
                  And you fuck people up for a
                  living.  That don't make me you.
                  Capisce, shitbird?

        Stompanato smiles.  Nervous.  Through the window, Bud
        watches a Salvation Army Santa palm coins from a kettle.

                                STENSLAND
                  Bud ain't in the mood for small
                  talk, Stompanato.

                                STOMPANATO
                  Look, Mickey C's doing time and
                  half the other guys who'd hire me
                  are dead or left town.  I need
                  money.  If your snitch-fund's
                  green, I'll get you some fucking-A
                  collars.

        Impatient, Bud tugs at a finger, CRACKS a KNUCKLE.

                                STOMPANATO
                  There's this guy.  He's blond and
                  fat, about forty.  Likes the
                  ponies.  Been pimping his wife to
                  cover his losses.  Knocks her
                  around to keep her in line.

        Bud's eyes narrow at this last bit of info.  Stompanato
        holds up a slip of paper.

                                STOMPANATO
                  I figure the address is worth
                  twenty.

        Bud digs into his wallet, pulls out twenty bucks,
        exchanges it with Stompanato.  Stompanato smiles smugly,
        grabs a bottle of Scotch from the back.

                                STOMPANATO
                  Yuletide cheer, fellas.

        Without warning, Bud grabs Stompanato's tie and yanks,
        slamming his forehead into the dash.

                                BUD
                  Happy New Year, greaseball.

        EXT. 1486 EVERGREEN - NIGHT

        A stucco job in a row of vet prefabs.  A neon Santa
        sleigh has landed on the roof.  Through the front window,
        we see a fat guy browbeating a woman.  Puff-faced, 35-
        ish, she backs away as he rages at her.

        The Packard pulls up out front.  Stensland could care
        less.

                                STENSLAND
                  Leave it for later, Bud.  We got
                  to pick up the rest of the booze
                  and get back to the precinct.

        Bud KILLS the IGNITION, picks up the radio.

                                BUD
                  Central, this is 4A-31.  Send a
                  prowler to 1486 Evergreen.  White
                  male in custody.  Code 623 point
                  one.  Domestic assault and
                  battery.  I won't be here, but
                  they'll see him.


        EXT. 1486 EVERGREEN - BUD - NIGHT

        steps to the house.  Inside, we hear SLAPS, MUFFLED
        CRIES.  Bud grips an outlet cord coming off the roof and
        yanks.  The sleigh crashes to the ground with REINDEER
        EXPLODING around it.  A beat.  The fat guy runs out to
        investigate, trips over Rudolph.

        Bud pounces.  Fat guy takes a swing, misses.  Grabbing
        fat guy's hair, Bud smashes his face to the pavement.
        Once, twice.  Teeth skitter down the walk.

                                BUD
                  Touch her again and I'll know
                  about it.  Understand?  Huh?

        Another face full of gravel.  Fat guy's WIFE watches with
        apprehension from the steps as Bud cuffs her husband's
        hands behind his back, empties his pockets.  A cash roll
        and car keys.  Bud looks over at her.

                                BUD
                  You got someplace you can go?

        She nods.  Bud hands her the keys and the cash.

                                BUD
                  Go get yourself fixed up.

                                WIFE
                         (nods, determined)
                  Merry Christmas, huh?

        Bud watches as she gets into a pre-war Ford in the drive.
        She backs over a blinking reindeer as she goes.

                                STENSLAND
                  You and women, partner.  What's
                  next?  Kids and dogs?


        INT. STAGE FOUR (VARIETY INTERNATIONAL PICTURES) - NIGHT

        The "Badge of Honor" set.  A Christmas party in full
        swing.  Eating, drinking, and dancing.  Star Brett Chase,
        seen earlier on television, is holding court.

        LAPD Sgt. "Trashcan" JACK VINCENNES, late 30s with slick,
        good looks, dances with a young ACTRESS.  Grinding their
        way through a ballad, they're obviously hitting it off.

                                ACTRESS
                  Brett Chase told me you're the cop
                  who busted Bob Mitchum.
                         (grinds closer)
                  These 'Badge of Honor' guys like
                  to pretend, but being the real
                  thing must be a thrill.

                                JACK
                  Let's go someplace quiet.  I'll
                  give you the low-down on Mitchum.

                                ACTRESS
                  You got your handcuffs with you?

                                JACK
                  Two sets.

                                ACTRESS
                  I'll get my coat.

        They're interrupted by Sid Hudgeons.

                                HUDGEONS
                  Big V Jack Vincennes!  May I have
                  this dance?

                                JACK
                  Karen, this is Sid Hudgeons from
                  Hush-Hush magazine.

                                ACTRESS
                  I know who he is.

        The Actress storms off.  Jack looks to Sid.

                                HUDGEONS
                  We did a piece last year.
                  'Ingenue Dykes In Hollywood.'  Her
                  name got mentioned.

                                JACK
                  Is she?

                                HUDGEONS
                  Beats me.  Look, Jackie-Boy, a
                  friend of mine just sold some
                  reefer to Matt Reynolds.  He's
                  tripping the light fantastic with
                  Tammy Jordan at 2245 Maravilla,
                  Hollywood Hills.  It's right
                  around the corner.

                                JACK
                  You lost me, Sid.  Who?

                                HUDGEONS
                  Contract players at Metro.  You
                  pinch 'em.  I do you up feature in
                  the next issue.  Plus the usual
                  fifty cash.  Tell me, am I fucking
                  Santa Claus?

                                JACK
                  I need an extra fifty.  Two
                  patrolmen at twenty apiece and a
                  dime for the watch commander at
                  Hollywood Station.

                                HUDGEONS
                  Jack!  It's Christmas!

                                JACK
                  No.  It's felony possession of
                  marijuana.


        EXT. 2245 MARAVILLA - NIGHT

        WITH a VIEW of Grauman's Chinese.  Jack and two uniformed
        patrolmen wait on the darkened street.  An arc light has
        been set up.  Hudgeons creeps back over from the house.

                                HUDGEONS
                  They're sitting in the dark,
                  goofing on the Christmas tree.

                                JACK
                  Stand there with your camera.
                  I'll stop here so you get
                  Grauman's Chinese in the
                  backgrouns.

                                HUDGEONS
                  I like it!  I like it!


        INT. 2245 MARAVILLA - NIGHT

        The arc light floods the living room about the same time
        that Jack kicks the door in.  The room is caught flush:
        Christmas tree, a bag of weed on the couch, two kids
        necking in their BVDs.  MATT REYNOLDS and TAMMY JORDAN.

                                JACK
                  Police!

        EXT. 2245 MARAVILLA - NIGHT

        Jack exits, hauling Jordan and Reynolds by the neck.
        Jack stops with Grauman's FRAMED behind him and Hudgeons
        CLICKS off several shots with his CAMERA.

                                HUDGEONS
                  Cut!  Wrap it!

        Windows light up.  Rubberneckers appear.  Jack hands the
        kids to the patrolmen, heads back in with Hudgeons in
        tow.


        INT. 2245 MARAVILLA - NIGHT

        Jack scoops the pot, flips through an address book.  A
        card falls out.  "Fleur-de-Lis.  Whatever you desire..."
        Jack looks from the card out the window at the kids being
        loaded into a black and white.  They're both crying now.

                                HUDGEONS
                         (stantorian tone)
                  It's Christmas morning in the City
                  of Angels, and while decent
                  citizens sleep the sleep of the
                  righteous, hopheads prowl for
                  marijuana, not knowing that a man
                  is coming to stop them.  The free-
                  wheeling, big-time Big V,
                  celebrity crime-stopper, Jack
                  Vincennes, the scourge of
                  grasshoppers and junk fiends
                  everywhere.  You like it, Jackie-
                  Boy?

                                JACK
                  Yeah, it's subtle.

        Sid hands him a President Grant 50.

                                HUDGEONS
                  Remember: you heard it first here,
                  off the record, on the Q.T. and
                  very Hush-Hush.


        INT. HOLLYWOOD STATION - DISPATCH DESK - NIGHT

        Suspects, mostly drunk and disorderly, are ushered
        through.  Sgt. ED EXLEY, 30, bespectacled, is at the desk
        with a YOUNG OFFICER.  Exley is an up-and-comer.  Burning
        with ambition.  The faster he rises through the ranks,
        the more resentment he leaves in his wake.

                                EXLEY
                  What's on the call sheet?

                                YOUNG OFFICER
                  A guy dressed as Santa has been
                  exposing himself to kids in Los
                  Feliz.  Apparently, sir, he's
                  decorated himself.

                                EXLEY
                  Decorated?

                                YOUNG OFFICER
                  With tinsel and plastic icicles
                  and... on his penis, sir.

                                EXLEY
                  I get the idea.  You got a
                  description?

                                YOUNG OFFICER
                  Of his penis, sir?


        EXT. HOLLYWOOD BOULEVARD - HOLLYWOOD LIQUOR - NIGHT

        Tinsel-trimmed photos of movie stars look down from the
        walls as the OWNER takes an order from LYNN BRACKEN.

                                LYNN
                  A case each of gin, Scotch, and
                  rum.  Everything top shelf.  None
                  of that watered-down stuff you
                  push on Errol Flynn.

                                OWNER
                         (laughs)
                  Sounds like a helluva party.

        Her hair kerchiefed, Lynn waits as the Owner writes it
        up.  There's glamour, a cat-girl grace about Lynn.  She
        seems like she belongs up on the wall with the movie
        stars.  Lynn looks across as Bud White heads toward the
        counter.  Spotting her, Bud doesn't look so tough for a
        moment.

                                OWNER
                  You want it delivered?

                                LYNN
                  Before five tomorrow.

        The Owner spots Bud.  A big smile turns to a frown.

                                OWNER
                  I'll be right with you, Lynn.

        The Owner begins indiscriminately loading hard liquor
        into a cardboard box, leaving Bud and Lynn to look at
        each other.  Bud says the only thing he can think of.

                                BUD
                  Merry Christmas.

                                LYNN
                  Merry Christmas yourself, Officer.

                                BUD
                  That obvious, huh?

                                LYNN
                         (smiles sweetly)
                  It's practically stamped on your
                  forehead.

        As the Owner bangs a case of liquor on the counter...


        EXT. HOLLYWOOD LIQUOR - NIGHT

        Bud exits with his booze, heads for the car.  Something
        catches his eye.  A woman in the rear passenger seat of a
        new Cadillac.  SUSAN LEFFERTS.  Both her eyes are black.

        Bud starts over.  The case on his hip, he motions for her
        to roll down the window.  The driver's side door opens
        and bodyguard TURNER "BUZZ" MEEKS menaces his way out.

                                MEEKS
                  Get lost why don't you?

        Meeks stops short as Bud shoves his badge in Meeks' face.
        Setting the case on the car's hood, Bud spins Meeks
        around, pats him down.  He finds a .38 in a shoulder
        holster.

                                MEEKS
                  I got a license for that.

        Bud removes Meeks' wallet, checks the ID.

                                MEEKS
                  Cut me some slack.  I used to be a
                  cop.

                                BUD
                  Turner Meeks?  Never heard of you.

                                LYNN
                         (exiting store)
                  We just call him Buzz.

        Bud raps on Susan's window with his badge.  It comes
        down.

                                BUD
                  You okay?

        Beside her, a man leans over.  Pierce Patchett, seen
        before at the freeway unveiling, is a man used to being
        chauffeured.  Like FDR, he smokes his cigarette in a
        holder.

                                PATCHETT
                  She's fine.

                                BUD
                         (menacing)
                  I'm not asking you.

        Patchett has no idea he's walking on thin ice.  As he
        stares impatiently at Bud, Bud looks back to Susan.

                                BUD
                  Somebody hit you?

                                LYNN
                  It's not what you think.

        Bud looks to see Lynn Bracken moving to the driver's
        door.

                                BUD
                  What is it then?

                                SUSAN
                  You got the wrong idea, Mister.
                  I'm fine.

        Susan laughs.  Patchett eases back into the shadows.

                                LYNN
                         (getting in the car)
                  But it's nice to know you care.

        Bud considers Meeks' gun license, then hands him back the
        .38 and wallet.  Lifting his booze, Bud watches Meeks get
        back in the car.

        Stensland steps up as the cabbie starts to pull away.

                                STENSLAND
                  What's going on?

        For an odd moment, Stensland and Meeks lock eyes.

                                BUD
                  You know him?

                                STENSLAND
                  Seen him around.  He used to be a
                  cop.

                                                   CUT TO:


        CLOSE ON DUDLEY SMITH

        Fifty, handsome in his police captain's uniform.  Singing
        "Silver Bells" in a beautiful low tenor.  Tough,
        respected, Dudley goes to bed as a cop every night of his
        life.  He's a department power to be reckoned with.


        INT. PRECINCT HOUSE - MUSTER ROOM - NIGHT

        An L.A. Herald Express REPORTER and photographer listen
        along with the gathered patrolmen as Dudley finishes to
        applause.  Dudley joins the press.

                                REPORTER
                  Captain Smith, I --

                                DUDLEY
                  Drop the formalities; it's
                  Christmas Eve.  Call me Dudley.

                                REPORTER
                  Dudley, I came up with a title for
                  the story.  I'm calling it "Silent
                  Night with the L.A.P.D."

                                DUDLEY
                  Excellent.  How's this?
                         (dramatic pause)
                  The sanctity of the night is an
                  invitation to the darker criminal
                  element.  Our vigilance will not
                  be diminished.

        As the Reporter scribbles down the quote...

                                DUDLEY
                  That's Smith with an S.

        They laugh.  Dudley points the way out.

                                DUDLEY
                  This way, gentlemen.

        Dudley's the last one out the door.  As he goes, he turns
        back to give the men a wink.  He's no sooner out the door
        when the first case of Johnny Walker is brought in.


        INT. PRECINCT HOUSE - DISPATCH DESK - NIGHT

        Ed Exley gets another report from the Young Officer.

                                YOUNG OFFICER
                  Two police officers were assaulted
                  in a bar.  Brown and Helenowski.

        He hands the report to Exley.  It's now that Dudley comes
        through on his press junket.

                                DUDLEY
                  This is Sergeant Ed Exley.  Son of
                  the legendary Preston Exley.  He's
                  the watch commander tonight and a
                  damn fine job.

        As the photographer snaps Exley's picture...

                                DUDLEY
                  I was fortunate enough to be
                  partnered with his father when I
                  was a rookie.  It makes a man feel
                  old.  That's a fact.
                         (a beat)
                  Feel free to get a feel for the
                  place.

        As the Reporter and photographer wander off, Dudley turns
        to Exley a bit more serious.

                                DUDLEY
                  A word with you, lad.


        INT. DUDLEY SMITH'S OFFICE - DAY

        Dudley pours two drinks, hands one to Exley.

                                DUDLEY
                  To the memory of your father.

        They drink.  Exley looks to a photo on the wall.

        Himself as a ten-year-old standing between Dudley and his
        father Preston, both in police uniform.

                                DUDLEY
                  The day he got the Medal of Valor.
                  A simpler time.

        Remembering, Exley invokes his father's favorite toast.

                                EXLEY
                  To the solving of crimes that
                  require absolute justice.

        Exley raises his glass, but Dudley just watches him.

                                DUDLEY
                  That was his favorite toast.
                         (a beat)
                  I saw the test results on the
                  lieutenant's exam.  You placed
                  first out of twenty-three.

                                EXLEY
                  The youngest applicant by eight
                  years.

                                DUDLEY
                  You'll make lieutenant inside a
                  year.  Patrol division?

                                EXLEY
                  I was thinking Detective Bureau.

        We can see Dudley doesn't approve.

                                DUDLEY
                  You don't have the eye for human
                  weakness to be a good detective.
                  Or the stomach.  You're a
                  political animal, Edmund.

        The criticism stings, but Dudley's a straight shooter.

                                EXLEY
                  You're wrong.

                                DUDLEY
                  Am I...?  Would you be willing to
                  plant corroborative evidence on a
                  suspect you knew was guilty in
                  order to ensure an indictment?

                                EXLEY
                  Dudley, we've been over this.

                                DUDLEY
                  Answer yes or no.

                                EXLEY
                  I... No.

                                DUDLEY
                  Would you be willing to rig crime
                  scene evidence to support a
                  prosecuting attorney's working
                  hypothesis...?  Yes or no, Edmund.

                                EXLEY
                  No.

                                DUDLEY
                  Would you be willing to beat
                  confessions out of suspects you
                  knew to be guilty?

                                EXLEY
                  No.

                                DUDLEY
                  Would you be willing to shoot
                  hardened criminals in the back to
                  offset the chance --

                                EXLEY
                  No.

                                DUDLEY
                  Then for God's sake, don't be a
                  detective.  Stick to assignments
                  where you won't have to make those
                  choices.  Patrol, Internal
                  Affairs, but not the Bureau.

                                EXLEY
                  I know you mean well, Dudley, but
                  I don't need to do it the way you
                  did.  Or my father.

                                DUDLEY
                  At least get rid of the glasses.
                  I can't think of one Bureau man
                  who wears them.


        INT. PRECINCT HOUSE - MUSTER ROOM - NIGHT

        A large impromptu bar has been set-up.  The party is in
        full swing, the floor packed with nightwatch blues.  A
        PHONOGRAPH SPEWS DIRTY CHRISTMAS CAROLS.

        Stensland pours eggnog and Old Crow into the water cooler
        as Bud elbows his way in with another case.

                                STENSLAND
                  Hey, partner.  Grab a cup.

                                BUD
                  I got to write my report first.

                                PASSING COP #1
                  Hear about Helenowski and Brown?
                  They got into a helluva scrap with
                  six taco benders at some bar.
                  Helenowski lost six pints of
                  blood.  Brown's in a coma.

                                PASSING COP #2
                  We ought to teach Paco and his
                  friends a lesson.

        More cops vocie their agreement.  Bottles are passed.
        Only Bud doesn't seem as caught-up as the rest.


        INT. PRECINCT HOUSE - NARCO PEN - NIGHT

        Jack Vincennes at his desk.  Holding the Fleur-de-Lis
        card, Jack dials the number.  A corkboard on the wall is
        posted with press clippings.  "Dope Crusader Wounded in
        Shootout."  "Actor Mitchum Seized in Marijuana Shack
        Raid."  That one includes a shot of Jack ushering Mitchum
        into jail.

                                WOMAN (V.O.)
                         (over phone, like
                          silk)
                  Whatever you desire.

                                JACK
                  Hi... I'd like to get a delivery
                  to Beverly Hills.

                                WOMAN (V.O.)
                         (over phone)
                  I don't think I know you.

        CLICK.  The line goes dead.  Jack redials.

                                WOMAN (V.O.)
                         (over phone)
                  Whatever you desire.

                                JACK
                  Look, a friend of mine gave me
                  this number.  I just --

        The line goes dead again.  Jack dials a new number.

                                OPERATOR (V.O.)
                         (filtered)
                  Pacific Coast Bell.

                                JACK
                  This is Sgt. Vincennes.
                  Requesting a name and address on a
                  phone number.  Hollywood zero-one-
                  two-three-nine.

                                OPERATOR (V.O.)
                         (filtered)
                  Please hold the line... No such
                  number is assigned.

                                JACK
                  I just called it.

                                OPERATOR (V.O.)
                  No, Sergeant.  I checked twice.

                                JACK
                         (realizes, hangs up)
                  A bootleg...


        INT. MUSTER ROOM - NIGHT

        Exley surveys the carousing rowdies.  Raising his
        voice...

                                EXLEY
                  All right, men.  You've had your
                  fun.  Time to break it up.

        The party continues undiminished.  From across the room,
        Stensland eyes Exley with disdain.

                                STENSLAND
                  Fucking Exley.  Guy's got a pole
                  so far up his ass, every time he
                  farts the flag waves.


        WATCH COMMANDER'S OFFICE

        The command not really his, Exley reads a report, ignores
        the party, though his window looks into the thick of it.

        Suddenly a ripple goes through the room.  The men begin
        to push out through a rear door.  Exley stands, stops a
        COP.

                                EXLEY
                  What's going on?

                                COP
                  They got the spics who japped
                  Helenowski and Brown.  Helenowski
                  lost an eye and Brown's got brain
                  damage.

                                EXLEY
                  I have the report right here.
                  They're home with bruises and
                  muscle pulls -- Oh shit...

        Exley starts out after them.


        INT. CELL BLOCK - NIGHT

        Stensland in the lead.  Pulling out a blackjack, he
        enters Cell #4, begins wailing on one of the Mexicans --
        Dinardo.

                                STENSLAND
                  For ours, Pancho. And you're
                  getting off easy.

        Cheered on by drunks in the tank and his fellow officers,
        Stensland goes wild.  He's joined by Lentz, Crumley and
        Tristano.  Shaking his head, Jack Vincennes moves away.


        INT. SQUAD ROOM - NIGHT

        Bud types his report with one finger.  Jack looks in.

                                JACK
                  White, you better get a lease on
                  Stens before he kills someone.


        INT. CELL BLOCK - NIGHT

        Followed by Jack, Bud forces his way through the crowd.
        The men who see it's him quickly clear a path.

        Swigging from a pint of gin, Stensland works skinny
        GARCIA.  Head saps.  The kid drops to his knees drooling
        blood.

        Bud grabs Stensland, hauls him off of Garcia who looks
        up.

                                GARCIA
                  Fuck you, pendejo.

                                BUD
                  Yeah yeah...

                                GARCIA
                  And fuck your mother too.

        Bud sees red.  Letting go of Stensland, Bud White picks
        up Garcia by the neck.  There are cheers, "Attaboys" and
        "Holy Fucks" as Bud bangs Garcia's head on the ceiling.

                                EXLEY
                         (arriving)
                  Stop, Officer!  That's an order!

        Cops block Exley's way.  As Bud looks over, Garcia kicks
        him in the balls.  A dangling shot.  Bud keels into the
        bars, Garcia stumbles out of the cell, smack into Jack.

        Jack looks down aghast at blood on his cashmere blazer,
        then puts Garcia down with a left-right.

        Exley pulls a pad of paper and pen form his pocket.

                                EXLEY
                  You're going in my report!  All of
                  you!

        Exley has just started taking names when Bud grabs him by
        the scruff of the neck and hauls him off balance into...


        HALL

        As Exley struggles, a cop opens the door to the store
        room.  Bud slings Exley inside, then slams the door
        tight.  Exley is locked in.  As Bud moves off, we hear
        POUNDING.

                                EXLEY (V.O.)
                  Let me out!  That's an order!


        CELL BLOCK

        The Herald Reporter and photographer enter unchaperoned
        and unnoticed.  Stensland swings like a madman.  That's
        when a flashbulb goes off.  Freezing everyone in black
        and white.

                                                   DISSOLVE TO:


        INT. CHIEF'S OFFICE - DAY

        The CHIEF sits behind a desk in a four-star uniform.
        Dudley Smith sits to his left, D.A. Ellis Loew to his
        right.  Seen earlier at the Mickey Cohen press
        conference, Loew is the only civilian.  Bud White stands
        across from them.  There to be judged.

                                CHIEF
                  Officer White, you've refused to
                  cooperate with Internal Affairs.
                  But you should know this is bigger
                  than a police board.  Indictments
                  may be handed down.  Quite
                  frankly, we need police witnesses
                  to offset the damage done to the
                  Department's image.  Will you
                  testify?

        Bud glances to a gray tinted mirror, then to the Chief.

                                BUD
                  No, sir.  I won't.

        The Chief sighs, looks to Loew.

                                CHIEF
                  District Attorney Loew.

        Loew steps to Bud, holds up a newspaper with the cell
        block photo.  The headline:  "BLOODY CHRISTMAS."

                                LOEW
                  Bloody Christmas.  The press love
                  to label.  You and Officer
                  Stensland brought the liquor into
                  the precinct.  Stensland was
                  already drunk.  Do you see how
                  appearing as a voluntary witness
                  against him could offset the
                  damage you've done to yourself?

                                BUD
                  I won't do it.
                         (staring at mirror)
                  I won't testify against my partner
                  or anyone else.

                                LOEW
                  This man is a disgrace.

                                CHIEF
                  Your badge and gun, Officer.

        Bud sets them on The Chief's desk.

                                CHIEF
                  This is the new L.A.P.D., White.
                  You're suspended from duty and
                  dismissed.

        Turning, White shoots the mirror a stiff middle finger as
        he makes his way out.  Dudley Smith hides a smile.


        OTHER SIDE OF GLASS

        Exley watches, involuntarily leans back as Bud passes on
        the other side of the glass.


        THE CHIEF'S OFFICE

        Dudley, Loew and The Chief wait as Exley enters.

                                CHIEF
                  Ed, your observations have been
                  astute.  What's your assessment of
                  this situation?

                                EXLEY
                  The public demands justice, sir.
                  This was a full-fledged riot of
                  policemen.  Shift the guilt to men
                  whose pensions are secured.  Force
                  them to retire.  But someone has
                  to swing.  Indict, try and convict
                  Stensland and Bud White.  Secure
                  them jail time.  Feed them to the
                  sharks, sir.  Protect yourself;
                  protect the department.

        Dudley gives Exley a look.  He's angry with him.

                                DUDLEY
                  Stensland's a disgrace.  Straight
                  D fitness reports from every C.O.
                  he ever served under.  But White
                  is a valuable officer.

                                EXLEY
                  White's a mindless thug.

                                DUDLEY
                  No, Edmund.  He's a man who can
                  answer yes to those questions I
                  ask you from time to time.

        The Chief interrupts with his own concern.

                                CHIEF
                  I want to know who we give the
                  public in contrast?  The
                  department needs role models.
                  Clean-cut, forthright men the
                  public can admire.

                                EXLEY
                  I'll testify, sir.  I'm not afraid
                  to do what's right.

                                CHIEF
                  And I'll promote you.  You'll be a
                  lieutenant immediately.

        Exley seizes the moment, going over Dudley's head.

                                EXLEY
                  Detective lieutenant.

        The Chief and Dudley exchange a look.  Neither approves.

                                CHIEF
                  Ed, you're 30.  Your father didn't
                  make lieutenant until he was 33.

                                EXLEY
                  I know that, sir.  I also know
                  that when he made lieutenant, it
                  was as a detective.

                                LOEW
                         (interrupting)
                  Before we start polishing our
                  laurels, it would look better if
                  we had a corroborative witness.

                                DUDLEY
                  That'll be hard to come by.  The
                  men hate a turncoat.

                                EXLEY
                  Jack Vincennes.  He's the
                  technical advisor on 'Badge of
                  Honor,' sir.  He lives for it.
                  That's the way to get him.

                                CHIEF
                  All right, Ed.
                         (into desk
                          intercom)
                  Call Sergeant Vincennes.

        As Exley starts out, Dudley pulls him aside, speaks low.

                                DUDLEY
                  You'll reap the benefits, but are
                  you truly prepared to be despised
                  within the department?

                                EXLEY
                  Yes, Dudley.  I am.

                                DUDLEY
                  So be it.


        JACK VINCENNES

        Looking sharp, he strides down the hall, enters the...


        CHIEF'S OFFICE

        Round two.  Centred on Jack.  Exley is gone.

                                DUDLEY
                  Sergeant, we'll get right to it.
                  Nine civilian witnesses have
                  identified you as hitting Ezekiel
                  Garcia.

                                LOEW
                  But my office has a stellar
                  witness who will tell the grand
                  jury that you hit back only after
                  being hit.

                                JACK
                  What do I have to do?

                                LOEW
                  Testify against the three officers
                  who have already earned their
                  pensions.  Our key witness will
                  testify roundly, but you can plead
                  ignorance to questions directed at
                  the other men.

                                CHIEF
                  I'll guarantee you a slap on the
                  wrist.  A brief suspension
                  followed by a temporary transfer
                  from Narcotics to Ad Vice.
                         (a beat)
                  When you transfer out of Vice,
                  you'll be back on the show.

                                JACK
                  The show, sir?

                                CHIEF
                  Badge of Honor, Vincennes.  We
                  need to tone down your profile for
                  a bit.

        The Chief just got Jack where he lives.

                                DUDLEY
                  John, I doubt you've ever drawn a
                  stupid breath.  Don't start now.

                                JACK
                  Okay.  I'll do it.

        Smiles all around.  Loew smiles at the two-way.  A move
        not lost on Jack who wonders who might be on the other
        side.

                                CHIEF
                  Dismissed, Vincennes.

        Jack leaves.  The Chief steps to the mirror, looks
        through.

                                CHIEF
                  So be it.  Detective Lieutenant.


        OTHER SIDE OF GLASS

        Exley clenches his fist in victory.  The Chief continues.

                                CHIEF
                  Ace them at the grand jury
                  tomorrow, son.  Wear the smart-
                  looking suit and ace them.  And,
                  Ed?  Lose the glasses.


        INT. ROOM 114 (GRAND JURY WITNESS ROOM) - DAY

        Glasses off, Exley waits, looks up as Jack enters.

                                JACK
                  You're the key witness?

                                EXLEY
                  That's right.

                                JACK
                  I should've known.  What's the
                  Chief throwing you?

                                EXLEY
                  Throwing me?

                                JACK
                  Yeah, Exley.  What's the payoff?

                                EXLEY
                  You're the payoff expert.  I'm
                  just doing my duty.

                                JACK
                  You're playing an angle, college
                  boy.  You're getting something out
                  of this so you don't have to
                  hobnob with the fucking rank and
                  file cops who'll hate your guts
                  for snitching.  If they're making
                  you a detective, watch out.  Some
                  Bureau guys are gonna burn in this
                  and you're gonna have to work with
                  friends of theirs.

                                EXLEY
                  What about you?

                                JACK
                  I'm snitching three old timers
                  who'll be fishing in Oregon next
                  week.  Next to you I'm clean.  And
                  smart.

        At that, a CLERK steps in from the hallway.

                                CLERK
                  Edmund J. Exley to chambers.

        As Exley's about to go...

                                JACK
                  Just remember, Bud White'll fuck
                  you for this if it takes the rest
                  of his life.  They already
                  suspended him.  Just pray he cops
                  a deal and stays on the Department
                  because that is one civilian you
                  do not want on your case.


        INT. TWILIGHT LOUNGE - NIGHT

        An old black guy in a frayed, threadbare tux plays piano.
        Bud, nursing a highball at the bar, steps over to a
        REDHEAD with too much make-up on too many miles.

                                BUD
                  That an old fashioned you're
                  drinking?
                         (as she nods)
                  My name's Bud.

                                REDHEAD
                  Nobody was born with the name Bud.

                                BUD
                  They stick you with a name like
                  Wendell, you look for an alias.

                                REDHEAD
                  What do you do, Bud?

                                BUD
                  I'm sorta between jobs.  Look,
                  what do you say we, uh...

        A hand on Bud's shoulder.  He turns to see Dudley Smith.

                                DUDLEY
                  Lad, may I have a word with you?

                                BUD
                  This business, Captain?

                                DUDLEY
                  Say goodnight to your friend and
                  join me by those back tables.

        Dudley starts off.  Bud turns back to Redhead, but she's
        already talking to a sailor.


        BOOTH

        Dudley sits at a table.  A newspaper is opened, a little
        mound underneath.  Bud joins Dudley.

                                BUD
                  Does that paper say we've been
                  indicted?  Does it say Exley's a
                  hero for squealing me and
                  Stensland off?

                                DUDLEY
                  He made his play amd he got what
                  he wanted.  They're making him a
                  detective.

                                BUD
                  Captain, what do you want?

                                DUDLEY
                  Call me Dudley.

                                BUD
                  Dudley, what do you want?

                                DUDLEY
                  Lad, I admire your refusal to
                  testify and your loyalty to your
                  partner.  I admire you as a
                  policeman, particularly your
                  adherence to violence as a
                  necessary adjutant to the job.
                  And I am most impressed with your
                  punishment of wife beaters.  Do
                  you hate them, Wendell?

                                BUD
                         (looks away)
                  Yeah, I hate them.

                                DUDLEY
                  And for good reason judging from
                  what I know of your background.

        Bud looks back over.  Dudley's getting too personal.

                                BUD
                  What's going to happen to
                  Stensland?  He'll give himself
                  cirrhosis over this.  He's one
                  year from his pension.

                                DUDLEY
                  It would've happened years ago if
                  you hadn't carried him.  Why the
                  loyalty, Wendell?

                                BUD
                  He helped me out once.  That's all.

                                DUDLEY
                  Your partner's through.
                  Department scapegoat on the
                  Chief's orders.  He's been billed,
                  he'll be indicted and he'll swing.

                                BUD
                  Him and me both.  Fucking Exley.

                                DUDLEY
                  Don't underestimate his skills.
                  As a politician he exceeds even
                  myself.  But the department needs
                  smart men like Exley and... direct
                  men like yourself

                                BUD
                  What do you want?

                                DUDLEY
                  Wendell, I want you to come to
                  work for me.

                                BUD
                  Doing what?  Mowing your fucking
                  lawn?

        Smith yanks the newspaper revealing Bud's badge & .38
        Special.  Bud can't believe his eyes.

                                DUDLEY
                  They're yours.  Take them.

                                BUD
                  I knew you had juice, but...
                  There's no goddamn bill on me?

                                DUDLEY
                  Four of the defendants recanted
                  their testimony.

                                BUD
                  How?

        Dudley dismisses the question with a wave of his hand.

                                DUDLEY
                  I need you for an assignment the
                  Chief's given me the go-ahead on.
                  A duty few men are fit for, but
                  you were born for.  You'll be
                  working out of Homicide.

                                BUD
                         (excited)
                  Homicide?  A detective?

                                CHIEF
                  Your talents lie elsewhere,
                  Wendell.  It's a muscle job and
                  shooting job.  You'll do what I
                  say and not ask questions.  Do you
                  follow my drift?

                                BUD
                         (disappointed)
                  In Technicolor.

                                DUDLEY
                  Will you work for me?

                                BUD
                  Of course... But how?

                                DUDLEY
                  How what, Wendell?

                                BUD
                  How'd you get them to retract?

        Dudley lays brass knuckles on the table.  They're
        chipped, caked with blood.

                                                   DISSOLVE TO:


        L.A. MONTAGE

        Over the pop song "STRANGER IN PARADISE."

        A)  EXT. GRAUMAN'S CHINESE - NIGHT

            Frank Sinatra at the premiere of From Here to
            Eternity.

        B)  INT. KLUB ZAMBOANGA - NIGHT

            Charlie "Bird" Parker makes magic before an
            appreciative, mostly black crowd.

        C)  TORCH SONG TAVERN (RIVERSIDE) - NIGHT

            Nate Janklow exits with his latest flame.  A mob
            lieutenant, Nate was last seen with Mickey Cohen
            outside the Federal Courthouse in the opening
            montage.  A CAR SCREECHES up.  TWO GUNS aim and Nate
            and his date do down in a proverbial HAIL OF LEAD.

        D)  EXT. FREEWAY - DAY

            A groundbreaking.  The Mayor scrapes at the ground
            with a gold shovel.  Pierce Patchett is among the
            distinguished guests.

        END OF MONTAGE


        EXT. HOLLYWOOD HIGH SCHOOL - DAY

        The marquee gushes:  "Today Sgt. Joe Reno:  Badge of
        Honor Star Brett Chase."


        INT. HOLLYWOOD HIGH SCHOOL - AUDITORIUM - DAY

        A nerdy 14-YEAR-OLD asks Brett Chase:

                                14-YEAR-OLD
                  Why'd you become a policeman?

                                CHASE
                  I'm not a policeman.  I just play
                  one on television.  But I think I
                  can answer for them.  To help
                  people.  That's why I do the show.

        Chase looks over and winks at Jack who waits in the
        wings.

                                CHASE
                  To protect and serve.  It's not
                  just a motto.

        As the kids applaud, Chase joins Jack who gives him a
        quick drag of a cigarette.  A nervous PA joins them.
        Chase points out a fetching girl in the second row.

                                CHASE
                  That one.  In the sweater.
                         (to Jack)
                  They also serve who only stand and
                  wait.

        Chase and Jack watch the PA ask "Sweater" a question
        while pointing to Chase.  Maybe sixteen, she nods "yes"
        eagerly.

                                CHASE
                  Jack, I'll see you Monday on set.

                                JACK
                  I won't be there.  They're toning
                  down my profile.


        PRINTING PRESS

        The latest issue of Hush-Hush flies through.  On the
        cover:  "Gail Russell Caught In Love Nest.  Nymph or
        No?"


        INT. CITY JAIL - DAY

        Bud White flips through today's booking slips, finds one
        that's interesting.  Reading to himself...

                                BUD
                  Domestic.  Assault and battery.

        Containment Squad strong-arms, BREUNING and CARLISLE
        pause as they pass.

                                CARLISLE
                  Ready to go, Bud?

                                BUD
                  I'll be there in five minutes.


        CITY JAIL - HALLWAY

        Bud walks to a door covered in sheet metal.  He opens it
        to reveal a holding tank with a burly, jumpsuited
        PRISONER.

                                BUD
                  I hear you like to hit women.

                                PRISONER
                  My wife.  She's dropping charges
                  so it's none of your business.

        Bud enters, closes the door behind him.  A beat, we hear
        the sounds of FISTS ON FLESH.  It's Bud's business now.


        INT. BEVERLY HILLS MANSION - STUDY - NIGHT

        Deuce Perkins (the Mickey Cohen narcotics lieutenant seen
        earlier) stands at the bookshelf.  He pulls down books to
        reveal a shoe box.  He sets it on his desk, pulls back
        the cover to reveal several bags of white powder.
        Heroin.

        A BRANCH SNAPS outside.  Perkins opens a drawer, fishes a
        revolver.  Turning off the light, he heads to the window.
        His finger parts the curtains.  At that instant, he
        staggers, falls as GUNFIRE rips into him.

        The heroin just sits there on the desk.


        EXT. McNEIL PENITENTIARY - DAY

        Grim-faced guards scan the yard from machine-gunned
        towers.


        INT. McNEIL PENITENTIARY - VISITOR BOOTH - DAY

        Mickey Cohen sits across from visitor Johnny Stompanato.
        Cohen is going off the handle.

                                COHEN
                  What do you mean Deuce Perkins got
                  clipped last night?!

                                STOMPANATO
                  They shot him in his library.

                                COHEN
                  I don't want a floor plan; I want
                  to know who!  Who's taking the
                  ticket for this, Johnny?

                                STOMPANATO
                  Nobody.  At least not yet.

                                COHEN
                  And what about the merchandise
                  Deuce was holding for me?

                                STOMPANATO
                  Gone.  Not a trace.

                                COHEN
                  Some ferstunkener is moving in and
                  we don't know who?!  Maybe we
                  should ask Hedda Hopper!

        As "STRANGER IN PARADISE" ENDS, so does the MONTAGE.


        INT. BRIEFING ROOM - AD VICE - DAY

        Addressing the squad, a no-nonsense VICE CAPTAIN picks up
        a stack of magazines.

                                VICE CAPTAIN
                  Picture-book smut, gentlemen.
                  There's been a bunch of it found
                  at collateral crime scenes lately.
                  Mostly narcotics and prostitution
                  collars.

        As the Vice Capt. hands it out for the men to examine,
        new member Jack Vincennes arrives late.

                                VICE CAPTAIN
                  Look who's back from suspension.
                  We're honored, Sergeant Jack.

        The men laugh.  Jack sits, flips a magazine.  Men and
        women.  Men and men.  Girls and girls.  Girls and horses.

                                JACK
                  Gee.  The Great Jerk-Off Book
                  Caper of 1953.

                                VICE CAPTAIN
                  Vincennes, is there someplace
                  you'd rather be?

                                JACK
                  Yeah, Cap.  Back in Narcotics.

                                VICE CAPTAIN
                  Oh?  Anyplace else?

                                JACK
                  Working whores with squad two.

                                VICE CAPTAIN
                  Maybe you should have thought of
                  that before you made Bloody
                  Christmas page one.

        Vice Capt. retrieves the magazines, hands them to Jack.

                                VICE CAPTAIN
                  They're yours.  Make a major case,
                  Sergeant.  It's the only way
                  you're getting out of here.

        Exaggerated "oohs" and "aahs" from the men.

                                VICE CAPTAIN
                  Dismissed, gentlemen.

        As they go, Jack sees the books are stamped:  "Fleur-de-Lis
        Whatever you desire."  Jack takes the matching
        business card from his wallet, the one he found on
        Christmas Eve.

                                VICE CAPTAIN
                  Roll, Vincennes.  No sidetracks.
                  This is Ad Vice, not Narco.


        INT. HOLLYWOOD STATION - NARCO PEN - DAY

        Jack Vincennes is at his desk.  Holding the Fleur-de-Lis
        card, magazines spread before him, Jack dials the number.


        INT. HUSH-HUSH MAGAZINE OFFICE - DAY

        Sid Hudgeons sits behind his desk, answers the phone.

                                HUDGEONS
                  Hush-Hush.  Off the record and on
                  the Q.T.

                                JACK (V.O.)
                  Sid, it's Vincennes.

                                HUDGEONS
                  Jackie, are you back on Narco?  I
                  need copy.

        INTERCUT WITH Jack at his desk:

                                JACK
                  No.  But I've got something going
                  with Ad Vice.

                                HUDGEONS
                  Something good?

                                JACK
                  Don't know.  I'm chasing picture
                  books.  Fuck shots, but the posers
                  don't look like junkies.  It's
                  well done stuff.  I thought you
                  might have heard something.

        Hudgeons reaches into a stack of papers, pulls out a
        magazine like the one Jack has.

                                HUDGEONS
                  Not a word.

                                JACK
                  What about Fleur-de-Lis?  Their
                  slogan's 'Whatever you desire.'

                                HUDGEONS
                  No.  No, I've heard bupkis.  Jack,
                  I'll talk to you later.  Call me
                  when you get something I can use.
                  Smut's from hunger.  For sad sacks
                  who can't get their ashes hauled

        The LINE CLICKS off.  Jack hesitates a moment before
        cradling the receiver.  Something's not right here.


        EXT. HOLYWOOD STATION - PARKING LOT - TWILIGHT

        As Exley pulls in, his two-way drones:

                                DISPATCHER (V.O.)
                  Park Rangers report three Negro
                  youths discharging shotguns into
                  the air in Griffith Park.
                  Suspects are driving a late model
                  purple Mercury Coupe.

        As the report ends, Exley switches off the two-way and
        gets out of his car.


        INT. HOLLYWOOD STATION - SQUAD ROOM - NIGHT

        Accompanied by Bud, Dick Stensland crams the contents of
        his desk into a box.  Well-wishing cops pat him on the
        back, offer words of encouragement, but Stensland looks
        like he's going to cry.

        It's very bad timing as Exley enters, comes face-to-face
        with them.  This is hatred.

        Acting on impulse, Bud goes after Exley.  It's a mauling.
        Four vicious body shots.  A potentially lethal head shot
        sails wide as Exley falls to the ground.

        As four men move to hold Bud back, Exley looks up at him.

                                EXLEY
                         (gasping)
                  You're just a thug, White.  That's
                  all you'll ever be.

        Dudley steps into the fray.  He helps Exley to his feet.

                                DUDLEY
                  You should stay away from a man
                  when his blood is up.

                                EXLEY
                  His blood's always up.

        Four cops are genuinely having trouble holding Bud back.
        Dudley watches with something bordering on admiration.

                                DUDLEY
                  Then maybe you should stay away
                  from him all the time.


        EXT. HOLLYWOOD STATION - PARKING LOT - NIGHT

        Accompanied by Bud, Stensland reaches his car, loads his
        box of stuff into the trunk.  Bud is moody, pensive.

                                STENSLAND
                  Don't look so down in the mouth,
                  Bud.  You nailed him good.

                                BUD
                  Yeah, sure... I got a couple of
                  hours before I have to be at the
                  Victory.  Want to grab a beer?

                                STENSLAND
                  Rain check me, partner.  I got
                  something big going on tonight.

                                BUD
                  What?  That new mystery girl
                  you've been seeing?

                                STENSLAND
                  No.  I'll tell you sometime.  Not
                  now.  Don't want to jinx it.  But
                  it could take the edge off that
                  jail time I got coming.

                                 BUD
                  What are you talking about?

                                STENSLAND
                  It's confidential, Bud.  Like that
                  magazines Vincennes scams for.
                  Hush-Hush.
                         (smiles)
                  I'll see you tomorrow.  And hey,
                  if it works out, you'll get a
                  piece of it.

        Stensland gets in the car, drives off.  Bud is left
        alone.


        INT. HOLLYWOOD STATION - SQUAD ROOM - NIGHT

        Exley sits alone in a sea of desks.  The SQUAWK BOX
        DRONES.  Exley squints at the clock on the wall, can't
        make it out.  He takes his glasses from the inside of his
        jacket.  2:00 A.M.  Finally, something to do.  He walks
        to the wall calendar, tears off Feb. 28 to reveal Mar. 1.

        As Exley sits, the call SQUAWK BOX booms to life.

                                VOICE
                  Squad call!  Nite Owl Coffee Shop
                  One-eight-one-two-four Cherokee!
                  Multiple homicides!  Multiple
                  homicides!  Code three!


        EXT. HOLLYWOOD AND CHEROKEE - NIGHT

        Patrol cars.  Blues setting up a crime scene blockade.
        Exley pulls up, DOUSES his SIREN.  PATROLMAN #1 runs
        over.

                                PATROLMAN #1
                  Loads of people down.  Men.
                  Women.  I stopped for coffee --

        Exley pushes him aside, heads for the door.  It's wide
        open.


        INT. NITE OWL - NIGHT

        Exley takes mental snapshots.  Ten stools front a
        counter.  The side wall mural-papered:  winking owls
        perched on street signs.  On the right a string of
        tables.  Three in disarray.  Food spilled, dishes broken.
        A high-heel pump by an upended chair.

        Heel drag marks across the linoleum floor heading back
        toward the kitchen.  Exley follows.  Past an open, empty
        cash register.  Outside -- SIRENS.


        SERVICE RUNWAY

        Crisscrossed drag marks connect, lead to a walk-in...


        FOOD LOCKER

        Blood-soaked bodies on the floor.  Five, maybe six in a
        tangle.  Dozens of shotgun shells float in the pools of
        blood.  As Exley struggles to maintain his composure...

                                ROOKIE (O.S.)
                  Holy shit fuck...

        Exley looks at a green-faced ROOKIE in the locker
        doorway.

                                ROOKIE
                  S-s-sir, there's a captain outside
                  wants to see you.

                                EXLEY
                  Don't get sick!  Not in here!

        Exley shoves the Rookie, puking, out the door.


        EXT. NITE OWL - NIGHT

        Patrolmen hold back a swarm of reporters and rubber-
        neckers.  HORNS BLAST.  Motorcycles run interference for
        meat wagons cut off by the crown.  As Ed emerges,
        reporters surge, shout questions.  Exley hurries past,
        finds Dudley in command and barking orders.

                                EXLEY
                  Sir, I took the call.  It's my
                  case.

                                DUDLEY
                  Edmund, you don't want it and you
                  can't have it.

                                EXLEY
                  Yes, I do, sir.

                                DUDLEY
                  It's mine.  I'll make you my
                  second in command.

        Exley spots a photographer moving in.  He looks properly
        serious as the flash bulb pops.


        INT. NIGHT OWL - NIGHT

        Forensics Chief RAY PINKER walks Exley and Dudley
        through.

                                PINKER
                  We got a total of forty-five spent
                  12-gauge Remington shotgun shells.
                  Three men with five-shot-capacity
                  pumps.  All of them reloading
                  twice.

                                EXLEY
                  Hold on... We need to canvass.
                  See if a purple Mercury was seen
                  around here tonight.

                                DUDLEY
                  Why?

                                EXLEY
                  We got a call earlier on three
                  Negro youths.  Firing shotguns in
                  Griffith Park from a late-model
                  purple Mercury Coupe.

                                DUDLEY
                         (to his adjutant)
                  Get on it.

        A FORENSICS COP approaches Pinker.

                                FORENSICS COP
                  We got an I.D. on one of the
                  victims, sir... I think it's Dick
                  Stensland.

        Exley and Dudley react, look at each other.


        EXT. VICTORY MOTEL - DAWN

        Set in a no-man's-land of bulldozed homes.  A sign
        proudly announces the impending arrival of the freeway.
        The motel is surrounded by a barbed-wire fence.
        Abandoned but for a pair of LAPD cars and a light burning
        in room 6.

        An unmarked pulls up and Exley and Dudley step out.  They
        start forward, but a SCREAM inside 6 stops Exley short.

                                DUDLEY
                  With Mickey Cohen in prison, Los
                  Angeles is organized crime free.
                  The Chief wants it to stay that
                  way, Edmund.  The means are not
                  for the weak-hearted.


        INT. VICTORY MOTEL - ROOM 6 - DAWN

        Bare.  A table and chair bolted to the floor.  A tough
        FLAT-NOSED GANGSTER is cuffed to the hot seat.  On the
        table are a .45 and a fat roll of $100 bills.

        Breuning and Carlisle watch as Bud White delivers a
        couple of short, stiff body shots.  Flatnose is not used
        to being on the receiving end.  All the same, we get the
        idea Bud's a bit reluctant.

        Bud's back is to Dudley and Exley who enter behind him.

                                DUDLEY
                  Come, Wendell, you can do better
                  than that.

        Bud turns, sees Exley and Dudley.  A beat.  As Bud looms
        over Flatnose, the gangster babbles.  Snitch-frenzied.

                                FLATNOSE
                  I know things.  I hear things.
                  Like with the Mick inside, things
                  are on this weird slowdown.
                                (MORE)

                                FLATNOSE (CONT'D)
                  These shooter teams, bang bang
                  bang, they're 86-ing Mickey
                  Cohen's men.

                                DUDLEY
                  We know all that, lad.  Tell us,
                  who do these shooters work for?

                                FLATNOSE
                  I don't know.  No one knows.
                  Maybe they're mavericks.  You want
                  a prostie roust?  Huh?  Some narco
                  action?
                         (breaking down)
                  What do you want?!

                                DUDLEY
                  We want you to go home.
                         (to Breuning)
                  Uncuff him, Michael.

        Dudley turns to Exley.

                                DUDLEY
                  Mr. Sifakis is a known loan shark
                  from San Francisco.  He arrived
                  this afternoon at Union Station.
                  Looking for business opportunities
                  in our fair city.  An organized
                  crime associate in need of re-
                  education in the ways of polite
                  society.

        Uncuffed, Flatnose rubs his wrists.  Wary.  As Breuning
        steps back, Flatnose snatches the .45 off the table.

                                FLATNOSE
                  Motherfuckers!

        Exley dives for cover, but the other four cops just stand
        there.  Dudley looks down on the floor at Exley.

                                DUDLEY
                  It's part of the play, Edmund.  A
                  sincerity test.

        Flatnose looks at the gun a beat, then squeezes the
        TRIGGER.  CLICK CLICK.  No bullets.

                                DUDLEY
                         (to Breuning)
                  Sit him back down.

        CLICK, CLICK.  They shove Flatnose back in the hot seat.
        Dudley offers a hand to Exley, helps him to his feet.

                                DUDLEY
                  Wendell, you need to accompany
                  Detective Lieutenant Exley on
                  official police business.  I'll
                  finish up here.


        INT. EXLEY'S PLYMOUTH - DAY

        They drive in silence.  No love lost here.  Finally.

                                 BUD
                  Where are we going?

                                EXLEY
                  It's a surprise.  You like
                  surprises, don't you, White?


        EXT. COUNTY MORGUE - DAY

        Exley pulls up.  Bud looks to him.  Really curious now.


        INT. COUNTY MORGUE - HALLWAY - DAY

        Exley and Bud walk.  An orderly wheels a covered corpse
        toward them from the other end of the hall.  Bud's
        spooked.  The orderly wheels the body in to the
        examination room.

        As Bud and Exley pass, the CORONER pulls back the sheet,
        is surprised at the sight of a woman who we don't quite
        see.

                                CORONER
                  Call me crazy, but for a second I
                  thought it was Rita Hayworth.


        MORGUE MEAT LOCKER

        Exley and Bud walk past a wall of drawers to where a
        coroner's assistant waits.

                                EXLEY
                  We need you to I.D. the body.
                  There's no next of kin and you
                  knew him best.  So tell me...

        The assistant pulls open drawer 12.  A naked man.

        A tag on his toe and half his face blown off.

                                EXLEY
                  Is that Dick Stensland?

        Stunned, Bud stares at what's left of his old partner.

                                 BUD
                  Yeah, that's Stens.

                                EXLEY
                  Hell of a way to avoid a prison
                  sentence.

        Bud's torn between wanting to smash Exley and finding out
        why Stensland is dead.  He squeezes out the words.

                                BUD
                  What happened?

                                EXLEY
                  Someone held up a coffee shop,
                  panicked and killed six people.

        Then, from the hall...

                                WOMAN (O.S.)
                  Not my baby!  Not my little girl!


        INT. COUNTY MORGUE - EXAMINATION ROOM - DAY

        HILDA LEFFERTS, 50, enters with the coroner to ID the
        body of her daughter, Susan.

        There's stray buckshot in the upper chest and shoulders,
        but a sheet hides the real damage.  It's the girl Bud saw
        outside Hollywood Liquor.  Without the black eyes, she
        does look like Rita hayworth.

        As Bud and Exley appear, Mrs. Lefferts looks confused.

                                CORONER
                  Is this your daughter, Mrs.
                  Lefferts?

                                MRS. LEFFERTS
                  I -- I don't know.

                                EXLEY
                  We know this is difficult.  Just
                  take your time and look again.

        Exley doesn't realize, but Bud recognizes the deceased.

                                MRS. LEFFERTS
                  It seems like my Susan, but...

                                EXLEY
                  When was the last time you saw
                  her, Mrs. Lefferts?

                                MRS. LEFFERTS
                  At Christmas.  We had fought.  I
                  didn't like her boyfriend.  I --
                  she has a birthmark on her hip.

        The Coroner lifts the sheet.  Mrs. Lefferts gasps.

                                MRS. LEFFERTS
                  It's her.  My baby.  Dear God...

        As Mrs. Lefferts swoons, Bud and Exley both hold her up.


        INT. LAPD HEADQUARTERS - BRIEFING ROOM - DAY

        The room buzzes, jammed to the rafters with every
        detective standing ready.  The Chief waits as Dudley
        Smith takes the mike, holds up an L.A. Times headline.

                                DUDLEY
                  'Nite Owl Massacre.'  Hyperbole
                  aside, this is a heinous crime
                  that requires a swift resolution.
                  The public will demand it and this
                  department will provide it.  Six
                  victims.  One of them, one of our
                  own -- Dick Stensland.
                         (as the cops react)
                  As it happens, he was a Nite Owl
                  regular.  In the wrong place at
                  the wrong time.

        Bud White listens, not too sure.  Stensland said he had
        something big going on...

                                DUDLEY
                  Robbery looks like the motive.  We
                  have rubber glove prints on the
                  register and preliminary forensics
                  strongly lean toward a trio of
                  gunmen.  We do have one hot lead,
                  so listen well.  Three Negro
                  youths were seen last night
                  discharging shotguns in the air at
                  Griffith Park.
                  A park ranger I.D.ed them as
                  driving a 1948 to 1950 Mercury
                  Coupe, purple in color.  An hour
                  ago, a canvassing crew found a
                  news vendor who saw a purple Merc
                  Coupe parked across from the Nite
                  Owl around 3:00 A.M.

        The room goes loud, a big rumbling.  Dudley holds up a
        list.

                                DUDLEY
                  The D.M.V. worked all night to get
                  us a registration list on '48 to
                  '50 purple Mercs.  There are 142
                  registered to Negroes in L.A.
                  County.  Fifty two-man teams will
                  shake three names apiece.  Hot
                  suspects you'll bring here.
                  Interrogation rooms have been set
                  up.  They'll be run by Lieutenant
                  Edmund Exley.  Hollywood Squad.

        Catcalls.  Boos.  The Chief steps to the mike.

                                CHIEF
                  Enough on that.  Gentlemen, just
                  go out and get them.  Use all
                  necessary force.  The people of
                  Los Angeles demand it.

        The men exchange knowing looks.  The real message:  kill
        them clean.  Exley doesn't approve.  As the men hurry
        out...

                                EXLEY
                  He might as well have put a bounty
                  on them.


        INT. SQUAD ROOM - DAY

        Detectives pairing up and moving out.  Scanning his three
        name list, Bud joins his PARTNER for the day.

                                 BUD
                  Can you take them?  I got
                  I got something I gotta do.

                                PARTNER
                  Christ, I don't know.  What if one
                  of these names...

                                 BUD
                  What I gotta do is for Stensland.
                  My partner.

        The guy looks at him a beat, nods.  As Bud heads off...


        EXLEY

        watches everyone go.  Wishes he could be part of the
        action.  He spots Jack talking to his REDNECK partner for
        for the day.


        JACK AND REDNECK

        Redneck chews tobacco, has a Texas drawl.

                                REDNECK
                  Where to, Trash?

                                JACK
                  If we go by the list, we have
                  about zero chance of making the
                  collar.  But I know a guy who
                  knows what's going on south of
                  Jefferson.  I'm betting he could
                  put us at 50/50.

                                REDNECK
                  I don't know...

        As Redneck thinks, Exley steps up.  He's overheard.

                                EXLEY
                  I'll take those odds.
                         (to Redneck)
                  Take off.  We got it from here.

        Jack stares.  Redneck shrugs, spits tobacco juice in a
        cup.

                                REDNECK
                  Between the two of you guys, you
                  should bring along a photographer.


        INT. HOLLYWOOD LIQUOR - DAY

        Last time we saw the Owner was Christmas Eve.  He looks
        up from a customer as Bud strides in, badge out front.

                                 BUD
                  I need an address on a customer of
                  yours.  Her name was Lynn.

                                OWNER
                  That's all I have to go on?

                                 BUD
                  Yeah.  And I think you already
                  know who I mean, so cough it up.

                                OWNER
                  Lynn Bracken.  There's a billing
                  address and a delivery address.

                                 BUD
                  Give me both.  Billing first.


        EXT. 1184 GRETNA GREEN, BRENTWOOD (PATCHETT'S) - DAY

        A big, pink Spanish mansion with lots of tile.  Also last
        seen outside Hollywood Liquor on Christmas Eve, Pierce
        Patchett is in the front yard, chipping golf balls over a
        koi pond.  They land in a tight grouping.  As he tees up:

                                 BUD (O.S.)
                  You must slay 'em at the country
                  club.

        Bud's halfway up the walk.  Patchett sees the cuffs
        hooked to his belt.  Patchett is cool as can be.

                                 BUD
                  Are you Pierce Patchett?

                                PATCHETT
                  I am.  Are you soliciting for
                  police charities?  The last time,
                  you people called at my office.

                                 BUD
                  I'm a homicide detective.  Where
                  were you last night?

                                PATCHETT
                  I was here, hosting a party.  Who
                  was killed and why do you think I
                  can help?

                                 BUD
                  Richard Stensland.

                                PATCHETT
                  I don't know him.  Mr...

                                 BUD
                  Officer White.  How about Susan
                  Lefferts?  You know her?

                                PATCHETT
                         (sighs, concedes)
                  You know I do or you wouldn't be
                  here.  How did you find me?

                                 BUD
                  We met outside Hollywood Liquors
                  on Christmas Eve.  This is where
                  Lynn Bracken's booze bills go.

                                PATCHETT
                  Of course...

                                 BUD
                  Sue Lefferts died at the Nite Owl.
                  I'm investigating.

        Patchett studies Bud a beat, weighing his options.
        Patchett's burly BODYGUARD starts over from the house.

                                BODYGUARD
                  Everything alright, Mr. Patchett?

                                PATCHETT
                         (waves him off)
                  Fine, Philip.  Thank you.

                                 BUD
                  Where's the other guy?  Buzz.

                                PATCHETT
                  He no longer works for me.
                         (a beat)
                  Find Susan's killer, Mr. White.
                  I'll give you a handsome reward.
                  Whatever you desire.

        If only Jack had been around to hear that.

                                 BUD
                  Thanks, but no thanks.

                                PATCHETT
                  Against your code?

                                 BUD
                  I don't have one.  Lefferts looked
                  beat-up Christmas Eve, but didn't
                  act it.  How come?

                                PATCHETT
                  Do you care about criminal matters
                  peripheral to Susan's murder?

                                 BUD
                  No.

                                PATCHETT
                  Then you wouldn't feel obligated
                  to report them?

                                 BUD
                  That's right.

                                PATCHETT
                  Then listen closely, because I'll
                  only say this once and if it gets
                  repeated, I'll deny it.  I run
                  call girls.  Lynn Bracken is one
                  of them and so was Susan Lefferts.
                  I treat my girls very well.  I
                  have grown daughters, myself, and
                  I don't like the thought of women
                  being hurt.  I sense you share
                  this feeling.

                                 BUD
                         (ignores comment)
                  Why were Lefferts' eyes black?

                                PATCHETT
                  I think she'd been hit in the face
                  with a tennis racket.  She is --
                  was -- a big doubles fan.

                                 BUD
                  You wanna go downtown and discuss
                  this officially?

                                PATCHETT
                  Wait.  Our deal still holds?

        Bud nods, his patience running thin.

                                PATCHETT
                  I needed a Rita Hayworth to fill
                  out my little studio.

                                 BUD
                  What little studio?

                                PATCHETT
                  There's Gardner, Hepburn, Grable,
                  Turner.  Lynn Bracken is my
                  Veronica Lake.  I use girls who
                  look like movie stars.  Sometimes
                  I employ a plastic surgeon.

                                 BUD
                  That's why her mother couldn't
                  I.D. her... Jesus fucking Christ.

                                PATCHETT
                  No, Mr. White.  Pierce Morehouse
                  Patchett.  Now, I sense you're on
                  your best behavior, but that's all
                  I'll give you.  If you persist,
                  I'll meet you with my attorney.
                  Now, would you like Miss Bracken's
                  address?  I doubt she knows
                  anything, but --

                                 BUD
                  I got her address.

                                PATCHETT
                  Of course... this is personal with
                  you, isn't it, Mr. White?

        Bud turns, heads down the walk.  Patchett hits his golf
        ball.  It lands just past the koi pond, with the rest.
        Ice.


        EXT. 1736 NOTTINGHAM, LOS FELIZ (LYNN BRACKEN'S) - DAY

        A modern-looking triplex.  A projector's flicker strobes
        against the closed curtains.  We hear a PHONE RING.


        INT. 1736 NOTTINGHAM (LYNN BRACKEN'S) - DAY

        The film is This Gun For Hire with Alan Ladd and Veronica
        Lake.  It's projected on a wall in front of which stands
        Lynn Bracken and an OLDER GENTLEMAN, in his underwear.
        Lynn's long, blonde hair hangs down over one eye.  She
        looks more like Veronica Lake than Veronica Lake.  The
        film flashes over them as they kiss.

        The PHONE RINGS.  Lynn ignores it as long as she can
        before breaking away to go answer it.

                                LYNN
                  Hello?

                                OLDER GENTLEMAN
                         (Alan Ladd)
                  Is it the cops?

        She waves him off.  As he practices pointing his finger
        like Ladd points a gun, Lynn reacts to the news on the
        phone.


        EXT. 9781 SOUTH DUQUESNE - DAY

        A South Central plywood and tar-paper dive.  A BLACK
        BOXER pounds a heavy bag/speed bag combo bolted to the
        porch.  Wiry, a welterweight, he doesn't see Jack and
        Exley till they're almost on top of him.

                                JACK
                  Leonard Bidwell?

        The Boxer leans on the bag to catch his breath.  Looking
        them over, he finally nods.

                                JACK
                  How's the left these days?

                                BOXER
                  What's it to you?

                                JACK
                  I saw you fight Kid Gavilan.  I
                  like your style.

                                BOXER
                  What do you want, Mr. Policeman?

                                JACK
                  You got a brother up in Folsom.  I
                  know because I put him there.

                                BOXER
                  Till 19-fucking-70.

                                JACK
                  How'd you like to make it 1960?  I
                  know the judge and Sergeant Exley
                  here is friends with hte D.A.

        Exley nods, this is true.  The Boxer's still listening.

                                JACK
                  We're looking for three colored
                  guys who like to pop off shotguns.
                  One of 'em owns a purple Merc
                  coupe.

                                BOXER
                  You wanna get me a fuckin' snitch
                  jacket?

                                JACK
                  You wanna buy your brother ten
                  years...?  You don't have to say
                  anything.  Just look at this list
                  and point.  Here.

        Jack holds the DMV list out to the Boxer, who waves it
        off.

                                BOXER
                  He's bad, so I'll just tell you.
                  Sugar Ray Coates.  Drives a '49
                  coupe, a beautiful ride.  Don't
                  know about shotguns, but he gets
                  his thrills killing dogs.  He is
                  righteous trash.

        Jack and Exley scan the list.  Jack's finger stabs down
        on, "Coates, Raymond, 9611 South Central, Room 414."

                                JACK
                  That's five minutes from here.


        EXT. 1736 NOTTINGHAM (LYNN BRACKEN'S) - DAY

        Lynn does her best to usher the slightly disheveled
        Older Gentleman out the door.

                                OLDER GENTLEMAN
                  I don't understand, doll, we just
                  got started.

                                LYNN
                  I'm sorry, but I'll make it up
                  to you.  I promise.

                                OLDER GENTLEMAN
                  Gosh, kitten, I don't know...

        As he begins to mash up against her...

                                BUD (O.S.)
                  Hit the road, gramps.

        Bud's standing at the bottom of the stairs.  The Older
        Gentleman strikes a pose.  He still thinks he's Alan
        Ladd.

                                OLDER GENTLEMAN
                  Alright.  This time I'll go, but
                  next time --

                                BUD
                         (flips badge)
                  L.A.P.D., shitbird.  Get the fuck
                  out of here or I'll call your wife
                  to come get you.

        Sputtering, the Older Gentleman exchanges a look with
        Lynn then hurries away, giving Bud a wide berth.

                                LYNN
                  I've been expecting you.  Pierce
                  called.  Told me what happened
                  to Sue.


        INT. 1736 NOTTINGHAM (LYNN BRACKEN'S) - DAY

        A nice breezy feel.  The perfect place to shack up.

                                LYNN
                  It's Officer White, isn't it?

        Bud nods, eyeballs the place.

                                LYNN
                  Can I get you a drink?

                                BUD
                  Yeah, plain scotch.

        Bud watches her move to the bar.  God, she's beautiful.

                                LYNN
                  I was friendly with Sue Lefferts,
                  but we weren't really friends.
                  You know what I mean?

                                BUD
                  Are you sorry she's dead?

                                LYNN
                  Of course I am.  What kind of
                  question is that?

        She steps back with a scotch for both of them.

                                BUD
                  Have you ever heard of Dick
                  Stensland?

                                LYNN
                  No I haven't.  Do you know why
                  Pierce is humoring you?

                                BUD
                  You use words like that, you
                  might make me mad.

                                LYNN
                  Yes.  But do you know?

                                BUD
                  Yeah I know.  Patchett's running
                  whores and judging by his address,
                  probably something bigger on the
                  side.  He doesn't want any
                  attention.

                                LYNN
                  That's right.  Our motives are
                  selfish, so we're cooperating.

                                BUD
                  Why was Susan Lefferts at the
                  Nite Owl?

                                LYNN
                  I don't know.  I never heard of
                  the Nite Owl till today.

                                BUD
                  Did Lefferts have a boyfriend?

                                LYNN
                  Like I said we were friendly,
                  not friends.

                                BUD
                  How'd she meet Patchett?

                                LYNN
                  Pierce meets people.  Sue came
                  on the bus with dreams of
                  Hollywood.  This is how they
                  turned out.  Thanks to Pierce,
                  we still get to act a little.

                                BUD
                  Tell me about Patchett.

                                LYNN
                  He's waiting for you to mention
                  mention.

                                BUD
                  You want some advice, Miss
                  Bracken?

                                LYNN
                  It's Lynn.

                                BUD
                  Miss Bracken, don't ever try to
                  fucking bribe me or threaten me
                  or I'll have you and Patchett
                  in shit up to your ears.

        Lynn smiles again.  She likes Bud.  A beat.

                                LYNN
                  I remember you from Christmas
                  Eve.  You have a thing for
                  helping women, don't you,
                  Officer White?

                                BUD
                  Maybe I'm just fucking curious.

                                LYNN
                  You say 'fuck' a lot.

                                BUD
                  You fuck for money.

                                LYNN
                  There's blood on your shirt.  Is
                  that an integral part of your job?

                                BUD
                  Yeah.

                                LYNN
                  Do you enjoy it?

                                BUD
                  When they deserve it.

                                LYNN
                  Did they deserve it today?

                                BUD
                  I'm not sure.

                                LYNN
                  But you did it anyway.

                                BUD
                  Yeah, just like the half dozen
                  guys you screwed today.

                                LYNN
                         (laughs again)
                  Actually, it was two.  You're
                  different, Officer White.  You're
                  the first man in five years who
                  didn't tell me I look like
                  Veronica Lake inside of a minute.

                                BUD
                  You look better than Veronica
                  Lake.  Now, Pierce Patchett.

                                LYNN
                  He takes a cut of our earnings
                  and invests it for us.  He makes
                  us quit the life at thirty.  He
                  doesn't let us use narcotics and
                  he doesn't abuse us.  Can your
                  policeman's mentality grasp
                  those contradictions?

                                BUD
                  He had you cut to look like
                  Veronica Lake?

                                LYNN
                  No.  I'm really a brunette, but
                  the rest is me.  And that's all
                  the news that's fit to print.

        Lynn starts toward the door.  Bud watches her a moment,
        then follows.  She takes his glass at the door.

                                LYNN
                  It was nice meeting you, Officer.

        Out the door, Bud turns back.  Blurts:

                                BUD
                  Look.  I want to see you again.

                                LYNN
                  Are you asking me for a date or
                  an appointment?

                                BUD
                         (suddenly unsure)
                  I don't know.

                                LYNN
                         (another smile)
                  If it's a date I think you'd
                  better tell me your first name
                  because I --

                                BUD
                         (feeling foolish)
                  Forget I asked.  It was a
                  mistake.

        Lynn watches thoughtfully after Bud as he walks away.
        He opens his car door like he's going to tear ir off.
        A last glance back at Lynn and as he gets in the car...


        EXT. TEVERE HOTEL - DAY

        An L-shaped walk-up.  Jack coasts the car to the curb.
        He leaps out with Exley.  Exley holds up at the sight
        of a late model sedan.  He leans down to look in the
        window at the two-way on the dash.

                                EXLEY
                  L.A.P.D.

                                JACK
                  Shit.  Someone beat us here.

        VOICES from the carport ahead.  We see a chrome bumper,
        the purple fender of a '49 Mercury coupe.  A door slams.
        Drawing a .45, Jack starts over with Exley, .38 in hand.


        CARPORT

        Toting shotguns, Dudley's boys from the Victory Motel,
        Breuning and Carlisle, stand by the purple Mercury.  Jack
        and Exley come around the corner, lower their guns.

                                JACK
                  Hey.

        Breuning wheels, pumps a round into the chamber.  He very
        nearly fires before he sees who it is.

                                CARLISLE
                  What the fuck are you guys doing
                  here?

                                EXLEY
                  Think of us as back-up.

                                JACK
                  What do you got?

        As Jack moves to peer through the Merc's window.

                                BREUNING
                  Three Ithaca pumps, an empty box
                  of double-ought buck and cash.

        Jack spots them.  Three shotguns on the passenger side
        floor, an empty box of shells and loose dollar bills.

                                JACK
                  So long, Vice.  Badge of Honor,
                  here I come.

                                CARLISLE
                  Fuck you, Vincennes.  It's our
                  collar.

        Breuning actually has to restrain his partner.

                                EXLEY
                  Quiet.  I'm ranking officer here.
                  We go as a team.  End of story.


        INT. CORRIDOR - TEVERE HOTEL - DAY

        Breuning and Carlisle lead the way with Jack and Exley
        bringing up the rear.  Squinting, Exley reaches to his
        pocket for something.  Not there.

                                EXLEY
                  Damnit...

                                JACK
                  What?

                                EXLEY
                  Glasses.

                                JACK
                         (chuckling)
                  Just don't shoot me.

        The door to 414.  Two men on either side.  Breuning rears
        back.  Jack rears back.  They kick at the same instant.
        The door flies off its hinges to reveal two young black
        men, LARRY FONTAINE and TY JONES, waking from a couple
        of flop mattresses.


        ROOM 414

        Fontaine jumps up.  Entering, Carlisle aims, but Exley
        grabs his arm.  The BLAST rips the ceiling.  Jack aims.

                                JACK
                  Freeze!

        Fontaine freezes.  Jones doesn't dare get up.

                                CARLISLE
                  Ace him, Jack.

                                EXLEY
                  Shut up, Carlisle!

        Jack and Exley burst into a...


        SECOND BEDROOM

        Another black, RAY COATES, passed out on mattress, sur-
        rounded by empty beer cans.  Jack sticks his .38 in his
        back, starts to cuff him.  As the cuff ratchets down...


        INT. OBSERVATION ROOM - DAY

        Dudley watches intently as Ed Exley skims a report,
        memorizing names and dates.  Jack and other brass are
        also here along with a stenographer.  So's Bud.  One of
        these guys killed Stensland.  Through tinted glass, the
        three suspects in three different rooms.

                                EXLEY
                  Casitas Youth Camp... Coates
                  twenty-two, a boxer... Manager
                  saw them burning clothes.

        Satisfied, Exley sets the report down.

                                DUDLEY
                  Ed, I want confessions.

                                EXLEY
                  I'll break them, sir.

        As Exley steps into the #1 room, Jack joins Dudley.

                                JACK
                  You think golden boy can handle
                  it, Cap?

                                DUDLEY
                  I think you'll be surprised what
                  Edmund's capable of.


        INT. #1 ROOM - DAY

        Exley closes the door.  Ray Coates is cuffed to a chair,
        dressed in baggy County denims.  One eye swollen shut,
        lip split, a smashed nose with one nostril split.

        Exley unlocks his cuffs. drops cigarettes and amtches
        on the table.  As Coates rubs his wrists...

                                EXLEY
                  They call you Sugar Ray because
                  of Ray Robinson?
                         (no answer)
                  They say Robinson can throw a
                  four punch combination in one
                  second.  Do you believe that?

        Coates just stares at him.

                                EXLEY
                  You're twenty-two, aren't you, Ray?

                                COATES
                  Say what and so what.

                                EXLEY
                  Did one of the officers work you
                  over a little?

        No bite.  Coates just stares back.

                                EXLEY
                  You look like Robinson after
                  that last LaMotta fight.  'Course
                  LaMotta looked a lot worse.  So
                  you're twenty-two, right?

                                COATES
                  Man, why do you keep asking me
                  that?

                                EXLEY
                  Just getting my facts straight.
                  Twenty-two makes it a gas chamber
                  bounce.
                  You should have pulled this caper
                  a couple of years ago.  Get life,
                  do a little Youth Authority jolt,
                  transfer to Folsom a big man.
                  Orbit on some of that good prison
                  brew, get yourself a sissy --

                                COATES
                  I never truck with no sissies!

                                EXLEY
                  That fucking Larry.  I almost
                  believed him.

                                COATES
                  Believed what?

                                EXLEY
                  Nothing, Ray.
                         (laughs)
                  That Larry, he's a pisser.  You
                  did the Casitas Youth Camp with
                  him, didn't you?

                                COATES
                  Man, why're you talkin' about
                  Larry?  His business is his
                  business.

        Unseen by Coates, Exley reaches under the table, takes
        hold of one of three toggle switches.

                                EXLEY
                  Sugar, Larry told me you went
                  sissy up at Casitas.  You
                  couldn't do the time so you
                  found yourself a big white boy
                  to look after you.  He said
                  they call you 'Sugar' because
                  you gave it out so sweet.

        Exley flips the toggle.


        #3 ROOM

        The speaker over Larry Fontaine's head crackles to life.

                                COATES (V.O.)
                  Larry gave it at Casitas!  Man,
                  I was the fuckin' boss jocker on
                  my dorm!  Larry's the sissy!
                  Larry gave it for candy bars!


        #1 ROOM

        Exley flips up the second toggle.

                                EXLEY
                  Ray, you protected Ty and Larry
                  up in Casitas, didn't you?

                                COATES
                  You ain't woofin' I did.  Stupid
                  down home niggers got no more
                  sense than a fuckin' dog.

        Exley flips the switches off.

                                EXLEY
                  I heard you like to shoot dogs.

                                COATES
                  Dogs got no reason to live.

                                EXLEY
                  Oh?  you feel that way about
                  people, too?

                                COATES
                  Man, what're you saying?

                                EXLEY
                  Ray, we got the shotguns.

                                COATES
                  I don't own no shotguns.

                                EXLEY
                  Why were you throwing clothes
                  in the building incinerator?

                                COATES
                         (trembling)
                  Say what?

                                EXLEY
                  You guys were arrested this
                  morning, but none of you have
                  last night's clothes.  You were
                  seen burning them.  Add to that
                  the fact that you hid the car
                  you were cruising around in
                  last night and it doesn't look
                  good.

                                COATES
                  I got nothin' more to say till
                  I see a judge.

                                EXLEY
                  Were you on hop?  You were passed
                  out when you got arrested.  Were
                  you hopped up, Ray?

                                COATES
                  Ty and Larry fuck with that
                  shit, not me.

                                EXLEY
                  Where do they get their stuff?
                  Come on.  Give me one to feed
                  the D.A.  Just a little one.

        Coates nods.  Exley flips up the toggles as he leans
        in.

                                COATES
                  Roland Navarette.  Lives on
                  Bunker Hill.  He runs a hole-up
                  for parole absconders and sells
                  red devils.

        Exley flips down the switches, stands.

                                EXLEY
                  I'm going to take a break.

        Exley opens the door, looks back in afterthought.

                                EXLEY
                  You know, Ray, I'm talking about
                  the gas chamber and you haven't
                  even asked me what this is all
                  about.  You got a big guilty
                  sign around your neck.

        Exley exits.


        OBSERVATION ROOM

        Exley enters.

                                DUDLEY
                  Masterful, Edmund.  Your father
                  would've been proud.
                         (pointing)
                  This one's on the verge.

        Exley looks through the glass into #2.  Larry Fontaine
        is weeping.  A piss puddle on the floor by his chair.

                                EXLEY
                  Fontaine next, but give Jones
                  the newspaper.  I want him
                  primed.


        #2 ROOM

        Fontaine tries to control his sniffles as Exley enters.

                                EXLEY
                  Larry, Ray Coates ratted you
                  off.  He said the Nite Owl was
                  your idea.  You want to tell me
                  about it?

        No answer.

                                EXLEY
                  I think it was Ray's idea.  Talk
                  and I think I can save your life.

        No answer.

                                EXLEY
                  Larry, this is a gas chamber job.
                  If you don't talk, you'll be dead
                  in six months.

        No answer.

                                EXLEY
                  Son, six people are dead and
                  somebody has to pay.  It can be
                  you or it can be Ray.

        No answer.

                                EXLEY
                  Larry, he called you queer.  He
                  said at Casitas you took it up
                  the ass.  He said --

                                FONTAINE
                  I DIDN'T KILL NOBODY!

        The voice is strong, full of conviction.  Exley
        glances at the mirror.  Then...

                                EXLEY
                  Why'd you burn the clothes?

                                FONTAINE
                         (sobbing)
                  I just wanted to lose my cherry.
                  I didn't mean to hurt her.

        Exley can't hide his surprise at this.

                                EXLEY
                  Hurt who?  Was she a hooker?
                  Hurt who?

        But Fontaine is gone.  Head lolling, eyes squeezing
        out tears.


        OBSERVATION ROOM

        Exley steps out of the interrogation room.  Dudley
        braces him.

                                DUDLEY
                  Don't get sidetracked.  Stay with
                  the Nite Owl.

                                EXLEY
                  She may still be alive, whoever
                  she is.

        Bud's all ears.


        #3 ROOM

        Reading, Jones has his feet on the table.  Exley
        bursts in.

                                JONES
                  This newspaper shit ain't shit.

                                EXLEY
                  Where's the girl?  Did you kill her?

        No answer, but Jones looks nervous.

                                EXLEY
                  You wanted Larry to lose his
                  cherry, but things got out of
                  hand.  Is that right?


        OBSERVATION ROOM

        Everyone's attention is riveted, particularly Bud's.
        They watch, listen over the speaker.

                                EXLEY
                         (over speaker)
                  Kick loose, Jones.  I know you
                  made her bleed, but that doesn't
                  mean you killed her.

        No answer, but Jones is squirming.

                                EXLEY
                         (over speaker)
                  If that girl's alive, you've
                  still got a chance on this one.

                                JONES
                         (over speaker)
                  I think she's alive.

                                EXLEY
                         (over speaker)
                  You think?

        Jack turns to Dudley.

                                JACK
                  He's good.  I'll give him that.

        They don't notice as the chair back begins to splinter
        in Bud's hands.


        #3 ROOM

        Exley sits across from him, tries to wrap it up.

                                EXLEY
                  Where is she now?
                         (no answer)
                  Did you leave her someplace?
                         (no answer)
                  Did you sell her out?  Give her
                  to some of your buddies?  Tell
                  me where the girl is!

        The door blasts open.  Bud slams Jones up against the
        wall.  As Exley stands, he bangs his knee on the table.
        Pulling a .38, Bud breaks the cylinder, drops 5 shells
        on the floor.

                                BUD
                  One in six.  Where's the girl?

                                EXLEY
                  Officer White, put down that
                  weapon and --

        Bud shoves the barrel into Jones' mouth, pulls the
        trigger twice.  CLICK, CLICK.  Jones starts to slide
        down the wall.  Bud jerks him back up, roars.

                                BUD
                  WHERE?!

        Two more clicks.  Jones spills.

                                JONES
                  S-sylvester F-fitch one-o-nine
                  and Avalon gray corner house...


        EXT. AVALON BOULEVARD - EVENING

        A four cordon.  They coast up to a GRAY CORNER HOUSE.
        Dudley Smith behind the wheel of the lead cruiser.  Bud
        White rides shotgun, reloading his revolver.

                                BUD
                  Give me one minute.

                                DUDLEY
                  You've got it, Wendell.


        STREET

        Bud is out the door and scooting down an alley.  Exley
        moves to follow, but Dudley cuts him off.

                                DUDLEY
                  We're going through the front.


        ALLEY

        Bud vaults a fence, pads up the back porch.  A screen
        door.  Bud slips the catch with a penknife and walks
        inside.


        SCREEN PORCH

        Bud heads for a blind-covered door.  Unlocked, he
        enters...


        A HALLWAY

        Light bouncing from side rooms.  We hear the opening
        spiel of "Badge of Honor" from the left.  Bud wheels into
        a...


        BEDROOM

        A NUDE GIRL spread-eagled on a mattress.  Bound with
        neckties.  One in her mouth.  Her eyes grow wide at the
        sight of Bud, then flicker to the adjoining room.
        Directing him.  Raising the .38, Bud enters...


        THE KITCHEN

        Sylvester Fitch sits naked at the table wolfing Rice
        Krispies and watching "Badge of Honor" on a flickering
        TV.  He looks up, sees the .38 before he sees Bud beyond
        it.  Fitch drops his spoon, raises his hands.

        Bud SHOOTS him in the face.  Dead, Fitch just sits there.

        Bud moves behind him.  Pulling a spare piece from an
        ankle holster, Bud FIRES back at the door from Fitch's
        line of fire, then puts the gun in Fitch's hand.

        We hear the FRONT DOOR CRASH OPEN.  As Fitch slides off
        the chair to the floor, Bud dumps the Rice Krispies on
        him.


        EXT.  GRAY HOUSE - NIGHT

        The Girl on a stretcher.  Being carried to an AMBULANCE.
        Bud White walks alongside, looking like some ferocious
        pet pit bull.  The ATTENDANTS get her inside.  One joins
        her.  The other closes the door, pauses to light a smoke.

        Bud rips the cigarette out of his mouth, nearly taking
        the guy's lips with it.

                                BUD
                  Get her to the fucking hospital.

        One look at Bud, and the Attendant is running around to
        the driver's side.  Exley arrives, steamed.

                                EXLEY
                  A naked guy with a gun?  You
                  expect anyone to believe that?

                                BUD
                  Get the fuck away from me.

        Bud starts away, but Exley gets right in his face.  Other
        cops begin to take notice.  The ambulance pulls out.

                                EXLEY
                  How's it going to look on your
                  report?

                                BUD
                  It'll look like justice.  That's
                  what that fat fuck got.  Justice.

                                EXLEY
                  You don't know what the word means,
                  you dumb bastard.

        Bud goes after Exley, but ten hands pull them apart.
        Dudley on Exley.  Four cops genuinely having trouble
        on Bud.

        And as if things couldn't get crazier, shouts from the
        cops on the street.  POLICE RADIOS CRANKED UP.

                                DISPATCHER (V.O.)
                  Repeat, three suspects escaped
                  from the Hall of Justice jail.
                  The Nite Owl killers:  Raymond
                  Coates, Tyrone Jones and Larry
                  Fontaine.  They are considered
                  armed and extremely dangerous.
                  Descriptions are as follows...


        INT. SQUAD ROOM - DAY

        Electrified, "Nite Owl Killers" on everyone's lips.
        Exley strides through with purpose, beelines to a filing
        cabinet.  Exley pulls the file he's looking for.  He
        scans an interrogation transcript, reads to himself the
        words he's looking for:

                                EXLEY
                  'Give me one to feed the D.A....
                  Roland Navarette.  Lives on
                  Bunker Hill.  Runs a hole-up for
                  parole absconders.'


        INT. HOLLYWOOD STATION - JACK'S DESK - DAY

        Police rush back and forth.  Exley hurries over to the
        desk, but he's not there.

                                EXLEY
                  Anyone seen Jack Vincennes?

        A few cops mumble they haven't.  As Exley decides what
        to do, Carlisle from the original arrest steps over.

                                CARLISLE
                  Is something up, Lieutenant?


        EXT.  1ST & OLIVE - DAY

        Exley and Carlisle pull up across the street from a
        four-story Victorian with paint peeling off the clap-
        boards.  They jump out of the car toting SHOTGUNS.
        Carlisle waits as Exley checks the mail slots:
        "R. Navarette, 408. "


        INT.  STAIRWELL - VICTORIAN BUILDING - DAY

        Exley and Carlisle take the steps two at a time.


        INT. 4TH FLOOR HALLWAY - VICTORIAN BUILDING - DAY

        Exley squints, reaches to a pocket.  No glasses.  He
        passes an elevator, rounds a corner.  There's 408.  Exley
        pumps the shotgun, nods to Carlisle who kicks the door
        in.


        NAVARETTE LIVING ROOM

        Exley and Carlisle burst in on four men eating sandwiches.
        Fontaine and Caucasian NAVARETTE at a table.  Coates on
        the floor.  Jones by the window.  Exley squints.

                                EXLEY
                  Nobody move!

        Fontaine and Navarette raise their hands.  A jostled BEER
        BOTTLE CRASHES to the floor.  Reacting, Carlisle JERKS
        the TRIGGER.  Fontaine goes down.

        Navarette draws a .38, SHOOTS Carlisle twice in the
        chest.  Exley BLASTS Navarette.

        Screaming, Jones pulls a .45 from his belt.  Exley FIRES,
        blowing him right THROUGH the WINDOW.

        Coates draws and FIRES, makes a run for it.  A bad pull
        takes out half a back wall.  Coates is out the door.


        ELEVATOR

        Coates makes it inside, frantically pushes buttons.


        HALLWAY

        Here comes Exley.  Stumbling, wiping Navarette's blood
        out of his eyes, he closes on the...


        ELEVATOR

        Coates watches as the elevator doors begin closing.


        HALLWAY

        Exley charging.


        ELEVATOR

        The shotgun barrel juts through.  The doors bang against
        it.  BLAM!

                                                   DISSOLVE TO:

        L.A. MONTAGE

        TONY BENNETT belts "BOULEVARD OF BROKEN DREAMS."


        INT. HOLLYWOOD STATION - DAY

        Exley returns to grudging respect.  His white shirt
        flecked with blood, he's clapped on the back by Dudley
        who dubs him "Shotgun Ed."  Exley doesn't enjoy it.  He's
        numb, stumbling along.  As he notices the blood on his
        hands...


        INSERT - NEWSPAPER HEADLINE

        NITE OWL HERO!  Over a photo of Exley.


        EXT. CEMETERY - GRAVE - DAY

        A coffin is lowered into the ground.  A WIDOW leans on
        the Chief's arm, accepts a tri-folded American flag from
        Dudley Smith.  Exley drops a handful of earth on the
        casket, has trouble getting the wet dirt off his hands.

                                CHIEF
                  We mourn the passing of a good
                  man.  The loss of Sgt. William
                  Carlisle is the loss of his
                  wife, his family and the entire
                  Los Angeles Police Department...

        A sea of dress blues.  Jack looks bored, dressed too
        flashy for a funeral.  Bud looks grim, rain dripping off
        the brim of his cap.  As a TWENTY-ONE GUN salute is
        FIRED...


        EXT. CEMETERY (SOUTH CENTRAL, L.A.) - DAY

        Larry Fontaine's mother mourns alone as her son is
        buried.


        INT. CITY OF ANGELS HOSPITAL - RECEPTION AREA - DAY

        Exley talks with a tough, starchy NURSE.

                                EXLEY
                  I need the girl to give me a
                  chronology of events.  No details.
                  Just times.

                                NURSE
                  Absolutely not.  She barely
                  remembers her own name.

                                EXLEY
                  But --

                                NURSE
                  I was told the case was closed.
                  Should I call your superior to
                  double-check?

                                EXLEY
                  No.  that won't be necessary.

        The Nurse turns, marches away.  Exley is left with a
        nagging doubt.


        EXT. ORANGE GROVE (ANAHEIM) - DAY

        People cheer as bulldozers mow down orange trees.  A
        banner heralds the future:  "On this site:  The World's
        Biggest Amusement Park."  Cartoon characters dance among
        the fallen trees.


        INT. STATE ASSEMBLYMAN'S OFFICE - DAY

        Sitting behind a desk is the Older Gentleman last seen
        doing his best Alan Ladd impersonation at Lynn Bracken's.

        He stares emphatically at the SMARMY LAWYER who stands
        before him holding a manila folder.

                                OLDER GENTLEMAN
                  You tell Mr. Patchett I have no
                  intention of changing my vote.

        The Lawyer simply hands him a stack of photographs.  From
        Lynn Bracken's apartment.  The first is the Older
        Gentleman naked except for his socks and garters.


        INT. STATE ASSEMBLY - CHAMBER - DAY

        The Older Gentleman rises for an assembly vote.

                                OLDER GENTLEMAN
                  It may surprise some, but a mature
                  man, enlightened by the facts, can
                  change him mind...


        EXT. 1736 NOTTINGHAM (LYNN BRACKEN'S) - NIGHT

        Rain.  A limo disgorges a heavy-set man who climbs steps,
        knocks on the door.  Lynn answers in an evening gown.  He
        gives her a peck on the cheek and continues in past her.
        Lynn's about to follow him in when she pauses to deadpan
        a look down the street.

        Bud's Packard is parked there and we can see his darkened
        silhouette behind the wheel.  Smiling a bit sadly to
        herself, Lynn disappears inside.

        This is no stake-out.  Bud watches after her with
        yearning.


        INT. TROCADERO CLUB - NIGHT

        Cigarette girls and club photographer make the rounds.
        Johnny Stompanato enjoys the frenzien floor show.


        EXT. WILSHIRE BOULEVARD - DAY

        A horse parade, heavy on the law enforcement contingent,
        Out of place in his suit and tie, District Attorney Ellis
        Loew awkwardly rides atop a sleek Palimono.


        INT. OLYMPIC AUDITORIUM - NIGHT

        The crowd in a frenzy as Vincennes-snitch, the
        welterweight black boxer, beats the shit out of a white
        fighter.


        INT. MIDDLE CLASS LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

        A father holds out his hand, counts along as Jack slaps
        $100 bills into his palm.  Maybe four thousand dollars.

        Jack says something about "We appreciate your
        understanding during this difficult time."  As "Badge of
        Honor" comes on the TV, the father responds with "Goddamn
        actors."

        Leading, Jack looks through an open door where Brett
        Chase's high school "Sweater Girl" is being comforted by
        her mother.  As she locks eyes with him an instant...


        INT. PIERCE PATCHETT'S HOUSE - NIGHT

        The monied johns watch horny as hell as "Ginger Rogers"
        twirls around the room with a female "Fred Astaire."
        Clothes fly as they spin.  Still, most eyes turn to Lynn
        Bracken as she enters oozing that cat-girl grace.


        EXT. POLICE HEADQUARTERS - DAY

        Reporters scribble as the Chief speaks.  Uniforms
        everywhere along with Exley and Loew.  Bus sits in the
        back.

                                CHIEF
                  Edmund J. Exley has amassed a
                  brilliant record in his seven
                  years with the L.A.P.D.  Recently
                  he evinced spectacular bravery in
                  the line of duty.  It is my honor
                  to present him with our highest
                  honor, the Medal of Valor.

        Exley steps up.  The Chief hangs a gold medallion around
        his neck.  Flashbulbs pop as the two men shake hands.

        Exley then accepts a handshake from Dudley.  The
        policemen stand on cue, applaud without enthusiasm.
        Dudley lifts the medal from his chest.

                                DUDLEY
                  Your father would've been proud.

        Exley uses the noise to have aprivate chat with Dudley.

                                EXLEY
                  There are loose ends out there,
                  Dudley.  I --

                                DUDLEY
                  There always are.  But there are
                  also three men and three guns.
                  Matched forensically.  A few loose
                  ends don't matter.

                                EXLEY
                  Something's wrong.  I feel it
                  inside.  Doesn't that sound crazy?

        Dudley puts an arm around Exley's shoulder, smiles out as
        more bulbs flash.

                                DUDLEY
                  Breaking a big case sticks you in
                  a whirlwind.  A little self-doubt?
                  It's natural.  Just keep it
                  inside.  Between you and you.

        Exley considers his medal.  It is an appealing thing.

        In the back, Bud stays sprawled in his seat.  No one's
        watching as he takes out his gun, kisses it, and blows
        pretend smoke off the barrel.  As the song ends...


        INT. VARIETY INTERNATIONAL PICTURES - STAGE 4 - NIGHT

        A "Badge of Honor" fund-raiser for D.A. Loew's re-
        election cmpaign.  Hot dogs and sauerkraut.  Fishbowls
        stuffed with cash.  Jack is here, returns a smile half-
        heartedly.  Loew sits with his wife and teenage daughter
        as Brett "Joe Reno" Chase speaks.

                                CHASE
                  This election is about the future
                  of law enforcement in Los Angeles.
                  Ellis Loew represents that future.
                  So dig deep and let's get a moral
                  man re-elected.

        Applause.  Leaving the podium, Chase smiles at Ellis
        Loew's daughter who absolutely gushes.  Chase then winks
        knowingly to Jack who returns a tired, humorless smile.

        Jack scans the room.  An odd moment as Jack catches his
        own reflection in a mirror across the way.  He puts a
        hand to his face.  Is that him?

                                HUDGEON (O.S.)
                  Big V Jack Vincennes!

        Jack turns to see Sid Hudgeons approaching.

                                HUDGEONS
                  You're back, boychick.

                                JACK
                  Sid, how are they hanging?

                                HUDGEONS
                  Down around my ankles.

        Hudgeons scans the crowd, points someone out.

                                HUDGEONS
                  You remember Matt Reynolds?

        Jack spots Matt Reynolds -- one of the young actors Jack
        arrested on Christmas Eve.

                                HUDGEONS
                  The Grauman's Chinese pot bust.
                  He just got off the honor farm.

                                JACK
                  What's he doing here, Sid?

                                HUDGEONS
                  You tight with the D.A., trash?

                                JACK
                  Sure, he just tried to throw me
                  off the force last Christmas as a
                  little joke.

                                HUDGEONS
                  How'd you like a little payback?
                  Not to mention a donation to the
                  widows and orphans fund.  Did you
                  know Loew was a swish?

                                JACK
                  And Reynolds?

                                HUDGEONS
                  He's queer too.  Metro paid him
                  two grand a week to fake it with
                  ingenues.  On screen and off.  I'm
                  getting him to fuck the D.A. for a
                  hundred bucks.
                         (winks)
                  That's twice the fifty you got for
                  wrecking his career.

        Even Jack's not immune to a comment like that.

                                HUDGEONS
                  Matt!  Over here!

        As Hudgeons heads over, Hudgeons points out...

                                HUDGEONS
                  That's D.A. Loew right there.

        Reynolds gets a nervous bead on Loew.  Hudgeons realizes:

                                HUDGEONS
                  You need a drink, kid... Jack,
                  look after him a minute.  Kid,
                  this is Jack.  No secrets between
                  me and him.

        Hudgeons heads off.  Reynolds, plae, nods at Jack.

                                REYNOLDS
                  Have we met before?

                                JACK
                  Yeah.

        Jack doesn't really feel like talking to him.  Reynolds'
        nerves won't let him stay quiet.

                                REYNOLDS
                  Was it a party?

                                JACK
                  Something like that.

                                REYNOLDS
                         (misreading)
                  Oh, I know.  A Fleur-de-Lis party,
                  right?

        Jack remembers the name, plays along for what it's worth.

                                JACK
                  Fleaur-de-Lis.  'Whatever you
                  desire.'

                                REYNOLDS
                  Dope, liquor, hookers that look
                  like movie stars.  Pierce Patchett
                  has it all.

        Jack recognizes the name, bluffs for more information.

                                JACK
                  Yeah.  Me and Patchett go way
                  back.

                                REYNOLDS
                  Pierce isn't like regular people.
                  I dig him, but he scares me too.

                                JACK
                  Really?  How?

                                REYNOLDS
                         (shakes his head)
                  You know, when I came out to L.A.,
                  this isn't exactly where I saw
                  myself ending up.

                                JACK
                  Yeah.  Me neither.

        Reynolds looks like he's going to cry.  Hudgeons returns
        with a double Scotch straight up and a hot dog with
        sauerkraut.  He hands the drink to Matt.

                                HUDGEONS
                  Dutch courage, kid.  Drink up.

        Reynolds downs a few gulps, looks across the room at
        Loew.

                                REYNOLDS
                  I don't know if I should do this.

                                HUDGEONS
                  Hey, it's not like you don't know
                  how.  And Jack here has
                  connections on 'Badge of Honor.'
                  Pull this off and there'll be a
                  part for you.  I smell a comeback.
                  Don't you, Jack?

        Reynolds looks to Jack who gives a noncommittal shrug.

                                JACK
                  Loew's free.  Congratulate him.

        Reynolds nods, drains his glass and heads off.  Hudgeons
        hands Jack a folded slip of paper.

                                HUDGEONS
                  If Reynolds works his charms,
                  which he will, this is the address
                  where they'll be.  Meet me at
                  midnight.  I guarantee all sorts
                  of illegal activity.

        Hudgeons takes out a President Grant $50 bill.  Jack
        doesn't take it.

                                JACK
                  Sid, why would a guy like Pierce
                  Patchett get involved with running
                  dope and hookers?

                                HUDGEONS
                  Where'd you hear that?

                                JACK
                  Around.

                                HUDGEONS
                  Jackie, all I know is what you
                  know.  The man is very rich.  And
                  he's invested in freeway
                  construction so he's gonna get a
                  lot richer.  But that's it.
                  Patchett's what I like to call
                  'Twilight.'  He ain't queer, he
                  ain't Red, he can't help me in my
                  quest for prime sinuendo.

        Jack takes the $50 as Reynolds returns, shaking his head.

                                HUDGEONS
                  What?

                                REYNOLDS
                  I can't do it.

                                HUDGEONS
                  Talk to him, Jack.  Tell him about
                  the opening on the show.

                                JACK
                  I'm pretty sure I can get you a
                  part on the show... But tonight?
                  Pretend it's an acting job, kid.
                  Showbiz.

                                REYNOLDS
                  And no one'll know about this?

                                JACK
                  It'll be our secret.

                                REYNOLDS
                  Showbiz.

        Emboldened by Jack's promise, Reynolds heads off.  Jack
        and Hudgeons watch as he strikes a conversation with Loew
        who's captivated.  Hudgeons chomps a bite of his hot dog,
        gives Jack the high sign, but Jack just feels like a pimp.


        INT. VICTORY HOTEL - ROOM SIX - NIGHT

        Screams.  A cauliflower-eared Cleveland mob enforcer on
        the hotseat.

        Breuning works him with a rubber hose as Dudley asks
        unanswered questions.  Bud watches, revulsion growing.

                                DUDLEY
                  Where did you intend to start.
                  Prostitution?  Gambling?
                         (no answer)
                  Go back to Cleveland, lad.  This
                  is the City of Angels and you
                  haven't got any wings.

        More screams as the hose thwops down.  Bud looks away,
        then shuffles blindly out of the room.


        INT. VICTORY HOTEL - BATHROOM - NIGHT

        Bud runs water in the sink to drown out the SCREAMS.  It
        doesn't work.  Finally, he leans down and sticks his head
        under the stream of water.  That doesn't work either.


        EXT. VICTORY HOTEL - NIGHT

        Hair dripping wet, Bud makes it to his car.  The tires
        spit gravel as he tears away.  Dudley appears in the
        doorway, watching curiously.  As cauliflower continues to
        SCREAM...


        INT. BUD'S PACKARD - 1736 NOTTINGHAM (LYNN'S) - NIGHT

        Bud watches Lynn Bracken's apartment,  Colored lights
        play on the windows.  Shadows pass.  Finally the front
        door opens.  There's Veronica Lake, all sparkles and
        spangles, kissing another distinguished gentleman
        goodnight.  Bud watches the man into a waiting limo.  As
        it pulls away...


        INT. 1736 NOTTINGHAM (LYNN BRACKEN'S) - LIVING ROOM -
        NIGHT

        Now Lynn just looks tired.  As she puts away Scotch
        bottles and picks up empty glasses, there's a KNOCK on
        the door.  Lynn sighs, become sultry Veronica Lake before
        our eyes.


        INT. FRONT HALL - NIGHT

                                LYNN
                         (opening door)
                  Did you forget some --

        Bud stands there, filling up the door frame.

                                LYNN
                  I wondered when you might ring the
                  bell again, Officer White.

                                BUD
                  It's Bud.

        Bud looks at Lynn a moment, then down at his own feet.
        Embarrassed.  She smiles.

                                LYNN
                  You should see yourself.  You look
                  like you're ten years old.

        Bud looks back up.  Lynn's smile fades as she studies his
        face.  She's not going to ask questions.  Lynn looks at
        him a moment more, then runs a hand through the blonde
        hair covering one eye.

                                LYNN
                  If you'd called first, I wouldn't
                  look this ridiculous.


        INT. LYNN BRACKEN'S (1736 NOTTINGHAM) - BEDROOM - NIGHT

        Lynn comes to Bud naked, her hair brushed back.  Bud goes
        slow, gently, takes time with his kisses:  like she was a
        lonely woman he wanted to love to death.

        Lynn plays off his timing:  her kisses back, her touches.
        Finally, Bud forces himself to stop.  He pulls back so he
        can see her.

                                LYNN
                  You're wondering if Patchett told
                  me to be receptive.

        Bud doesn't answer, but yes.

                                LYNN
                  It doesn't matter.  I like you,
                  Bud.  I really do.

        She kisses him.  Softly, drawing it out.  Not a job.  She
        wants to make love to him.  And as Bud stops thinking...


        EXT. 5261 CHERAMOYA AVENUE (HOLLYWOOD) - NIGHT

        Jack sits in his car waiting.  He checks his watch...
        1:30.  Well past midnight.

                                JACK
                  Come on, Sid.  Where are you?

        Jack decides.  MOVE WITH him as he gets out and crosses
        the street.  The apartment is dark, the front door a few
        inches ajar.  Suspicious, Jack listens.  Dead quiet.  He
        enters...


        INT. 5261 CHERAMOYA AVENUE - NIGHT

        No one here it seems.  Till Jack nearly trips over a
        body.  Matt Reynolds.  Soaked in blood.  Throat slit.
        Jack looks down in horror as Reynolds seems to stare back
        up at him.  Jack stumbles out the door.  We hear his CAR
        DOOR SLAM shut, the SCREECH of RUBBER down the street.


        EXT. 2345 HALBORO (HUDGEONS' HOUSE) - NIGHT

        Jack pounds on Sid's door till lights switch on.

                                JACK
                  It's Vincennes!  Open up!

        Hudgeons opens the door.  He's in his pajamas.

                                HUDGEONS
                  Jackie!  You got some good scoop
                  for the Sidster?

                                JACK
                  Sid, cut the crap.  I --

                                HUDGEONS
                  Give me some Narco skinny.  I want
                  to put out an all hop-head issue.
                  Shvartze jazz musicians and movie
                  stars.  Maybe tie it into the
                  Rosenbergs.  You like?

        Jack grabs him, jerks him into the door frame.

                                JACK
                  Shut up!

                                HUDGEONS
                         (confused)
                  What's wrong, Trash?

                                HUDGEONS
                  What happened with the kid and
                  Loew?

                                HUDGEONS
                  You didn't get my message?  It got
                  called off.  The kid chickened out
                  at the last minute.

                                JACK
                  He's dead.  I was just there.
                  Somebody slit his throat.

                                HUDGEONS
                  Jesus.  Jack, that's a story.
                  'Swish Actor Gets The Gay Blade.'
                  Let me get my camera.

        Hudgeons starts away, but Jack grabs him.

                                JACK
                  Loew didn't go with him.  You're
                  sure?

                                HUDGEONS
                  I put Reynolds in the cab myself.
                  The night cost me a hundred scoots
                  and I got bupkis.

        Jack lets go of him, starts to ramble off into the night.

                                HUDGEONS
                  Jackie!  Big V!  Let me get my
                  camera!  Where are you going?!


        INT. AFTER HOURS CLUB - NIGHT

        The BARTENDER walks down the bar to where Jack arrives.

                                BARTENDER
                  What'll it be, Jack?

                                JACK
                         (pulls out wallet)
                  A bottle of Scotch.

        As the Bartender turns for one, the only bill Jack finds
        is the President Grant fifty.  The things he's done for
        fifty bucks... As he looks up with despair at his
        reflection in the bar mirror, the Bartneder sets down a
        bottle and shot glass.  He plucks the fifty from Jack's
        hand.

        Jack grabs the bottle and starts out.

                                BARTENDER
                  Hey!  Your change!


        INT. 1736 NOTTINGHAM (LYNN BRACKEN'S) - BEDROOM - NIGHT

        Spent, Bud and Lynn lie in bed.  SHe traces a finger over
        his bicep as he muses on the ceiling.

                                BUD
                  Who was that guy who was here
                  earlier?

        Lynn's tracing finger stops on Bud's shoulder -- a small
        white scar.

                                LYNN
                  It doesn't matter.  All they get
                  is Veronica Lake.  You got the
                  real Lynn Margaret Bracken...
                         (re: scar)
                  Where'd this come from?

                                BUD
                  When I was ten, my old man threw a
                  bottle at my mother.  I guess I
                  got in the way.

                                LYNN
                  So you saved her.

                                BUD
                  Yeah.  But not for long.

        Bud looks away.  Lynn sees he doesn't want to talk about
        it.

                                LYNN
                  Do you like being a cop, Bud?

                                BUD
                  I used to.  What I do now is
                  strong-arm.  Sitting duck stuff...
                  No, I don't like it.  If I could
                  work Homicide like a real
                  detective...

        Lynn listens sympathetically.  Bud's opening up.

                                BUD
                  There's something wrong with the
                  Nite Owl.  That prick Exley shot
                  the wrong guys.  But they made him
                  a hero and whoever killed my
                  partner is still out there.

        Frustrated, Bud pokes at his own chest.

                                BUD
                  In here I know it.  But I can't
                  prove it.  I'm not a detective.
                  I'm not smart enough.  I'm just
                  the guy they bring in to scare the
                  other guy shitless.

        Bud looks away, embarrassed to have shown so much of
        himself.  Lynn reaches over, turns his face back to her.

                                LYNN
                  You found Patchett.  You found me.
                  You're smart enough.  Be a
                  detective if that's what you want.

                                BUD
                  That simple, huh?

        Lynn nods.  That simple.


        INT. HOLLYWOOD STATION - EXLEY'S OFFICE - NIGHT

        Exley looks up as a CLERK enters holding two files.

                                CLERK
                  I got the rap sheets on the black
                  guys, sir.  Coates and Jones got
                  charges a mile long.  But except
                  for some kid stuff, Fontaine's
                  clean.

                                EXLEY
                  Clean?

                                CLERK
                  More or less.

                                EXLEY
                  Until he gunned down six people.


        EXT. GRIFFITH PARK - DAY

        Exley stands in the trees as a PARK RANGER approaches.

                                PARK RANGER
                  I asked my men, Lieutenant.  No
                  one remembers any colored guys
                  firing shotguns.

                                EXLEY
                  Then who phoned in the report?

                                PARK RANGER
                  Not us.


        INT. FORENSICS LAB - DAY

        Ray Pinker looks up from his microscope as Bud enters.

                                PINKER
                  Bud White, what brings you down to
                  the basement?

                                BUD
                  I got a few Nite Owl questions.

                                PINKER
                  I don't know if you read the
                  papers, but that case is closed.

                                BUD
                  I'm tying up loose ends.  Padding
                  my report.  You know how it goes.

                                PINKER
                  What do you want to know?

                                BUD
                  Anything off.  Anything that
                  didn't make sense.

                                PINKER
                  You mean beside the fact that
                  thirty-five out of forty-five
                  rounds were gratuitous?  I can't
                  think of anything.

        Pinker is ticked as Bud steps over to where a group of
        Nite Owl crime scene photos are posted on the wall.  Bud
        pauses at a photo which shows the floor around the table.
        We see a high heel shoe, blood smears across the floor.

                                BUD
                  Whose shoe?

                                PINKER
                  Susan Lefferts.

                                BUD
                         (pointing)
                  If she was sitting here, then it's
                  facing the wrong way.  What are
                  these smears in the blood?

                                PINKER
                  It looks like she was flailing,
                  trying to get away.

                                BUD
                  But she's moving away from the
                  door.
                         (thinks; points)
                  Who was sitting at this table?

                                PINKER
                  Dick Stensland.
                         (a beat)
                  Had to be dumb panic.  If she knew
                  him she would've been sitting with
                  him... Right?

        Bud wonders, maybe a puzzle piece just fell into place.
        Pinker remembers something.

                                PINKER
                  You know, there is one thing.

        Pinker rummages a shelf for a glass jar which he hands
        Bud.  Inside are two wax-saturated cotton balls.

                                PINKER
                  Cotton balls.  I found them just
                  inside the meat locker door.

                                BUD
                  Ear plugs.

                                PINKER
                  Exactly.  At least one of those
                  animals had the brains to protect
                  his ears.

                                BUD
                  It doesn't exactly play like dumb
                  panic.

                                PINKER
                  What do you mean?

                                BUD
                  It's like they knew they were
                  going to kill everyone before they
                  went in...

                                PINKER
                  Yeah, so...

        Bud just stares at the picture of Susan Lefferts.


        EXT. LEFFERTS' HOUSE (SAN BERNARDINO) - DAY

        A shingle shack dump.  Bud walks the front steps, RINGS
        the BELL.  Hilda Lefferts answers.  She doesn't look so
        good.

                                BUD
                  Mrs. Lefferts, I'm Officer White
                  with the L.A.P.D.  I'd like to ask
                  a couple of questions.

                                MRS. LEFFERTS
                  Let my daughter rest in peace.

                                BUD
                  Five minutes.  That's all.


        INT. LEFFERTS' HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY

        Pictures of Susan smile down from four walls.  Vamp poses
        on a nightclub floor.  Mrs. Lefferts is all twitchy and
        nervous, her eyes darting to a closed door.

                                BUD
                  Tell me about the boyfriend she
                  had.  The one you mentioned at the
                  morgue.

                                MRS. LEFFERTS
                  First I want to go on record as
                  saying that my Susie was a virgin
                  when she died.

                                BUD
                  Ma'am, I'm sure she was.

        Mrs. Lefferts talks directly to a photo of her daughter.

                                MRS. LEFFERTS
                  Susie, I told you I didn't approve
                  of that boyfriend.  He was too old
                  for you.  You let him come into
                  this house and be fresh to me.  I
                  went out one day and old Mrs.
                  Jensen next door saw Susan's
                  boyfriend and another man and
                  thought she heard a ruckus.

                                BUD
                  What was that boyfriend's name?

                                MRS. LEFFERTS
                  We were never properly introduced.
                  Susan and I were fighting that
                  day.  She called him by a
                  nickname.  Muns or Lunts or
                  something.

                                BUD
                  Stens?  Was it Stens?

                                MRS. LEFFERTS
                  Maybe.  I don't know.

                                BUD
                  Look at a picture for me.

        Bud hands her a snapshot of Stensland taken in Tijuana.
        Out of uniform.  She recognizes him.

                                MRS. LEFFERTS
                  That's him.  That's him.

                                BUD
                  You said a neighbor heard a
                  ruckus.  Was it outside, inside?

        Mrs. Lefferts' eyes go crazy, darting to a closed door.
        Rolled towels are crammed against the bottom of it.

                                MRS. LEFFERTS
                  I don't know.  You'll have to
                  leave now, Officer.

        Bud starts for the closed door.

                                BUD
                  What's through here?

                                MRS. LEFFERTS
                  No!  Please leave!

        Bud kicks away the towels, opens the door, steps into...


        DEN

        Innocuous except for the smell.  It hits Bud right off.

                                MRS. LEFFERTS
                  Don't mind the smell.  I think a
                  rat died behind the wall... My
                  Susie was a good girl!

                                BUD
                  Easy.  Tell me about the ruckus.

                                MRS. LEFFERTS
                  I came home that night and there
                  was blood on the floor.  Susan
                  said Stams -- Stens had cut
                  himself.  They were acting
                  nervous.  And that Stens kept
                  going under the house.

        As Mrs. Lefferts goes shrill, Bud beelines out the door.


        EXT. LEFFERTS' HOUSE (SAN BERNARDINO) - DAY

        Holding a flashlight, Bud crawls under the house, into...


        CRAWLSPACE

        Bud elbow-crawls over the dirt, between wooden pilings.

        There's a long burlap sack ahead.  It smells bad.  Bud
        rips burlap.  A rat's nest explodes.  Bud sweeps a
        forearm at them.  As they clear, he sees a gristle-caked
        human skull staring back, a .38 hole in the forehead.

        Undaunted, Bud tears the burlap back further.  He pats
        the corpse's pockets, comes up with a wallet.  Bud checks
        the ID.  "Turner Meeks."  Bus knows him by that name and
        another.

                                BUD
                  Buzz Meeks... Holy shit.


        EXT. LEFFERTS' HOUSE - DAY

        Bud crawls out, blinking sunlight and gulping fresh air.
        Mrs. Lefferts is there.  She's scared.

                                MRS. LEFFERTS
                  Was it... a rat?

                                BUD
                  Yeah.  A great big one.

        Bud opens Meeks' wallet, pulls out a couple hundred bucks
        and gives them to Mrs. Lefferts.

                                BUD
                  Here.  Compliments of the Los
                  Angeles Police Department.


        INT. FORENSICS LAB - DAY

        Ray Pinker looks up from an autopsy as Exley enters.

                                PINKER
                  Hey, just in time for our stomach
                  of the week.  Frankfurters with
                  sauerkraut, French fries,
                  Coca-Cola, alcohol and sperm.
                  Jesus, what a last supper.

        The stiff is Matt Reynolds!  Pinker continues working
        away.

                                EXLEY
                  The Nite Owl.  Anything bothering
                  you about the case?

                                PINKER
                  Yeah.  The fact that you guys
                  won't let it get filed away.

                                EXLEY
                  What are you talking about?

                                PINKER
                  Bud White grilled me on it this
                  morning.  You know, he's not as
                  dumb as I thought.

        As Exley's head swims...

        EXT. LEFFERTS' HOUSE (SAN BERNARDINO) - DAY

        Mrs. Lefferts waters the grass, watches as a car pulls
        up.  Exley gets up, starts toward her.  She drops the
        hose and runs for the front door  Exley cuts her off.

                                MRS. LEFFERTS
                  Let my Susie rest in peace!

                                EXLEY
                  Mrs. Lefferts, I just want to ask
                  a few questions.

                                MRS. LEFFERTS
                  That other policeman already
                  checked under the house and found
                  not a thing amiss.

                                EXLEY
                  Officer White?

                                MRS. LEFFERTS
                  A sweet man.

                                EXLEY
                         (thinking
                          out loud)
                  Under the house.

                                MRS. LEFFERTS
                  All he found were rodents.  No
                  signs of foul play.  So there.

        Exley spots the entrance to the crawlspace.  He hurries
        over, enters nearly flat on his belly.  Mrs. Lefferts
        calls in after him.

                                MRS. LEFFERTS
                  My daughter was a virgin!

                                EXLEY (O.S.)
                  I don't doubt it -- Oh, God.


        INT. HOLLYWOOD STATION - JACK'S DESK - DAY

        Jack sits unshaven and hung-over, the dregs of the Scotch
        bottle on the desk.  He considers a framed "Badge of
        Honor" photo:  Jack and Brett Chase, before a banner "To
        Protect and Serve."  Jack punches a fist through it.


        INT. LAPD - FORENSICS LAB - DAY

        Exley walks alonside as a body bag is wheeled into the
        lab atop a gurney.  Pinker steps over.

                                EXLEY
                  I need an I.D. ASAP.  You talk
                  only to me on this one.


        INT. JACK'S DESK - DAY

        Sitting in disgust, Jack spots something amidst all the
        clutter -- the Great Jerk-Off Books of 1962.  He flips
        one over, looks at the Fleur-de-Lis stamp.  Jack
        remembers something Matt Reynolds told him.  He dials the
        phone.

                                JACK
                  Yeah.  Sergeant Jack Vincennes
                  requesting.  I need the home
                  address on a Pierce Patchett.

                                OPERATOR (V.O.)
                  Please hold, Sergeant...

        As Jack waits, Exley appears in front of him.

                                EXLEY
                  I need to speak to you.

                                JACK
                  Give me a minute, will ya?

        Exley clicks off the phone.

                                JACK
                  Damnit... What?

                                EXLEY
                  I want you to follow Bud White.

                                JACK
                  Even I'm not that crazy.

                                EXLEY
                  It's not a request.  I need to
                  know what White knows.  Follow him
                  or I'll have you pulled off 'Badge
                  of Honor.'  Permanently.

                                JACK
                  Yesterday that might've meant
                  something.  Pull me off.  You'd be
                  doing me a big favor.

                                EXLEY
                  Yesterday yes, today no.  What
                  happened last night?

                                JACK
                  Transfer me, suspend me.  Just
                  leave me alone.

                                EXLEY
                  You make a mistake?

                                JACK
                  Yeah.  My whole life.

        Jack stands, heads out.  Exley follows; he needs help.

                                EXLEY
                  Listen, I think I made a mistake,
                  too.

                                JACK
                  I ain't a priest, Lieutenant.  I
                  can't hear your confession.

                                EXLEY
                  Do you make the three Negroes for
                  the Nite Owl killings?

                                JACK
                  What?

                                EXLEY
                  It's a simple question.

                                JACK
                  You should be the last person who
                  wants to dig any deeper into the
                  Nite Owl, Lieutenant.

        Exley watches as Jack continues down a hall.  Then:

                                EXLEY
                  Rollo Tomasi.

        Jack stops, looks back at him.

                                JACK
                  Is there more to that, or do I
                  have to guess?

                                EXLEY
                  Rollo was a purse snatcher.  My
                  father ran into him off duty.  He
                  shot my father six times and got
                  away clean.  No one even knew who
                  he was.  I made the name up to
                  give him some personality.

                                JACK
                  So what's the point?

                                EXLEY
                  Rollo's the reason I became a cop.
                  I wanted to catch the guys who
                  thought they could get away with
                  it.  It was supposed to be about
                  truth and justice and Rollo.  But
                  somewhere along the way I forgot
                  all that... How about you, Jack?
                  Why'd you become a cop?

        Jack looks like he might cry, but smiles instead.

                                JACK
                  I don't remember...

        Both men are quiet a moment.

                                JACK
                  I'm trying to figure what angle
                  you're playing this time, but I
                  sure as hell can't see one.

                                EXLEY
                  I've given up angles for awhile.
                  I just want to solve this thing.

                                JACK
                  The Nite Owl was solved,
                  Lieutenant.

                                EXLEY
                  I want to do it right.

        So does Jack.

                                JACK
                  Okay, college boy, I'll help you.
                  But I want half the collar.

                                EXLEY
                  A third.  I don't think we can
                  make a case without Bud White.


        EXT. BROWN DERBY - DAY

        A Packard pulls up out front.  Bud gets out, heads
        inside.  Another car pulls up across the street.


        CLOSE ON JACK

        Watching Bud.  Jack gets out, starts across the street.


        INT. BROWN DERBY - BAR - DAY

        At the bar, Johnny Stompanato looks over as Bud joins
        him.  Stompanato isn't happy about it, but he smiles
        anyway.

                                STOMPANATO
                  Wendell White, how's tricks,
                  paesano?

                                BUD
                  I ain't your paesano, you wop
                  cocksucker.

        Nervous, Johnny taps his pinkie ring on a bottle of beer.

                                STOMPANATO
                  What do you want, officer?

                                BUD
                  You remember an ex-cop named Buzz
                  Meeks?  He works for a guy named
                  Patchett.

        Johnny taps his ring harder.  The bottle almost tips.

                                STOMPANATO
                  Should I?

                                BUD
                  His file listed you as a known
                  associate.  Now spill.

                                STOMPANATO
                  Oh, yeah.  That was a long time
                  ago.  Before your day.  The last
                  few years he's been muscle for
                  hire.  But I heard he's
                  disappeared.

                                BUD
                  More.

                                STOMPANATO
                  More's gonna cost you.

        Bud's hand flashes out, grabs Stompanato by the crotch.

                                BUD
                  How 'bout I give you your balls
                  back?

                                STOMPANATO
                         (in considerable
                          pain)
                  Before Meeks disappeared he was
                  popping off about trying to move
                  eighteen pounds of heroin.

                                BUD
                  Bullshit.  Where would a two-bit
                  ex-cop get 18 pounds of heroin?

                                STOMPANATO
                  Deuce Perkins.  Mickey C's
                  narcotics lieutenant.  The night
                  he got clipped, eighteen pounds of
                  Mickey's heroin went missing.

        Bud loosens his grip.  Stompanato gasps for air.


        DOOR

        Jack peels in, catches a glimpse of Bud and Stompanato.
        Too far away too hear anything, Jack quickly ducks out.


        BAR

        Stompanato's recovering.

                                STOMPANATO
                  Meeks is probably in Rio or
                  someplace like that by now.

                                BUD
                  He's under a tract house in San
                  Berdoo.  And he don't smell too
                  good.  What happened to the
                  heroin, Johnny?

                                STOMPANATO
                  I don't know.  I swear it!

        Bud starts to raise a hand.  Stompanato cringes, but Bud
        just slaps a twenty down on the bar and goes.


        INT. BROWN DERBY - PHONE BOOTH - DAY

        Jack's on the phone to Exley.

                                JACK
                  He's in the Brown Derby with
                  Johnny Stompanato.
                         (sees Bud exit)
                  Check that.  I gotta go.


        EXT. 1736 NOTTINGHAM (LYNN BRACKEN'S) - DAY

        Jack pulls up, sees Bud knock on the front door.  It
        opens and Bud steps in.  Jack doesn't see who opens it.


        EXT. BUSHES - 1736 NOTTINGHAM (LYNN BRACKEN'S) - DAY

        LEAVES RUSTLE.  There's movement in the underbrush.  Jack
        appears, followed by Exley.  Jack pulls a gun as they
        near a window.

                                EXLEY
                  What's that for?

                                JACK
                  Bud White.  He sees us and we're
                  dead.

        They press up to the glass for a partial view.  Bud White
        sits on a footstool massaging a pair of women's feet.
        Jack and Exley exchange a long, curious look.  This isn't
        the Bud White they're used to.  A pair of woman's hands
        take Bud, the arms covered in glitter and satin.

        The woman, Lynn Bracken, leans forward to kiss her
        policeman.  It may have been a long day, but she's every
        inch Veronica Lake.  Only the hair's not over her eye.

        They stand, kiss again.  Lynn's gown spills down around
        her ankles.  Bud scoops Lynn into his arms and the two of
        them disappear into a bedroom.  A long beat before...

                                JACK
                  Jesus... Maybe White's not so dumb
                  after all.

                                EXLEY
                  Rita Hayworth at the morgue and
                  now Veronica Lake with White.
                  What the hell's going on?

                                JACK
                  Movie star hookers.  Whatever you
                  desire... It's Fleur-fr-Lis again.

                                EXLEY
                  What's Fleur-de-Lis?

                                JACK
                  High line whores.  With plastic
                  surgery to look like movie stars.
                  And who knows what else?  It's run
                  by this guy Pierce Patchett.  You
                  want to talk to him?

                                EXLEY
                  Yeah.  But first I want to brace
                  Stompanato.


        INT. BROWN DERBY - ENTRANCE - DAY

        Exley and Jack enter.

                                EXLEY
                  Check the bar.  I got the restaurant.


        RESTAURANT

        Exley scans.  There's Stompanato with a girl who looks
        amazingly like "LANA TURNER."

        Engrossed, Stomapanato doesn't look up till Exley's nearly
        on top of him.

                                STOMPANATO
                  Hey, you want an autograph, write
                  to M-G-M.

                                EXLEY
                  Since when do two-bit hoods and
                  hookers give out autographs?

                                STOMPANATO
                  What?

        As Stompanato stands, Exley flashes his badge.

                                EXLEY
                  L.A.P.D.  Sit down.

                                "LANA"
                  Who in the hell do you think you
                  are?

                                EXLEY
                  Take a walk, honey, before I haul
                  your ass downtown.

                                "LANA"
                  Who in the hell do you think
                  are?!

                                STOMPANATO
                  You are making a large mistake.

        As Jack arrives, Lana tosses a drink in Exley's face.

                                "LANA"
                  Get away from our table!

                                EXLEY
                         (grabs her wrist)
                  Shut up.  Being cut to look like
                  Lana Turner doesn't mean you are
                  Lana Turner.

        Jack pulls him aside.

                                JACK
                  She is Lana Turner.

                                EXLEY
                  What?

                                JACK
                  She is Lana Turner.


        INT. EXLEY'S PLYMOUTH - SUNSET

        Rolling.  The sky glows ahead.

                                EXLEY
                  How was I supposed to know?

        A moment before Jack begins to laugh.  Exley joins him.


        EXT. 1184 GRETNA GREEN (PIERCE PATCHETT'S) - NIGHT

        Exley's Plymouth is parked on the street.


        INT. 1184 GRETNA GREEN (PATCHETT'S) - LIBRARY - NIGHT

        In a silk robe, the unflappable Pierce Patchett smiles
        at Exley.  Jack stands alongside.

                                PATCHETT
                  I believe the Nite Owl's your area
                  of expertise, Mr. Exley.  I saw
                  you on television getting your
                  medal.
                         (turns to Jack)
                  And you're that other celebrity
                  Hollywood policeman, aren't you?

        A beat.  Exley and Jack don't look like they appreciate
        being joked with.  Patchett finally sighs.

                                PATCHETT
                  I'll tell you what I told Officer
                  White when he asked me about
                  Susan's death.

                                EXLEY
                         (a look to Jack)
                  Bud White's been here?

                                PATCHETT
                  For the last time.  I may suborn
                  women into illicit activities, but
                  they're handsomely compensated, I
                  treat them well and make sure the
                  men they deal with show them every
                  due respect.

                                EXLEY
                  Is the Veronica Lake look-alike
                  one of your whores?

                                PATCHETT
                  A vulgar term, but yes.

                                EXLEY
                  What's her name?

                                PATCHETT
                  Lynn Bracken.

                                EXLEY
                  Why's she seeing Bud White?

                                PATCHETT
                  Why do men and women usually see
                  each other?

                                EXLEY
                  Anything else you want to add
                  before I talk to her?

                                PATCHETT
                  No.

                                EXLEY
                  Not good enough.

                                PATCHETT
                         (unfazed)
                  Then try talking to my lawyer.
                  Good evening, gentlemen.


        EXT. 1184 GRETNA GREEN - NIGHT

        Exley and Jack head for the car.

                                JACK
                  Guy's as cool as they come.

        A call CRACKLES in over Exley's RADIO.  Exley picks up.

                                EXLEY
                  This is Exley.

                                DISPATCHER (V.O.)
                  Ray Pinker wants to talk to you,
                  Lieutenant.  Says he has your I.D.

                                EXLEY
                  Tell him Sergeant Vincennes is
                  coming in to talk to him.

                                JACK
                  What are you going to do?

                                EXLEY
                  I'm going to Lynn Bracken's.  I'll
                  meet you at the Dining Car.

                                JACK
                  Great.  You get the girl, I get
                  the coroner.


        INT. LIBRARY (1184 GRETNA GREEN) - NIGHT

        Watching Exley and Vincennes from the window, Patchett
        picks up the phone, dials.

                                HUDGEONS (V.O.)
                         (over phone)
                  Hush-Hush.  Off the record and on
                  the Q.T.


        INT. 1736 NOTTINGHAM (LYNN'S) - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

        KNOCKING on the door.  Lynn answers to reveal Exley.

                                EXLEY
                  Miss Bracken, I'm Lieutenant
                  Exley.

                                LYNN
                  I know who you are.  You're the
                  policeman Bud told me about.

                                EXLEY
                  Really?  What did White say?

                                LYNN
                  He said you were smart.  He also
                  said you were competing with your
                  dead father.  How did he put it?
                  Trying to measure up to a ghost.

        Exley lets it pass.  As he enters...

                                EXLEY
                  Let's concentrate on my smarts.
                  Pierce Patchett made you, didn't
                  he?  He taught you how to dress
                  and talk and think and I am very
                  impressed with the results.  But I
                  need some answers and if I don't
                  get them, I'm going to take you
                  and Patchett down.

                                LYNN
                  He can take care of himself and
                  I'm not afraid of you.  And you
                  forgot one thing, Lieutenant.
                  Pierce also taught me how to
                  fuck... Can I get you a drink?

        Exley can't help but smile.  Lynn smiles back.

                                EXLEY
                  Scotch.

        Exley watches her as she steps over to fix the drinks.

                                LYNN
                  I'm curious about you.

                                EXLEY
                  Why?

        She hands him his drink.

                                LYNN
                  Because Bud hates you more than he
                  loves me.

        Exley stews.  Lynn watches him over the rim of her glass.

                                LYNN
                  It galls you that I know so much
                  about you.  You don't have
                  information to compete.

                                EXLEY
                  Don't underestimate me, Miss
                  Bracken.

                                LYNN
                  The way you've underestimated Bud
                  White?

        Exley's had it.  A menacing step forward.  Lynn's smile
        becomes a laugh.  Lost to himself, Exley leans in and
        kisses her.  Lynn pulls back, then kisses back.  In a
        beat, they're rolling to the floor, shedding clothes.

        As they trash the furniture, Lynn looks over his shoulder
        at her own reflection in a closet door mirror.


        REVERSE ANGLE - INSIDE CLOSET

        Two-way glass.  Sid Hudgeons is in here SNAPPING
        pictures.  As Lynn and Exley continue with their frantic
        lovemaking...


        INT. FORENSIC LAB - NIGHT

        Ray Pinker rubs his tired eyes.

                                PINKER
                  God bless dental records.  Stiff
                  used to be a cop.  Turner Meeks.

                                JACK
                  Buzz Meeks?

                                PINKER
                  You knew him?

                                JACK
                  Of him.  He was around when I
                  first joined the force.  A bad
                  egg.

        Pinker could care less.  As Jack's wheels turn...


        INT. LAPD - RECORDS ROOM - NIGHT

        Jack searches dusty filing cabinets with dates like 1939
        and 1940.  Reading one headed "Meeks," Jack lets out a
        low whistle.  He's found something.


        INT. PACIFIC DINING CAR - NIGHT

        Jack waits at the bar, watches the door anxiously.

                                JACK
                  Come on, Exley.  Where are you?


        INT. 1736 NOTTINGHAM (LYNN'S) - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

        Spent, Exley and Lynn sit, half-dressed, on the floor.
        They're quiet.  Then, through a smile:

                                EXLEY
                  How was I?

                                LYNN
                  Oh, the best I ever had.
                  Absolutely the best.

                                EXLEY
                         (laughs)
                  You sound like you mean it.

                                LYNN
                  The silver screen's loss is your
                  gain.

                                EXLEY
                  How about White?

                                LYNN
                  You want to know what Bud's like
                  in bed?

        She actually embarrasses him with that one.

                                EXLEY
                  I want to know why you see him.
                  Is it a Patchett payoff?

                                LYNN
                  I see Bud because I want to.  I
                  see Bud because he can't hide the
                  warmth he has inside him.

                                EXLEY
                  I'll take your word for it.

                                LYNN
                  I see Bud because he makes me feel
                  like Lynn Bracken and not some
                  Veronica Lake look-alike who fucks
                  for money.  I see him because he
                  doesn't know how to disguise who
                  he is.  There's more if you want
                  to hear it.

        Exley shakes his head.  He's heard enough.

                                LYNN
                  Does all that make it harder for
                  you to hate him or easier?

                                EXLEY
                  I don't hate White.  I really
                  don't.  It's just, in my business,
                  it's the wild cars you have to
                  watch out for.

                                LYNN
                  You don't like that you don't know
                  how to play him.  He doesn't
                  follow the same rules of politics
                  you do.  That makes him dangerous.

                                EXLEY
                  You cut to the heart of things,
                  don't you?  What about Lynn
                  Bracken?  She going to be a hooker
                  all her life?

                                LYNN
                  I came out here with a dream.
                  That's gone, but I settled for
                  reality.

                                EXLEY
                  Some reality.

                                LYNN
                  No.  This is the means to the
                  reality.  But I'm not going to
                  tell you what it is.

                                EXLEY
                  Why not?

                                LYNN
                  Because you'll use it against me.
                  Won't you?

        Exley doesn't answer, but the answer is yes.  Lynn
        smiles.

                                LYNN
                  You're tougher than Bud thinks you
                  are.

                                EXLEY
                         (smiles)
                  You're the first person to ever
                  call me tough.

                                LYNN
                  Like recognizes like.  I'm pretty
                  tough, myself.

                                EXLEY
                  You, me and White, huh?

                                LYNN
                  Actually, Bud's only tough on the
                  outside.

        As Exley kisses her...


        IN CLOSET

        Exasperated that he's still stuck in here, Sid Hudgeons
        checks his watch, shakes his head in disgust.


        EXT. 9608 VENDOME (SILVERLAKE) - NIGHT

        Jack knocks at a darkened house.  The porch lights come
        on.  The door opens to reveal Dudley Smith in his
        bathrobe.

                                DUDLEY
                  John Vincennes.  It's three A.M.,
                  lad.

                                JACK
                  Two minutes, Dudley.  It's
                  important.

                                DUDLEY
                  Lucky for you that my wife and
                  four fair daughters are at the
                  beach in Santa Barbara.


        INT. 9608 VENDOME - KITCHEN - NIGHT

        Jack sits at the table while Dudley makes coffee.

                                JACK
                  You remember Buzz Meeks, Dudley?

                                DUDLEY
                  A disgrace as a policeman.
                  Straight D fitness reports from
                  every C.O. he ever served under.
                  What about him?

                                JACK
                  Twelve years ago he worked a vice
                  roust with Dick Stensland.  They
                  arrested a Pierce Patchett on an
                  extortion scam.  Guy ran hookers.
                  He'd have them photographed with
                  their johns, then double-dip for
                  some blackmail.  Charges got
                  dropped.  Insufficient evidence.
                  You were supervising officer on
                  the case and I was wondering if
                  you remember anything about it.

                                DUDLEY
                  What's this all about, lad?

                                JACK
                  Part of it has to do with a
                  murder.  I've been working with Ed
                  Exley on it.

                                DUDLEY
                  You're Narco, lad, not Homicide.
                  And since when do you work with
                  Edmund?

                                JACK
                  It's a private investigation.  I
                  fucked something up and I want to
                  make amends.

                                DUDLEY
                         (smiles, then...)
                  Don't start trying to do the right
                  thing, John.  You haven't had
                  enough practice.

        Dudley walks over, hands Jack his coffee.

                                DUDLEY
                  Have you discussed this with
                  anyone else, John?

                                JACK
                  No.

                                DUDLEY
                  Not even with Exley?

        Jack shakes his head.  Dudley raises a REVOLVER.  He
        FIRES it at point-blank range, right into Jack's heart.
        Jack hits the floor, his cheek pressed flat on the
        linoleum.

        Jack opens his mouth to speak.  His lips form the words,
        but no sound comes out.  Dudley crouches down beside him.

                                JACK
                  Have you a valediction, lad?

        Dudley leans low, gives Jack an ear.  As he dies...

                                JACK
                  Rollo Tomasi...

        Dudley frowns in ignorance at the name.


        INT. LAPD HEADQUARTERS - BRIEFING ROOM - DAY

        Nothing mobilizes the police like losing one of their
        own.  Dudley is at the podium along with Exley.  Dozens
        of detectives take notes, including Bud White.

                                DUDLEY
                  Sergeant Vincennes' body was found
                  in Echo Park at ten o'clock this
                  morning.  Killed by a single .38
                  round to the heart.  One of our
                  own, gentlemen.  We cannot
                  tolerate it.  Justice must be
                  swift and merciless.  That's all.

        As the men move odd, Dudley approaches Exley.

                                DUDLEY
                  Edmund, a word with you.  We
                  received a tip this morning.  Did
                  Vincennes ever mention the name
                  Rollo Tomasi?

        Exley tries to look like he's thinking as Jack calls from
        the grave.  Screaming the name Dudley!

                                EXLEY
                  No... Where'd the tip come from?

                                DUDLEY
                  Anonymous.  Probably nothing.

        As Dudley moves off, Exley watches him go.  Scared.


        INT. LAPD HEADQUARTERS - BUD WHITE'S DESK - DAY

        Bud looks over as Dudley sits down across from him.

                                DUDLEY
                  You're perplexing to me these
                  days, Wendell.  You're not your
                  old, cruel self anymore.  I need
                  proof that the extracurricular
                  work I had planned for you remains
                  within your grasp.

                                BUD
                  What work?

                                DUDLEY
                  I've long been involved in
                  containing hard crime in such a
                  way that myself and a few
                  colleagues might someday enjoy a
                  profit dispensation.  That day
                  will soon be here and you'll share
                  handsomely.  Grand means will be
                  in our hands, Wendell.
                                (MORE)

                                DUDLEY (CONT'D)
                  Imagine crime limited to the
                  criminal element who perpetrate
                  it. Imagine the means to keep the
                  nigger filth sedated.  But don't
                  stop there.  Extrapolate.  Imagine
                  the police in control.  It's big,
                  lad.

                                BUD
                  You lost me, Dudley.  I don't know
                  what you're talking about.

                                DUDLEY
                  You have your extracurricular
                  secrets, I have mine.  We'll hold
                  a clarification session soon.  For
                  now, I need your fearsome old
                  habits at the Victory Motel.
                  We're going to brace a man who may
                  know who killed Jack Vincennes.
                  Can I count on you?

                                BUD
                  Sure, boss.  Sure you can.


        INT. FORENSICS LAB - DAY

        Pinker looks up as Exley enters.

                                EXLEY
                  I want to know what you and Jack
                  Vincennes talked about last night.
                  Anything and everything.  Start
                  with the I.D. on the corpse.

        A put-upon Pinker sighs.

                                PINKER
                  An ex-cop.  Buzz Meeks.  I pulled
                  his police academy photo.

        Pinker goes to his desk for a twenty-year-old photo of
        Meeks.  he hands it to Exley, whose wheels are turning.

                                EXLEY
                  We got a dead ex-cop and a girl
                  who looks like Rita Hayworth at
                  the Nite Owl.  Another dead ex-cop
                  under the house of Rita's mother.
                  It's not a good week for ex-cops.

                                PINKER
                  I got Vincennes in the next room.
                  It's not a good week for cops in
                  general.


        EXT. VICTORY MOTEL - DAY

        A RAIN STORM has turned the courtyard into a mud bath.
        As usual, a light burns in room six.  Bud White parks
        alongside the other cars already here.  He makes a dash
        for the door.


        INT. VICTORY MOTEL - ROOM SIX - DAY

        Sid Hudgeons is cuffed to the hot seat.  Dudley sits
        across from him.  Dudley's henchman Breuning looms.  Bud
        enters.

                                DUDLEY
                  This is Mr. Hudgeons, Wendell.

                                HUDGEONS
                  I'm happy to cooperate.  You don't
                  need to tie me down.

                                DUDLEY
                  It's for your own safety.  Now
                  what can you tell us about
                  Sergeant John Vincennes?

                                HUDGEONS
                  Trashcan Jack.  The Big V.  I can
                  tell you he's on the Night Train
                  to the big adios.

        Breuning cuffs Hudgeons in the side of the head.

                                HUDGEONS
                  Take it easy!  I didn't have
                  anything to do with him getting
                  killed if that's what you mean.

                                DUDLEY
                  But you were business associates?

                                HUDGEONS
                  What does that have to do --

        Breuning cuffs him again.

                                HUDGEONS
                  Okay so we worked together.  It
                  was an information exchange.  I
                  got him first class collars and he
                  got me good stories.  We were
                  friends for Chrissakes!

                                DUDLEY
                  Alright.  We'll drop that line for
                  now.  Next topic.  Please comment
                  on Pierce Patchett.

        Bud looks over at mention of the name.

                                HUDGEONS
                  You think he had something to do
                  with Vincennes getting iced?

        Dudley sighs, looks to Bud.

                                DUDLEY
                  Wendell.  I want full and docile
                  cooperation on all topics.

        Hudgeons flinches as Bud steps up, twice Breuning's size.

                                HUDGEONS
                  Okay.  Okay.  Everyone knows
                  Patchett's worth a boat-load of
                  greenbacks.  From aviation,
                  freeway construction.  But the man
                  has hobbies, too.  He bankrolls B
                  movies under the table and runs
                  movie star look-alike hookers.
                  And try this on:  he's rumored to
                  be a periodic heroin sniffer.  All
                  in all a powerful behind-the-
                  scenes strange-o.

                                DUDLEY
                  And?

                                HUDGEONS
                  And what?

        Bud digs a fist into Hudgeons' gut.  As Hudgeons gasps to
        get his breath back.

                                DUDLEY
                  Reciprocity, Mr. Hudgeons, is the
                  key to all relationships.

                                HUDGEONS
                  He runs call girls.  Primo tail.
                  Fixed up like movie stars.

        Bud looms, rests his hands on the back of Hudgeons'
        chair.  He doesn't like where this is going.

                                DUDLEY
                  And?

                                HUDGEONS
                  In my car.  Blackmail shit.  The
                  trunk under the carpet.  Patchett
                  got me to photograph a cop fucking
                  this gorgeous cunt Lynn, looks
                  just like Veronicaaa --

        Wooden slats pop as Bud tears the bolted chair right out
        of the floor.  Hudgeons and the chair land sideways.

                                DUDLEY
                  Wendell!

        Bud can't hear him.  He uprights the chair one-handed.
        As his fist cocks back, he's restrained by Breuning and
        Dudley.  This is no act.  They can barely hold Bud back.

                                HUDGEONS
                  Get him away from me!

        Bud breaks free, heads outside.


        EXT. VICTORY MOTEL - HUDGEONS' CAR - DAY

        Bud jams a tire iron into the trunk seam and pops it with
        a ferocious yank.  He tears at the carpeting.  A manila
        envelope.  Bud rips it open and 8x10 glossies of Exley
        and Lynn spill out.  Raindrops dot them, as Bud's in his
        Packard and tearing out of there.


        INT. VICTORY MOTEL - ROOM 6 - DAY

        Dudley and Breuning watch from the door.

                                DUDLEY
                  I wouldn't trade places with
                  Edmund Exley right now for all the
                  tea in China.

        Breuning laughs.  So does Hudgeons.

                                HUDGEONS
                  Dudley, I thought you were gonna
                  let the dumb bastard kill me.
                         (to Breuning)
                  And you!  Learn to pull those
                  punches a little better.

        Dudley and Breuning stare at him.  A bit grimly.

                                HUDGEONS
                  You can uncuff me now, fellas.

        But no one moves to do so.

                                HUDGEONS
                  Fellas?
                         (nervous)
                  We had a deal.  You, me and
                  Patchett,  We're a team!
                         (scared)
                  Come on, we're friends.  We're --

        As Hudgeons protests, Dudley slaps a hand over his mouth.

                                DUDLEY
                  Hush-hush...

        As Breuning and Carlisle move in...


        INT. RECORDS ROOM - LAPD - DAY

        A wormish CLERK searches dusty filing cabinets with dates
        like 1939 and 1940.  The same ones Jack looked through.
        Exley steps over from another row.

                                EXLEY
                  Anything?

                                CLERK
                  Nothing.

                                EXLEY
                  So on active duty, Meeks didn't
                  make an arrest from 1938 to '43.

                                CLERK
                  Someone must've pulled the
                  records.

        Exley ponders the implications.  Taking out the photo of
        Meeks, he gets an idea.

                                EXLEY
                  Where are the police academy
                  files?

                                CLERK
                  I don't have time.  I have --

                                EXLEY
                  Just show me where they are!


        EXT. 1736 NOTTINGHAM (LYNN BRACKEN'S) - DAY

        Blue, Lynn sits on her porch watching the rain come down.
        A SCREECHING on the wet street as Bud's PACKARD pulls up.
        She watches as he gets out and starts for the house.
        Lynn stands, holds her arms out.  Bud stops short on the
        steps, out of reach, the rain soaking him.

                                BUD
                  Did you talk to Exley?

                                LYNN
                  Come in out of the rain.  In the
                  morning we'll have both our
                  stories for breakfast.

        Lightning flashes.  Bud shakes hs head.

                                BUD
                  I want to know about Exley.

                                LYNN
                  He's the opposite of you.  He's
                  more like me.  Cold, calculating.

                                BUD
                  How'd you get to know so much
                  about him?

        More lightning.  Lynn looks God-awful sad.

                                LYNN
                  Come in out of the rain, Bud.

                                BUD
                  You gonna tell me what happened
                  with you and Exley?

                                LYNN
                  We talked.

                                BUD
                  So tell me about it.

                                LYNN
                         (looking away)
                  In the morning.

                                BUD
                  No.  Now.
                         (a beat)
                  You fucked him.

        Too tired to lie anymore, Lynn finally just nods.

                                LYNN
                  I thought I was helping you.  I
                  thought --

        Bud backhands her, hard.  Lynn faces straight into the
        next one as Bud hits her again.  A third time as the sins
        of the father are visited on the son.  Bud stops short as
        the self-realization slams home.  Lynn waits stoically.
        She doesn't start crying till Bud turns and runs back
        into the rain.


        INT. RECORDS ROOM - LAPD - DAY

        Drawers are open.  Files are everywhere.  Exley's reached
        the end of the line.  As he looks through one last file,
        he finds a stack of official photos.  Then he stops
        short.  There's a photo of four cadets and an academy
        instructor.

        Two of the cadets are IDed as Turner Meeks and Dick
        Stensland.  The instructor is Dudley Smith!

        Exley looks up at the sound of FOOTSTEPS and Bud is
        there.  Fury.  He slams Exley, knocks him flat.

        Bud's here to kill him.  He hauls Exley up, pummels him,
        then throws him over the table.  Then up into a wall.
        Plaster cracks.  Bud's on some gonzo animal plane.  Bud
        strangles him.  Exley gags.  It'll be over in moments.

        Until Exley's flailing hands finds Bud's .38.  Yanking it
        from his waistband, Exley smashes Bud in the forehead.
        Bud reels.  But, blind with rage, he moves back in only
        to have the barrel of the .38 placed right between his
        eyes.

                                EXLEY
                  Why?

                                BUD
                  Lynn.

                                EXLEY
                  She told you?

        Bud shakes his head.  He's coiled, ready to make a move.

                                EXLEY
                  Who told you?  Did Dudley have
                  anything to do with you finding
                  out?

        Bud hesitates, the answer obvious.

                                EXLEY
                  Listen to me.  Dudley killed Jack.
                  It has something to do with Buzz
                  Meeks.

        Exley points out the academy photo on the floor.

                                EXLEY
                  Look.  Dudley and Meeks go way
                  back.  Stensland, too.

        Bud sees, but does he really?  As Bud reaches for the
        photo, Exley relaxes slightly.  Bud slaps the gun away,
        drops Exley to the ground.  He grabs, begins slamming his
        head into the floor.

                                EXLEY
                  Think, goddamn you.  Think...

        Exley's almost out.  But maybe Bud heard him.  The attack
        slows, stops as Bud does think.  Exley stays conscious.

                                BUD
                  I knew Stensland and Meeks knew
                  each other.  Meeks was with Sue
                  Lefferts on Christmas Eve.  The
                  night I met Lynn.  Lefferts'
                  mother I.D.ed Stensland as
                  Lefferts' boyfriend, but Stens
                  pretended he didn't know either
                  one of them.

                                EXLEY
                  Stensland and Meeks.  What were
                  they up to?

                                BUD
                  Johnny Stompanato told me when
                  Meeks disappeared, he was trying
                  to move the 18 pounds of heroin
                  that went missing when Deuce
                  Perkins was shot.

                                EXLEY
                  Stensland and Buzz Meeks.  Two-man
                  triggers knocking off Mickey Cohen
                  lieutenants.  When they killed
                  Deuce Perkins, they got heroin as
                  a bonus.

                                BUD
                  Then something goes wrong.  Meeks
                  gets killed.  Maybe Stens got
                  greedy, killed Meeks and left him
                  under his girlfriend's house.
                         (a beat)
                  The night he died, Stens was all
                  mysterious.  Said he had something
                  big going down.

                                EXLEY
                  The Nite Owl!  Stensland was going
                  there to sell the heroin.

                                BUD
                  Somebody got wind of it, killed
                  them all.

                                EXLEY
                  It wasn't the Negroes.  The Griffith
                  Park report was a phony. And, who
                  says the purple Merc was spotted
                  outside the Nite Owl?

                                BUD
                  Dudley.

                                EXLEY
                  The first guys to the car when
                  Jack and I got there were Bruening
                  and Carlisle.

                                BUD
                  Dudley's guys.

                                EXLEY
                  They didn't find the shotguns.
                  They planted them.

                                BUD
                  It all keeps coming back to
                  Dudley.

                                EXLEY
                  It's Dudley for the Nite Owl.

        They just stare at each other a beat as it sinks in.

                                EXLEY
                  Pierce Patchett figures in, too.
                  That's the angle Jack was working.
                  Dudley must work for Patchett.

                                BUD
                  Let's just kill them.

                                EXLEY
                  What?

                                BUD
                  For Jack, for Stensland, for
                  anybody else who got in the way.
                  I've been trying to be smart.  A
                  detective.  But killing those two
                  fuckers, that would be justice.

                                EXLEY
                  Stay smart, Bud.  We build a case.
                  We play by the rules.

                                BUD
                  There are no rules!  Why the fuck
                  are you doing this?  The Nite Owl
                  made you.  You want to tear all
                  that down.

                                EXLEY
                  With a wrecking ball.  You want to
                  help me swing it?

        Bud smiles.  For a second he likes Exley.

                                EXLEY
                  Let's go see Pierce Patchett.  Run
                  a good-cop-bad-cop.

                                BUD
                  Which one are you and which one am
                  I?

        EXT. 1184 GRETNA GREEN (PIERCE PATCHETT'S) - DAY

        Exley and Bud make their way up the walk.  Bud pulls his
        .38 from its shoulder holster, shoves it in his
        waistband.

                                EXLEY
                  You expecting problems?

                                BUD
                  Patchett uses a lot of ex-cop
                  muscle.


        FRONT DOOR

        Exley RINGS the BUZZER.  Looking back, Bud sees a
        pitching wedge and pile of golf balls abandoned in the
        grass.  A single ball floats in the koi pond.  Bud's eyes
        narrow at the sight.  Not like Patchett at all.

                                BUD
                  Come on.

        And Bud shoulders the heavy door right off its hinges.


        INT. 1184 GRETNA GREEN - HALLWAY - DAY

        Bud draws his .38 as he strides in.  Exley tries to keep up.

                                EXLEY
                         (a screaming
                          whisper)
                  What?

        Double doors on the left open into a library.  Bud stops
        short, slowly lowers his gun.  Exley steps up beside him.


        LIBRARY

        Hanging from a ceiling light, Patchett's body slowly
        twists around, a toppled chair beneath him.

                                EXLEY
                  I don't think his ex-cop did him
                  much good.

        Bud goes to the body while Exley heads for a side table
        on which rests a typed sheet of paper.

        Bud checks Patchett's right hand, the knuckles are split,
        two of the fingers badly distended.

                                EXLEY
                  It's a suicide note.  Says he
                  killed Jack because Jack had
                  figured out a pornography scam
                  Patchett was running.

                                BUD
                  He had help getting up there.  Two
                  of his fingers are broken.

                                EXLEY
                  We had one thing figured wrong.  I
                  don't think Dudley workd for
                  Patchett.

                                BUD
                  At least not anymore.

                                EXLEY
                  Patchett's dead.  He sent you
                  after me.  I'd say Dudley's tying
                  up his loose ends.

                                BUD
                         (it hits him)
                  Lynn.

        Bud dashes to the PHONE, dials.  It RINGS.  No one
        answers.

                                EXLEY
                  I got a guy who owes me in the
                  Sheriff's department.  West
                  Hollywood station.  He can be at
                  her house in two minutes.

        Bud shoves the phone into his hand.

                                BUD
                  Call him.


        EXT. 1736 NOTTINGHAM (LYNN BRACKEN'S) - DAY

        A county sheriff's unmarked parked out front.  A DEPUTY
        behind the wheel.  Exley's Plymouth pulls up behind.  The
        Deputy gets out.  MOVE WITH him as he steps BACK TO
        Exley, who's rolling down his window.

                                EXLEY
                  Is she inside?

                                DEPUTY
                  We took her to Hollywood Station
                  for safekeeping.  Someone worked
                  her over pretty good.  She
                  wouldn't say who.

        Exley looks at Bud.  Bud looks down in shame.

                                EXLEY
                  Hold her as Joan Smith.  No one
                  sees her unless I okay it.

                                DEPUTY
                  You got it, Exley.  And now we're
                  even.

        As the Deputy moves off.

                                EXLEY
                  Ellis Loew.

                                BUD
                  What about him?

                                EXLEY
                  Jack thought he was up to his neck
                  in all this.

        INT. DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OUTER OFFICE - DAY

        A SECRETARY looks up as Bud and Exley beeline Loew's
        door.

                                SECRETARY
                  You can't go in there!


        INNER OFFICE

        Loew looks up as they burst in.

                                SECRETARY
                  Do you want me to call the police,
                  Mr. Loew?

                                EXLEY
                  Ask for Captain Dudley Smith.
                  We'll have a party.  Hot dogs and
                  sauerkraut.

        A beat as Loew considers his options.

                                LOEW
                  It's okay.  These are police.
                         (as she leaves)
                  What do you want?

                                EXLEY
                  I want D.A. bureau men to tail
                  Dudley Smith twenty-four hours a
                  day; I want you to get a judge to
                  authorize a wire tap on his home
                  phone; I want authorization to
                  check his bank records and I want
                  it all in an hour.

                                LOEW
                  On what evidence?

                                EXLEY
                  None.  Call it a hunch.

                                LOEW
                         (incredulous)
                  Absolutely not.  Dudley Smith is a
                  highly decorated member of this
                  city's police department and I
                  won't smear his name without --

                                EXLEY
                  Without what, his smearing yours
                  first?  What's he got on you,
                  Loew?  Pictures of you and an out
                  of work actor with your pants
                  down?

                                LOEW
                  Do you have any proof?

                                EXLEY
                  The proof had his throat slit.
                         (a beat)
                  So far you're not denying it.

                                LOEW
                  I'm not going to dignify youwith
                  answers.  If you'll excuse me,
                  I've got a Jack Vincennes press
                  conference to prepare for.

        Loew enters his bathroom.  Bud looks to Exley who nods:
        Go.


        OFFICE BATHROOM

        Loew is at the mirror clipping a few stray nose hairs.
        Bud enters full of menace followed by Exley.

                                LOEW
                  Unless you're here to wipe my ass,
                  I think we're through.

        Bud just glares at him.  Loew shakes his head.

                                LOEW
                  Don't try this good cop/bad cop
                  with me.  I practically
                  invented it.  And so what if some
                  homo actor is dead.  Boys, girls,
                  ten of them step off the bus to
                  L.A. every day.

        The MIRROR SPIDERWEBS as Bud slams Loew's face into it.
        Bud swings him around, forces him forward and shoves his
        head in the toilet.

        He holds it there, finally lets Loew up for breath.  Then        
        backhands:  one, two, three.

                                BUD
                  Dudley Smith.  Spill.

                                LOEW
                  Call him off, Exley!

                                EXLEY
                  I don't know how.

        More backhands.  Holding Loew by the scruff of the neck,
        Bud marches him past Exley and back into the...


        INNER OFFICE

        Bud heaves up the window, practically throws Loew through
        it.  Loew catches hold of the window framing.  Bud
        hammers his hands loose with a fist and pushes him
        through.


        OUTSIDE

        Bud holds his leg.  Loew screams as coins, comb and
        wallet spill from his pockets, plummet toward the street
        below.


        INNER OFFICE

        Bud shakes Loew, could drop him at any time.

                                EXLEY
                  Bud...

                                BUD
                  If I let you go, there'll be ten
                  more lawyers to take your place
                  tomorrow.  They just won't come on
                  the bus, that's all.


        OUTSIDE

        We hear Loew's PANT LEG TEARING loose.

                                LOEW
                  Okay!  You're right!  Dudley's got
                  photos of me and Reynolds.

                                EXLEY
                  What's Dudley's scheme?

        More TEARING.  Loew's life may depend on the answer.

                                LOEW
                  Dudley's rotten to the core.  He's
                  taking over Mickey Cohen's
                  rackets, his own hand-picked
                  cops'll be the new franchise
                  holders.  Because of those
                  pictures I won't be able to
                  prosecute.  Oh Jesus pull me up!


        INNER OFFICE

        Exley helps pull Loew back inside.  Bud dumps him on the
        floor.  Bruised and bloodied, Loew looks up at Exley.

                                LOEW
                  Dudley's got everyone under his
                  thumb.  Not just me, but the Chief
                  of Police, the lieutenant
                  governor, everybody!

        Exley pulls his .38, shoves it into the side of Loew's
        neck.

                                EXLEY
                  Not everybody.  You tip-off Dudley
                  and Officer White visits you alone
                  next time.

        Loew looks at Bud, nods, his face a bloody mess.


        EXT. CITY OFFICE BUILDING - DAY

        Exley and Bud exit.  Bud's wheels are turning.

                                BUD
                  They never made a match on the
                  shotgun serial numbers.  What if
                  Breuning and Carlisle took them
                  from the evidence room?  Couple of
                  cold pieces that had been hanging
                  around a year or two.

                                EXLEY
                  We should check the records, and,
                  we should talk to Lynn.

        Bud just stares at him a beat.

                                EXLEY
                  You want to talk to her?

        Bud looks away, shakes his head "no."  Finally...

                                BUD
                  You do it.  I'll check the files.


        INT. SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT - HOLDING ROOM - DAY

        Lynn looks up as Exley enters.  her face is puffy,
        swollen.

                                LYNN
                         (dry)
                  If I knew you were coming I'd have
                  baked a cake.

                                EXLEY
                  Forget everything else for a
                  second, Lynn.  Is there anything
                  you can give me on Dudley Smith?

        A blank look from her.

                                EXLEY
                  A police captain.  I think he's
                  behind all of this.

                                LYNN
                         (shakes her head)
                  I work for Patchett.  I had a
                  feeling that there was someone
                  else, but I never knew who.

                                EXLEY
                  Okay.  Look, if it helps, Bud
                  hates himself for what he did.

                                LYNN
                         (a beat)
                  I know how he feels.

        A beat as Exley wonders how he should interpret this.

                                EXLEY
                  I don't know if it's pathetic or
                  romantic, but when this is all
                  over I'd like to see you again.

        Lynn looks away, can't help an ironic smile even as she
        starts to cry.  As Exley gives her his handkerchief...


        INT. LAPD - EVIDENCE ROOM - NIGHT

        Bud waits at the cage window as a RECORDER returns with
        some information.

                                RECORDER
                  I got your guns, Bud.  Signed in
                  April 3rd, 1950.  Remember the
                  First Western bank robbery?  They
                  were used in that.

                                BUD
                  I want to see them.

                                RECORDER
                  No can do.  I can't find them.

        As Bud thinks, a ROOKIE-TYPE approaches.

                                ROOKIE-TYPE
                  Uh -- Sergeant White?

                                BUD
                  What?

                                ROOKIE-TYPE
                  Dispatch just got a call for you.
                  Lieutenant Exley wants you to meet
                  him at the Victory Motel.


        EXT. VICTORY MOTEL - SUNSET

        Bud's Packard crests the rise looking down on the
        Victory.  Exley's Plymouth is in the courtyard.


        INT. VICTORY MOTEL - ROOM 6 - SUNSET

        Exley in the hotseat.  Sitting there thinking.  At a CAR
        DOOR CLOSING, he goes to the door.


        ANOTHER ANGLE

        Exley opens the door as Bud approaches, toting a shotgun.
        The sun is down.  The sky is just a dull glow.

                                BUD
                  You wanted to meet here?

                                EXLEY
                  Me?  You called it.  I got a
                  message that...

        As the reality sinks in, Bud and Exley hear TIRES on the
        GRAVEL; CARS are COMING.  Being in a concavity, they
        don't see them yet.  Then the CARS STOP.   But still Bud
        and Exley can't see anything.  They hear the CLICKS of
        CAR DOORS OPENING, but they don't hear them shut.  There
        are FOOTSTEPS, MURMURED WHISPERS.  More CARS PULL UP.

                                EXLEY
                  Shit... Come on.

        Exley starts for his car, but Bud holds him back.

                                BUD
                  Too late.

        A beat.  Resigned, Exley nods.  They retreat back to Room
        6, disappear inside.  A beat.  There's MOVEMENT in the
        shadows to the left.  To the right.


        INT. VICTORY MOTEL - ROOM 6 - NIGHT

        There's a big back window.  Bud covers most of it with a
        ratty old mattress.  He pumps the shotgun.

        He pulls a .45 automatic from his waistband.

                                BUD
                  Here.

        He throws the auto to Exley, pulls out a .38.  Bud's
        armed for bear.

                                EXLEY
                  You figured this was a set-up?
                  And you showed up anyway?

                                BUD
                  A lot of bad stuff happened here.
                  It's as good a place as any for it
                  to end.

        Bud switches off the light.  They wait in silence.  Then:

                                EXLEY
                  You know, all I ever wanted was to
                  measure up to my father.

                                BUD
                         (softly)
                  I spent years trying not to live
                  down to mine.
                                (MORE)

                                BUD (CONT'D)
                         (thinking)
                  We should block off the bathroom.
                  They could come through --

        A CREAK outside the front door.  Bud levels the SHOTGUN.
        BOOM!  The DOOR is BLOWN OFF ITS HINGES.  We see the
        figure of a man sprawl back in the dirt.  In the darkness
        beyond, MUZZLE FLASHES from all around.  Exley and Bud
        RETURN FIRE.

        We hear the BACK WINDOW BREAK under a MUFFLED BLOW.  Bud
        charges back, yanks down the mattress revealing two men
        climbing through.  Sitting ducks:  torn apart by THREE
        TRIPLE-AUGHT ROUNDS close in.  A beat, then...

                                EXLEY
                  We got him!

        Bud smiles, in on the plan as theres an answering WHOOP.
        A third man looks through the window.  BOOM!  Bud nails
        him.

        Bud motions Exley to stay put, then slips out the window.


        EXT. VICTORY MOTEL - NIGHT

        Bud crouches, looks between the cinder blocks supporting
        the room.  Two sets of feet shuffling along.  Bud FIRES
        the SHOTGUN.  Shrieks as the men go down.  Bud extends
        the .38 to fire point blank headshots.  Then...

        Bud flattens himself as a wicked CROSSFIRE TEARS UP ROOM
        6.


        INT. VICTORY MOTEL - NIGHT

        Exley is forced down as well, lying flat as plaster rains
        down.

        The door frame splinters as more Dudley men charge in.
        Four men with rifles.  One is Patchett's Burly Bodyguard.
        They spot Exley lying there.  Hushed whispers as they
        approach:  "Dead meat."  "Be careful."  Kicks in the
        side.  The men look at each other, sneer.

        Exley jerks a foot.  The foot man stumbles as Exley spins
        around SHOOTING.  FIRING the .45 and his own .38.  All
        four men go down.  Exley stands, digs into his pocket to
        reload.

        Bud scrambles back through the window.  Exley looks over
        and smiles as Bud reloads the shotgun.  It's dead quiet.

                                EXLEY
                  I'm thinking we might walk away
                  from this.

        At that instant, Dudley steps through the bathroom door.
        He's got Exley dead to rights.  As he squeezes the
        trigger, Bud leaps forward, pushes Exley hard to the
        ground.

        The SHOT passes through Bud's back by his left shoulder
        blade.  It spins him around.  A SECOND SHOT to the
        stomach slows him to a walk as he charges Dudley.  A
        THIRD ROUND SHATTERS Bud's jaw, but still he comes.
        Driven by rage, his hands reaching for Dudley's throat.
        He even gets hold before a FOURTH SLUG tears his chest.

        Bud falls hard.

        Dudley swings his aim to Exley who's just managed to
        shake the cobwebs of being flattened by Bud.  A frozen
        moment.

                                DUDLEY
                  I'm loathe to kill my brother
                  officers, Edmund.

                                EXLEY
                  Tell that to Jack Vincennes.  To
                  Stensland.

                                DUDLEY
                  Jack was a shame, but Dick
                  Stensland had the audacity to try
                  to sell me my own heroin.  Through
                  his whore girl friend.  I sent him
                  to make the buy.  The rest is
                  history.

                                EXLEY
                  Why?

                                DUDLEY
                  A vacuum, Edmund.  That's what we
                  have in Los Angeles.  Sending
                  Mickey Cohen up created it.  My
                  containment work maintained it.
                  Certain photographs guarantee it.
                  Organized crime has been held
                  back, but there's still a demand
                  for the services it provides.

                                EXLEY
                  And now you'll provide them.

                                DUDLEY
                  Absolutely.  Prostitution and
                  gambling are victimless crimes.
                  The heroin we'll run down to the
                  coloreds.  Anesthetize them.  As
                  long as it's not a middle class
                  problem, no one will care.  It's
                  still a crime free city... for
                  respectable people.

        Dudley aims the .38, cocks back the hammer.  We hear
        DISTANT POLICE SIRENS.

                                DUDLEY
                  This isn't politics, Edmund.
                  There won't be winners and losers
                  when it's over...

        Dudley doesn't see Bud stir, reach into a pocket.

                                DUDLEY
                  Just the living and the dead.
                  It's always been that way in the
                  Bureau.  You should've realized
                  that before you became a
                  detective.

        It's over.  Dudley's finger tightens on the trigger.  But
        Dudley screams as Bud buries a switchblade into his left
        calf.  It took all Bud had left.  As he collapses...

        Dudley wails; Exley dives for Bud's shotgun.  Dudley
        FIRES, misses.  A wild SHOTGUN BLAST takes out half the
        wall.  Dudley stumbles out the door.  SIRENS BLARE.


        EXT. VICTORY MOTEL - NIGHT

        Dudley drops his gun as the cruisers stream down.  Exley
        steps out behind him, but doesn't drop the shotgun.  The
        two of them are bleached white by headlights.

        Dudley raises his badge over his head.

                                DUDLEY
                  We're policemen!
                         (winks)
                  Let me do the talking.  They'll
                  make you Chief of Detectives.

        Exley steps ahead to block his way.

                                EXLEY
                  No.

                                DUDLEY
                  Why not, lad?  Absolute justice?

                                EXLEY
                  Something like that.

                                DUDLEY
                  Really?  Would you be willing to
                  rig crime scene evidence to
                  support a prosecuting attorney's
                  working hypothesis?

        Exley doesn't answer.  Dudley smiles.

                                DUDLEY
                  Would you be willing to beat
                  confessions out of suspects you
                  knew to be guilty?

        Exley glares.  Laughing, Dudley brushes by, limps toward
        the gathering policemen.

                                DUDLEY
                  Are you willing to shoot hardened
                  criminals in the back to offset
                  the chance they'll --

        The SHOTGUN BELCHES flame.  Dudley goes down, shot in the
        back.  Exley drops the gun, raises his hands over his
        head.

                                                   DISSOLVE TO:


        L.A. MONTAGE

        "RAGS TO RICHES" PLAYS.


        EXT. ROSE BOWL PARADE - DAY

        Riding in a convertible, waving to the crowds is the
        Grand Marshal -- the new Vice President, a young
        Richard Nixon.


        INT. OBSERVATION ROOM - NIGHT

        A midnight assembly.  The Chief, D.A. Loew and several
        high ranking brass.  Their attention riveted
        THROUGH the one-way glass into...


        INT. ROOM #1 - NIGHT

        Bloody, exhausted, Exley sits across from two INTERNAL
        AFFAIRS DETECTIVES.

                                INTERNAL AFFAIRS #1
                  You have a lot of explaining to
                  do, Lieutenant.

                                EXLEY
                  Yes.  I do.

        As Exley begins...


        TELEVISION SCREEN

        Where we're informed that tonight's episode of "Badge of
        Honor" is:  "Dedicated to the memory of technical advisor
        Sergeant Jack Vincennes."


        EXT. VENTURA FREEWAY - CAHUENGA PASS - DAY

        A ribbon is cut.  Eager motorists roll down the blacktop.


        EXT. GRAUMAN'S CHINESE THEATER - DAY

        Ronald Reagan applauds as Jane Wyman plunges her hands
        into fresh sidewalk cement.


        INT. OBSERVATION ROOM - NIGHT

        The brass exchange concerned looks and raied eyebrows as
        they watch Exley THROUGH the glass, his VOICE heard OVER
        the SPEAKERS.


        INT. UNION STATION - DAY

        The Flatnose Frisco loan shark and Cauliflowered
        Cleveland enforcer seen earlier at the Victory Motel
        return to L.A., ready to fill the vacuum.


        EXT. NEWSSTAND - DAY

        Hush-Hush is delivered.  The headline:  "Actor Reynolds
        in his Final Role:  Conductor of the Night Train to Slice
        City."


        INT. ROOM #1 - NIGHT

        Exley stares across at the Internal Affairs Detectives.

                                EXLEY
                  That's it.  That's the whole
                  story.

        As Exley looks to the gray-tinted wall mirror...


        OBSERVATION ROOM

        Loew leans over, whispers to the Chief.

                                LOEW
                  The press would have a field day
                  with this.

                                CHIEF
                         (a beat)
                  When in doubt, feed them a hero.
                  In this case, we'll need more than
                  one.

                                                   CUT TO:


        LOS ANGELES EXAMINER HEADLINE:

                           R.I.P. DUDLEY SMITH
                   Fabled L.A. Cop Dies Defending City
                           from Organized Crime!


        INT. LAPD HEADQUARTERS - BRIEFING ROOM - DAY

        Exley in his dress blue uniform.  The Chief smiles, pins
        gold stars to his shoulders.

                                CHIEF
                  Captain Edmund Exley.  Chief of
                  Detectives.  Los Angeles Police
                  Department.

        Applause.  Flashbulbs.  Lynn watches from the back as
        Exley runs a handshake gauntlet.  Finally, he spots her.
        She's returned to her natural brunette.  Looks even
        better.  Exley steps over.

                                EXLEY
                         (ironic smile)
                  I tried to throw it all away and
                  they give it back in spades.


        EXT. PARKING LOT - DAY

        Exley walks Lynn out.

                                EXLEY
                  Where will you go?

                                LYNN
                  Bisbee, Arizona.  The air's good
                  for pensioners and I know where
                  everything is.

                                EXLEY
                  When?

                                LYNN
                  Right now, before I back down.

                                EXLEY
                  Where is he?

        Lynn gestures ahead.  They walk to her car.  She opens
        the back door.  Bud's in the back.  Braces on his legs,
        head sutured.  Jaw wired shut and tubes running in and
        out.  But his hands still look strong.  Bud forces a
        smile through the wires, tries to say something, but
        can't.

                                EXLEY
                  Thanks for the push.

        Exley takes his hand.  Bud squeezes till both men wince.

                                EXLEY
                  You just did what you did.  No
                  rank, no glory.

        Exley slips his Medal of Valor into Bud's hand.

                                EXLEY
                  From me to you.  It'll mean
                  something if it's yours.

        Bud takes it, turns away so Exley won't see the tears.

                                LYNN
                  We should go now.

        As Exley steps back, Lynn closes the door.  PARTY noises
        drift from upstairs.  Exley looks to Lynn.

                                EXLEY
                  Do you think I ever could've been
                  in the running?

                                LYNN
                  Some men get the world.  Others
                  get ex-hookers and a trip to
                  Arizona.

        A beat.  Exley wishes he'd gotten the trip to Arizona.
        She kisses him on the cheek, gets in the CAR.  STARTS it.

        Exley looks back at Bud.  Bud presses his hands to the
        glass.  Exley touches his side, palms half the man's
        size.  Hands against hands.

        The car moves. A turn into traffic, a good-bye TOOT on
        the HORN.  Exley's all alone.  As he watches them go...

                                                  FADE TO BLACK.

        FADE IN:

        OVER the opening strains of "I LOVE YOU, CALIFORNIA," a
        MONTAGE:  a mixture of headlines, newsreel footage and
        live action.  Economy Booming!  Postwar Optimism!  L.A.:
        City of the Future!  But most prominent among them:
        GANGLAND!  Police photographers document crime scenes.
        The meat wagon hauls ex-button men to the morgue.  Where
        will it end?


        EXT. L.A. SKYLINE - SUNSET

        Palm trees in silhouette against a cherry sky.  City
        lights twinkle.  Los Angeles.  A place where anything is
        possible.  A place where dreams come true.  As the sky
        darkens, triple-kleig lights begin to sweep back and
        forth.


        EXT. MANSION (HANCOCK PARK) - NIGHT

        The KLEIG LIGHTS are out front.  Valets hurry to park a
        line of elegant cars.

                                MAYOR (V.O.)
                  Ladies and gentlemen, I give you
                  the future of Los Angeles!


        INT. HANCOCK PARK MANSION - BALLROOM - NIGHT

        The MAYOR yanks a cloth to reveal a MODEL of L.A. criss-
        crossed by an elaborate FREEWAY SYSTEM.  The CROWD oohs.
        A COUNCILMAN claps.  A SOCIETY MATRON nods her approval.

        PIERCE PATCHETT, 50, tuxedoed, watches off to one side.
        A behind-the-scenes power broker, Patchett exudes
        authority much more so than the Mayor does.

                                MAYOR
                  The Arroyo Seco freeway is just
                  the beginning.  We're planning
                  freeways from Downtown to Santa
                  Monica, from the South Bay to the
                  San Fernando Valley.  Twenty
                  minutes to work or play is the
                  longest you'll have to travel.

        More applause.  One REPORTER asks a little too loudly...

                                REPORTER
                  How many bodies you think Mickey
                  Cohen'll be able to hide in all
                  that cement?

        The Mayor wears a plastic smile, ignores it.


        INT. THE MOCAMBO - NIGHT

        A CLUB PHOTOGRAPHER pops snapshots, but the real action
        is on the floor where MICKEY COHEN does a wicked "Lindy
        Hop" with THREE different GIRLS at once.  A fireplug of a
        man, he hardly seems a public menace.  Nearby is his
        bodyguard JOHNNY STOMPANATO.  Over it all:

                                HUDGEONS (V.O.)
                  Meyer Harris Cohen, Mickey C to
                  his fans.  He's the big moocher,
                  local L.A. color to the nth
                  degree.  You know Mickey.  He runs
                  dope, rackets and prostitution.
                  He kills a dozen people a year.
                  But who you may not know is
                  bodyguard Johnny Stompanato.

        His hair in a slick pompadour, Stompanato keeps an eye on
        Cohen and comes onto a CIGARETTE GIRL at the same time.

                                HUDGEONS (V.O.)
                  Johnny's handsome, ladies, but the
                  real attraction is below the belt.
                  Second only to Steve Cochran, he's
                  sometimes known as 'Oscar' because
                  of his Academy Award-size
                  appendage.

        Mickey works a sweat on the dance floor.  A bottle of
        champagne pops; Stompanato reacts, nearly draws a pistol
        from his shoulder holster.  As he laughs at himself...


        INT. HUSH-HUSH MAGAZINE OFFICE - DAY

        Lurid page one headlines cover the wall where SID
        HUDGEONS types.  The essence of sleaze, Sid is the
        publisher-photographer-writer of Hush-Hush magazine and
        keeper of inside dirt supreme.  As he continues...

                                HUDGEONS (V.O.)
                  Remember, dear readers, you heard
                  it here first, off the record, on
                  the Q.T. and very Hush-Hush.


        INT. HANCOCK PARK MANSION - BALLROOM - NIGHT

        The party continues.  The Mayor has moved off to the side
        with the power brokers.  Patchett is a presence.

                                MAYOR
                  We're selling an image, gentlemen.
                  Beautiful weather.  Affordable
                  housing.
                         (re:  model)
                  Trouble-free transportation.  And
                  the best police department in the
                  world to keep it all running
                  smoothly.


        EXT. STOREFRONT - NIGHT

        A dozen people watch a display windoe TELEVISION as it
        rolls the opening of the hit show "Badge of Honor."  Over
        familiar THEME MUSIC, "Sgt. Joe Reno" (actor BRETT CHASE)
        walks the streets of Los Angeles.

                                CHASE (V.O.)
                  My name?  Joe Reno.  The city?
                  Los Angeles.  A big town.  Full of
                  all sorts of people.  It's my job
                  to help them.  I like what I do.
                  I'm a cop.


        INT. HANCOCK PARK MANSION - BALLROOM - NIGHT

        The Mayor continues.

                                MAYOR
                  But with a second rate Al Capone
                  out there, L.A. looks like Chicago
                  in the '30s.  Something has to be
                  done.

        As Pierce Patchett nods sagely.


        INT. OLYMPIC AUDITORIUM - NIGHT

        Wrestler GORGEOUS GEORGE primps and poses before flatten-
        ing an opponent with a drop kick.


        INT. MOVIE THEATER - NIGHT

        An enthusiastic crowd adjusts their 3-D glasses.


        EXT. COHEN MANSION (BEVERLY HILLS) - DAY

        In monogrammed silk pajamas, Mickey Cohen answers the
        door, his pet BULLDOG Mickey Jr. at his feet.  The police
        are waiting.  REPORTERS' flashbulbs pop.

                                POLICE OFFICER
                  Mr. Cohen, you're under arrest.

                                COHEN
                  Bullshit.  What's the charge?

                                POLICE OFFICER
                  Non-payment of federal income tax.

                                COHEN
                  Bullshit.


        EXT. GRAUMAN'S CHINESE - DAY

        JOHN WAYNE gets his hand prints in the sidewalk.


        EXT. WESTCHESTER BEAN FIELD - DAY

        MIGRANT WORKERS hurry to finish the harvest.  We PAN
        TO CONSTRUCTION WORKERS who wait impatiently with bull-
        dozers under a "Spirit of the Future" BANNER.  As the
        last picker leaves the field, the bulldozers move in,
        leveling the bean rows to make way for a housing tract.


        EXT. FEDERAL COURTHOUSE - STEPS - DAY

        Flashbulbs pop as Mickey Cohen exits and starts down
        the steps.  Accompanied by his LAWYERS, bodyguard
        Stompanato and mob lieutenants DEUCE PERKINS and NATE
        JANKLOW, Cohen ignores REPORTERS' shouts.

                                REPORTER
                  How's your bullshit now, Mickey?!

        As Cohen gets into a waiting car, the media turn their
        attention to District Attorney ELLIS LOEW.  A singularly
        ambitious man, Loew loves the spotlight.

                                LOEW
                  Today is an auspicious one for the
                  city of Los Angeles.  Mickey Cohen
                  has just been sentenced to ten
                  years in federal prison for
                  failure to pay income tax.
                  As the District Attorney for Los
                  Angeles County, it is my pleasure
                  to declare our great city
                  organized crime free.  It is truly
                  the dawning of a new day.

        The SONG ENDS and so does the MONTAGE.


        INT. PACKARD (ACROSS FROM BULLOCKS WILSHIRE) - NIGHT

        December 24th.  Wendell "BUD" WHITE, 30, stares at the
        enormous Christmas tree on the deco platform over
        Bullocks' entrance.  An LAPD cop, Bud's rep as the
        toughest man on the force has been well earned.  In the
        back seat, with cases of Walker Black and Cutty Sark, is
        Bud's partner -- DICK STENSLAND.  Older, but also a tough
        hump, "Stens" sucks on a pint of Old Crow.

        The passenger door opens and Mickey Cohen bodyguard
        Johnny Stompanato slides in.  Guinea handsome, Johnny
        wears his curls in a tight pompadour.  With his boss
        behind bars, he's out of work.  Bud just stares at him.

                                STOMPANATO
                  Officer White.  I heard you got a
                  hard-on for wife beaters.

                                BUD
                  And you fuck people up for a
                  living.  That don't make me you.
                  Capisce, shitbird?

        Stompanato smiles.  Nervous.  Through the window, Bud
        watches a Salvation Army Santa palm coins from a kettle.

                                STENSLAND
                  Bud ain't in the mood for small
                  talk, Stompanato.

                                STOMPANATO
                  Look, Mickey C's doing time and
                  half the other guys who'd hire me
                  are dead or left town.  I need
                  money.  If your snitch-fund's
                  green, I'll get you some fucking-A
                  collars.

        Impatient, Bud tugs at a finger, CRACKS a KNUCKLE.

                                STOMPANATO
                  There's this guy.  He's blond and
                  fat, about forty.  Likes the
                  ponies.  Been pimping his wife to
                  cover his losses.  Knocks her
                  around to keep her in line.

        Bud's eyes narrow at this last bit of info.  Stompanato
        holds up a slip of paper.

                                STOMPANATO
                  I figure the address is worth
                  twenty.

        Bud digs into his wallet, pulls out twenty bucks,
        exchanges it with Stompanato.  Stompanato smiles smugly,
        grabs a bottle of Scotch from the back.

                                STOMPANATO
                  Yuletide cheer, fellas.

        Without warning, Bud grabs Stompanato's tie and yanks,
        slamming his forehead into the dash.

                                BUD
                  Happy New Year, greaseball.

        EXT. 1486 EVERGREEN - NIGHT

        A stucco job in a row of vet prefabs.  A neon Santa
        sleigh has landed on the roof.  Through the front window,
        we see a fat guy browbeating a woman.  Puff-faced, 35-
        ish, she backs away as he rages at her.

        The Packard pulls up out front.  Stensland could care
        less.

                                STENSLAND
                  Leave it for later, Bud.  We got
                  to pick up the rest of the booze
                  and get back to the precinct.

        Bud KILLS the IGNITION, picks up the radio.

                                BUD
                  Central, this is 4A-31.  Send a
                  prowler to 1486 Evergreen.  White
                  male in custody.  Code 623 point
                  one.  Domestic assault and
                  battery.  I won't be here, but
                  they'll see him.


        EXT. 1486 EVERGREEN - BUD - NIGHT

        steps to the house.  Inside, we hear SLAPS, MUFFLED
        CRIES.  Bud grips an outlet cord coming off the roof and
        yanks.  The sleigh crashes to the ground with REINDEER
        EXPLODING around it.  A beat.  The fat guy runs out to
        investigate, trips over Rudolph.

        Bud pounces.  Fat guy takes a swing, misses.  Grabbing
        fat guy's hair, Bud smashes his face to the pavement.
        Once, twice.  Teeth skitter down the walk.

                                BUD
                  Touch her again and I'll know
                  about it.  Understand?  Huh?

        Another face full of gravel.  Fat guy's WIFE watches with
        apprehension from the steps as Bud cuffs her husband's
        hands behind his back, empties his pockets.  A cash roll
        and car keys.  Bud looks over at her.

                                BUD
                  You got someplace you can go?

        She nods.  Bud hands her the keys and the cash.

                                BUD
                  Go get yourself fixed up.

                                WIFE
                         (nods, determined)
                  Merry Christmas, huh?

        Bud watches as she gets into a pre-war Ford in the drive.
        She backs over a blinking reindeer as she goes.

                                STENSLAND
                  You and women, partner.  What's
                  next?  Kids and dogs?


        INT. STAGE FOUR (VARIETY INTERNATIONAL PICTURES) - NIGHT

        The "Badge of Honor" set.  A Christmas party in full
        swing.  Eating, drinking, and dancing.  Star Brett Chase,
        seen earlier on television, is holding court.

        LAPD Sgt. "Trashcan" JACK VINCENNES, late 30s with slick,
        good looks, dances with a young ACTRESS.  Grinding their
        way through a ballad, they're obviously hitting it off.

                                ACTRESS
                  Brett Chase told me you're the cop
                  who busted Bob Mitchum.
                         (grinds closer)
                  These 'Badge of Honor' guys like
                  to pretend, but being the real
                  thing must be a thrill.

                                JACK
                  Let's go someplace quiet.  I'll
                  give you the low-down on Mitchum.

                                ACTRESS
                  You got your handcuffs with you?

                                JACK
                  Two sets.

                                ACTRESS
                  I'll get my coat.

        They're interrupted by Sid Hudgeons.

                                HUDGEONS
                  Big V Jack Vincennes!  May I have
                  this dance?

                                JACK
                  Karen, this is Sid Hudgeons from
                  Hush-Hush magazine.

                                ACTRESS
                  I know who he is.

        The Actress storms off.  Jack looks to Sid.

                                HUDGEONS
                  We did a piece last year.
                  'Ingenue Dykes In Hollywood.'  Her
                  name got mentioned.

                                JACK
                  Is she?

                                HUDGEONS
                  Beats me.  Look, Jackie-Boy, a
                  friend of mine just sold some
                  reefer to Matt Reynolds.  He's
                  tripping the light fantastic with
                  Tammy Jordan at 2245 Maravilla,
                  Hollywood Hills.  It's right
                  around the corner.

                                JACK
                  You lost me, Sid.  Who?

                                HUDGEONS
                  Contract players at Metro.  You
                  pinch 'em.  I do you up feature in
                  the next issue.  Plus the usual
                  fifty cash.  Tell me, am I fucking
                  Santa Claus?

                                JACK
                  I need an extra fifty.  Two
                  patrolmen at twenty apiece and a
                  dime for the watch commander at
                  Hollywood Station.

                                HUDGEONS
                  Jack!  It's Christmas!

                                JACK
                  No.  It's felony possession of
                  marijuana.


        EXT. 2245 MARAVILLA - NIGHT

        WITH a VIEW of Grauman's Chinese.  Jack and two uniformed
        patrolmen wait on the darkened street.  An arc light has
        been set up.  Hudgeons creeps back over from the house.

                                HUDGEONS
                  They're sitting in the dark,
                  goofing on the Christmas tree.

                                JACK
                  Stand there with your camera.
                  I'll stop here so you get
                  Grauman's Chinese in the
                  backgrouns.

                                HUDGEONS
                  I like it!  I like it!


        INT. 2245 MARAVILLA - NIGHT

        The arc light floods the living room about the same time
        that Jack kicks the door in.  The room is caught flush:
        Christmas tree, a bag of weed on the couch, two kids
        necking in their BVDs.  MATT REYNOLDS and TAMMY JORDAN.

                                JACK
                  Police!

        EXT. 2245 MARAVILLA - NIGHT

        Jack exits, hauling Jordan and Reynolds by the neck.
        Jack stops with Grauman's FRAMED behind him and Hudgeons
        CLICKS off several shots with his CAMERA.

                                HUDGEONS
                  Cut!  Wrap it!

        Windows light up.  Rubberneckers appear.  Jack hands the
        kids to the patrolmen, heads back in with Hudgeons in
        tow.


        INT. 2245 MARAVILLA - NIGHT

        Jack scoops the pot, flips through an address book.  A
        card falls out.  "Fleur-de-Lis.  Whatever you desire..."
        Jack looks from the card out the window at the kids being
        loaded into a black and white.  They're both crying now.

                                HUDGEONS
                         (stantorian tone)
                  It's Christmas morning in the City
                  of Angels, and while decent
                  citizens sleep the sleep of the
                  righteous, hopheads prowl for
                  marijuana, not knowing that a man
                  is coming to stop them.  The free-
                  wheeling, big-time Big V,
                  celebrity crime-stopper, Jack
                  Vincennes, the scourge of
                  grasshoppers and junk fiends
                  everywhere.  You like it, Jackie-
                  Boy?

                                JACK
                  Yeah, it's subtle.

        Sid hands him a President Grant 50.

                                HUDGEONS
                  Remember: you heard it first here,
                  off the record, on the Q.T. and
                  very Hush-Hush.


        INT. HOLLYWOOD STATION - DISPATCH DESK - NIGHT

        Suspects, mostly drunk and disorderly, are ushered
        through.  Sgt. ED EXLEY, 30, bespectacled, is at the desk
        with a YOUNG OFFICER.  Exley is an up-and-comer.  Burning
        with ambition.  The faster he rises through the ranks,
        the more resentment he leaves in his wake.

                                EXLEY
                  What's on the call sheet?

                                YOUNG OFFICER
                  A guy dressed as Santa has been
                  exposing himself to kids in Los
                  Feliz.  Apparently, sir, he's
                  decorated himself.

                                EXLEY
                  Decorated?

                                YOUNG OFFICER
                  With tinsel and plastic icicles
                  and... on his penis, sir.

                                EXLEY
                  I get the idea.  You got a
                  description?

                                YOUNG OFFICER
                  Of his penis, sir?


        EXT. HOLLYWOOD BOULEVARD - HOLLYWOOD LIQUOR - NIGHT

        Tinsel-trimmed photos of movie stars look down from the
        walls as the OWNER takes an order from LYNN BRACKEN.

                                LYNN
                  A case each of gin, Scotch, and
                  rum.  Everything top shelf.  None
                  of that watered-down stuff you
                  push on Errol Flynn.

                                OWNER
                         (laughs)
                  Sounds like a helluva party.

        Her hair kerchiefed, Lynn waits as the Owner writes it
        up.  There's glamour, a cat-girl grace about Lynn.  She
        seems like she belongs up on the wall with the movie
        stars.  Lynn looks across as Bud White heads toward the
        counter.  Spotting her, Bud doesn't look so tough for a
        moment.

                                OWNER
                  You want it delivered?

                                LYNN
                  Before five tomorrow.

        The Owner spots Bud.  A big smile turns to a frown.

                                OWNER
                  I'll be right with you, Lynn.

        The Owner begins indiscriminately loading hard liquor
        into a cardboard box, leaving Bud and Lynn to look at
        each other.  Bud says the only thing he can think of.

                                BUD
                  Merry Christmas.

                                LYNN
                  Merry Christmas yourself, Officer.

                                BUD
                  That obvious, huh?

                                LYNN
                         (smiles sweetly)
                  It's practically stamped on your
                  forehead.

        As the Owner bangs a case of liquor on the counter...


        EXT. HOLLYWOOD LIQUOR - NIGHT

        Bud exits with his booze, heads for the car.  Something
        catches his eye.  A woman in the rear passenger seat of a
        new Cadillac.  SUSAN LEFFERTS.  Both her eyes are black.

        Bud starts over.  The case on his hip, he motions for her
        to roll down the window.  The driver's side door opens
        and bodyguard TURNER "BUZZ" MEEKS menaces his way out.

                                MEEKS
                  Get lost why don't you?

        Meeks stops short as Bud shoves his badge in Meeks' face.
        Setting the case on the car's hood, Bud spins Meeks
        around, pats him down.  He finds a .38 in a shoulder
        holster.

                                MEEKS
                  I got a license for that.

        Bud removes Meeks' wallet, checks the ID.

                                MEEKS
                  Cut me some slack.  I used to be a
                  cop.

                                BUD
                  Turner Meeks?  Never heard of you.

                                LYNN
                         (exiting store)
                  We just call him Buzz.

        Bud raps on Susan's window with his badge.  It comes
        down.

                                BUD
                  You okay?

        Beside her, a man leans over.  Pierce Patchett, seen
        before at the freeway unveiling, is a man used to being
        chauffeured.  Like FDR, he smokes his cigarette in a
        holder.

                                PATCHETT
                  She's fine.

                                BUD
                         (menacing)
                  I'm not asking you.

        Patchett has no idea he's walking on thin ice.  As he
        stares impatiently at Bud, Bud looks back to Susan.

                                BUD
                  Somebody hit you?

                                LYNN
                  It's not what you think.

        Bud looks to see Lynn Bracken moving to the driver's
        door.

                                BUD
                  What is it then?

                                SUSAN
                  You got the wrong idea, Mister.
                  I'm fine.

        Susan laughs.  Patchett eases back into the shadows.

                                LYNN
                         (getting in the car)
                  But it's nice to know you care.

        Bud considers Meeks' gun license, then hands him back the
        .38 and wallet.  Lifting his booze, Bud watches Meeks get
        back in the car.

        Stensland steps up as the cabbie starts to pull away.

                                STENSLAND
                  What's going on?

        For an odd moment, Stensland and Meeks lock eyes.

                                BUD
                  You know him?

                                STENSLAND
                  Seen him around.  He used to be a
                  cop.

                                                   CUT TO:


        CLOSE ON DUDLEY SMITH

        Fifty, handsome in his police captain's uniform.  Singing
        "Silver Bells" in a beautiful low tenor.  Tough,
        respected, Dudley goes to bed as a cop every night of his
        life.  He's a department power to be reckoned with.


        INT. PRECINCT HOUSE - MUSTER ROOM - NIGHT

        An L.A. Herald Express REPORTER and photographer listen
        along with the gathered patrolmen as Dudley finishes to
        applause.  Dudley joins the press.

                                DUDLEY
                  Drop the formalities; it's
                  Christmas Eve.  Call me Dudley.

                                REPORTER
                  Dudley, I came up with a title for
                  the story.  I'm calling it "Silent
                  Night with the L.A.P.D."

                                DUDLEY
                  Excellent.  How's this?
                         (dramatic pause)
                  The sanctity of the night is an
                  invitation to the darker criminal
                  element.  Our vigilance will not
                  be diminished.

        As the Reporter scribbles down the quote...

                                DUDLEY
                  That's Smith with an S.

        They laugh.  Dudley points the way out.

                                DUDLEY
                  This way, gentlemen.

        Dudley's the last one out the door.  As he goes, he turns
        back to give the men a wink.  He's no sooner out the door
        when the first case of Johnny Walker is brought in.


        INT. PRECINCT HOUSE - DISPATCH DESK - NIGHT

        Ed Exley gets another report from the Young Officer.

                                YOUNG OFFICER
                  Two police officers were assaulted
                  in a bar.  Brown and Helenowski.

        He hands the report to Exley.  It's now that Dudley comes
        through on his press junket.

                                DUDLEY
                  This is Sergeant Ed Exley.  Son of
                  the legendary Preston Exley.  He's
                  the watch commander tonight and a
                  damn fine job.

        As the photographer snaps Exley's picture...

                                DUDLEY
                  I was fortunate enough to be
                  partnered with his father when I
                  was a rookie.  It makes a man feel
                  old.  That's a fact.
                         (a beat)
                  Feel free to get a feel for the
                  place.

        As the Reporter and photographer wander off, Dudley turns
        to Exley a bit more serious.

                                DUDLEY
                  A word with you, lad.


        INT. DUDLEY SMITH'S OFFICE - DAY

        Dudley pours two drinks, hands one to Exley.

                                DUDLEY
                  To the memory of your father.

        They drink.  Exley looks to a photo on the wall.

        Himself as a ten-year-old standing between Dudley and his
        father Preston, both in police uniform.

                                DUDLEY
                  The day he got the Medal of Valor.
                  A simpler time.

        Remembering, Exley invokes his father's favorite toast.

                                EXLEY
                  To the solving of crimes that
                  require absolute justice.

        Exley raises his glass, but Dudley just watches him.

                                DUDLEY
                  That was his favorite toast.
                         (a beat)
                  I saw the test results on the
                  lieutenant's exam.  You placed
                  first out of twenty-three.

                                EXLEY
                  The youngest applicant by eight
                  years.

                                DUDLEY
                  You'll make lieutenant inside a
                  year.  Patrol division?

                                EXLEY
                  I was thinking Detective Bureau.

        We can see Dudley doesn't approve.

                                DUDLEY
                  You don't have the eye for human
                  weakness to be a good detective.
                  Or the stomach.  You're a
                  political animal, Edmund.

        The criticism stings, but Dudley's a straight shooter.

                                EXLEY
                  You're wrong.

                                DUDLEY
                  Am I...?  Would you be willing to
                  plant corroborative evidence on a
                  suspect you knew was guilty in
                  order to ensure an indictment?

                                EXLEY
                  Dudley, we've been over this.

                                DUDLEY
                  Answer yes or no.

                                EXLEY
                  I... No.

                                DUDLEY
                  Would you be willing to rig crime
                  scene evidence to support a
                  prosecuting attorney's working
                  hypothesis...?  Yes or no, Edmund.

                                EXLEY
                  No.

                                DUDLEY
                  Would you be willing to beat
                  confessions out of suspects you
                  knew to be guilty?

                                EXLEY
                  No.

                                DUDLEY
                  Would you be willing to shoot
                  hardened criminals in the back to
                  offset the chance --

                                EXLEY
                  No.

                                DUDLEY
                  Then for God's sake, don't be a
                  detective.  Stick to assignments
                  where you won't have to make those
                  choices.  Patrol, Internal
                  Affairs, but not the Bureau.

                                EXLEY
                  I know you mean well, Dudley, but
                  I don't need to do it the way you
                  did.  Or my father.

                                DUDLEY
                  At least get rid of the glasses.
                  I can't think of one Bureau man
                  who wears them.


        INT. PRECINCT HOUSE - MUSTER ROOM - NIGHT

        A large impromptu bar has been set-up.  The party is in
        full swing, the floor packed with nightwatch blues.  A
        PHONOGRAPH SPEWS DIRTY CHRISTMAS CAROLS.

        Stensland pours eggnog and Old Crow into the water cooler
        as Bud elbows his way in with another case.

                                STENSLAND
                  Hey, partner.  Grab a cup.

                                BUD
                  I got to write my report first.

                                PASSING COP #1
                  Hear about Helenowski and Brown?
                  They got into a helluva scrap with
                  six taco benders at some bar.
                  Helenowski lost six pints of
                  blood.  Brown's in a coma.

                                PASSING COP #2
                  We ought to teach Paco and his
                  friends a lesson.

        More cops vocie their agreement.  Bottles are passed.
        Only Bud doesn't seem as caught-up as the rest.


        INT. PRECINCT HOUSE - NARCO PEN - NIGHT

        Jack Vincennes at his desk.  Holding the Fleur-de-Lis
        card, Jack dials the number.  A corkboard on the wall is
        posted with press clippings.  "Dope Crusader Wounded in
        Shootout."  "Actor Mitchum Seized in Marijuana Shack
        Raid."  That one includes a shot of Jack ushering Mitchum
        into jail.

                                WOMAN (V.O.)
                         (over phone, like
                          silk)
                  Whatever you desire.

                                JACK
                  Hi... I'd like to get a delivery
                  to Beverly Hills.

                                WOMAN (V.O.)
                         (over phone)
                  I don't think I know you.

        CLICK.  The line goes dead.  Jack redials.

                                WOMAN (V.O.)
                         (over phone)
                  Whatever you desire.

                                JACK
                  Look, a friend of mine gave me
                  this number.  I just --

        The line goes dead again.  Jack dials a new number.

                                OPERATOR (V.O.)
                         (filtered)
                  Pacific Coast Bell.

                                JACK
                  This is Sgt. Vincennes.
                  Requesting a name and address on a
                  phone number.  Hollywood zero-one-
                  two-three-nine.

                                OPERATOR (V.O.)
                         (filtered)
                  Please hold the line... No such
                  number is assigned.

                                JACK
                  I just called it.

                                OPERATOR (V.O.)
                  No, Sergeant.  I checked twice.

                                JACK
                         (realizes, hangs up)
                  A bootleg...


        INT. MUSTER ROOM - NIGHT

        Exley surveys the carousing rowdies.  Raising his
        voice...

                                EXLEY
                  All right, men.  You've had your
                  fun.  Time to break it up.

        The party continues undiminished.  From across the room,
        Stensland eyes Exley with disdain.

                                STENSLAND
                  Fucking Exley.  Guy's got a pole
                  so far up his ass, every time he
                  farts the flag waves.


        WATCH COMMANDER'S OFFICE

        The command not really his, Exley reads a report, ignores
        the party, though his window looks into the thick of it.

        Suddenly a ripple goes through the room.  The men begin
        to push out through a rear door.  Exley stands, stops a
        COP.

                                EXLEY
                  What's going on?

                                COP
                  They got the spics who japped
                  Helenowski and Brown.  Helenowski
                  lost an eye and Brown's got brain
                  damage.

                                EXLEY
                  I have the report right here.
                  They're home with bruises and
                  muscle pulls -- Oh shit...

        Exley starts out after them.


        INT. CELL BLOCK - NIGHT

        Stensland in the lead.  Pulling out a blackjack, he
        enters Cell #4, begins wailing on one of the Mexicans --
        Dinardo.

                                STENSLAND
                  For ours, Pancho. And you're
                  getting off easy.

        Cheered on by drunks in the tank and his fellow officers,
        Stensland goes wild.  He's joined by Lentz, Crumley and
        Tristano.  Shaking his head, Jack Vincennes moves away.


        INT. SQUAD ROOM - NIGHT

        Bud types his report with one finger.  Jack looks in.

                                JACK
                  White, you better get a lease on
                  Stens before he kills someone.


        INT. CELL BLOCK - NIGHT

        Followed by Jack, Bud forces his way through the crowd.
        The men who see it's him quickly clear a path.

        Swigging from a pint of gin, Stensland works skinny
        GARCIA.  Head saps.  The kid drops to his knees drooling
        blood.

        Bud grabs Stensland, hauls him off of Garcia who looks
        up.

                                GARCIA
                  Fuck you, pendejo.

                                BUD
                  Yeah yeah...

                                GARCIA
                  And fuck your mother too.

        Bud sees red.  Letting go of Stensland, Bud White picks
        up Garcia by the neck.  There are cheers, "Attaboys" and
        "Holy Fucks" as Bud bangs Garcia's head on the ceiling.

                                EXLEY
                         (arriving)
                  Stop, Officer!  That's an order!

        Cops block Exley's way.  As Bud looks over, Garcia kicks
        him in the balls.  A dangling shot.  Bud keels into the
        bars, Garcia stumbles out of the cell, smack into Jack.

        Jack looks down aghast at blood on his cashmere blazer,
        then puts Garcia down with a left-right.

        Exley pulls a pad of paper and pen form his pocket.

                                EXLEY
                  You're going in my report!  All of
                  you!

        Exley has just started taking names when Bud grabs him by
        the scruff of the neck and hauls him off balance into...


        HALL

        As Exley struggles, a cop opens the door to the store
        room.  Bud slings Exley inside, then slams the door
        tight.  Exley is locked in.  As Bud moves off, we hear
        POUNDING.

                                EXLEY (V.O.)
                  Let me out!  That's an order!


        CELL BLOCK

        The Herald Reporter and photographer enter unchaperoned
        and unnoticed.  Stensland swings like a madman.  That's
        when a flashbulb goes off.  Freezing everyone in black
        and white.

                                                   DISSOLVE TO:


        INT. CHIEF'S OFFICE - DAY

        The CHIEF sits behind a desk in a four-star uniform.
        Dudley Smith sits to his left, D.A. Ellis Loew to his
        right.  Seen earlier at the Mickey Cohen press
        conference, Loew is the only civilian.  Bud White stands
        across from them.  There to be judged.

                                CHIEF
                  Officer White, you've refused to
                  cooperate with Internal Affairs.
                  But you should know this is bigger
                  than a police board.  Indictments
                  may be handed down.  Quite
                  frankly, we need police witnesses
                  to offset the damage done to the
                  Department's image.  Will you
                  testify?

        Bud glances to a gray tinted mirror, then to the Chief.

                                BUD
                  No, sir.  I won't.

        The Chief sighs, looks to Loew.

                                CHIEF
                  District Attorney Loew.

        Loew steps to Bud, holds up a newspaper with the cell
        block photo.  The headline:  "BLOODY CHRISTMAS."

                                LOEW
                  Bloody Christmas.  The press love
                  to label.  You and Officer
                  Stensland brought the liquor into
                  the precinct.  Stensland was
                  already drunk.  Do you see how
                  appearing as a voluntary witness
                  against him could offset the
                  damage you've done to yourself?

                                BUD
                  I won't do it.
                         (staring at mirror)
                  I won't testify against my partner
                  or anyone else.

                                LOEW
                  This man is a disgrace.

                                CHIEF
                  Your badge and gun, Officer.

        Bud sets them on The Chief's desk.

                                CHIEF
                  This is the new L.A.P.D., White.
                  You're suspended from duty and
                  dismissed.

        Turning, White shoots the mirror a stiff middle finger as
        he makes his way out.  Dudley Smith hides a smile.


        OTHER SIDE OF GLASS

        Exley watches, involuntarily leans back as Bud passes on
        the other side of the glass.


        THE CHIEF'S OFFICE

        Dudley, Loew and The Chief wait as Exley enters.

                                CHIEF
                  Ed, your observations have been
                  astute.  What's your assessment of
                  this situation?

                                EXLEY
                  The public demands justice, sir.
                  This was a full-fledged riot of
                  policemen.  Shift the guilt to men
                  whose pensions are secured.  Force
                  them to retire.  But someone has
                  to swing.  Indict, try and convict
                  Stensland and Bud White.  Secure
                  them jail time.  Feed them to the
                  sharks, sir.  Protect yourself;
                  protect the department.

        Dudley gives Exley a look.  He's angry with him.

                                DUDLEY
                  Stensland's a disgrace.  Straight
                  D fitness reports from every C.O.
                  he ever served under.  But White
                  is a valuable officer.

                                EXLEY
                  White's a mindless thug.

                                DUDLEY
                  No, Edmund.  He's a man who can
                  answer yes to those questions I
                  ask you from time to time.

        The Chief interrupts with his own concern.

                                CHIEF
                  I want to know who we give the
                  public in contrast?  The
                  department needs role models.
                  Clean-cut, forthright men the
                  public can admire.

                                EXLEY
                  I'll testify, sir.  I'm not afraid
                  to do what's right.

                                CHIEF
                  And I'll promote you.  You'll be a
                  lieutenant immediately.

        Exley seizes the moment, going over Dudley's head.

                                EXLEY
                  Detective lieutenant.

        The Chief and Dudley exchange a look.  Neither approves.

                                CHIEF
                  Ed, you're 30.  Your father didn't
                  make lieutenant until he was 33.

                                EXLEY
                  I know that, sir.  I also know
                  that when he made lieutenant, it
                  was as a detective.

                                LOEW
                         (interrupting)
                  Before we start polishing our
                  laurels, it would look better if
                  we had a corroborative witness.

                                DUDLEY
                  That'll be hard to come by.  The
                  men hate a turncoat.

                                EXLEY
                  Jack Vincennes.  He's the
                  technical advisor on 'Badge of
                  Honor,' sir.  He lives for it.
                  That's the way to get him.

                                CHIEF
                  All right, Ed.
                         (into desk
                          intercom)
                  Call Sergeant Vincennes.

        As Exley starts out, Dudley pulls him aside, speaks low.

                                DUDLEY
                  You'll reap the benefits, but are
                  you truly prepared to be despised
                  within the department?

                                EXLEY
                  Yes, Dudley.  I am.

                                DUDLEY
                  So be it.


        JACK VINCENNES

        Looking sharp, he strides down the hall, enters the...


        CHIEF'S OFFICE

        Round two.  Centred on Jack.  Exley is gone.

                                DUDLEY
                  Sergeant, we'll get right to it.
                  Nine civilian witnesses have
                  identified you as hitting Ezekiel
                  Garcia.

                                LOEW
                  But my office has a stellar
                  witness who will tell the grand
                  jury that you hit back only after
                  being hit.

                                JACK
                  What do I have to do?

                                LOEW
                  Testify against the three officers
                  who have already earned their
                  pensions.  Our key witness will
                  testify roundly, but you can plead
                  ignorance to questions directed at
                  the other men.

                                CHIEF
                  I'll guarantee you a slap on the
                  wrist.  A brief suspension
                  followed by a temporary transfer
                  from Narcotics to Ad Vice.
                         (a beat)
                  When you transfer out of Vice,
                  you'll be back on the show.

                                JACK
                  The show, sir?

                                CHIEF
                  Badge of Honor, Vincennes.  We
                  need to tone down your profile for
                  a bit.

        The Chief just got Jack where he lives.

                                DUDLEY
                  John, I doubt you've ever drawn a
                  stupid breath.  Don't start now.

                                JACK
                  Okay.  I'll do it.

        Smiles all around.  Loew smiles at the two-way.  A move
        not lost on Jack who wonders who might be on the other
        side.

                                CHIEF
                  Dismissed, Vincennes.

        Jack leaves.  The Chief steps to the mirror, looks
        through.

                                CHIEF
                  So be it.  Detective Lieutenant.


        OTHER SIDE OF GLASS

        Exley clenches his fist in victory.  The Chief continues.

                                CHIEF
                  Ace them at the grand jury
                  tomorrow, son.  Wear the smart-
                  looking suit and ace them.  And,
                  Ed?  Lose the glasses.


        INT. ROOM 114 (GRAND JURY WITNESS ROOM) - DAY

        Glasses off, Exley waits, looks up as Jack enters.

                                JACK
                  You're the key witness?

                                EXLEY
                  That's right.

                                JACK
                  I should've known.  What's the
                  Chief throwing you?

                                EXLEY
                  Throwing me?

                                JACK
                  Yeah, Exley.  What's the payoff?

                                EXLEY
                  You're the payoff expert.  I'm
                  just doing my duty.

                                JACK
                  You're playing an angle, college
                  boy.  You're getting something out
                  of this so you don't have to
                  hobnob with the fucking rank and
                  file cops who'll hate your guts
                  for snitching.  If they're making
                  you a detective, watch out.  Some
                  Bureau guys are gonna burn in this
                  and you're gonna have to work with
                  friends of theirs.

                                EXLEY
                  What about you?

                                JACK
                  I'm snitching three old timers
                  who'll be fishing in Oregon next
                  week.  Next to you I'm clean.  And
                  smart.

        At that, a CLERK steps in from the hallway.

                                CLERK
                  Edmund J. Exley to chambers.

        As Exley's about to go...

                                JACK
                  Just remember, Bud White'll fuck
                  you for this if it takes the rest
                  of his life.  They already
                  suspended him.  Just pray he cops
                  a deal and stays on the Department
                  because that is one civilian you
                  do not want on your case.


        INT. TWILIGHT LOUNGE - NIGHT

        An old black guy in a frayed, threadbare tux plays piano.
        Bud, nursing a highball at the bar, steps over to a
        REDHEAD with too much make-up on too many miles.

                                BUD
                  That an old fashioned you're
                  drinking?
                         (as she nods)
                  My name's Bud.

                                REDHEAD
                  Nobody was born with the name Bud.

                                BUD
                  They stick you with a name like
                  Wendell, you look for an alias.

                                REDHEAD
                  What do you do, Bud?

                                BUD
                  I'm sorta between jobs.  Look,
                  what do you say we, uh...

        A hand on Bud's shoulder.  He turns to see Dudley Smith.

                                DUDLEY
                  Lad, may I have a word with you?

                                BUD
                  This business, Captain?

                                DUDLEY
                  Say goodnight to your friend and
                  join me by those back tables.

        Dudley starts off.  Bud turns back to Redhead, but she's
        already talking to a sailor.


        BOOTH

        Dudley sits at a table.  A newspaper is opened, a little
        mound underneath.  Bud joins Dudley.

                                BUD
                  Does that paper say we've been
                  indicted?  Does it say Exley's a
                  hero for squealing me and
                  Stensland off?

                                DUDLEY
                  He made his play amd he got what
                  he wanted.  They're making him a
                  detective.

                                BUD
                  Captain, what do you want?

                                DUDLEY
                  Call me Dudley.

                                BUD
                  Dudley, what do you want?

                                DUDLEY
                  Lad, I admire your refusal to
                  testify and your loyalty to your
                  partner.  I admire you as a
                  policeman, particularly your
                  adherence to violence as a
                  necessary adjutant to the job.
                  And I am most impressed with your
                  punishment of wife beaters.  Do
                  you hate them, Wendell?

                                BUD
                         (looks away)
                  Yeah, I hate them.

                                DUDLEY
                  And for good reason judging from
                  what I know of your background.

        Bud looks back over.  Dudley's getting too personal.

                                BUD
                  What's going to happen to
                  Stensland?  He'll give himself
                  cirrhosis over this.  He's one
                  year from his pension.

                                DUDLEY
                  It would've happened years ago if
                  you hadn't carried him.  Why the
                  loyalty, Wendell?

                                BUD
                  He helped me out once.  That's all.

                                DUDLEY
                  Your partner's through.
                  Department scapegoat on the
                  Chief's orders.  He's been billed,
                  he'll be indicted and he'll swing.

                                BUD
                  Him and me both.  Fucking Exley.

                                DUDLEY
                  Don't underestimate his skills.
                  As a politician he exceeds even
                  myself.  But the department needs
                  smart men like Exley and... direct
                  men like yourself

                                BUD
                  What do you want?

                                DUDLEY
                  Wendell, I want you to come to
                  work for me.

                                BUD
                  Doing what?  Mowing your fucking
                  lawn?

        Smith yanks the newspaper revealing Bud's badge & .38
        Special.  Bud can't believe his eyes.

                                DUDLEY
                  They're yours.  Take them.

                                BUD
                  I knew you had juice, but...
                  There's no goddamn bill on me?

                                DUDLEY
                  Four of the defendants recanted
                  their testimony.

                                BUD
                  How?

        Dudley dismisses the question with a wave of his hand.

                                DUDLEY
                  I need you for an assignment the
                  Chief's given me the go-ahead on.
                  A duty few men are fit for, but
                  you were born for.  You'll be
                  working out of Homicide.

                                BUD
                         (excited)
                  Homicide?  A detective?

                                CHIEF
                  Your talents lie elsewhere,
                  Wendell.  It's a muscle job and
                  shooting job.  You'll do what I
                  say and not ask questions.  Do you
                  follow my drift?

                                BUD
                         (disappointed)
                  In Technicolor.

                                DUDLEY
                  Will you work for me?

                                BUD
                  Of course... But how?

                                DUDLEY
                  How what, Wendell?

                                BUD
                  How'd you get them to retract?

        Dudley lays brass knuckles on the table.  They're
        chipped, caked with blood.

                                                   DISSOLVE TO:


        L.A. MONTAGE

        Over the pop song "STRANGER IN PARADISE."

        A)  EXT. GRAUMAN'S CHINESE - NIGHT

            Frank Sinatra at the premiere of From Here to
            Eternity.

        B)  INT. KLUB ZAMBOANGA - NIGHT

            Charlie "Bird" Parker makes magic before an
            appreciative, mostly black crowd.

        C)  TORCH SONG TAVERN (RIVERSIDE) - NIGHT

            Nate Janklow exits with his latest flame.  A mob
            lieutenant, Nate was last seen with Mickey Cohen
            outside the Federal Courthouse in the opening
            montage.  A CAR SCREECHES up.  TWO GUNS aim and Nate
            and his date do down in a proverbial HAIL OF LEAD.

        D)  EXT. FREEWAY - DAY

            A groundbreaking.  The Mayor scrapes at the ground
            with a gold shovel.  Pierce Patchett is among the
            distinguished guests.

        END OF MONTAGE


        EXT. HOLLYWOOD HIGH SCHOOL - DAY

        The marquee gushes:  "Today Sgt. Joe Reno:  Badge of
        Honor Star Brett Chase."


        INT. HOLLYWOOD HIGH SCHOOL - AUDITORIUM - DAY

        A nerdy 14-YEAR-OLD asks Brett Chase:

                                14-YEAR-OLD
                  Why'd you become a policeman?

                                CHASE
                  I'm not a policeman.  I just play
                  one on television.  But I think I
                  can answer for them.  To help
                  people.  That's why I do the show.

        Chase looks over and winks at Jack who waits in the
        wings.

                                CHASE
                  To protect and serve.  It's not
                  just a motto.

        As the kids applaud, Chase joins Jack who gives him a
        quick drag of a cigarette.  A nervous PA joins them.
        Chase points out a fetching girl in the second row.

                                CHASE
                  That one.  In the sweater.
                         (to Jack)
                  They also serve who only stand and
                  wait.

        Chase and Jack watch the PA ask "Sweater" a question
        while pointing to Chase.  Maybe sixteen, she nods "yes"
        eagerly.

                                CHASE
                  Jack, I'll see you Monday on set.

                                JACK
                  I won't be there.  They're toning
                  down my profile.


        PRINTING PRESS

        The latest issue of Hush-Hush flies through.  On the
        cover:  "Gail Russell Caught In Love Nest.  Nymph or
        No?"


        INT. CITY JAIL - DAY

        Bud White flips through today's booking slips, finds one
        that's interesting.  Reading to himself...

                                BUD
                  Domestic.  Assault and battery.

        Containment Squad strong-arms, BREUNING and CARLISLE
        pause as they pass.

                                CARLISLE
                  Ready to go, Bud?

                                BUD
                  I'll be there in five minutes.


        CITY JAIL - HALLWAY

        Bud walks to a door covered in sheet metal.  He opens it
        to reveal a holding tank with a burly, jumpsuited
        PRISONER.

                                BUD
                  I hear you like to hit women.

                                PRISONER
                  My wife.  She's dropping charges
                  so it's none of your business.

        Bud enters, closes the door behind him.  A beat, we hear
        the sounds of FISTS ON FLESH.  It's Bud's business now.


        INT. BEVERLY HILLS MANSION - STUDY - NIGHT

        Deuce Perkins (the Mickey Cohen narcotics lieutenant seen
        earlier) stands at the bookshelf.  He pulls down books to
        reveal a shoe box.  He sets it on his desk, pulls back
        the cover to reveal several bags of white powder.
        Heroin.

        A BRANCH SNAPS outside.  Perkins opens a drawer, fishes a
        revolver.  Turning off the light, he heads to the window.
        His finger parts the curtains.  At that instant, he
        staggers, falls as GUNFIRE rips into him.

        The heroin just sits there on the desk.


        EXT. McNEIL PENITENTIARY - DAY

        Grim-faced guards scan the yard from machine-gunned
        towers.


        INT. McNEIL PENITENTIARY - VISITOR BOOTH - DAY

        Mickey Cohen sits across from visitor Johnny Stompanato.
        Cohen is going off the handle.

                                COHEN
                  What do you mean Deuce Perkins got
                  clipped last night?!

                                STOMPANATO
                  They shot him in his library.

                                COHEN
                  I don't want a floor plan; I want
                  to know who!  Who's taking the
                  ticket for this, Johnny?

                                STOMPANATO
                  Nobody.  At least not yet.

                                COHEN
                  And what about the merchandise
                  Deuce was holding for me?

                                STOMPANATO
                  Gone.  Not a trace.

                                COHEN
                  Some ferstunkener is moving in and
                  we don't know who?!  Maybe we
                  should ask Hedda Hopper!

        As "STRANGER IN PARADISE" ENDS, so does the MONTAGE.


        INT. BRIEFING ROOM - AD VICE - DAY

        Addressing the squad, a no-nonsense VICE CAPTAIN picks up
        a stack of magazines.

                                VICE CAPTAIN
                  Picture-book smut, gentlemen.
                  There's been a bunch of it found
                  at collateral crime scenes lately.
                  Mostly narcotics and prostitution
                  collars.

        As the Vice Capt. hands it out for the men to examine,
        new member Jack Vincennes arrives late.

                                VICE CAPTAIN
                  Look who's back from suspension.
                  We're honored, Sergeant Jack.

        The men laugh.  Jack sits, flips a magazine.  Men and
        women.  Men and men.  Girls and girls.  Girls and horses.

                                JACK
                  Gee.  The Great Jerk-Off Book
                  Caper of 1953.

                                VICE CAPTAIN
                  Vincennes, is there someplace
                  you'd rather be?

                                JACK
                  Yeah, Cap.  Back in Narcotics.

                                VICE CAPTAIN
                  Oh?  Anyplace else?

                                JACK
                  Working whores with squad two.

                                VICE CAPTAIN
                  Maybe you should have thought of
                  that before you made Bloody
                  Christmas page one.

        Vice Capt. retrieves the magazines, hands them to Jack.

                                VICE CAPTAIN
                  They're yours.  Make a major case,
                  Sergeant.  It's the only way
                  you're getting out of here.

        Exaggerated "oohs" and "aahs" from the men.

                                VICE CAPTAIN
                  Dismissed, gentlemen.

        As they go, Jack sees the books are stamped:  "Fleur-de-Lis
        Whatever you desire."  Jack takes the matching
        business card from his wallet, the one he found on
        Christmas Eve.

                                VICE CAPTAIN
                  Roll, Vincennes.  No sidetracks.
                  This is Ad Vice, not Narco.


        INT. HOLLYWOOD STATION - NARCO PEN - DAY

        Jack Vincennes is at his desk.  Holding the Fleur-de-Lis
        card, magazines spread before him, Jack dials the number.


        INT. HUSH-HUSH MAGAZINE OFFICE - DAY

        Sid Hudgeons sits behind his desk, answers the phone.

                                HUDGEONS
                  Hush-Hush.  Off the record and on
                  the Q.T.

                                JACK (V.O.)
                  Sid, it's Vincennes.

                                HUDGEONS
                  Jackie, are you back on Narco?  I
                  need copy.

        INTERCUT WITH Jack at his desk:

                                JACK
                  No.  But I've got something going
                  with Ad Vice.

                                HUDGEONS
                  Something good?

                                JACK
                  Don't know.  I'm chasing picture
                  books.  Fuck shots, but the posers
                  don't look like junkies.  It's
                  well done stuff.  I thought you
                  might have heard something.

        Hudgeons reaches into a stack of papers, pulls out a
        magazine like the one Jack has.

                                HUDGEONS
                  Not a word.

                                JACK
                  What about Fleur-de-Lis?  Their
                  slogan's 'Whatever you desire.'

                                HUDGEONS
                  No.  No, I've heard bupkis.  Jack,
                  I'll talk to you later.  Call me
                  when you get something I can use.
                  Smut's from hunger.  For sad sacks
                  who can't get their ashes hauled

        The LINE CLICKS off.  Jack hesitates a moment before
        cradling the receiver.  Something's not right here.


        EXT. HOLYWOOD STATION - PARKING LOT - TWILIGHT

        As Exley pulls in, his two-way drones:

                                DISPATCHER (V.O.)
                  Park Rangers report three Negro
                  youths discharging shotguns into
                  the air in Griffith Park.
                  Suspects are driving a late model
                  purple Mercury Coupe.

        As the report ends, Exley switches off the two-way and
        gets out of his car.


        INT. HOLLYWOOD STATION - SQUAD ROOM - NIGHT

        Accompanied by Bud, Dick Stensland crams the contents of
        his desk into a box.  Well-wishing cops pat him on the
        back, offer words of encouragement, but Stensland looks
        like he's going to cry.

        It's very bad timing as Exley enters, comes face-to-face
        with them.  This is hatred.

        Acting on impulse, Bud goes after Exley.  It's a mauling.
        Four vicious body shots.  A potentially lethal head shot
        sails wide as Exley falls to the ground.

        As four men move to hold Bud back, Exley looks up at him.

                                EXLEY
                         (gasping)
                  You're just a thug, White.  That's
                  all you'll ever be.

        Dudley steps into the fray.  He helps Exley to his feet.

                                DUDLEY
                  You should stay away from a man
                  when his blood is up.

                                EXLEY
                  His blood's always up.

        Four cops are genuinely having trouble holding Bud back.
        Dudley watches with something bordering on admiration.

                                DUDLEY
                  Then maybe you should stay away
                  from him all the time.


        EXT. HOLLYWOOD STATION - PARKING LOT - NIGHT

        Accompanied by Bud, Stensland reaches his car, loads his
        box of stuff into the trunk.  Bud is moody, pensive.

                                STENSLAND
                  Don't look so down in the mouth,
                  Bud.  You nailed him good.

                                BUD
                  Yeah, sure... I got a couple of
                  hours before I have to be at the
                  Victory.  Want to grab a beer?

                                STENSLAND
                  Rain check me, partner.  I got
                  something big going on tonight.

                                BUD
                  What?  That new mystery girl
                  you've been seeing?

                                STENSLAND
                  No.  I'll tell you sometime.  Not
                  now.  Don't want to jinx it.  But
                  it could take the edge off that
                  jail time I got coming.

                                 BUD
                  What are you talking about?

                                STENSLAND
                  It's confidential, Bud.  Like that
                  magazines Vincennes scams for.
                  Hush-Hush.
                         (smiles)
                  I'll see you tomorrow.  And hey,
                  if it works out, you'll get a
                  piece of it.

        Stensland gets in the car, drives off.  Bud is left
        alone.


        INT. HOLLYWOOD STATION - SQUAD ROOM - NIGHT

        Exley sits alone in a sea of desks.  The SQUAWK BOX
        DRONES.  Exley squints at the clock on the wall, can't
        make it out.  He takes his glasses from the inside of his
        jacket.  2:00 A.M.  Finally, something to do.  He walks
        to the wall calendar, tears off Feb. 28 to reveal Mar. 1.

        As Exley sits, the call SQUAWK BOX booms to life.

                                VOICE
                  Squad call!  Nite Owl Coffee Shop
                  One-eight-one-two-four Cherokee!
                  Multiple homicides!  Multiple
                  homicides!  Code three!


        EXT. HOLLYWOOD AND CHEROKEE - NIGHT

        Patrol cars.  Blues setting up a crime scene blockade.
        Exley pulls up, DOUSES his SIREN.  PATROLMAN #1 runs
        over.

                                PATROLMAN #1
                  Loads of people down.  Men.
                  Women.  I stopped for coffee --

        Exley pushes him aside, heads for the door.  It's wide
        open.


        INT. NITE OWL - NIGHT

        Exley takes mental snapshots.  Ten stools front a
        counter.  The side wall mural-papered:  winking owls
        perched on street signs.  On the right a string of
        tables.  Three in disarray.  Food spilled, dishes broken.
        A high-heel pump by an upended chair.

        Heel drag marks across the linoleum floor heading back
        toward the kitchen.  Exley follows.  Past an open, empty
        cash register.  Outside -- SIRENS.


        SERVICE RUNWAY

        Crisscrossed drag marks connect, lead to a walk-in...


        FOOD LOCKER

        Blood-soaked bodies on the floor.  Five, maybe six in a
        tangle.  Dozens of shotgun shells float in the pools of
        blood.  As Exley struggles to maintain his composure...

                                ROOKIE (O.S.)
                  Holy shit fuck...

        Exley looks at a green-faced ROOKIE in the locker
        doorway.

                                ROOKIE
                  S-s-sir, there's a captain outside
                  wants to see you.

                                EXLEY
                  Don't get sick!  Not in here!

        Exley shoves the Rookie, puking, out the door.


        EXT. NITE OWL - NIGHT

        Patrolmen hold back a swarm of reporters and rubber-
        neckers.  HORNS BLAST.  Motorcycles run interference for
        meat wagons cut off by the crown.  As Ed emerges,
        reporters surge, shout questions.  Exley hurries past,
        finds Dudley in command and barking orders.

                                EXLEY
                  Sir, I took the call.  It's my
                  case.

                                DUDLEY
                  Edmund, you don't want it and you
                  can't have it.

                                EXLEY
                  Yes, I do, sir.

                                DUDLEY
                  It's mine.  I'll make you my
                  second in command.

        Exley spots a photographer moving in.  He looks properly
        serious as the flash bulb pops.


        INT. NIGHT OWL - NIGHT

        Forensics Chief RAY PINKER walks Exley and Dudley
        through.

                                PINKER
                  We got a total of forty-five spent
                  12-gauge Remington shotgun shells.
                  Three men with five-shot-capacity
                  pumps.  All of them reloading
                  twice.

                                EXLEY
                  Hold on... We need to canvass.
                  See if a purple Mercury was seen
                  around here tonight.

                                DUDLEY
                  Why?

                                EXLEY
                  We got a call earlier on three
                  Negro youths.  Firing shotguns in
                  Griffith Park from a late-model
                  purple Mercury Coupe.

                                DUDLEY
                         (to his adjutant)
                  Get on it.

        A FORENSICS COP approaches Pinker.

                                FORENSICS COP
                  We got an I.D. on one of the
                  victims, sir... I think it's Dick
                  Stensland.

        Exley and Dudley react, look at each other.


        EXT. VICTORY MOTEL - DAWN

        Set in a no-man's-land of bulldozed homes.  A sign
        proudly announces the impending arrival of the freeway.
        The motel is surrounded by a barbed-wire fence.
        Abandoned but for a pair of LAPD cars and a light burning
        in room 6.

        An unmarked pulls up and Exley and Dudley step out.  They
        start forward, but a SCREAM inside 6 stops Exley short.

                                DUDLEY
                  With Mickey Cohen in prison, Los
                  Angeles is organized crime free.
                  The Chief wants it to stay that
                  way, Edmund.  The means are not
                  for the weak-hearted.


        INT. VICTORY MOTEL - ROOM 6 - DAWN

        Bare.  A table and chair bolted to the floor.  A tough
        FLAT-NOSED GANGSTER is cuffed to the hot seat.  On the
        table are a .45 and a fat roll of $100 bills.

        Breuning and Carlisle watch as Bud White delivers a
        couple of short, stiff body shots.  Flatnose is not used
        to being on the receiving end.  All the same, we get the
        idea Bud's a bit reluctant.

        Bud's back is to Dudley and Exley who enter behind him.

                                DUDLEY
                  Come, Wendell, you can do better
                  than that.

        Bud turns, sees Exley and Dudley.  A beat.  As Bud looms
        over Flatnose, the gangster babbles.  Snitch-frenzied.

                                FLATNOSE
                  I know things.  I hear things.
                  Like with the Mick inside, things
                  are on this weird slowdown.
                                (MORE)

                                FLATNOSE (CONT'D)
                  These shooter teams, bang bang
                  bang, they're 86-ing Mickey
                  Cohen's men.

                                DUDLEY
                  We know all that, lad.  Tell us,
                  who do these shooters work for?

                                FLATNOSE
                  I don't know.  No one knows.
                  Maybe they're mavericks.  You want
                  a prostie roust?  Huh?  Some narco
                  action?
                         (breaking down)
                  What do you want?!

                                DUDLEY
                  We want you to go home.
                         (to Breuning)
                  Uncuff him, Michael.

        Dudley turns to Exley.

                                DUDLEY
                  Mr. Sifakis is a known loan shark
                  from San Francisco.  He arrived
                  this afternoon at Union Station.
                  Looking for business opportunities
                  in our fair city.  An organized
                  crime associate in need of re-
                  education in the ways of polite
                  society.

        Uncuffed, Flatnose rubs his wrists.  Wary.  As Breuning
        steps back, Flatnose snatches the .45 off the table.

                                FLATNOSE
                  Motherfuckers!

        Exley dives for cover, but the other four cops just stand
        there.  Dudley looks down on the floor at Exley.

                                DUDLEY
                  It's part of the play, Edmund.  A
                  sincerity test.

        Flatnose looks at the gun a beat, then squeezes the
        TRIGGER.  CLICK CLICK.  No bullets.

                                DUDLEY
                         (to Breuning)
                  Sit him back down.

        CLICK, CLICK.  They shove Flatnose back in the hot seat.
        Dudley offers a hand to Exley, helps him to his feet.

                                DUDLEY
                  Wendell, you need to accompany
                  Detective Lieutenant Exley on
                  official police business.  I'll
                  finish up here.


        INT. EXLEY'S PLYMOUTH - DAY

        They drive in silence.  No love lost here.  Finally.

                                 BUD
                  Where are we going?

                                EXLEY
                  It's a surprise.  You like
                  surprises, don't you, White?


        EXT. COUNTY MORGUE - DAY

        Exley pulls up.  Bud looks to him.  Really curious now.


        INT. COUNTY MORGUE - HALLWAY - DAY

        Exley and Bud walk.  An orderly wheels a covered corpse
        toward them from the other end of the hall.  Bud's
        spooked.  The orderly wheels the body in to the
        examination room.

        As Bud and Exley pass, the CORONER pulls back the sheet,
        is surprised at the sight of a woman who we don't quite
        see.

                                CORONER
                  Call me crazy, but for a second I
                  thought it was Rita Hayworth.


        MORGUE MEAT LOCKER

        Exley and Bud walk past a wall of drawers to where a
        coroner's assistant waits.

                                EXLEY
                  We need you to I.D. the body.
                  There's no next of kin and you
                  knew him best.  So tell me...

        The assistant pulls open drawer 12.  A naked man.

        A tag on his toe and half his face blown off.

                                EXLEY
                  Is that Dick Stensland?

        Stunned, Bud stares at what's left of his old partner.

                                 BUD
                  Yeah, that's Stens.

                                EXLEY
                  Hell of a way to avoid a prison
                  sentence.

        Bud's torn between wanting to smash Exley and finding out
        why Stensland is dead.  He squeezes out the words.

                                BUD
                  What happened?

                                EXLEY
                  Someone held up a coffee shop,
                  panicked and killed six people.

        Then, from the hall...

                                WOMAN (O.S.)
                  Not my baby!  Not my little girl!


        INT. COUNTY MORGUE - EXAMINATION ROOM - DAY

        HILDA LEFFERTS, 50, enters with the coroner to ID the
        body of her daughter, Susan.

        There's stray buckshot in the upper chest and shoulders,
        but a sheet hides the real damage.  It's the girl Bud saw
        outside Hollywood Liquor.  Without the black eyes, she
        does look like Rita hayworth.

        As Bud and Exley appear, Mrs. Lefferts looks confused.

                                CORONER
                  Is this your daughter, Mrs.
                  Lefferts?

                                MRS. LEFFERTS
                  I -- I don't know.

                                EXLEY
                  We know this is difficult.  Just
                  take your time and look again.

        Exley doesn't realize, but Bud recognizes the deceased.

                                MRS. LEFFERTS
                  It seems like my Susan, but...

                                EXLEY
                  When was the last time you saw
                  her, Mrs. Lefferts?

                                MRS. LEFFERTS
                  At Christmas.  We had fought.  I
                  didn't like her boyfriend.  I --
                  she has a birthmark on her hip.

        The Coroner lifts the sheet.  Mrs. Lefferts gasps.

                                MRS. LEFFERTS
                  It's her.  My baby.  Dear God...

        As Mrs. Lefferts swoons, Bud and Exley both hold her up.


        INT. LAPD HEADQUARTERS - BRIEFING ROOM - DAY

        The room buzzes, jammed to the rafters with every
        detective standing ready.  The Chief waits as Dudley
        Smith takes the mike, holds up an L.A. Times headline.

                                DUDLEY
                  'Nite Owl Massacre.'  Hyperbole
                  aside, this is a heinous crime
                  that requires a swift resolution.
                  The public will demand it and this
                  department will provide it.  Six
                  victims.  One of them, one of our
                  own -- Dick Stensland.
                         (as the cops react)
                  As it happens, he was a Nite Owl
                  regular.  In the wrong place at
                  the wrong time.

        Bud White listens, not too sure.  Stensland said he had
        something big going on...

                                DUDLEY
                  Robbery looks like the motive.  We
                  have rubber glove prints on the
                  register and preliminary forensics
                  strongly lean toward a trio of
                  gunmen.  We do have one hot lead,
                  so listen well.  Three Negro
                  youths were seen last night
                  discharging shotguns in the air at
                  Griffith Park.
                  A park ranger I.D.ed them as
                  driving a 1948 to 1950 Mercury
                  Coupe, purple in color.  An hour
                  ago, a canvassing crew found a
                  news vendor who saw a purple Merc
                  Coupe parked across from the Nite
                  Owl around 3:00 A.M.

        The room goes loud, a big rumbling.  Dudley holds up a
        list.

                                DUDLEY
                  The D.M.V. worked all night to get
                  us a registration list on '48 to
                  '50 purple Mercs.  There are 142
                  registered to Negroes in L.A.
                  County.  Fifty two-man teams will
                  shake three names apiece.  Hot
                  suspects you'll bring here.
                  Interrogation rooms have been set
                  up.  They'll be run by Lieutenant
                  Edmund Exley.  Hollywood Squad.

        Catcalls.  Boos.  The Chief steps to the mike.

                                CHIEF
                  Enough on that.  Gentlemen, just
                  go out and get them.  Use all
                  necessary force.  The people of
                  Los Angeles demand it.

        The men exchange knowing looks.  The real message:  kill
        them clean.  Exley doesn't approve.  As the men hurry
        out...

                                EXLEY
                  He might as well have put a bounty
                  on them.


        INT. SQUAD ROOM - DAY

        Detectives pairing up and moving out.  Scanning his three
        name list, Bud joins his PARTNER for the day.

                                 BUD
                  Can you take them?  I got
                  I got something I gotta do.

                                PARTNER
                  Christ, I don't know.  What if one
                  of these names...

                                 BUD
                  What I gotta do is for Stensland.
                  My partner.

        The guy looks at him a beat, nods.  As Bud heads off...


        EXLEY

        watches everyone go.  Wishes he could be part of the
        action.  He spots Jack talking to his REDNECK partner for
        for the day.


        JACK AND REDNECK

        Redneck chews tobacco, has a Texas drawl.

                                REDNECK
                  Where to, Trash?

                                JACK
                  If we go by the list, we have
                  about zero chance of making the
                  collar.  But I know a guy who
                  knows what's going on south of
                  Jefferson.  I'm betting he could
                  put us at 50/50.

                                REDNECK
                  I don't know...

        As Redneck thinks, Exley steps up.  He's overheard.

                                EXLEY
                  I'll take those odds.
                         (to Redneck)
                  Take off.  We got it from here.

        Jack stares.  Redneck shrugs, spits tobacco juice in a
        cup.

                                REDNECK
                  Between the two of you guys, you
                  should bring along a photographer.


        INT. HOLLYWOOD LIQUOR - DAY

        Last time we saw the Owner was Christmas Eve.  He looks
        up from a customer as Bud strides in, badge out front.

                                 BUD
                  I need an address on a customer of
                  yours.  Her name was Lynn.

                                OWNER
                  That's all I have to go on?

                                 BUD
                  Yeah.  And I think you already
                  know who I mean, so cough it up.

                                OWNER
                  Lynn Bracken.  There's a billing
                  address and a delivery address.

                                 BUD
                  Give me both.  Billing first.


        EXT. 1184 GRETNA GREEN, BRENTWOOD (PATCHETT'S) - DAY

        A big, pink Spanish mansion with lots of tile.  Also last
        seen outside Hollywood Liquor on Christmas Eve, Pierce
        Patchett is in the front yard, chipping golf balls over a
        koi pond.  They land in a tight grouping.  As he tees up:

                                 BUD (O.S.)
                  You must slay 'em at the country
                  club.

        Bud's halfway up the walk.  Patchett sees the cuffs
        hooked to his belt.  Patchett is cool as can be.

                                 BUD
                  Are you Pierce Patchett?

                                PATCHETT
                  I am.  Are you soliciting for
                  police charities?  The last time,
                  you people called at my office.

                                 BUD
                  I'm a homicide detective.  Where
                  were you last night?

                                PATCHETT
                  I was here, hosting a party.  Who
                  was killed and why do you think I
                  can help?

                                 BUD
                  Richard Stensland.

                                PATCHETT
                  I don't know him.  Mr...

                                 BUD
                  Officer White.  How about Susan
                  Lefferts?  You know her?

                                PATCHETT
                         (sighs, concedes)
                  You know I do or you wouldn't be
                  here.  How did you find me?

                                 BUD
                  We met outside Hollywood Liquors
                  on Christmas Eve.  This is where
                  Lynn Bracken's booze bills go.

                                PATCHETT
                  Of course...

                                 BUD
                  Sue Lefferts died at the Nite Owl.
                  I'm investigating.

        Patchett studies Bud a beat, weighing his options.
        Patchett's burly BODYGUARD starts over from the house.

                                BODYGUARD
                  Everything alright, Mr. Patchett?

                                PATCHETT
                         (waves him off)
                  Fine, Philip.  Thank you.

                                 BUD
                  Where's the other guy?  Buzz.

                                PATCHETT
                  He no longer works for me.
                         (a beat)
                  Find Susan's killer, Mr. White.
                  I'll give you a handsome reward.
                  Whatever you desire.

        If only Jack had been around to hear that.

                                 BUD
                  Thanks, but no thanks.

                                PATCHETT
                  Against your code?

                                 BUD
                  I don't have one.  Lefferts looked
                  beat-up Christmas Eve, but didn't
                  act it.  How come?

                                PATCHETT
                  Do you care about criminal matters
                  peripheral to Susan's murder?

                                 BUD
                  No.

                                PATCHETT
                  Then you wouldn't feel obligated
                  to report them?

                                 BUD
                  That's right.

                                PATCHETT
                  Then listen closely, because I'll
                  only say this once and if it gets
                  repeated, I'll deny it.  I run
                  call girls.  Lynn Bracken is one
                  of them and so was Susan Lefferts.
                  I treat my girls very well.  I
                  have grown daughters, myself, and
                  I don't like the thought of women
                  being hurt.  I sense you share
                  this feeling.

                                 BUD
                         (ignores comment)
                  Why were Lefferts' eyes black?

                                PATCHETT
                  I think she'd been hit in the face
                  with a tennis racket.  She is --
                  was -- a big doubles fan.

                                 BUD
                  You wanna go downtown and discuss
                  this officially?

                                PATCHETT
                  Wait.  Our deal still holds?

        Bud nods, his patience running thin.

                                PATCHETT
                  I needed a Rita Hayworth to fill
                  out my little studio.

                                 BUD
                  What little studio?

                                PATCHETT
                  There's Gardner, Hepburn, Grable,
                  Turner.  Lynn Bracken is my
                  Veronica Lake.  I use girls who
                  look like movie stars.  Sometimes
                  I employ a plastic surgeon.

                                 BUD
                  That's why her mother couldn't
                  I.D. her... Jesus fucking Christ.

                                PATCHETT
                  No, Mr. White.  Pierce Morehouse
                  Patchett.  Now, I sense you're on
                  your best behavior, but that's all
                  I'll give you.  If you persist,
                  I'll meet you with my attorney.
                  Now, would you like Miss Bracken's
                  address?  I doubt she knows
                  anything, but --

                                 BUD
                  I got her address.

                                PATCHETT
                  Of course... this is personal with
                  you, isn't it, Mr. White?

        Bud turns, heads down the walk.  Patchett hits his golf
        ball.  It lands just past the koi pond, with the rest.
        Ice.


        EXT. 1736 NOTTINGHAM, LOS FELIZ (LYNN BRACKEN'S) - DAY

        A modern-looking triplex.  A projector's flicker strobes
        against the closed curtains.  We hear a PHONE RING.


        INT. 1736 NOTTINGHAM (LYNN BRACKEN'S) - DAY

        The film is This Gun For Hire with Alan Ladd and Veronica
        Lake.  It's projected on a wall in front of which stands
        Lynn Bracken and an OLDER GENTLEMAN, in his underwear.
        Lynn's long, blonde hair hangs down over one eye.  She
        looks more like Veronica Lake than Veronica Lake.  The
        film flashes over them as they kiss.

        The PHONE RINGS.  Lynn ignores it as long as she can
        before breaking away to go answer it.

                                LYNN
                  Hello?

                                OLDER GENTLEMAN
                         (Alan Ladd)
                  Is it the cops?

        She waves him off.  As he practices pointing his finger
        like Ladd points a gun, Lynn reacts to the news on the
        phone.


        EXT. 9781 SOUTH DUQUESNE - DAY

        A South Central plywood and tar-paper dive.  A BLACK
        BOXER pounds a heavy bag/speed bag combo bolted to the
        porch.  Wiry, a welterweight, he doesn't see Jack and
        Exley till they're almost on top of him.

                                JACK
                  Leonard Bidwell?

        The Boxer leans on the bag to catch his breath.  Looking
        them over, he finally nods.

                                JACK
                  How's the left these days?

                                BOXER
                  What's it to you?

                                JACK
                  I saw you fight Kid Gavilan.  I
                  like your style.

                                BOXER
                  What do you want, Mr. Policeman?

                                JACK
                  You got a brother up in Folsom.  I
                  know because I put him there.

                                BOXER
                  Till 19-fucking-70.

                                JACK
                  How'd you like to make it 1960?  I
                  know the judge and Sergeant Exley
                  here is friends with hte D.A.

        Exley nods, this is true.  The Boxer's still listening.

                                JACK
                  We're looking for three colored
                  guys who like to pop off shotguns.
                  One of 'em owns a purple Merc
                  coupe.

                                BOXER
                  You wanna get me a fuckin' snitch
                  jacket?

                                JACK
                  You wanna buy your brother ten
                  years...?  You don't have to say
                  anything.  Just look at this list
                  and point.  Here.

        Jack holds the DMV list out to the Boxer, who waves it
        off.

                                BOXER
                  He's bad, so I'll just tell you.
                  Sugar Ray Coates.  Drives a '49
                  coupe, a beautiful ride.  Don't
                  know about shotguns, but he gets
                  his thrills killing dogs.  He is
                  righteous trash.

        Jack and Exley scan the list.  Jack's finger stabs down
        on, "Coates, Raymond, 9611 South Central, Room 414."

                                JACK
                  That's five minutes from here.


        EXT. 1736 NOTTINGHAM (LYNN BRACKEN'S) - DAY

        Lynn does her best to usher the slightly disheveled
        Older Gentleman out the door.

                                OLDER GENTLEMAN
                  I don't understand, doll, we just
                  got started.

                                LYNN
                  I'm sorry, but I'll make it up
                  to you.  I promise.

                                OLDER GENTLEMAN
                  Gosh, kitten, I don't know...

        As he begins to mash up against her...

                                BUD (O.S.)
                  Hit the road, gramps.

        Bud's standing at the bottom of the stairs.  The Older
        Gentleman strikes a pose.  He still thinks he's Alan
        Ladd.

                                OLDER GENTLEMAN
                  Alright.  This time I'll go, but
                  next time --

                                BUD
                         (flips badge)
                  L.A.P.D., shitbird.  Get the fuck
                  out of here or I'll call your wife
                  to come get you.

        Sputtering, the Older Gentleman exchanges a look with
        Lynn then hurries away, giving Bud a wide berth.

                                LYNN
                  I've been expecting you.  Pierce
                  called.  Told me what happened
                  to Sue.


        INT. 1736 NOTTINGHAM (LYNN BRACKEN'S) - DAY

        A nice breezy feel.  The perfect place to shack up.

                                LYNN
                  It's Officer White, isn't it?

        Bud nods, eyeballs the place.

                                LYNN
                  Can I get you a drink?

                                BUD
                  Yeah, plain scotch.

        Bud watches her move to the bar.  God, she's beautiful.

                                LYNN
                  I was friendly with Sue Lefferts,
                  but we weren't really friends.
                  You know what I mean?

                                BUD
                  Are you sorry she's dead?

                                LYNN
                  Of course I am.  What kind of
                  question is that?

        She steps back with a scotch for both of them.

                                BUD
                  Have you ever heard of Dick
                  Stensland?

                                LYNN
                  No I haven't.  Do you know why
                  Pierce is humoring you?

                                BUD
                  You use words like that, you
                  might make me mad.

                                LYNN
                  Yes.  But do you know?

                                BUD
                  Yeah I know.  Patchett's running
                  whores and judging by his address,
                  probably something bigger on the
                  side.  He doesn't want any
                  attention.

                                LYNN
                  That's right.  Our motives are
                  selfish, so we're cooperating.

                                BUD
                  Why was Susan Lefferts at the
                  Nite Owl?

                                LYNN
                  I don't know.  I never heard of
                  the Nite Owl till today.

                                BUD
                  Did Lefferts have a boyfriend?

                                LYNN
                  Like I said we were friendly,
                  not friends.

                                BUD
                  How'd she meet Patchett?

                                LYNN
                  Pierce meets people.  Sue came
                  on the bus with dreams of
                  Hollywood.  This is how they
                  turned out.  Thanks to Pierce,
                  we still get to act a little.

                                BUD
                  Tell me about Patchett.

                                LYNN
                  He's waiting for you to mention
                  mention.

                                BUD
                  You want some advice, Miss
                  Bracken?

                                LYNN
                  It's Lynn.

                                BUD
                  Miss Bracken, don't ever try to
                  fucking bribe me or threaten me
                  or I'll have you and Patchett
                  in shit up to your ears.

        Lynn smiles again.  She likes Bud.  A beat.

                                LYNN
                  I remember you from Christmas
                  Eve.  You have a thing for
                  helping women, don't you,
                  Officer White?

                                BUD
                  Maybe I'm just fucking curious.

                                LYNN
                  You say 'fuck' a lot.

                                BUD
                  You fuck for money.

                                LYNN
                  There's blood on your shirt.  Is
                  that an integral part of your job?

                                BUD
                  Yeah.

                                LYNN
                  Do you enjoy it?

                                BUD
                  When they deserve it.

                                LYNN
                  Did they deserve it today?

                                BUD
                  I'm not sure.

                                LYNN
                  But you did it anyway.

                                BUD
                  Yeah, just like the half dozen
                  guys you screwed today.

                                LYNN
                         (laughs again)
                  Actually, it was two.  You're
                  different, Officer White.  You're
                  the first man in five years who
                  didn't tell me I look like
                  Veronica Lake inside of a minute.

                                BUD
                  You look better than Veronica
                  Lake.  Now, Pierce Patchett.

                                LYNN
                  He takes a cut of our earnings
                  and invests it for us.  He makes
                  us quit the life at thirty.  He
                  doesn't let us use narcotics and
                  he doesn't abuse us.  Can your
                  policeman's mentality grasp
                  those contradictions?

                                BUD
                  He had you cut to look like
                  Veronica Lake?

                                LYNN
                  No.  I'm really a brunette, but
                  the rest is me.  And that's all
                  the news that's fit to print.

        Lynn starts toward the door.  Bud watches her a moment,
        then follows.  She takes his glass at the door.

                                LYNN
                  It was nice meeting you, Officer.

        Out the door, Bud turns back.  Blurts:

                                BUD
                  Look.  I want to see you again.

                                LYNN
                  Are you asking me for a date or
                  an appointment?

                                BUD
                         (suddenly unsure)
                  I don't know.

                                LYNN
                         (another smile)
                  If it's a date I think you'd
                  better tell me your first name
                  because I --

                                BUD
                         (feeling foolish)
                  Forget I asked.  It was a
                  mistake.

        Lynn watches thoughtfully after Bud as he walks away.
        He opens his car door like he's going to tear ir off.
        A last glance back at Lynn and as he gets in the car...


        EXT. TEVERE HOTEL - DAY

        An L-shaped walk-up.  Jack coasts the car to the curb.
        He leaps out with Exley.  Exley holds up at the sight
        of a late model sedan.  He leans down to look in the
        window at the two-way on the dash.

                                EXLEY
                  L.A.P.D.

                                JACK
                  Shit.  Someone beat us here.

        VOICES from the carport ahead.  We see a chrome bumper,
        the purple fender of a '49 Mercury coupe.  A door slams.
        Drawing a .45, Jack starts over with Exley, .38 in hand.


        CARPORT

        Toting shotguns, Dudley's boys from the Victory Motel,
        Breuning and Carlisle, stand by the purple Mercury.  Jack
        and Exley come around the corner, lower their guns.

                                JACK
                  Hey.

        Breuning wheels, pumps a round into the chamber.  He very
        nearly fires before he sees who it is.

                                CARLISLE
                  What the fuck are you guys doing
                  here?

                                EXLEY
                  Think of us as back-up.

                                JACK
                  What do you got?

        As Jack moves to peer through the Merc's window.

                                BREUNING
                  Three Ithaca pumps, an empty box
                  of double-ought buck and cash.

        Jack spots them.  Three shotguns on the passenger side
        floor, an empty box of shells and loose dollar bills.

                                JACK
                  So long, Vice.  Badge of Honor,
                  here I come.

                                CARLISLE
                  Fuck you, Vincennes.  It's our
                  collar.

        Breuning actually has to restrain his partner.

                                EXLEY
                  Quiet.  I'm ranking officer here.
                  We go as a team.  End of story.


        INT. CORRIDOR - TEVERE HOTEL - DAY

        Breuning and Carlisle lead the way with Jack and Exley
        bringing up the rear.  Squinting, Exley reaches to his
        pocket for something.  Not there.

                                EXLEY
                  Damnit...

                                JACK
                  What?

                                EXLEY
                  Glasses.

                                JACK
                         (chuckling)
                  Just don't shoot me.

        The door to 414.  Two men on either side.  Breuning rears
        back.  Jack rears back.  They kick at the same instant.
        The door flies off its hinges to reveal two young black
        men, LARRY FONTAINE and TY JONES, waking from a couple
        of flop mattresses.


        ROOM 414

        Fontaine jumps up.  Entering, Carlisle aims, but Exley
        grabs his arm.  The BLAST rips the ceiling.  Jack aims.

                                JACK
                  Freeze!

        Fontaine freezes.  Jones doesn't dare get up.

                                CARLISLE
                  Ace him, Jack.

                                EXLEY
                  Shut up, Carlisle!

        Jack and Exley burst into a...


        SECOND BEDROOM

        Another black, RAY COATES, passed out on mattress, sur-
        rounded by empty beer cans.  Jack sticks his .38 in his
        back, starts to cuff him.  As the cuff ratchets down...


        INT. OBSERVATION ROOM - DAY

        Dudley watches intently as Ed Exley skims a report,
        memorizing names and dates.  Jack and other brass are
        also here along with a stenographer.  So's Bud.  One of
        these guys killed Stensland.  Through tinted glass, the
        three suspects in three different rooms.

                                EXLEY
                  Casitas Youth Camp... Coates
                  twenty-two, a boxer... Manager
                  saw them burning clothes.

        Satisfied, Exley sets the report down.

                                DUDLEY
                  Ed, I want confessions.

                                EXLEY
                  I'll break them, sir.

        As Exley steps into the #1 room, Jack joins Dudley.

                                JACK
                  You think golden boy can handle
                  it, Cap?

                                DUDLEY
                  I think you'll be surprised what
                  Edmund's capable of.


        INT. #1 ROOM - DAY

        Exley closes the door.  Ray Coates is cuffed to a chair,
        dressed in baggy County denims.  One eye swollen shut,
        lip split, a smashed nose with one nostril split.

        Exley unlocks his cuffs. drops cigarettes and amtches
        on the table.  As Coates rubs his wrists...

                                EXLEY
                  They call you Sugar Ray because
                  of Ray Robinson?
                         (no answer)
                  They say Robinson can throw a
                  four punch combination in one
                  second.  Do you believe that?

        Coates just stares at him.

                                EXLEY
                  You're twenty-two, aren't you, Ray?

                                COATES
                  Say what and so what.

                                EXLEY
                  Did one of the officers work you
                  over a little?

        No bite.  Coates just stares back.

                                EXLEY
                  You look like Robinson after
                  that last LaMotta fight.  'Course
                  LaMotta looked a lot worse.  So
                  you're twenty-two, right?

                                COATES
                  Man, why do you keep asking me
                  that?

                                EXLEY
                  Just getting my facts straight.
                  Twenty-two makes it a gas chamber
                  bounce.
                  You should have pulled this caper
                  a couple of years ago.  Get life,
                  do a little Youth Authority jolt,
                  transfer to Folsom a big man.
                  Orbit on some of that good prison
                  brew, get yourself a sissy --

                                COATES
                  I never truck with no sissies!

                                EXLEY
                  That fucking Larry.  I almost
                  believed him.

                                COATES
                  Believed what?

                                EXLEY
                  Nothing, Ray.
                         (laughs)
                  That Larry, he's a pisser.  You
                  did the Casitas Youth Camp with
                  him, didn't you?

                                COATES
                  Man, why're you talkin' about
                  Larry?  His business is his
                  business.

        Unseen by Coates, Exley reaches under the table, takes
        hold of one of three toggle switches.

                                EXLEY
                  Sugar, Larry told me you went
                  sissy up at Casitas.  You
                  couldn't do the time so you
                  found yourself a big white boy
                  to look after you.  He said
                  they call you 'Sugar' because
                  you gave it out so sweet.

        Exley flips the toggle.


        #3 ROOM

        The speaker over Larry Fontaine's head crackles to life.

                                COATES (V.O.)
                  Larry gave it at Casitas!  Man,
                  I was the fuckin' boss jocker on
                  my dorm!  Larry's the sissy!
                  Larry gave it for candy bars!


        #1 ROOM

        Exley flips up the second toggle.

                                EXLEY
                  Ray, you protected Ty and Larry
                  up in Casitas, didn't you?

                                COATES
                  You ain't woofin' I did.  Stupid
                  down home niggers got no more
                  sense than a fuckin' dog.

        Exley flips the switches off.

                                EXLEY
                  I heard you like to shoot dogs.

                                COATES
                  Dogs got no reason to live.

                                EXLEY
                  Oh?  you feel that way about
                  people, too?

                                COATES
                  Man, what're you saying?

                                EXLEY
                  Ray, we got the shotguns.

                                COATES
                  I don't own no shotguns.

                                EXLEY
                  Why were you throwing clothes
                  in the building incinerator?

                                COATES
                         (trembling)
                  Say what?

                                EXLEY
                  You guys were arrested this
                  morning, but none of you have
                  last night's clothes.  You were
                  seen burning them.  Add to that
                  the fact that you hid the car
                  you were cruising around in
                  last night and it doesn't look
                  good.

                                COATES
                  I got nothin' more to say till
                  I see a judge.

                                EXLEY
                  Were you on hop?  You were passed
                  out when you got arrested.  Were
                  you hopped up, Ray?

                                COATES
                  Ty and Larry fuck with that
                  shit, not me.

                                EXLEY
                  Where do they get their stuff?
                  Come on.  Give me one to feed
                  the D.A.  Just a little one.

        Coates nods.  Exley flips up the toggles as he leans
        in.

                                COATES
                  Roland Navarette.  Lives on
                  Bunker Hill.  He runs a hole-up
                  for parole absconders and sells
                  red devils.

        Exley flips down the switches, stands.

                                EXLEY
                  I'm going to take a break.

        Exley opens the door, looks back in afterthought.

                                EXLEY
                  You know, Ray, I'm talking about
                  the gas chamber and you haven't
                  even asked me what this is all
                  about.  You got a big guilty
                  sign around your neck.

        Exley exits.


        OBSERVATION ROOM

        Exley enters.

                                DUDLEY
                  Masterful, Edmund.  Your father
                  would've been proud.
                         (pointing)
                  This one's on the verge.

        Exley looks through the glass into #2.  Larry Fontaine
        is weeping.  A piss puddle on the floor by his chair.

                                EXLEY
                  Fontaine next, but give Jones
                  the newspaper.  I want him
                  primed.


        #2 ROOM

        Fontaine tries to control his sniffles as Exley enters.

                                EXLEY
                  Larry, Ray Coates ratted you
                  off.  He said the Nite Owl was
                  your idea.  You want to tell me
                  about it?

        No answer.

                                EXLEY
                  I think it was Ray's idea.  Talk
                  and I think I can save your life.

        No answer.

                                EXLEY
                  Larry, this is a gas chamber job.
                  If you don't talk, you'll be dead
                  in six months.

        No answer.

                                EXLEY
                  Son, six people are dead and
                  somebody has to pay.  It can be
                  you or it can be Ray.

        No answer.

                                EXLEY
                  Larry, he called you queer.  He
                  said at Casitas you took it up
                  the ass.  He said --

                                FONTAINE
                  I DIDN'T KILL NOBODY!

        The voice is strong, full of conviction.  Exley
        glances at the mirror.  Then...

                                EXLEY
                  Why'd you burn the clothes?

                                FONTAINE
                         (sobbing)
                  I just wanted to lose my cherry.
                  I didn't mean to hurt her.

        Exley can't hide his surprise at this.

                                EXLEY
                  Hurt who?  Was she a hooker?
                  Hurt who?

        But Fontaine is gone.  Head lolling, eyes squeezing
        out tears.


        OBSERVATION ROOM

        Exley steps out of the interrogation room.  Dudley
        braces him.

                                DUDLEY
                  Don't get sidetracked.  Stay with
                  the Nite Owl.

                                EXLEY
                  She may still be alive, whoever
                  she is.

        Bud's all ears.


        #3 ROOM

        Reading, Jones has his feet on the table.  Exley
        bursts in.

                                JONES
                  This newspaper shit ain't shit.

                                EXLEY
                  Where's the girl?  Did you kill her?

        No answer, but Jones looks nervous.

                                EXLEY
                  You wanted Larry to lose his
                  cherry, but things got out of
                  hand.  Is that right?


        OBSERVATION ROOM

        Everyone's attention is riveted, particularly Bud's.
        They watch, listen over the speaker.

                                EXLEY
                         (over speaker)
                  Kick loose, Jones.  I know you
                  made her bleed, but that doesn't
                  mean you killed her.

        No answer, but Jones is squirming.

                                EXLEY
                         (over speaker)
                  If that girl's alive, you've
                  still got a chance on this one.

                                JONES
                         (over speaker)
                  I think she's alive.

                                EXLEY
                         (over speaker)
                  You think?

        Jack turns to Dudley.

                                JACK
                  He's good.  I'll give him that.

        They don't notice as the chair back begins to splinter
        in Bud's hands.


        #3 ROOM

        Exley sits across from him, tries to wrap it up.

                                EXLEY
                  Where is she now?
                         (no answer)
                  Did you leave her someplace?
                         (no answer)
                  Did you sell her out?  Give her
                  to some of your buddies?  Tell
                  me where the girl is!

        The door blasts open.  Bud slams Jones up against the
        wall.  As Exley stands, he bangs his knee on the table.
        Pulling a .38, Bud breaks the cylinder, drops 5 shells
        on the floor.

                                BUD
                  One in six.  Where's the girl?

                                EXLEY
                  Officer White, put down that
                  weapon and --

        Bud shoves the barrel into Jones' mouth, pulls the
        trigger twice.  CLICK, CLICK.  Jones starts to slide
        down the wall.  Bud jerks him back up, roars.

                                BUD
                  WHERE?!

        Two more clicks.  Jones spills.

                                JONES
                  S-sylvester F-fitch one-o-nine
                  and Avalon gray corner house...


        EXT. AVALON BOULEVARD - EVENING

        A four cordon.  They coast up to a GRAY CORNER HOUSE.
        Dudley Smith behind the wheel of the lead cruiser.  Bud
        White rides shotgun, reloading his revolver.

                                BUD
                  Give me one minute.

                                DUDLEY
                  You've got it, Wendell.


        STREET

        Bud is out the door and scooting down an alley.  Exley
        moves to follow, but Dudley cuts him off.

                                DUDLEY
                  We're going through the front.


        ALLEY

        Bud vaults a fence, pads up the back porch.  A screen
        door.  Bud slips the catch with a penknife and walks
        inside.


        SCREEN PORCH

        Bud heads for a blind-covered door.  Unlocked, he
        enters...


        A HALLWAY

        Light bouncing from side rooms.  We hear the opening
        spiel of "Badge of Honor" from the left.  Bud wheels into
        a...


        BEDROOM

        A NUDE GIRL spread-eagled on a mattress.  Bound with
        neckties.  One in her mouth.  Her eyes grow wide at the
        sight of Bud, then flicker to the adjoining room.
        Directing him.  Raising the .38, Bud enters...


        THE KITCHEN

        Sylvester Fitch sits naked at the table wolfing Rice
        Krispies and watching "Badge of Honor" on a flickering
        TV.  He looks up, sees the .38 before he sees Bud beyond
        it.  Fitch drops his spoon, raises his hands.

        Bud SHOOTS him in the face.  Dead, Fitch just sits there.

        Bud moves behind him.  Pulling a spare piece from an
        ankle holster, Bud FIRES back at the door from Fitch's
        line of fire, then puts the gun in Fitch's hand.

        We hear the FRONT DOOR CRASH OPEN.  As Fitch slides off
        the chair to the floor, Bud dumps the Rice Krispies on
        him.


        EXT.  GRAY HOUSE - NIGHT

        The Girl on a stretcher.  Being carried to an AMBULANCE.
        Bud White walks alongside, looking like some ferocious
        pet pit bull.  The ATTENDANTS get her inside.  One joins
        her.  The other closes the door, pauses to light a smoke.

        Bud rips the cigarette out of his mouth, nearly taking
        the guy's lips with it.

                                BUD
                  Get her to the fucking hospital.

        One look at Bud, and the Attendant is running around to
        the driver's side.  Exley arrives, steamed.

                                EXLEY
                  A naked guy with a gun?  You
                  expect anyone to believe that?

                                BUD
                  Get the fuck away from me.

        Bud starts away, but Exley gets right in his face.  Other
        cops begin to take notice.  The ambulance pulls out.

                                EXLEY
                  How's it going to look on your
                  report?

                                BUD
                  It'll look like justice.  That's
                  what that fat fuck got.  Justice.

                                EXLEY
                  You don't know what the word means,
                  you dumb bastard.

        Bud goes after Exley, but ten hands pull them apart.
        Dudley on Exley.  Four cops genuinely having trouble
        on Bud.

        And as if things couldn't get crazier, shouts from the
        cops on the street.  POLICE RADIOS CRANKED UP.

                                DISPATCHER (V.O.)
                  Repeat, three suspects escaped
                  from the Hall of Justice jail.
                  The Nite Owl killers:  Raymond
                  Coates, Tyrone Jones and Larry
                  Fontaine.  They are considered
                  armed and extremely dangerous.
                  Descriptions are as follows...


        INT. SQUAD ROOM - DAY

        Electrified, "Nite Owl Killers" on everyone's lips.
        Exley strides through with purpose, beelines to a filing
        cabinet.  Exley pulls the file he's looking for.  He
        scans an interrogation transcript, reads to himself the
        words he's looking for:

                                EXLEY
                  'Give me one to feed the D.A....
                  Roland Navarette.  Lives on
                  Bunker Hill.  Runs a hole-up for
                  parole absconders.'


        INT. HOLLYWOOD STATION - JACK'S DESK - DAY

        Police rush back and forth.  Exley hurries over to the
        desk, but he's not there.

                                EXLEY
                  Anyone seen Jack Vincennes?

        A few cops mumble they haven't.  As Exley decides what
        to do, Carlisle from the original arrest steps over.

                                CARLISLE
                  Is something up, Lieutenant?


        EXT.  1ST & OLIVE - DAY

        Exley and Carlisle pull up across the street from a
        four-story Victorian with paint peeling off the clap-
        boards.  They jump out of the car toting SHOTGUNS.
        Carlisle waits as Exley checks the mail slots:
        "R. Navarette, 408. "


        INT.  STAIRWELL - VICTORIAN BUILDING - DAY

        Exley and Carlisle take the steps two at a time.


        INT. 4TH FLOOR HALLWAY - VICTORIAN BUILDING - DAY

        Exley squints, reaches to a pocket.  No glasses.  He
        passes an elevator, rounds a corner.  There's 408.  Exley
        pumps the shotgun, nods to Carlisle who kicks the door
        in.


        NAVARETTE LIVING ROOM

        Exley and Carlisle burst in on four men eating sandwiches.
        Fontaine and Caucasian NAVARETTE at a table.  Coates on
        the floor.  Jones by the window.  Exley squints.

                                EXLEY
                  Nobody move!

        Fontaine and Navarette raise their hands.  A jostled BEER
        BOTTLE CRASHES to the floor.  Reacting, Carlisle JERKS
        the TRIGGER.  Fontaine goes down.

        Navarette draws a .38, SHOOTS Carlisle twice in the
        chest.  Exley BLASTS Navarette.

        Screaming, Jones pulls a .45 from his belt.  Exley FIRES,
        blowing him right THROUGH the WINDOW.

        Coates draws and FIRES, makes a run for it.  A bad pull
        takes out half a back wall.  Coates is out the door.


        ELEVATOR

        Coates makes it inside, frantically pushes buttons.


        HALLWAY

        Here comes Exley.  Stumbling, wiping Navarette's blood
        out of his eyes, he closes on the...


        ELEVATOR

        Coates watches as the elevator doors begin closing.


        HALLWAY

        Exley charging.


        ELEVATOR

        The shotgun barrel juts through.  The doors bang against
        it.  BLAM!

                                                   DISSOLVE TO:

        L.A. MONTAGE

        TONY BENNETT belts "BOULEVARD OF BROKEN DREAMS."


        INT. HOLLYWOOD STATION - DAY

        Exley returns to grudging respect.  His white shirt
        flecked with blood, he's clapped on the back by Dudley
        who dubs him "Shotgun Ed."  Exley doesn't enjoy it.  He's
        numb, stumbling along.  As he notices the blood on his
        hands...


        INSERT - NEWSPAPER HEADLINE

        NITE OWL HERO!  Over a photo of Exley.


        EXT. CEMETERY - GRAVE - DAY

        A coffin is lowered into the ground.  A WIDOW leans on
        the Chief's arm, accepts a tri-folded American flag from
        Dudley Smith.  Exley drops a handful of earth on the
        casket, has trouble getting the wet dirt off his hands.

                                CHIEF
                  We mourn the passing of a good
                  man.  The loss of Sgt. William
                  Carlisle is the loss of his
                  wife, his family and the entire
                  Los Angeles Police Department...

        A sea of dress blues.  Jack looks bored, dressed too
        flashy for a funeral.  Bud looks grim, rain dripping off
        the brim of his cap.  As a TWENTY-ONE GUN salute is
        FIRED...


        EXT. CEMETERY (SOUTH CENTRAL, L.A.) - DAY

        Larry Fontaine's mother mourns alone as her son is
        buried.


        INT. CITY OF ANGELS HOSPITAL - RECEPTION AREA - DAY

        Exley talks with a tough, starchy NURSE.

                                EXLEY
                  I need the girl to give me a
                  chronology of events.  No details.
                  Just times.

                                NURSE
                  Absolutely not.  She barely
                  remembers her own name.

                                EXLEY
                  But --

                                NURSE
                  I was told the case was closed.
                  Should I call your superior to
                  double-check?

                                EXLEY
                  No.  that won't be necessary.

        The Nurse turns, marches away.  Exley is left with a
        nagging doubt.


        EXT. ORANGE GROVE (ANAHEIM) - DAY

        People cheer as bulldozers mow down orange trees.  A
        banner heralds the future:  "On this site:  The World's
        Biggest Amusement Park."  Cartoon characters dance among
        the fallen trees.


        INT. STATE ASSEMBLYMAN'S OFFICE - DAY

        Sitting behind a desk is the Older Gentleman last seen
        doing his best Alan Ladd impersonation at Lynn Bracken's.

        He stares emphatically at the SMARMY LAWYER who stands
        before him holding a manila folder.

                                OLDER GENTLEMAN
                  You tell Mr. Patchett I have no
                  intention of changing my vote.

        The Lawyer simply hands him a stack of photographs.  From
        Lynn Bracken's apartment.  The first is the Older
        Gentleman naked except for his socks and garters.


        INT. STATE ASSEMBLY - CHAMBER - DAY

        The Older Gentleman rises for an assembly vote.

                                OLDER GENTLEMAN
                  It may surprise some, but a mature
                  man, enlightened by the facts, can
                  change him mind...


        EXT. 1736 NOTTINGHAM (LYNN BRACKEN'S) - NIGHT

        Rain.  A limo disgorges a heavy-set man who climbs steps,
        knocks on the door.  Lynn answers in an evening gown.  He
        gives her a peck on the cheek and continues in past her.
        Lynn's about to follow him in when she pauses to deadpan
        a look down the street.

        Bud's Packard is parked there and we can see his darkened
        silhouette behind the wheel.  Smiling a bit sadly to
        herself, Lynn disappears inside.

        This is no stake-out.  Bud watches after her with
        yearning.


        INT. TROCADERO CLUB - NIGHT

        Cigarette girls and club photographer make the rounds.
        Johnny Stompanato enjoys the frenzien floor show.


        EXT. WILSHIRE BOULEVARD - DAY

        A horse parade, heavy on the law enforcement contingent,
        Out of place in his suit and tie, District Attorney Ellis
        Loew awkwardly rides atop a sleek Palimono.


        INT. OLYMPIC AUDITORIUM - NIGHT

        The crowd in a frenzy as Vincennes-snitch, the
        welterweight black boxer, beats the shit out of a white
        fighter.


        INT. MIDDLE CLASS LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

        A father holds out his hand, counts along as Jack slaps
        $100 bills into his palm.  Maybe four thousand dollars.

        Jack says something about "We appreciate your
        understanding during this difficult time."  As "Badge of
        Honor" comes on the TV, the father responds with "Goddamn
        actors."

        Leading, Jack looks through an open door where Brett
        Chase's high school "Sweater Girl" is being comforted by
        her mother.  As she locks eyes with him an instant...


        INT. PIERCE PATCHETT'S HOUSE - NIGHT

        The monied johns watch horny as hell as "Ginger Rogers"
        twirls around the room with a female "Fred Astaire."
        Clothes fly as they spin.  Still, most eyes turn to Lynn
        Bracken as she enters oozing that cat-girl grace.


        EXT. POLICE HEADQUARTERS - DAY

        Reporters scribble as the Chief speaks.  Uniforms
        everywhere along with Exley and Loew.  Bus sits in the
        back.

                                CHIEF
                  Edmund J. Exley has amassed a
                  brilliant record in his seven
                  years with the L.A.P.D.  Recently
                  he evinced spectacular bravery in
                  the line of duty.  It is my honor
                  to present him with our highest
                  honor, the Medal of Valor.

        Exley steps up.  The Chief hangs a gold medallion around
        his neck.  Flashbulbs pop as the two men shake hands.

        Exley then accepts a handshake from Dudley.  The
        policemen stand on cue, applaud without enthusiasm.
        Dudley lifts the medal from his chest.

                                DUDLEY
                  Your father would've been proud.

        Exley uses the noise to have aprivate chat with Dudley.

                                EXLEY
                  There are loose ends out there,
                  Dudley.  I --

                                DUDLEY
                  There always are.  But there are
                  also three men and three guns.
                  Matched forensically.  A few loose
                  ends don't matter.

                                EXLEY
                  Something's wrong.  I feel it
                  inside.  Doesn't that sound crazy?

        Dudley puts an arm around Exley's shoulder, smiles out as
        more bulbs flash.

                                DUDLEY
                  Breaking a big case sticks you in
                  a whirlwind.  A little self-doubt?
                  It's natural.  Just keep it
                  inside.  Between you and you.

        Exley considers his medal.  It is an appealing thing.

        In the back, Bud stays sprawled in his seat.  No one's
        watching as he takes out his gun, kisses it, and blows
        pretend smoke off the barrel.  As the song ends...


        INT. VARIETY INTERNATIONAL PICTURES - STAGE 4 - NIGHT

        A "Badge of Honor" fund-raiser for D.A. Loew's re-
        election cmpaign.  Hot dogs and sauerkraut.  Fishbowls
        stuffed with cash.  Jack is here, returns a smile half-
        heartedly.  Loew sits with his wife and teenage daughter
        as Brett "Joe Reno" Chase speaks.

                                CHASE
                  This election is about the future
                  of law enforcement in Los Angeles.
                  Ellis Loew represents that future.
                  So dig deep and let's get a moral
                  man re-elected.

        Applause.  Leaving the podium, Chase smiles at Ellis
        Loew's daughter who absolutely gushes.  Chase then winks
        knowingly to Jack who returns a tired, humorless smile.

        Jack scans the room.  An odd moment as Jack catches his
        own reflection in a mirror across the way.  He puts a
        hand to his face.  Is that him?

                                HUDGEON (O.S.)
                  Big V Jack Vincennes!

        Jack turns to see Sid Hudgeons approaching.

                                HUDGEONS
                  You're back, boychick.

                                JACK
                  Sid, how are they hanging?

                                HUDGEONS
                  Down around my ankles.

        Hudgeons scans the crowd, points someone out.

                                HUDGEONS
                  You remember Matt Reynolds?

        Jack spots Matt Reynolds -- one of the young actors Jack
        arrested on Christmas Eve.

                                HUDGEONS
                  The Grauman's Chinese pot bust.
                  He just got off the honor farm.

                                JACK
                  What's he doing here, Sid?

                                HUDGEONS
                  You tight with the D.A., trash?

                                JACK
                  Sure, he just tried to throw me
                  off the force last Christmas as a
                  little joke.

                                HUDGEONS
                  How'd you like a little payback?
                  Not to mention a donation to the
                  widows and orphans fund.  Did you
                  know Loew was a swish?

                                JACK
                  And Reynolds?

                                HUDGEONS
                  He's queer too.  Metro paid him
                  two grand a week to fake it with
                  ingenues.  On screen and off.  I'm
                  getting him to fuck the D.A. for a
                  hundred bucks.
                         (winks)
                  That's twice the fifty you got for
                  wrecking his career.

        Even Jack's not immune to a comment like that.

                                HUDGEONS
                  Matt!  Over here!

        As Hudgeons heads over, Hudgeons points out...

                                HUDGEONS
                  That's D.A. Loew right there.

        Reynolds gets a nervous bead on Loew.  Hudgeons realizes:

                                HUDGEONS
                  You need a drink, kid... Jack,
                  look after him a minute.  Kid,
                  this is Jack.  No secrets between
                  me and him.

        Hudgeons heads off.  Reynolds, plae, nods at Jack.

                                REYNOLDS
                  Have we met before?

                                JACK
                  Yeah.

        Jack doesn't really feel like talking to him.  Reynolds'
        nerves won't let him stay quiet.

                                REYNOLDS
                  Was it a party?

                                JACK
                  Something like that.

                                REYNOLDS
                         (misreading)
                  Oh, I know.  A Fleur-de-Lis party,
                  right?

        Jack remembers the name, plays along for what it's worth.

                                JACK
                  Fleaur-de-Lis.  'Whatever you
                  desire.'

                                REYNOLDS
                  Dope, liquor, hookers that look
                  like movie stars.  Pierce Patchett
                  has it all.

        Jack recognizes the name, bluffs for more information.

                                JACK
                  Yeah.  Me and Patchett go way
                  back.

                                REYNOLDS
                  Pierce isn't like regular people.
                  I dig him, but he scares me too.

                                JACK
                  Really?  How?

                                REYNOLDS
                         (shakes his head)
                  You know, when I came out to L.A.,
                  this isn't exactly where I saw
                  myself ending up.

                                JACK
                  Yeah.  Me neither.

        Reynolds looks like he's going to cry.  Hudgeons returns
        with a double Scotch straight up and a hot dog with
        sauerkraut.  He hands the drink to Matt.

                                HUDGEONS
                  Dutch courage, kid.  Drink up.

        Reynolds downs a few gulps, looks across the room at
        Loew.

                                REYNOLDS
                  I don't know if I should do this.

                                HUDGEONS
                  Hey, it's not like you don't know
                  how.  And Jack here has
                  connections on 'Badge of Honor.'
                  Pull this off and there'll be a
                  part for you.  I smell a comeback.
                  Don't you, Jack?

        Reynolds looks to Jack who gives a noncommittal shrug.

                                JACK
                  Loew's free.  Congratulate him.

        Reynolds nods, drains his glass and heads off.  Hudgeons
        hands Jack a folded slip of paper.

                                HUDGEONS
                  If Reynolds works his charms,
                  which he will, this is the address
                  where they'll be.  Meet me at
                  midnight.  I guarantee all sorts
                  of illegal activity.

        Hudgeons takes out a President Grant $50 bill.  Jack
        doesn't take it.

                                JACK
                  Sid, why would a guy like Pierce
                  Patchett get involved with running
                  dope and hookers?

                                HUDGEONS
                  Where'd you hear that?

                                JACK
                  Around.

                                HUDGEONS
                  Jackie, all I know is what you
                  know.  The man is very rich.  And
                  he's invested in freeway
                  construction so he's gonna get a
                  lot richer.  But that's it.
                  Patchett's what I like to call
                  'Twilight.'  He ain't queer, he
                  ain't Red, he can't help me in my
                  quest for prime sinuendo.

        Jack takes the $50 as Reynolds returns, shaking his head.

                                HUDGEONS
                  What?

                                REYNOLDS
                  I can't do it.

                                HUDGEONS
                  Talk to him, Jack.  Tell him about
                  the opening on the show.

                                JACK
                  I'm pretty sure I can get you a
                  part on the show... But tonight?
                  Pretend it's an acting job, kid.
                  Showbiz.

                                REYNOLDS
                  And no one'll know about this?

                                JACK
                  It'll be our secret.

                                REYNOLDS
                  Showbiz.

        Emboldened by Jack's promise, Reynolds heads off.  Jack
        and Hudgeons watch as he strikes a conversation with Loew
        who's captivated.  Hudgeons chomps a bite of his hot dog,
        gives Jack the high sign, but Jack just feels like a pimp.


        INT. VICTORY HOTEL - ROOM SIX - NIGHT

        Screams.  A cauliflower-eared Cleveland mob enforcer on
        the hotseat.

        Breuning works him with a rubber hose as Dudley asks
        unanswered questions.  Bud watches, revulsion growing.

                                DUDLEY
                  Where did you intend to start.
                  Prostitution?  Gambling?
                         (no answer)
                  Go back to Cleveland, lad.  This
                  is the City of Angels and you
                  haven't got any wings.

        More screams as the hose thwops down.  Bud looks away,
        then shuffles blindly out of the room.


        INT. VICTORY HOTEL - BATHROOM - NIGHT

        Bud runs water in the sink to drown out the SCREAMS.  It
        doesn't work.  Finally, he leans down and sticks his head
        under the stream of water.  That doesn't work either.


        EXT. VICTORY HOTEL - NIGHT

        Hair dripping wet, Bud makes it to his car.  The tires
        spit gravel as he tears away.  Dudley appears in the
        doorway, watching curiously.  As cauliflower continues to
        SCREAM...


        INT. BUD'S PACKARD - 1736 NOTTINGHAM (LYNN'S) - NIGHT

        Bud watches Lynn Bracken's apartment,  Colored lights
        play on the windows.  Shadows pass.  Finally the front
        door opens.  There's Veronica Lake, all sparkles and
        spangles, kissing another distinguished gentleman
        goodnight.  Bud watches the man into a waiting limo.  As
        it pulls away...


        INT. 1736 NOTTINGHAM (LYNN BRACKEN'S) - LIVING ROOM -
        NIGHT

        Now Lynn just looks tired.  As she puts away Scotch
        bottles and picks up empty glasses, there's a KNOCK on
        the door.  Lynn sighs, become sultry Veronica Lake before
        our eyes.


        INT. FRONT HALL - NIGHT

                                LYNN
                         (opening door)
                  Did you forget some --

        Bud stands there, filling up the door frame.

                                LYNN
                  I wondered when you might ring the
                  bell again, Officer White.

                                BUD
                  It's Bud.

        Bud looks at Lynn a moment, then down at his own feet.
        Embarrassed.  She smiles.

                                LYNN
                  You should see yourself.  You look
                  like you're ten years old.

        Bud looks back up.  Lynn's smile fades as she studies his
        face.  She's not going to ask questions.  Lynn looks at
        him a moment more, then runs a hand through the blonde
        hair covering one eye.

                                LYNN
                  If you'd called first, I wouldn't
                  look this ridiculous.


        INT. LYNN BRACKEN'S (1736 NOTTINGHAM) - BEDROOM - NIGHT

        Lynn comes to Bud naked, her hair brushed back.  Bud goes
        slow, gently, takes time with his kisses:  like she was a
        lonely woman he wanted to love to death.

        Lynn plays off his timing:  her kisses back, her touches.
        Finally, Bud forces himself to stop.  He pulls back so he
        can see her.

                                LYNN
                  You're wondering if Patchett told
                  me to be receptive.

        Bud doesn't answer, but yes.

                                LYNN
                  It doesn't matter.  I like you,
                  Bud.  I really do.

        She kisses him.  Softly, drawing it out.  Not a job.  She
        wants to make love to him.  And as Bud stops thinking...


        EXT. 5261 CHERAMOYA AVENUE (HOLLYWOOD) - NIGHT

        Jack sits in his car waiting.  He checks his watch...
        1:30.  Well past midnight.

                                JACK
                  Come on, Sid.  Where are you?

        Jack decides.  MOVE WITH him as he gets out and crosses
        the street.  The apartment is dark, the front door a few
        inches ajar.  Suspicious, Jack listens.  Dead quiet.  He
        enters...


        INT. 5261 CHERAMOYA AVENUE - NIGHT

        No one here it seems.  Till Jack nearly trips over a
        body.  Matt Reynolds.  Soaked in blood.  Throat slit.
        Jack looks down in horror as Reynolds seems to stare back
        up at him.  Jack stumbles out the door.  We hear his CAR
        DOOR SLAM shut, the SCREECH of RUBBER down the street.


        EXT. 2345 HALBORO (HUDGEONS' HOUSE) - NIGHT

        Jack pounds on Sid's door till lights switch on.

                                JACK
                  It's Vincennes!  Open up!

        Hudgeons opens the door.  He's in his pajamas.

                                HUDGEONS
                  Jackie!  You got some good scoop
                  for the Sidster?

                                JACK
                  Sid, cut the crap.  I --

                                HUDGEONS
                  Give me some Narco skinny.  I want
                  to put out an all hop-head issue.
                  Shvartze jazz musicians and movie
                  stars.  Maybe tie it into the
                  Rosenbergs.  You like?

        Jack grabs him, jerks him into the door frame.

                                JACK
                  Shut up!

                                HUDGEONS
                         (confused)
                  What's wrong, Trash?

                                HUDGEONS
                  What happened with the kid and
                  Loew?

                                HUDGEONS
                  You didn't get my message?  It got
                  called off.  The kid chickened out
                  at the last minute.

                                JACK
                  He's dead.  I was just there.
                  Somebody slit his throat.

                                HUDGEONS
                  Jesus.  Jack, that's a story.
                  'Swish Actor Gets The Gay Blade.'
                  Let me get my camera.

        Hudgeons starts away, but Jack grabs him.

                                JACK
                  Loew didn't go with him.  You're
                  sure?

                                HUDGEONS
                  I put Reynolds in the cab myself.
                  The night cost me a hundred scoots
                  and I got bupkis.

        Jack lets go of him, starts to ramble off into the night.

                                HUDGEONS
                  Jackie!  Big V!  Let me get my
                  camera!  Where are you going?!


        INT. AFTER HOURS CLUB - NIGHT

        The BARTENDER walks down the bar to where Jack arrives.

                                BARTENDER
                  What'll it be, Jack?

                                JACK
                         (pulls out wallet)
                  A bottle of Scotch.

        As the Bartender turns for one, the only bill Jack finds
        is the President Grant fifty.  The things he's done for
        fifty bucks... As he looks up with despair at his
        reflection in the bar mirror, the Bartneder sets down a
        bottle and shot glass.  He plucks the fifty from Jack's
        hand.

        Jack grabs the bottle and starts out.

                                BARTENDER
                  Hey!  Your change!


        INT. 1736 NOTTINGHAM (LYNN BRACKEN'S) - BEDROOM - NIGHT

        Spent, Bud and Lynn lie in bed.  SHe traces a finger over
        his bicep as he muses on the ceiling.

                                BUD
                  Who was that guy who was here
                  earlier?

        Lynn's tracing finger stops on Bud's shoulder -- a small
        white scar.

                                LYNN
                  It doesn't matter.  All they get
                  is Veronica Lake.  You got the
                  real Lynn Margaret Bracken...
                         (re: scar)
                  Where'd this come from?

                                BUD
                  When I was ten, my old man threw a
                  bottle at my mother.  I guess I
                  got in the way.

                                LYNN
                  So you saved her.

                                BUD
                  Yeah.  But not for long.

        Bud looks away.  Lynn sees he doesn't want to talk about
        it.

                                LYNN
                  Do you like being a cop, Bud?

                                BUD
                  I used to.  What I do now is
                  strong-arm.  Sitting duck stuff...
                  No, I don't like it.  If I could
                  work Homicide like a real
                  detective...

        Lynn listens sympathetically.  Bud's opening up.

                                BUD
                  There's something wrong with the
                  Nite Owl.  That prick Exley shot
                  the wrong guys.  But they made him
                  a hero and whoever killed my
                  partner is still out there.

        Frustrated, Bud pokes at his own chest.

                                BUD
                  In here I know it.  But I can't
                  prove it.  I'm not a detective.
                  I'm not smart enough.  I'm just
                  the guy they bring in to scare the
                  other guy shitless.

        Bud looks away, embarrassed to have shown so much of
        himself.  Lynn reaches over, turns his face back to her.

                                LYNN
                  You found Patchett.  You found me.
                  You're smart enough.  Be a
                  detective if that's what you want.

                                BUD
                  That simple, huh?

        Lynn nods.  That simple.


        INT. HOLLYWOOD STATION - EXLEY'S OFFICE - NIGHT

        Exley looks up as a CLERK enters holding two files.

                                CLERK
                  I got the rap sheets on the black
                  guys, sir.  Coates and Jones got
                  charges a mile long.  But except
                  for some kid stuff, Fontaine's
                  clean.

                                EXLEY
                  Clean?

                                CLERK
                  More or less.

                                EXLEY
                  Until he gunned down six people.


        EXT. GRIFFITH PARK - DAY

        Exley stands in the trees as a PARK RANGER approaches.

                                PARK RANGER
                  I asked my men, Lieutenant.  No
                  one remembers any colored guys
                  firing shotguns.

                                EXLEY
                  Then who phoned in the report?

                                PARK RANGER
                  Not us.


        INT. FORENSICS LAB - DAY

        Ray Pinker looks up from his microscope as Bud enters.

                                PINKER
                  Bud White, what brings you down to
                  the basement?

                                BUD
                  I got a few Nite Owl questions.

                                PINKER
                  I don't know if you read the
                  papers, but that case is closed.

                                BUD
                  I'm tying up loose ends.  Padding
                  my report.  You know how it goes.

                                PINKER
                  What do you want to know?

                                BUD
                  Anything off.  Anything that
                  didn't make sense.

                                PINKER
                  You mean beside the fact that
                  thirty-five out of forty-five
                  rounds were gratuitous?  I can't
                  think of anything.

        Pinker is ticked as Bud steps over to where a group of
        Nite Owl crime scene photos are posted on the wall.  Bud
        pauses at a photo which shows the floor around the table.
        We see a high heel shoe, blood smears across the floor.

                                BUD
                  Whose shoe?

                                PINKER
                  Susan Lefferts.

                                BUD
                         (pointing)
                  If she was sitting here, then it's
                  facing the wrong way.  What are
                  these smears in the blood?

                                PINKER
                  It looks like she was flailing,
                  trying to get away.

                                BUD
                  But she's moving away from the
                  door.
                         (thinks; points)
                  Who was sitting at this table?

                                PINKER
                  Dick Stensland.
                         (a beat)
                  Had to be dumb panic.  If she knew
                  him she would've been sitting with
                  him... Right?

        Bud wonders, maybe a puzzle piece just fell into place.
        Pinker remembers something.

                                PINKER
                  You know, there is one thing.

        Pinker rummages a shelf for a glass jar which he hands
        Bud.  Inside are two wax-saturated cotton balls.

                                PINKER
                  Cotton balls.  I found them just
                  inside the meat locker door.

                                BUD
                  Ear plugs.

                                PINKER
                  Exactly.  At least one of those
                  animals had the brains to protect
                  his ears.

                                BUD
                  It doesn't exactly play like dumb
                  panic.

                                PINKER
                  What do you mean?

                                BUD
                  It's like they knew they were
                  going to kill everyone before they
                  went in...

                                PINKER
                  Yeah, so...

        Bud just stares at the picture of Susan Lefferts.


        EXT. LEFFERTS' HOUSE (SAN BERNARDINO) - DAY

        A shingle shack dump.  Bud walks the front steps, RINGS
        the BELL.  Hilda Lefferts answers.  She doesn't look so
        good.

                                BUD
                  Mrs. Lefferts, I'm Officer White
                  with the L.A.P.D.  I'd like to ask
                  a couple of questions.

                                MRS. LEFFERTS
                  Let my daughter rest in peace.

                                BUD
                  Five minutes.  That's all.


        INT. LEFFERTS' HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY

        Pictures of Susan smile down from four walls.  Vamp poses
        on a nightclub floor.  Mrs. Lefferts is all twitchy and
        nervous, her eyes darting to a closed door.

                                BUD
                  Tell me about the boyfriend she
                  had.  The one you mentioned at the
                  morgue.

                                MRS. LEFFERTS
                  First I want to go on record as
                  saying that my Susie was a virgin
                  when she died.

                                BUD
                  Ma'am, I'm sure she was.

        Mrs. Lefferts talks directly to a photo of her daughter.

                                MRS. LEFFERTS
                  Susie, I told you I didn't approve
                  of that boyfriend.  He was too old
                  for you.  You let him come into
                  this house and be fresh to me.  I
                  went out one day and old Mrs.
                  Jensen next door saw Susan's
                  boyfriend and another man and
                  thought she heard a ruckus.

                                BUD
                  What was that boyfriend's name?

                                MRS. LEFFERTS
                  We were never properly introduced.
                  Susan and I were fighting that
                  day.  She called him by a
                  nickname.  Muns or Lunts or
                  something.

                                BUD
                  Stens?  Was it Stens?

                                MRS. LEFFERTS
                  Maybe.  I don't know.

                                BUD
                  Look at a picture for me.

        Bud hands her a snapshot of Stensland taken in Tijuana.
        Out of uniform.  She recognizes him.

                                MRS. LEFFERTS
                  That's him.  That's him.

                                BUD
                  You said a neighbor heard a
                  ruckus.  Was it outside, inside?

        Mrs. Lefferts' eyes go crazy, darting to a closed door.
        Rolled towels are crammed against the bottom of it.

                                MRS. LEFFERTS
                  I don't know.  You'll have to
                  leave now, Officer.

        Bud starts for the closed door.

                                BUD
                  What's through here?

                                MRS. LEFFERTS
                  No!  Please leave!

        Bud kicks away the towels, opens the door, steps into...


        DEN

        Innocuous except for the smell.  It hits Bud right off.

                                MRS. LEFFERTS
                  Don't mind the smell.  I think a
                  rat died behind the wall... My
                  Susie was a good girl!

                                BUD
                  Easy.  Tell me about the ruckus.

                                MRS. LEFFERTS
                  I came home that night and there
                  was blood on the floor.  Susan
                  said Stams -- Stens had cut
                  himself.  They were acting
                  nervous.  And that Stens kept
                  going under the house.

        As Mrs. Lefferts goes shrill, Bud beelines out the door.


        EXT. LEFFERTS' HOUSE (SAN BERNARDINO) - DAY

        Holding a flashlight, Bud crawls under the house, into...


        CRAWLSPACE

        Bud elbow-crawls over the dirt, between wooden pilings.

        There's a long burlap sack ahead.  It smells bad.  Bud
        rips burlap.  A rat's nest explodes.  Bud sweeps a
        forearm at them.  As they clear, he sees a gristle-caked
        human skull staring back, a .38 hole in the forehead.

        Undaunted, Bud tears the burlap back further.  He pats
        the corpse's pockets, comes up with a wallet.  Bud checks
        the ID.  "Turner Meeks."  Bus knows him by that name and
        another.

                                BUD
                  Buzz Meeks... Holy shit.


        EXT. LEFFERTS' HOUSE - DAY

        Bud crawls out, blinking sunlight and gulping fresh air.
        Mrs. Lefferts is there.  She's scared.

                                MRS. LEFFERTS
                  Was it... a rat?

                                BUD
                  Yeah.  A great big one.

        Bud opens Meeks' wallet, pulls out a couple hundred bucks
        and gives them to Mrs. Lefferts.

                                BUD
                  Here.  Compliments of the Los
                  Angeles Police Department.


        INT. FORENSICS LAB - DAY

        Ray Pinker looks up from an autopsy as Exley enters.

                                PINKER
                  Hey, just in time for our stomach
                  of the week.  Frankfurters with
                  sauerkraut, French fries,
                  Coca-Cola, alcohol and sperm.
                  Jesus, what a last supper.

        The stiff is Matt Reynolds!  Pinker continues working
        away.

                                EXLEY
                  The Nite Owl.  Anything bothering
                  you about the case?

                                PINKER
                  Yeah.  The fact that you guys
                  won't let it get filed away.

                                EXLEY
                  What are you talking about?

                                PINKER
                  Bud White grilled me on it this
                  morning.  You know, he's not as
                  dumb as I thought.

        As Exley's head swims...

        EXT. LEFFERTS' HOUSE (SAN BERNARDINO) - DAY

        Mrs. Lefferts waters the grass, watches as a car pulls
        up.  Exley gets up, starts toward her.  She drops the
        hose and runs for the front door  Exley cuts her off.

                                MRS. LEFFERTS
                  Let my Susie rest in peace!

                                EXLEY
                  Mrs. Lefferts, I just want to ask
                  a few questions.

                                MRS. LEFFERTS
                  That other policeman already
                  checked under the house and found
                  not a thing amiss.

                                EXLEY
                  Officer White?

                                MRS. LEFFERTS
                  A sweet man.

                                EXLEY
                         (thinking
                          out loud)
                  Under the house.

                                MRS. LEFFERTS
                  All he found were rodents.  No
                  signs of foul play.  So there.

        Exley spots the entrance to the crawlspace.  He hurries
        over, enters nearly flat on his belly.  Mrs. Lefferts
        calls in after him.

                                MRS. LEFFERTS
                  My daughter was a virgin!

                                EXLEY (O.S.)
                  I don't doubt it -- Oh, God.


        INT. HOLLYWOOD STATION - JACK'S DESK - DAY

        Jack sits unshaven and hung-over, the dregs of the Scotch
        bottle on the desk.  He considers a framed "Badge of
        Honor" photo:  Jack and Brett Chase, before a banner "To
        Protect and Serve."  Jack punches a fist through it.


        INT. LAPD - FORENSICS LAB - DAY

        Exley walks alonside as a body bag is wheeled into the
        lab atop a gurney.  Pinker steps over.

                                EXLEY
                  I need an I.D. ASAP.  You talk
                  only to me on this one.


        INT. JACK'S DESK - DAY

        Sitting in disgust, Jack spots something amidst all the
        clutter -- the Great Jerk-Off Books of 1962.  He flips
        one over, looks at the Fleur-de-Lis stamp.  Jack
        remembers something Matt Reynolds told him.  He dials the
        phone.

                                JACK
                  Yeah.  Sergeant Jack Vincennes
                  requesting.  I need the home
                  address on a Pierce Patchett.

                                OPERATOR (V.O.)
                  Please hold, Sergeant...

        As Jack waits, Exley appears in front of him.

                                EXLEY
                  I need to speak to you.

                                JACK
                  Give me a minute, will ya?

        Exley clicks off the phone.

                                JACK
                  Damnit... What?

                                EXLEY
                  I want you to follow Bud White.

                                JACK
                  Even I'm not that crazy.

                                EXLEY
                  It's not a request.  I need to
                  know what White knows.  Follow him
                  or I'll have you pulled off 'Badge
                  of Honor.'  Permanently.

                                JACK
                  Yesterday that might've meant
                  something.  Pull me off.  You'd be
                  doing me a big favor.

                                EXLEY
                  Yesterday yes, today no.  What
                  happened last night?

                                JACK
                  Transfer me, suspend me.  Just
                  leave me alone.

                                EXLEY
                  You make a mistake?

                                JACK
                  Yeah.  My whole life.

        Jack stands, heads out.  Exley follows; he needs help.

                                EXLEY
                  Listen, I think I made a mistake,
                  too.

                                JACK
                  I ain't a priest, Lieutenant.  I
                  can't hear your confession.

                                EXLEY
                  Do you make the three Negroes for
                  the Nite Owl killings?

                                JACK
                  What?

                                EXLEY
                  It's a simple question.

                                JACK
                  You should be the last person who
                  wants to dig any deeper into the
                  Nite Owl, Lieutenant.

        Exley watches as Jack continues down a hall.  Then:

                                EXLEY
                  Rollo Tomasi.

        Jack stops, looks back at him.

                                JACK
                  Is there more to that, or do I
                  have to guess?

                                EXLEY
                  Rollo was a purse snatcher.  My
                  father ran into him off duty.  He
                  shot my father six times and got
                  away clean.  No one even knew who
                  he was.  I made the name up to
                  give him some personality.

                                JACK
                  So what's the point?

                                EXLEY
                  Rollo's the reason I became a cop.
                  I wanted to catch the guys who
                  thought they could get away with
                  it.  It was supposed to be about
                  truth and justice and Rollo.  But
                  somewhere along the way I forgot
                  all that... How about you, Jack?
                  Why'd you become a cop?

        Jack looks like he might cry, but smiles instead.

                                JACK
                  I don't remember...

        Both men are quiet a moment.

                                JACK
                  I'm trying to figure what angle
                  you're playing this time, but I
                  sure as hell can't see one.

                                EXLEY
                  I've given up angles for awhile.
                  I just want to solve this thing.

                                JACK
                  The Nite Owl was solved,
                  Lieutenant.

                                EXLEY
                  I want to do it right.

        So does Jack.

                                JACK
                  Okay, college boy, I'll help you.
                  But I want half the collar.

                                EXLEY
                  A third.  I don't think we can
                  make a case without Bud White.


        EXT. BROWN DERBY - DAY

        A Packard pulls up out front.  Bud gets out, heads
        inside.  Another car pulls up across the street.


        CLOSE ON JACK

        Watching Bud.  Jack gets out, starts across the street.


        INT. BROWN DERBY - BAR - DAY

        At the bar, Johnny Stompanato looks over as Bud joins
        him.  Stompanato isn't happy about it, but he smiles
        anyway.

                                STOMPANATO
                  Wendell White, how's tricks,
                  paesano?

                                BUD
                  I ain't your paesano, you wop
                  cocksucker.

        Nervous, Johnny taps his pinkie ring on a bottle of beer.

                                STOMPANATO
                  What do you want, officer?

                                BUD
                  You remember an ex-cop named Buzz
                  Meeks?  He works for a guy named
                  Patchett.

        Johnny taps his ring harder.  The bottle almost tips.

                                STOMPANATO
                  Should I?

                                BUD
                  His file listed you as a known
                  associate.  Now spill.

                                STOMPANATO
                  Oh, yeah.  That was a long time
                  ago.  Before your day.  The last
                  few years he's been muscle for
                  hire.  But I heard he's
                  disappeared.

                                BUD
                  More.

                                STOMPANATO
                  More's gonna cost you.

        Bud's hand flashes out, grabs Stompanato by the crotch.

                                BUD
                  How 'bout I give you your balls
                  back?

                                STOMPANATO
                         (in considerable
                          pain)
                  Before Meeks disappeared he was
                  popping off about trying to move
                  eighteen pounds of heroin.

                                BUD
                  Bullshit.  Where would a two-bit
                  ex-cop get 18 pounds of heroin?

                                STOMPANATO
                  Deuce Perkins.  Mickey C's
                  narcotics lieutenant.  The night
                  he got clipped, eighteen pounds of
                  Mickey's heroin went missing.

        Bud loosens his grip.  Stompanato gasps for air.


        DOOR

        Jack peels in, catches a glimpse of Bud and Stompanato.
        Too far away too hear anything, Jack quickly ducks out.


        BAR

        Stompanato's recovering.

                                STOMPANATO
                  Meeks is probably in Rio or
                  someplace like that by now.

                                BUD
                  He's under a tract house in San
                  Berdoo.  And he don't smell too
                  good.  What happened to the
                  heroin, Johnny?

                                STOMPANATO
                  I don't know.  I swear it!

        Bud starts to raise a hand.  Stompanato cringes, but Bud
        just slaps a twenty down on the bar and goes.


        INT. BROWN DERBY - PHONE BOOTH - DAY

        Jack's on the phone to Exley.

                                JACK
                  He's in the Brown Derby with
                  Johnny Stompanato.
                         (sees Bud exit)
                  Check that.  I gotta go.


        EXT. 1736 NOTTINGHAM (LYNN BRACKEN'S) - DAY

        Jack pulls up, sees Bud knock on the front door.  It
        opens and Bud steps in.  Jack doesn't see who opens it.


        EXT. BUSHES - 1736 NOTTINGHAM (LYNN BRACKEN'S) - DAY

        LEAVES RUSTLE.  There's movement in the underbrush.  Jack
        appears, followed by Exley.  Jack pulls a gun as they
        near a window.

                                EXLEY
                  What's that for?

                                JACK
                  Bud White.  He sees us and we're
                  dead.

        They press up to the glass for a partial view.  Bud White
        sits on a footstool massaging a pair of women's feet.
        Jack and Exley exchange a long, curious look.  This isn't
        the Bud White they're used to.  A pair of woman's hands
        take Bud, the arms covered in glitter and satin.

        The woman, Lynn Bracken, leans forward to kiss her
        policeman.  It may have been a long day, but she's every
        inch Veronica Lake.  Only the hair's not over her eye.

        They stand, kiss again.  Lynn's gown spills down around
        her ankles.  Bud scoops Lynn into his arms and the two of
        them disappear into a bedroom.  A long beat before...

                                JACK
                  Jesus... Maybe White's not so dumb
                  after all.

                                EXLEY
                  Rita Hayworth at the morgue and
                  now Veronica Lake with White.
                  What the hell's going on?

                                JACK
                  Movie star hookers.  Whatever you
                  desire... It's Fleur-fr-Lis again.

                                EXLEY
                  What's Fleur-de-Lis?

                                JACK
                  High line whores.  With plastic
                  surgery to look like movie stars.
                  And who knows what else?  It's run
                  by this guy Pierce Patchett.  You
                  want to talk to him?

                                EXLEY
                  Yeah.  But first I want to brace
                  Stompanato.


        INT. BROWN DERBY - ENTRANCE - DAY

        Exley and Jack enter.

                                EXLEY
                  Check the bar.  I got the restaurant.


        RESTAURANT

        Exley scans.  There's Stompanato with a girl who looks
        amazingly like "LANA TURNER."

        Engrossed, Stomapanato doesn't look up till Exley's nearly
        on top of him.

                                STOMPANATO
                  Hey, you want an autograph, write
                  to M-G-M.

                                EXLEY
                  Since when do two-bit hoods and
                  hookers give out autographs?

                                STOMPANATO
                  What?

        As Stompanato stands, Exley flashes his badge.

                                EXLEY
                  L.A.P.D.  Sit down.

                                "LANA"
                  Who in the hell do you think you
                  are?

                                EXLEY
                  Take a walk, honey, before I haul
                  your ass downtown.

                                "LANA"
                  Who in the hell do you think
                  are?!

                                STOMPANATO
                  You are making a large mistake.

        As Jack arrives, Lana tosses a drink in Exley's face.

                                "LANA"
                  Get away from our table!

                                EXLEY
                         (grabs her wrist)
                  Shut up.  Being cut to look like
                  Lana Turner doesn't mean you are
                  Lana Turner.

        Jack pulls him aside.

                                JACK
                  She is Lana Turner.

                                EXLEY
                  What?

                                JACK
                  She is Lana Turner.


        INT. EXLEY'S PLYMOUTH - SUNSET

        Rolling.  The sky glows ahead.

                                EXLEY
                  How was I supposed to know?

        A moment before Jack begins to laugh.  Exley joins him.


        EXT. 1184 GRETNA GREEN (PIERCE PATCHETT'S) - NIGHT

        Exley's Plymouth is parked on the street.


        INT. 1184 GRETNA GREEN (PATCHETT'S) - LIBRARY - NIGHT

        In a silk robe, the unflappable Pierce Patchett smiles
        at Exley.  Jack stands alongside.

                                PATCHETT
                  I believe the Nite Owl's your area
                  of expertise, Mr. Exley.  I saw
                  you on television getting your
                  medal.
                         (turns to Jack)
                  And you're that other celebrity
                  Hollywood policeman, aren't you?

        A beat.  Exley and Jack don't look like they appreciate
        being joked with.  Patchett finally sighs.

                                PATCHETT
                  I'll tell you what I told Officer
                  White when he asked me about
                  Susan's death.

                                EXLEY
                         (a look to Jack)
                  Bud White's been here?

                                PATCHETT
                  For the last time.  I may suborn
                  women into illicit activities, but
                  they're handsomely compensated, I
                  treat them well and make sure the
                  men they deal with show them every
                  due respect.

                                EXLEY
                  Is the Veronica Lake look-alike
                  one of your whores?

                                PATCHETT
                  A vulgar term, but yes.

                                EXLEY
                  What's her name?

                                PATCHETT
                  Lynn Bracken.

                                EXLEY
                  Why's she seeing Bud White?

                                PATCHETT
                  Why do men and women usually see
                  each other?

                                EXLEY
                  Anything else you want to add
                  before I talk to her?

                                PATCHETT
                  No.

                                EXLEY
                  Not good enough.

                                PATCHETT
                         (unfazed)
                  Then try talking to my lawyer.
                  Good evening, gentlemen.


        EXT. 1184 GRETNA GREEN - NIGHT

        Exley and Jack head for the car.

                                JACK
                  Guy's as cool as they come.

        A call CRACKLES in over Exley's RADIO.  Exley picks up.

                                EXLEY
                  This is Exley.

                                DISPATCHER (V.O.)
                  Ray Pinker wants to talk to you,
                  Lieutenant.  Says he has your I.D.

                                EXLEY
                  Tell him Sergeant Vincennes is
                  coming in to talk to him.

                                JACK
                  What are you going to do?

                                EXLEY
                  I'm going to Lynn Bracken's.  I'll
                  meet you at the Dining Car.

                                JACK
                  Great.  You get the girl, I get
                  the coroner.


        INT. LIBRARY (1184 GRETNA GREEN) - NIGHT

        Watching Exley and Vincennes from the window, Patchett
        picks up the phone, dials.

                                HUDGEONS (V.O.)
                         (over phone)
                  Hush-Hush.  Off the record and on
                  the Q.T.


        INT. 1736 NOTTINGHAM (LYNN'S) - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

        KNOCKING on the door.  Lynn answers to reveal Exley.

                                EXLEY
                  Miss Bracken, I'm Lieutenant
                  Exley.

                                LYNN
                  I know who you are.  You're the
                  policeman Bud told me about.

                                EXLEY
                  Really?  What did White say?

                                LYNN
                  He said you were smart.  He also
                  said you were competing with your
                  dead father.  How did he put it?
                  Trying to measure up to a ghost.

        Exley lets it pass.  As he enters...

                                EXLEY
                  Let's concentrate on my smarts.
                  Pierce Patchett made you, didn't
                  he?  He taught you how to dress
                  and talk and think and I am very
                  impressed with the results.  But I
                  need some answers and if I don't
                  get them, I'm going to take you
                  and Patchett down.

                                LYNN
                  He can take care of himself and
                  I'm not afraid of you.  And you
                  forgot one thing, Lieutenant.
                  Pierce also taught me how to
                  fuck... Can I get you a drink?

        Exley can't help but smile.  Lynn smiles back.

                                EXLEY
                  Scotch.

        Exley watches her as she steps over to fix the drinks.

                                LYNN
                  I'm curious about you.

                                EXLEY
                  Why?

        She hands him his drink.

                                LYNN
                  Because Bud hates you more than he
                  loves me.

        Exley stews.  Lynn watches him over the rim of her glass.

                                LYNN
                  It galls you that I know so much
                  about you.  You don't have
                  information to compete.

                                EXLEY
                  Don't underestimate me, Miss
                  Bracken.

                                LYNN
                  The way you've underestimated Bud
                  White?

        Exley's had it.  A menacing step forward.  Lynn's smile
        becomes a laugh.  Lost to himself, Exley leans in and
        kisses her.  Lynn pulls back, then kisses back.  In a
        beat, they're rolling to the floor, shedding clothes.

        As they trash the furniture, Lynn looks over his shoulder
        at her own reflection in a closet door mirror.


        REVERSE ANGLE - INSIDE CLOSET

        Two-way glass.  Sid Hudgeons is in here SNAPPING
        pictures.  As Lynn and Exley continue with their frantic
        lovemaking...


        INT. FORENSIC LAB - NIGHT

        Ray Pinker rubs his tired eyes.

                                PINKER
                  God bless dental records.  Stiff
                  used to be a cop.  Turner Meeks.

                                JACK
                  Buzz Meeks?

                                PINKER
                  You knew him?

                                JACK
                  Of him.  He was around when I
                  first joined the force.  A bad
                  egg.

        Pinker could care less.  As Jack's wheels turn...


        INT. LAPD - RECORDS ROOM - NIGHT

        Jack searches dusty filing cabinets with dates like 1939
        and 1940.  Reading one headed "Meeks," Jack lets out a
        low whistle.  He's found something.


        INT. PACIFIC DINING CAR - NIGHT

        Jack waits at the bar, watches the door anxiously.

                                JACK
                  Come on, Exley.  Where are you?


        INT. 1736 NOTTINGHAM (LYNN'S) - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

        Spent, Exley and Lynn sit, half-dressed, on the floor.
        They're quiet.  Then, through a smile:

                                EXLEY
                  How was I?

                                LYNN
                  Oh, the best I ever had.
                  Absolutely the best.

                                EXLEY
                         (laughs)
                  You sound like you mean it.

                                LYNN
                  The silver screen's loss is your
                  gain.

                                EXLEY
                  How about White?

                                LYNN
                  You want to know what Bud's like
                  in bed?

        She actually embarrasses him with that one.

                                EXLEY
                  I want to know why you see him.
                  Is it a Patchett payoff?

                                LYNN
                  I see Bud because I want to.  I
                  see Bud because he can't hide the
                  warmth he has inside him.

                                EXLEY
                  I'll take your word for it.

                                LYNN
                  I see Bud because he makes me feel
                  like Lynn Bracken and not some
                  Veronica Lake look-alike who fucks
                  for money.  I see him because he
                  doesn't know how to disguise who
                  he is.  There's more if you want
                  to hear it.

        Exley shakes his head.  He's heard enough.

                                LYNN
                  Does all that make it harder for
                  you to hate him or easier?

                                EXLEY
                  I don't hate White.  I really
                  don't.  It's just, in my business,
                  it's the wild cars you have to
                  watch out for.

                                LYNN
                  You don't like that you don't know
                  how to play him.  He doesn't
                  follow the same rules of politics
                  you do.  That makes him dangerous.

                                EXLEY
                  You cut to the heart of things,
                  don't you?  What about Lynn
                  Bracken?  She going to be a hooker
                  all her life?

                                LYNN
                  I came out here with a dream.
                  That's gone, but I settled for
                  reality.

                                EXLEY
                  Some reality.

                                LYNN
                  No.  This is the means to the
                  reality.  But I'm not going to
                  tell you what it is.

                                EXLEY
                  Why not?

                                LYNN
                  Because you'll use it against me.
                  Won't you?

        Exley doesn't answer, but the answer is yes.  Lynn
        smiles.

                                LYNN
                  You're tougher than Bud thinks you
                  are.

                                EXLEY
                         (smiles)
                  You're the first person to ever
                  call me tough.

                                LYNN
                  Like recognizes like.  I'm pretty
                  tough, myself.

                                EXLEY
                  You, me and White, huh?

                                LYNN
                  Actually, Bud's only tough on the
                  outside.

        As Exley kisses her...


        IN CLOSET

        Exasperated that he's still stuck in here, Sid Hudgeons
        checks his watch, shakes his head in disgust.


        EXT. 9608 VENDOME (SILVERLAKE) - NIGHT

        Jack knocks at a darkened house.  The porch lights come
        on.  The door opens to reveal Dudley Smith in his
        bathrobe.

                                DUDLEY
                  John Vincennes.  It's three A.M.,
                  lad.

                                JACK
                  Two minutes, Dudley.  It's
                  important.

                                DUDLEY
                  Lucky for you that my wife and
                  four fair daughters are at the
                  beach in Santa Barbara.


        INT. 9608 VENDOME - KITCHEN - NIGHT

        Jack sits at the table while Dudley makes coffee.

                                JACK
                  You remember Buzz Meeks, Dudley?

                                DUDLEY
                  A disgrace as a policeman.
                  Straight D fitness reports from
                  every C.O. he ever served under.
                  What about him?

                                JACK
                  Twelve years ago he worked a vice
                  roust with Dick Stensland.  They
                  arrested a Pierce Patchett on an
                  extortion scam.  Guy ran hookers.
                  He'd have them photographed with
                  their johns, then double-dip for
                  some blackmail.  Charges got
                  dropped.  Insufficient evidence.
                  You were supervising officer on
                  the case and I was wondering if
                  you remember anything about it.

                                DUDLEY
                  What's this all about, lad?

                                JACK
                  Part of it has to do with a
                  murder.  I've been working with Ed
                  Exley on it.

                                DUDLEY
                  You're Narco, lad, not Homicide.
                  And since when do you work with
                  Edmund?

                                JACK
                  It's a private investigation.  I
                  fucked something up and I want to
                  make amends.

                                DUDLEY
                         (smiles, then...)
                  Don't start trying to do the right
                  thing, John.  You haven't had
                  enough practice.

        Dudley walks over, hands Jack his coffee.

                                DUDLEY
                  Have you discussed this with
                  anyone else, John?

                                JACK
                  No.

                                DUDLEY
                  Not even with Exley?

        Jack shakes his head.  Dudley raises a REVOLVER.  He
        FIRES it at point-blank range, right into Jack's heart.
        Jack hits the floor, his cheek pressed flat on the
        linoleum.

        Jack opens his mouth to speak.  His lips form the words,
        but no sound comes out.  Dudley crouches down beside him.

                                JACK
                  Have you a valediction, lad?

        Dudley leans low, gives Jack an ear.  As he dies...

                                JACK
                  Rollo Tomasi...

        Dudley frowns in ignorance at the name.


        INT. LAPD HEADQUARTERS - BRIEFING ROOM - DAY

        Nothing mobilizes the police like losing one of their
        own.  Dudley is at the podium along with Exley.  Dozens
        of detectives take notes, including Bud White.

                                DUDLEY
                  Sergeant Vincennes' body was found
                  in Echo Park at ten o'clock this
                  morning.  Killed by a single .38
                  round to the heart.  One of our
                  own, gentlemen.  We cannot
                  tolerate it.  Justice must be
                  swift and merciless.  That's all.

        As the men move odd, Dudley approaches Exley.

                                DUDLEY
                  Edmund, a word with you.  We
                  received a tip this morning.  Did
                  Vincennes ever mention the name
                  Rollo Tomasi?

        Exley tries to look like he's thinking as Jack calls from
        the grave.  Screaming the name Dudley!

                                EXLEY
                  No... Where'd the tip come from?

                                DUDLEY
                  Anonymous.  Probably nothing.

        As Dudley moves off, Exley watches him go.  Scared.


        INT. LAPD HEADQUARTERS - BUD WHITE'S DESK - DAY

        Bud looks over as Dudley sits down across from him.

                                DUDLEY
                  You're perplexing to me these
                  days, Wendell.  You're not your
                  old, cruel self anymore.  I need
                  proof that the extracurricular
                  work I had planned for you remains
                  within your grasp.

                                BUD
                  What work?

                                DUDLEY
                  I've long been involved in
                  containing hard crime in such a
                  way that myself and a few
                  colleagues might someday enjoy a
                  profit dispensation.  That day
                  will soon be here and you'll share
                  handsomely.  Grand means will be
                  in our hands, Wendell.
                                (MORE)

                                DUDLEY (CONT'D)
                  Imagine crime limited to the
                  criminal element who perpetrate
                  it. Imagine the means to keep the
                  nigger filth sedated.  But don't
                  stop there.  Extrapolate.  Imagine
                  the police in control.  It's big,
                  lad.

                                BUD
                  You lost me, Dudley.  I don't know
                  what you're talking about.

                                DUDLEY
                  You have your extracurricular
                  secrets, I have mine.  We'll hold
                  a clarification session soon.  For
                  now, I need your fearsome old
                  habits at the Victory Motel.
                  We're going to brace a man who may
                  know who killed Jack Vincennes.
                  Can I count on you?

                                BUD
                  Sure, boss.  Sure you can.


        INT. FORENSICS LAB - DAY

        Pinker looks up as Exley enters.

                                EXLEY
                  I want to know what you and Jack
                  Vincennes talked about last night.
                  Anything and everything.  Start
                  with the I.D. on the corpse.

        A put-upon Pinker sighs.

                                PINKER
                  An ex-cop.  Buzz Meeks.  I pulled
                  his police academy photo.

        Pinker goes to his desk for a twenty-year-old photo of
        Meeks.  he hands it to Exley, whose wheels are turning.

                                EXLEY
                  We got a dead ex-cop and a girl
                  who looks like Rita Hayworth at
                  the Nite Owl.  Another dead ex-cop
                  under the house of Rita's mother.
                  It's not a good week for ex-cops.

                                PINKER
                  I got Vincennes in the next room.
                  It's not a good week for cops in
                  general.


        EXT. VICTORY MOTEL - DAY

        A RAIN STORM has turned the courtyard into a mud bath.
        As usual, a light burns in room six.  Bud White parks
        alongside the other cars already here.  He makes a dash
        for the door.


        INT. VICTORY MOTEL - ROOM SIX - DAY

        Sid Hudgeons is cuffed to the hot seat.  Dudley sits
        across from him.  Dudley's henchman Breuning looms.  Bud
        enters.

                                DUDLEY
                  This is Mr. Hudgeons, Wendell.

                                HUDGEONS
                  I'm happy to cooperate.  You don't
                  need to tie me down.

                                DUDLEY
                  It's for your own safety.  Now
                  what can you tell us about
                  Sergeant John Vincennes?

                                HUDGEONS
                  Trashcan Jack.  The Big V.  I can
                  tell you he's on the Night Train
                  to the big adios.

        Breuning cuffs Hudgeons in the side of the head.

                                HUDGEONS
                  Take it easy!  I didn't have
                  anything to do with him getting
                  killed if that's what you mean.

                                DUDLEY
                  But you were business associates?

                                HUDGEONS
                  What does that have to do --

        Breuning cuffs him again.

                                HUDGEONS
                  Okay so we worked together.  It
                  was an information exchange.  I
                  got him first class collars and he
                  got me good stories.  We were
                  friends for Chrissakes!

                                DUDLEY
                  Alright.  We'll drop that line for
                  now.  Next topic.  Please comment
                  on Pierce Patchett.

        Bud looks over at mention of the name.

                                HUDGEONS
                  You think he had something to do
                  with Vincennes getting iced?

        Dudley sighs, looks to Bud.

                                DUDLEY
                  Wendell.  I want full and docile
                  cooperation on all topics.

        Hudgeons flinches as Bud steps up, twice Breuning's size.

                                HUDGEONS
                  Okay.  Okay.  Everyone knows
                  Patchett's worth a boat-load of
                  greenbacks.  From aviation,
                  freeway construction.  But the man
                  has hobbies, too.  He bankrolls B
                  movies under the table and runs
                  movie star look-alike hookers.
                  And try this on:  he's rumored to
                  be a periodic heroin sniffer.  All
                  in all a powerful behind-the-
                  scenes strange-o.

                                DUDLEY
                  And?

                                HUDGEONS
                  And what?

        Bud digs a fist into Hudgeons' gut.  As Hudgeons gasps to
        get his breath back.

                                DUDLEY
                  Reciprocity, Mr. Hudgeons, is the
                  key to all relationships.

                                HUDGEONS
                  He runs call girls.  Primo tail.
                  Fixed up like movie stars.

        Bud looms, rests his hands on the back of Hudgeons'
        chair.  He doesn't like where this is going.

                                DUDLEY
                  And?

                                HUDGEONS
                  In my car.  Blackmail shit.  The
                  trunk under the carpet.  Patchett
                  got me to photograph a cop fucking
                  this gorgeous cunt Lynn, looks
                  just like Veronicaaa --

        Wooden slats pop as Bud tears the bolted chair right out
        of the floor.  Hudgeons and the chair land sideways.

                                DUDLEY
                  Wendell!

        Bud can't hear him.  He uprights the chair one-handed.
        As his fist cocks back, he's restrained by Breuning and
        Dudley.  This is no act.  They can barely hold Bud back.

                                HUDGEONS
                  Get him away from me!

        Bud breaks free, heads outside.


        EXT. VICTORY MOTEL - HUDGEONS' CAR - DAY

        Bud jams a tire iron into the trunk seam and pops it with
        a ferocious yank.  He tears at the carpeting.  A manila
        envelope.  Bud rips it open and 8x10 glossies of Exley
        and Lynn spill out.  Raindrops dot them, as Bud's in his
        Packard and tearing out of there.


        INT. VICTORY MOTEL - ROOM 6 - DAY

        Dudley and Breuning watch from the door.

                                DUDLEY
                  I wouldn't trade places with
                  Edmund Exley right now for all the
                  tea in China.

        Breuning laughs.  So does Hudgeons.

                                HUDGEONS
                  Dudley, I thought you were gonna
                  let the dumb bastard kill me.
                         (to Breuning)
                  And you!  Learn to pull those
                  punches a little better.

        Dudley and Breuning stare at him.  A bit grimly.

                                HUDGEONS
                  You can uncuff me now, fellas.

        But no one moves to do so.

                                HUDGEONS
                  Fellas?
                         (nervous)
                  We had a deal.  You, me and
                  Patchett,  We're a team!
                         (scared)
                  Come on, we're friends.  We're --

        As Hudgeons protests, Dudley slaps a hand over his mouth.

                                DUDLEY
                  Hush-hush...

        As Breuning and Carlisle move in...


        INT. RECORDS ROOM - LAPD - DAY

        A wormish CLERK searches dusty filing cabinets with dates
        like 1939 and 1940.  The same ones Jack looked through.
        Exley steps over from another row.

                                EXLEY
                  Anything?

                                CLERK
                  Nothing.

                                EXLEY
                  So on active duty, Meeks didn't
                  make an arrest from 1938 to '43.

                                CLERK
                  Someone must've pulled the
                  records.

        Exley ponders the implications.  Taking out the photo of
        Meeks, he gets an idea.

                                EXLEY
                  Where are the police academy
                  files?

                                CLERK
                  I don't have time.  I have --

                                EXLEY
                  Just show me where they are!


        EXT. 1736 NOTTINGHAM (LYNN BRACKEN'S) - DAY

        Blue, Lynn sits on her porch watching the rain come down.
        A SCREECHING on the wet street as Bud's PACKARD pulls up.
        She watches as he gets out and starts for the house.
        Lynn stands, holds her arms out.  Bud stops short on the
        steps, out of reach, the rain soaking him.

                                BUD
                  Did you talk to Exley?

                                LYNN
                  Come in out of the rain.  In the
                  morning we'll have both our
                  stories for breakfast.

        Lightning flashes.  Bud shakes hs head.

                                BUD
                  I want to know about Exley.

                                LYNN
                  He's the opposite of you.  He's
                  more like me.  Cold, calculating.

                                BUD
                  How'd you get to know so much
                  about him?

        More lightning.  Lynn looks God-awful sad.

                                LYNN
                  Come in out of the rain, Bud.

                                BUD
                  You gonna tell me what happened
                  with you and Exley?

                                LYNN
                  We talked.

                                BUD
                  So tell me about it.

                                LYNN
                         (looking away)
                  In the morning.

                                BUD
                  No.  Now.
                         (a beat)
                  You fucked him.

        Too tired to lie anymore, Lynn finally just nods.

                                LYNN
                  I thought I was helping you.  I
                  thought --

        Bud backhands her, hard.  Lynn faces straight into the
        next one as Bud hits her again.  A third time as the sins
        of the father are visited on the son.  Bud stops short as
        the self-realization slams home.  Lynn waits stoically.
        She doesn't start crying till Bud turns and runs back
        into the rain.


        INT. RECORDS ROOM - LAPD - DAY

        Drawers are open.  Files are everywhere.  Exley's reached
        the end of the line.  As he looks through one last file,
        he finds a stack of official photos.  Then he stops
        short.  There's a photo of four cadets and an academy
        instructor.

        Two of the cadets are IDed as Turner Meeks and Dick
        Stensland.  The instructor is Dudley Smith!

        Exley looks up at the sound of FOOTSTEPS and Bud is
        there.  Fury.  He slams Exley, knocks him flat.

        Bud's here to kill him.  He hauls Exley up, pummels him,
        then throws him over the table.  Then up into a wall.
        Plaster cracks.  Bud's on some gonzo animal plane.  Bud
        strangles him.  Exley gags.  It'll be over in moments.

        Until Exley's flailing hands finds Bud's .38.  Yanking it
        from his waistband, Exley smashes Bud in the forehead.
        Bud reels.  But, blind with rage, he moves back in only
        to have the barrel of the .38 placed right between his
        eyes.

                                EXLEY
                  Why?

                                BUD
                  Lynn.

                                EXLEY
                  She told you?

        Bud shakes his head.  He's coiled, ready to make a move.

                                EXLEY
                  Who told you?  Did Dudley have
                  anything to do with you finding
                  out?

        Bud hesitates, the answer obvious.

                                EXLEY
                  Listen to me.  Dudley killed Jack.
                  It has something to do with Buzz
                  Meeks.

        Exley points out the academy photo on the floor.

                                EXLEY
                  Look.  Dudley and Meeks go way
                  back.  Stensland, too.

        Bud sees, but does he really?  As Bud reaches for the
        photo, Exley relaxes slightly.  Bud slaps the gun away,
        drops Exley to the ground.  He grabs, begins slamming his
        head into the floor.

                                EXLEY
                  Think, goddamn you.  Think...

        Exley's almost out.  But maybe Bud heard him.  The attack
        slows, stops as Bud does think.  Exley stays conscious.

                                BUD
                  I knew Stensland and Meeks knew
                  each other.  Meeks was with Sue
                  Lefferts on Christmas Eve.  The
                  night I met Lynn.  Lefferts'
                  mother I.D.ed Stensland as
                  Lefferts' boyfriend, but Stens
                  pretended he didn't know either
                  one of them.

                                EXLEY
                  Stensland and Meeks.  What were
                  they up to?

                                BUD
                  Johnny Stompanato told me when
                  Meeks disappeared, he was trying
                  to move the 18 pounds of heroin
                  that went missing when Deuce
                  Perkins was shot.

                                EXLEY
                  Stensland and Buzz Meeks.  Two-man
                  triggers knocking off Mickey Cohen
                  lieutenants.  When they killed
                  Deuce Perkins, they got heroin as
                  a bonus.

                                BUD
                  Then something goes wrong.  Meeks
                  gets killed.  Maybe Stens got
                  greedy, killed Meeks and left him
                  under his girlfriend's house.
                         (a beat)
                  The night he died, Stens was all
                  mysterious.  Said he had something
                  big going down.

                                EXLEY
                  The Nite Owl!  Stensland was going
                  there to sell the heroin.

                                BUD
                  Somebody got wind of it, killed
                  them all.

                                EXLEY
                  It wasn't the Negroes.  The Griffith
                  Park report was a phony. And, who
                  says the purple Merc was spotted
                  outside the Nite Owl?

                                BUD
                  Dudley.

                                EXLEY
                  The first guys to the car when
                  Jack and I got there were Bruening
                  and Carlisle.

                                BUD
                  Dudley's guys.

                                EXLEY
                  They didn't find the shotguns.
                  They planted them.

                                BUD
                  It all keeps coming back to
                  Dudley.

                                EXLEY
                  It's Dudley for the Nite Owl.

        They just stare at each other a beat as it sinks in.

                                EXLEY
                  Pierce Patchett figures in, too.
                  That's the angle Jack was working.
                  Dudley must work for Patchett.

                                BUD
                  Let's just kill them.

                                EXLEY
                  What?

                                BUD
                  For Jack, for Stensland, for
                  anybody else who got in the way.
                  I've been trying to be smart.  A
                  detective.  But killing those two
                  fuckers, that would be justice.

                                EXLEY
                  Stay smart, Bud.  We build a case.
                  We play by the rules.

                                BUD
                  There are no rules!  Why the fuck
                  are you doing this?  The Nite Owl
                  made you.  You want to tear all
                  that down.

                                EXLEY
                  With a wrecking ball.  You want to
                  help me swing it?

        Bud smiles.  For a second he likes Exley.

                                EXLEY
                  Let's go see Pierce Patchett.  Run
                  a good-cop-bad-cop.

                                BUD
                  Which one are you and which one am
                  I?

        EXT. 1184 GRETNA GREEN (PIERCE PATCHETT'S) - DAY

        Exley and Bud make their way up the walk.  Bud pulls his
        .38 from its shoulder holster, shoves it in his
        waistband.

                                EXLEY
                  You expecting problems?

                                BUD
                  Patchett uses a lot of ex-cop
                  muscle.


        FRONT DOOR

        Exley RINGS the BUZZER.  Looking back, Bud sees a
        pitching wedge and pile of golf balls abandoned in the
        grass.  A single ball floats in the koi pond.  Bud's eyes
        narrow at the sight.  Not like Patchett at all.

                                BUD
                  Come on.

        And Bud shoulders the heavy door right off its hinges.


        INT. 1184 GRETNA GREEN - HALLWAY - DAY

        Bud draws his .38 as he strides in.  Exley tries to keep up.

                                EXLEY
                         (a screaming
                          whisper)
                  What?

        Double doors on the left open into a library.  Bud stops
        short, slowly lowers his gun.  Exley steps up beside him.


        LIBRARY

        Hanging from a ceiling light, Patchett's body slowly
        twists around, a toppled chair beneath him.

                                EXLEY
                  I don't think his ex-cop did him
                  much good.

        Bud goes to the body while Exley heads for a side table
        on which rests a typed sheet of paper.

        Bud checks Patchett's right hand, the knuckles are split,
        two of the fingers badly distended.

                                EXLEY
                  It's a suicide note.  Says he
                  killed Jack because Jack had
                  figured out a pornography scam
                  Patchett was running.

                                BUD
                  He had help getting up there.  Two
                  of his fingers are broken.

                                EXLEY
                  We had one thing figured wrong.  I
                  don't think Dudley workd for
                  Patchett.

                                BUD
                  At least not anymore.

                                EXLEY
                  Patchett's dead.  He sent you
                  after me.  I'd say Dudley's tying
                  up his loose ends.

                                BUD
                         (it hits him)
                  Lynn.

        Bud dashes to the PHONE, dials.  It RINGS.  No one
        answers.

                                EXLEY
                  I got a guy who owes me in the
                  Sheriff's department.  West
                  Hollywood station.  He can be at
                  her house in two minutes.

        Bud shoves the phone into his hand.

                                BUD
                  Call him.


        EXT. 1736 NOTTINGHAM (LYNN BRACKEN'S) - DAY

        A county sheriff's unmarked parked out front.  A DEPUTY
        behind the wheel.  Exley's Plymouth pulls up behind.  The
        Deputy gets out.  MOVE WITH him as he steps BACK TO
        Exley, who's rolling down his window.

                                EXLEY
                  Is she inside?

                                DEPUTY
                  We took her to Hollywood Station
                  for safekeeping.  Someone worked
                  her over pretty good.  She
                  wouldn't say who.

        Exley looks at Bud.  Bud looks down in shame.

                                EXLEY
                  Hold her as Joan Smith.  No one
                  sees her unless I okay it.

                                DEPUTY
                  You got it, Exley.  And now we're
                  even.

        As the Deputy moves off.

                                EXLEY
                  Ellis Loew.

                                BUD
                  What about him?

                                EXLEY
                  Jack thought he was up to his neck
                  in all this.

        INT. DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OUTER OFFICE - DAY

        A SECRETARY looks up as Bud and Exley beeline Loew's
        door.

                                SECRETARY
                  You can't go in there!


        INNER OFFICE

        Loew looks up as they burst in.

                                SECRETARY
                  Do you want me to call the police,
                  Mr. Loew?

                                EXLEY
                  Ask for Captain Dudley Smith.
                  We'll have a party.  Hot dogs and
                  sauerkraut.

        A beat as Loew considers his options.

                                LOEW
                  It's okay.  These are police.
                         (as she leaves)
                  What do you want?

                                EXLEY
                  I want D.A. bureau men to tail
                  Dudley Smith twenty-four hours a
                  day; I want you to get a judge to
                  authorize a wire tap on his home
                  phone; I want authorization to
                  check his bank records and I want
                  it all in an hour.

                                LOEW
                  On what evidence?

                                EXLEY
                  None.  Call it a hunch.

                                LOEW
                         (incredulous)
                  Absolutely not.  Dudley Smith is a
                  highly decorated member of this
                  city's police department and I
                  won't smear his name without --

                                EXLEY
                  Without what, his smearing yours
                  first?  What's he got on you,
                  Loew?  Pictures of you and an out
                  of work actor with your pants
                  down?

                                LOEW
                  Do you have any proof?

                                EXLEY
                  The proof had his throat slit.
                         (a beat)
                  So far you're not denying it.

                                LOEW
                  I'm not going to dignify youwith
                  answers.  If you'll excuse me,
                  I've got a Jack Vincennes press
                  conference to prepare for.

        Loew enters his bathroom.  Bud looks to Exley who nods:
        Go.


        OFFICE BATHROOM

        Loew is at the mirror clipping a few stray nose hairs.
        Bud enters full of menace followed by Exley.

                                LOEW
                  Unless you're here to wipe my ass,
                  I think we're through.

        Bud just glares at him.  Loew shakes his head.

                                LOEW
                  Don't try this good cop/bad cop
                  with me.  I practically
                  invented it.  And so what if some
                  homo actor is dead.  Boys, girls,
                  ten of them step off the bus to
                  L.A. every day.

        The MIRROR SPIDERWEBS as Bud slams Loew's face into it.
        Bud swings him around, forces him forward and shoves his
        head in the toilet.

        He holds it there, finally lets Loew up for breath.  Then        
        backhands:  one, two, three.

                                BUD
                  Dudley Smith.  Spill.

                                LOEW
                  Call him off, Exley!

                                EXLEY
                  I don't know how.

        More backhands.  Holding Loew by the scruff of the neck,
        Bud marches him past Exley and back into the...


        INNER OFFICE

        Bud heaves up the window, practically throws Loew through
        it.  Loew catches hold of the window framing.  Bud
        hammers his hands loose with a fist and pushes him
        through.


        OUTSIDE

        Bud holds his leg.  Loew screams as coins, comb and
        wallet spill from his pockets, plummet toward the street
        below.


        INNER OFFICE

        Bud shakes Loew, could drop him at any time.

                                EXLEY
                  Bud...

                                BUD
                  If I let you go, there'll be ten
                  more lawyers to take your place
                  tomorrow.  They just won't come on
                  the bus, that's all.


        OUTSIDE

        We hear Loew's PANT LEG TEARING loose.

                                LOEW
                  Okay!  You're right!  Dudley's got
                  photos of me and Reynolds.

                                EXLEY
                  What's Dudley's scheme?

        More TEARING.  Loew's life may depend on the answer.

                                LOEW
                  Dudley's rotten to the core.  He's
                  taking over Mickey Cohen's
                  rackets, his own hand-picked
                  cops'll be the new franchise
                  holders.  Because of those
                  pictures I won't be able to
                  prosecute.  Oh Jesus pull me up!


        INNER OFFICE

        Exley helps pull Loew back inside.  Bud dumps him on the
        floor.  Bruised and bloodied, Loew looks up at Exley.

                                LOEW
                  Dudley's got everyone under his
                  thumb.  Not just me, but the Chief
                  of Police, the lieutenant
                  governor, everybody!

        Exley pulls his .38, shoves it into the side of Loew's
        neck.

                                EXLEY
                  Not everybody.  You tip-off Dudley
                  and Officer White visits you alone
                  next time.

        Loew looks at Bud, nods, his face a bloody mess.


        EXT. CITY OFFICE BUILDING - DAY

        Exley and Bud exit.  Bud's wheels are turning.

                                BUD
                  They never made a match on the
                  shotgun serial numbers.  What if
                  Breuning and Carlisle took them
                  from the evidence room?  Couple of
                  cold pieces that had been hanging
                  around a year or two.

                                EXLEY
                  We should check the records, and,
                  we should talk to Lynn.

        Bud just stares at him a beat.

                                EXLEY
                  You want to talk to her?

        Bud looks away, shakes his head "no."  Finally...

                                BUD
                  You do it.  I'll check the files.


        INT. SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT - HOLDING ROOM - DAY

        Lynn looks up as Exley enters.  her face is puffy,
        swollen.

                                LYNN
                         (dry)
                  If I knew you were coming I'd have
                  baked a cake.

                                EXLEY
                  Forget everything else for a
                  second, Lynn.  Is there anything
                  you can give me on Dudley Smith?

        A blank look from her.

                                EXLEY
                  A police captain.  I think he's
                  behind all of this.

                                LYNN
                         (shakes her head)
                  I work for Patchett.  I had a
                  feeling that there was someone
                  else, but I never knew who.

                                EXLEY
                  Okay.  Look, if it helps, Bud
                  hates himself for what he did.

                                LYNN
                         (a beat)
                  I know how he feels.

        A beat as Exley wonders how he should interpret this.

                                EXLEY
                  I don't know if it's pathetic or
                  romantic, but when this is all
                  over I'd like to see you again.

        Lynn looks away, can't help an ironic smile even as she
        starts to cry.  As Exley gives her his handkerchief...


        INT. LAPD - EVIDENCE ROOM - NIGHT

        Bud waits at the cage window as a RECORDER returns with
        some information.

                                RECORDER
                  I got your guns, Bud.  Signed in
                  April 3rd, 1950.  Remember the
                  First Western bank robbery?  They
                  were used in that.

                                BUD
                  I want to see them.

                                RECORDER
                  No can do.  I can't find them.

        As Bud thinks, a ROOKIE-TYPE approaches.

                                ROOKIE-TYPE
                  Uh -- Sergeant White?

                                BUD
                  What?

                                ROOKIE-TYPE
                  Dispatch just got a call for you.
                  Lieutenant Exley wants you to meet
                  him at the Victory Motel.


        EXT. VICTORY MOTEL - SUNSET

        Bud's Packard crests the rise looking down on the
        Victory.  Exley's Plymouth is in the courtyard.


        INT. VICTORY MOTEL - ROOM 6 - SUNSET

        Exley in the hotseat.  Sitting there thinking.  At a CAR
        DOOR CLOSING, he goes to the door.


        ANOTHER ANGLE

        Exley opens the door as Bud approaches, toting a shotgun.
        The sun is down.  The sky is just a dull glow.

                                BUD
                  You wanted to meet here?

                                EXLEY
                  Me?  You called it.  I got a
                  message that...

        As the reality sinks in, Bud and Exley hear TIRES on the
        GRAVEL; CARS are COMING.  Being in a concavity, they
        don't see them yet.  Then the CARS STOP.   But still Bud
        and Exley can't see anything.  They hear the CLICKS of
        CAR DOORS OPENING, but they don't hear them shut.  There
        are FOOTSTEPS, MURMURED WHISPERS.  More CARS PULL UP.

                                EXLEY
                  Shit... Come on.

        Exley starts for his car, but Bud holds him back.

                                BUD
                  Too late.

        A beat.  Resigned, Exley nods.  They retreat back to Room
        6, disappear inside.  A beat.  There's MOVEMENT in the
        shadows to the left.  To the right.


        INT. VICTORY MOTEL - ROOM 6 - NIGHT

        There's a big back window.  Bud covers most of it with a
        ratty old mattress.  He pumps the shotgun.

        He pulls a .45 automatic from his waistband.

                                BUD
                  Here.

        He throws the auto to Exley, pulls out a .38.  Bud's
        armed for bear.

                                EXLEY
                  You figured this was a set-up?
                  And you showed up anyway?

                                BUD
                  A lot of bad stuff happened here.
                  It's as good a place as any for it
                  to end.

        Bud switches off the light.  They wait in silence.  Then:

                                EXLEY
                  You know, all I ever wanted was to
                  measure up to my father.

                                BUD
                         (softly)
                  I spent years trying not to live
                  down to mine.
                                (MORE)

                                BUD (CONT'D)
                         (thinking)
                  We should block off the bathroom.
                  They could come through --

        A CREAK outside the front door.  Bud levels the SHOTGUN.
        BOOM!  The DOOR is BLOWN OFF ITS HINGES.  We see the
        figure of a man sprawl back in the dirt.  In the darkness
        beyond, MUZZLE FLASHES from all around.  Exley and Bud
        RETURN FIRE.

        We hear the BACK WINDOW BREAK under a MUFFLED BLOW.  Bud
        charges back, yanks down the mattress revealing two men
        climbing through.  Sitting ducks:  torn apart by THREE
        TRIPLE-AUGHT ROUNDS close in.  A beat, then...

                                EXLEY
                  We got him!

        Bud smiles, in on the plan as theres an answering WHOOP.
        A third man looks through the window.  BOOM!  Bud nails
        him.

        Bud motions Exley to stay put, then slips out the window.


        EXT. VICTORY MOTEL - NIGHT

        Bud crouches, looks between the cinder blocks supporting
        the room.  Two sets of feet shuffling along.  Bud FIRES
        the SHOTGUN.  Shrieks as the men go down.  Bud extends
        the .38 to fire point blank headshots.  Then...

        Bud flattens himself as a wicked CROSSFIRE TEARS UP ROOM
        6.


        INT. VICTORY MOTEL - NIGHT

        Exley is forced down as well, lying flat as plaster rains
        down.

        The door frame splinters as more Dudley men charge in.
        Four men with rifles.  One is Patchett's Burly Bodyguard.
        They spot Exley lying there.  Hushed whispers as they
        approach:  "Dead meat."  "Be careful."  Kicks in the
        side.  The men look at each other, sneer.

        Exley jerks a foot.  The foot man stumbles as Exley spins
        around SHOOTING.  FIRING the .45 and his own .38.  All
        four men go down.  Exley stands, digs into his pocket to
        reload.

        Bud scrambles back through the window.  Exley looks over
        and smiles as Bud reloads the shotgun.  It's dead quiet.

                                EXLEY
                  I'm thinking we might walk away
                  from this.

        At that instant, Dudley steps through the bathroom door.
        He's got Exley dead to rights.  As he squeezes the
        trigger, Bud leaps forward, pushes Exley hard to the
        ground.

        The SHOT passes through Bud's back by his left shoulder
        blade.  It spins him around.  A SECOND SHOT to the
        stomach slows him to a walk as he charges Dudley.  A
        THIRD ROUND SHATTERS Bud's jaw, but still he comes.
        Driven by rage, his hands reaching for Dudley's throat.
        He even gets hold before a FOURTH SLUG tears his chest.

        Bud falls hard.

        Dudley swings his aim to Exley who's just managed to
        shake the cobwebs of being flattened by Bud.  A frozen
        moment.

                                DUDLEY
                  I'm loathe to kill my brother
                  officers, Edmund.

                                EXLEY
                  Tell that to Jack Vincennes.  To
                  Stensland.

                                DUDLEY
                  Jack was a shame, but Dick
                  Stensland had the audacity to try
                  to sell me my own heroin.  Through
                  his whore girl friend.  I sent him
                  to make the buy.  The rest is
                  history.

                                EXLEY
                  Why?

                                DUDLEY
                  A vacuum, Edmund.  That's what we
                  have in Los Angeles.  Sending
                  Mickey Cohen up created it.  My
                  containment work maintained it.
                  Certain photographs guarantee it.
                  Organized crime has been held
                  back, but there's still a demand
                  for the services it provides.

                                EXLEY
                  And now you'll provide them.

                                DUDLEY
                  Absolutely.  Prostitution and
                  gambling are victimless crimes.
                  The heroin we'll run down to the
                  coloreds.  Anesthetize them.  As
                  long as it's not a middle class
                  problem, no one will care.  It's
                  still a crime free city... for
                  respectable people.

        Dudley aims the .38, cocks back the hammer.  We hear
        DISTANT POLICE SIRENS.

                                DUDLEY
                  This isn't politics, Edmund.
                  There won't be winners and losers
                  when it's over...

        Dudley doesn't see Bud stir, reach into a pocket.

                                DUDLEY
                  Just the living and the dead.
                  It's always been that way in the
                  Bureau.  You should've realized
                  that before you became a
                  detective.

        It's over.  Dudley's finger tightens on the trigger.  But
        Dudley screams as Bud buries a switchblade into his left
        calf.  It took all Bud had left.  As he collapses...

        Dudley wails; Exley dives for Bud's shotgun.  Dudley
        FIRES, misses.  A wild SHOTGUN BLAST takes out half the
        wall.  Dudley stumbles out the door.  SIRENS BLARE.


        EXT. VICTORY MOTEL - NIGHT

        Dudley drops his gun as the cruisers stream down.  Exley
        steps out behind him, but doesn't drop the shotgun.  The
        two of them are bleached white by headlights.

        Dudley raises his badge over his head.

                                DUDLEY
                  We're policemen!
                         (winks)
                  Let me do the talking.  They'll
                  make you Chief of Detectives.

        Exley steps ahead to block his way.

                                EXLEY
                  No.

                                DUDLEY
                  Why not, lad?  Absolute justice?

                                EXLEY
                  Something like that.

                                DUDLEY
                  Really?  Would you be willing to
                  rig crime scene evidence to
                  support a prosecuting attorney's
                  working hypothesis?

        Exley doesn't answer.  Dudley smiles.

                                DUDLEY
                  Would you be willing to beat
                  confessions out of suspects you
                  knew to be guilty?

        Exley glares.  Laughing, Dudley brushes by, limps toward
        the gathering policemen.

                                DUDLEY
                  Are you willing to shoot hardened
                  criminals in the back to offset
                  the chance they'll --

        The SHOTGUN BELCHES flame.  Dudley goes down, shot in the
        back.  Exley drops the gun, raises his hands over his
        head.

                                                   DISSOLVE TO:

        Bloody, exhausted, Exley sits across from two INTERNAL

                  You have a lot of explaining to
                  do, Lieutenant.

                                EXLEY
                  Yes.  I do.

        As Exley begins...

                                EXLEY
                  That's it.  That's the whole
                  story.

        As Exley looks to the gray-tinted wall mirror...


        OBSERVATION ROOM

        Loew leans over, whispers to the Chief.

                                LOEW
                  The press would have a field day
                  with this.

        gold stars to his shoulders.

                                CHIEF
                  Captain Edmund Exley.  Chief of
                  Detectives.  Los Angeles Police
                  Department.

        Applause.  Flashbulbs.  Lynn watches from the back as
        Exley runs a handshake gauntlet.  Finally, he spots her.
        She's returned to her natural brunette.  Looks even
        better.  Exley steps over.

                                EXLEY
                         (ironic smile)
                  I tried to throw it all away and
                  they give it back in spades.


        EXT. PARKING LOT - DAY

        Exley walks Lynn out.

                                EXLEY
                  Where will you go?

                                LYNN
                  Bisbee, Arizona.  The air's good
                  for pensioners and I know where
                  everything is.

                                EXLEY
                  When?

                                LYNN
                  Right now, before I back down.

                                EXLEY
                  Where is he?

        Lynn gestures ahead.  They walk to her car.  She opens
        the back door.  Bud's in the back.  Braces on his legs,
        head sutured.  Jaw wired shut and tubes running in and
        out.  But his hands still look strong.  Bud forces a
        smile through the wires, tries to say something, but
        can't.

                                EXLEY
                  Thanks for the push.

        Exley takes his hand.  Bud squeezes till both men wince.

                                EXLEY
                  You just did what you did.  No
                  rank, no glory.

        Exley slips his Medal of Valor into Bud's hand.

                                EXLEY
                  From me to you.  It'll mean
                  something if it's yours.

        Bud takes it, turns away so Exley won't see the tears.

                                LYNN
                  We should go now.

        As Exley steps back, Lynn closes the door.  PARTY noises
        drift from upstairs.  Exley looks to Lynn.

                                EXLEY
                  Do you think I ever could've been
                  in the running?

                                LYNN
                  Some men get the world.  Others
                  get ex-hookers and a trip to
                  Arizona.

        A beat.  Exley wishes he'd gotten the trip to Arizona.
        She kisses him on the cheek, gets in the CAR.  STARTS it.

        Exley looks back at Bud.  Bud presses his hands to the
        glass.  Exley touches his side, palms half the man's
        size.  Hands against hands.

        The car moves. A turn into traffic, a good-bye TOOT on
        the HORN.  Exley's all alone.  As he watches them go...

                                                  FADE TO BLACK.





                                 THE END
"THE LADYKILLERS"

                                      Screenplay by

                                 Joel Coen and Ethan Coen

                                 Based on the 1955 movie

                                    "The Ladykillers"

                                     by William Rose

                

               EXT. MISSISSIPPI RIVER - DAY

               A BOAT

               Specifically, a garbage scow.

               We see it from ON HIGH, chugging down the placid but mighty 
               Mississippi.

               Head credits play over COVERAGE of the garbage scow. No sound, 
               except for an incongruously heroic score.

               The COVERAGE is a little rough, coarse-grained; along with 
               the overbearing score it almost suggests an industrial film 
               rather than a feature.

               One piece of sound -- the toot of the boat's horn -- is 
               obviously library. And not a new library either.

               The garbage scow passes under a bridge spanning the broad, 
               sluggish waters, and proceeds on to its landfill, a steaming 
               river island. Disturbed gulls and other scavenger birds rise 
               from where they were picking through trash. Their squawks, 
               like the boat horn, are not quite believable as SYNC.

               The head credits end as the anthemic music resolves.

               EXT. SAUCIER, MISSISSIPPI - DAY

               AN OLD HOUND DOG

               lies on the weather-grayed and -roughened planking of a front 
               porch. The porch is half-shaded from the noonday sun. It is 
               quiet except for the chirr of heat bugs, close by, and, very 
               distant, many voices in chorus, engaged in divine worship in 
               a Baptist church sufficiently far away that vagaries of breeze 
               fan them in and out of audibility.

               We once again hear the toot of the scow's horn, distant now 
               and played as real, not slapdash effect. At this, the dog 
               lifts his nose to catch the breeze, sniffs, and then, whining, 
               lowers his head to the floor and covers his snout with his 
               forepaws. He huffs briefly and goes to sleep.

               We DRIFT UP to show that the dog is sleeping before the

               SAUCIER WORM STORE

               Your source for worms, lures, etcetera, etcetera...

               We TRAVEL OVER TO REVEAL that the modest one-story structure 
               houses two establishments; its other front door leads to the

               SAUCIER MUNICIPAL BUILDING.

               A campaign sign in the window on the municipal side shows a 
               black man of late middle-age beaming and giving the viewer a 
               thumbs-up:

               RE-ELECT WAYNE WYNER SHERIFF/He Is Too Old to Go to Work.

               INT. SAUCIER MUNICIPAL BUILDING - DAY

               We hear snoring on top of a low, steady hissing sound.

               We are DRIFTING toward the door of the lock-up, which stands 
               open. The small cell is empty, its bed neatly made.

               A KEY

               We are ARCING slowly around a jailer's key on a ring that 
               hangs from a nail. The OFFSCREEN snoring and whirring 
               continues.

               The TRACK'S SHIFTING ANGLE now makes the light catch a spider 
               web spun between the key and the wall.

               POLICE SCANNER

               We DRIFT across the face of the radio. The peaceful steady 
               hissing jumps in louder at the CUT: it is uninterrupted: a 
               transmissionless, crimeless, misdemeanorless idle radio hiss.

               The snoring is also louder here. As we TRAVEL OFF the radio 
               we are COMING ONTO a pair of feet propped up on the desktop.

               They belong to SHERIFF WYNER, tipped back in his chair, 
               fingers laced on his chest, head lolling forward.

               As the MOVING CAMERA FINALLY ENDS on him, there is the ring 
               of a telephone -- muffled, not present.

               It nevertheless rouses the sheriff who almost strangles on a 
               snore as he awakes, and then rocks forward to pick up his 
               phone.

                                     SHERIFF WYNER
                         Sheriff Wyner...

               The muffled ringing continues; the sheriff looks, puzzled, 
               at the phone. Now the ringing stops and we hear a muffled 
               voice next door:

                                     VOICE (O.S.)
                         Worms.

               The sheriff replaces the phone, leans back again, adjusts 
               his hat, and is about to go back to sleep when we hear the 
               front door open.

               The sheriff looks and reacts with genuine, if momentary, 
               fear.

               He manages to compose himself and give the intruder a smile:

                                     SHERIFF WYNER
                         Afternoon, Miz Munson.

               Entering is an elderly black woman in a floral print dress 
               and fruited bonnet.

                                     MRS. MUNSON
                         Afternoon, Sheriff. You know the 
                         Funthes boy?

                                     SHERIFF WYNER
                         ...Mackatee Funthes?

                                     MRS. MUNSON
                         No no, WeeMack! Mackatee's eldest!

                                     SHERIFF WYNER
                         Oh yeah, believe I do.

                                     MRS. MUNSON
                         Well, he's a good boy but he done 
                         gone down to the Costco in Pascagoula 
                         and got hisself a blastah -- and he 
                         been playin' that music!

               Wyner is not sure where this is going:

                                     SHERIFF WYNER
                         Uh-huh...

                                     MRS. MUNSON
                         Loud!

                                     SHERIFF WYNER
                         Well--

                                     MRS. MUNSON
                         "Left my wallet in El Segundo!"

                                     SHERIFF WYNER
                         He--

                                     MRS. MUNSON
                         Songs like that!

                                     SHERIFF WYNER
                         Uh-huh...

                                     MRS. MUNSON
                         Hippity-hop music!

                                     SHERIFF WYNER
                         I could--

                                     MRS. MUNSON
                         You know they call it hippity-hop 
                         music, but it don't make me wanna go 
                         hippity-hop!

                                     SHERIFF WYNER
                         No ma'am--

                                     MRS. MUNSON
                         And Othar don't like that music 
                         neither!

               Sheriff Wyner now displays an exaggerated solicitousness:

                                     SHERIFF WYNER
                         It's been disturbin' Othar then, has 
                         it?

                                     MRS. MUNSON
                         How could it help but do! That kind 
                         of music! You know what they call 
                         colored folks in them songs? Have 
                         you got any idea?

                                     SHERIFF WYNER
                         I don't think I--

                                     MRS. MUNSON
                         NIGGAZ! I don't wanna say the word.

                         that. I say it one time.

                                     SHERIFF WYNER
                         Yes ma'am.

                                     MRS. MUNSON

                         John The Apostle said: Behold there 
                         is a stranger in our midst, come to 
                         destroy us!

                                     SHERIFF WYNER
                         Yes ma'am.

               EXT. SAUCIER MUNICIPAL BUILDING - DAY

               Mrs. Munson closes the door behind her. She wags a paper fan 
               and mutters:

                                     MRS. MUNSON
                         He's a good man. Just needs 
                         instruction. Dog, you in peoples' 
                         way.

               The dog stirs with a whine and ambles off.

               EXT. MUNSON HOUSE - DAY

               With a neatly tended garden. It is the last house on a street 
               of other similarly modest but well maintained homes; beyond 
               it the street disappears down a bluff. The empty space beyond 
               suggests a wide river, and indeed we can see the top of an 
               anchored, gaudily painted paddle-boat poking over the rise. 
               The paddle-boat is apparently anchored at the near bank of 
               the river.

               Mrs. Munson is entering by the gate. She stops in the garden 
               and stoops to pull a tiny weed marring the otherwise perfect 
               row of flowers.

               I/E. MUNSON HOUSE - FOYER - DAY

               Mrs. Munson lets herself in. A cat lopes up to her, the bell 
               around its neck tinkling, and leans mewing into her leg.

                                     MRS. MUNSON
                         You need somethin' to eat, Angel?

               INT. MUNSON HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY

               Mrs. Munson hand-cranks a can opener around a tin of cat 
               food.

                                     MRS. MUNSON
                         Mm... gizzards...

               The cat paces back and forth between her legs, leaning into 
               them and purring, responding to the snap of tin as the cover 
               comes off the can.

               The can contains cubed processed gizzard in a gelatinous 
               medium like the stuff that clings to gefilte fish.

               INT. MUNSON HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

               Above the fireplace is an oil portrait of a serious-looking 
               black man of late middle-age with a neatly groomed mustache 
               starting to gray. A couple of candles sit on the mantel below 
               the portrait, giving it the semblance of a shrine.

               Mrs. Munson enters and lights the candles.

                                     MRS. MUNSON
                         Othar, I went'n complained about 
                         WeeMack, I hope it'll do some good. 
                         That boy hangin' by a thread! Over 
                         the pit! Fiery pit! "I Left My Wallet 
                         in El Segundo"!

               She shakes out the match and sits in a rocker and takes up 
               her knitting. As she sits she gives an audible groan.

                                     MRS. MUNSON
                         ...Sixty-seven years of life, forty-
                         six years of marriage, you mean to 
                         tell me you never one time suffered 
                         from piles? It's the human condition, 
                         most humans anyway. Like that ball 
                         player said: world's got two kinds 
                         of folks -- them that's got piles 
                         and them that's gonna get 'em. But 
                         you was always healthy as an ox...

               There is the distant moan of a riverboat horn.

                                     MRS. MUNSON
                         ...Passed on before you got piles. 
                         Mmmmhmm. Thank the Lord you wasn't 
                         sick. You don't wanna sicken 'n die. 
                         No, you wanna pass nice 'n peaceful... 
                         go to sleep one night, wake up in 
                         the glory land... woof...

               A gust of wind hums under the eaves; the candles below the 
               portrait flicker. As Mrs. Munson looks around the room, 
               vaguely towards the ceiling, sensing a negative aura, the 
               cat arches its back and hisses.

               At this moment the doorbell rings.

                                     MRS. MUNSON
                         ...Well who's that now, Pickles?

               She grunts as she hoists herself out of the chair.

               I/E. MUNSON HOUSE - FOYER - NIGHT

               She opens the door--

               A draft--

               INT. MUNSON HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

               The candles below the portrait of Othar go out, sending up 
               thin wisps of smoke.

               I/E. MUNSON HOUSE - FOYER - NIGHT

               The cat shrieks and bolts out the door, past the man on the 
               stoop: GOLDTHWAIT HIGGINSON DORR, III.

               He is a middle-aged Southern gentleman wearing a panama hat 
               and a cape over a cream-colored suit. He has dark circles 
               under his eyes. The smile he attempts, mournful yet courtly, 
               is wiped away by:

                                     MRS. MUNSON
                         PICKLES!

                                     DORR
                         Ma'am?

                                     MRS. MUNSON
                         Go get 'im!

                                     DORR
                         I do beg your pardon?

                                     MRS. MUNSON
                         Go get Pickles, I didn't let 'im 
                         out!

                                     DORR
                              (tasting the name)
                         Pickles...

               EXT. MUNSON HOUSE - NIGHT

               Dorr walks down the stoop followed by the old lady.

                                     MRS. MUNSON
                         Oh, he's up the tree again. Your 
                         gonna have to shimmy on up.

                                     DORR
                         I am so terribly sorry, madam. But 
                         won't the feline eventually tire of 
                         his lonely perch and, pining for his 
                         master's affection, return on his 
                         own initiative?

                                     MRS. MUNSON
                         Huh? No, he won't come down less you 
                         fetch him. He'd set there til Gabriel 
                         blows his horn if someone didn't 
                         shimmy up. Up with you now!

                                     DORR
                         Well then couldn't we perhaps offer 
                         him kitty treats and enticements, or 
                         if not foodstuffs perhaps squeaky 
                         little toys of the kind formerly 
                         manufactured in Hong Kong but now 
                         produced in the other so-called 
                         "Little Tigers"...

               His fingers form the quotes.

                                     DORR
                         ...of the Pacific Rim? The point 
                         bein', do we have to actually ascend 
                         the tree--

                                     MRS. MUNSON
                         Look, I don't want no doubletalk. If 
                         you ain't gonna fetch him down I 
                         guess I gotta call the po-lice...

                                     DORR
                         Police...

               His face darkens.

                                     MRS. MUNSON
                         They ain't gonna be happy. Every 
                         time they come fetch him down they 
                         swear they won't do it no more...

               Dorr casts his hat aside and starts awkwardly climbing the 
               tree. He gasps as he climbs:

                                     DORR
                         No need to call the authorities. I 
                         did this often as a youth -- why, I 
                         was a positive lemur... Here, kitty...

               The cat backs away down a branch, arching its back and 
               hissing.

                                     MRS. MUNSON
                         Don't upset him, now!

               Dorr, on his stomach, inches after the cat, grunting:

                                     DORR
                         I wouldn't dream of it... harmless 
                         little felix domesticus... Come to 
                         G.H...

               The branch breaks, hinging down to slam Dorr face-first into 
               the trunk, from where he drops the rest of the way to the 
               ground.

               INT. MUNSON HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

               Othar's portrait, upside-down, seems to be looking bemusedly 
               down on us.

               An OBJECTIVE ANGLE shows Dorr lying on the couch, a damp 
               washcloth on his forehead, eyes rolled back to look at the 
               picture.

               Mrs. Munson is entering with a cup of tea. Dorr swings his 
               feet out to sit up and accept the tea.

                                     DORR
                         I thank you, madam, for your act of 
                         kindness.

                                     MRS. MUNSON
                         Well you let him out.

                                     DORR
                         I certainly did and I do apologize 
                         no end. Allow me to present myself, 
                         uh, formally: Goldthwait Higginson 
                         Dorr, Ph.D.

                                     MRS. MUNSON
                         What, like Elmer?

                                     DORR
                         Beg your pardon, ma'am?

                                     MRS. MUNSON
                         Fudd?

                                     DORR
                         No no, Ph.D. is a mark of academic 
                         attainment. It is a degree of higher 
                         learning bestowed, in my case, in 
                         recognition of my mastery of the 
                         antique languages of Latin and Greek. 
                         I also hold a number of other advanced 
                         degrees including the baccalaureate 
                         from a school in Paris, France, called 
                         the Sorbonne.

               Munson chuckles.

                                     MRS. MUNSON
                         Sore bone, well I guess that's 
                         appropriate. You ever study at Bob 
                         Jones University?

                                     DORR
                         I have not had that privilege.

                                     MRS. MUNSON
                         It's a bible school, only the finest 
                         in the country. I send them five 
                         dollars every month.

                                     DORR
                         That's very gener--

                                     MRS. MUNSON
                         I'm on their mailing list. I'm an 
                         Angel.

                                     DORR
                         Indeed.

                                     MRS. MUNSON
                         They list my name in the newsletter, 
                         every issue. I got the literature 
                         here, you wanna examine it.

                                     DORR
                         Perhaps when my head has recovered 
                         from its... buffeting. Mrs. Munson, 
                         are you at all curious as to why I 
                         darkened your door, as the expression 
                         has it, on this lovely camelia-scented 
                         morn?

                                     MRS. MUNSON
                         I was wondering, til you let Pickles 
                         out. Then in all the excitement--

                                     DORR
                         I quite understand. The fact is that 
                         I saw the sign on your window 
                         advertising a room to let, and it is 
                         the only such sign among the houses 
                         of this charming, charming street.

                                     MRS. MUNSON
                         Yeah, I got a room. I'm lookin' for 
                         a quiet tenant. Fifteen dollars a 
                         week

                                     DORR
                         I quite understand. Madam, you are 
                         addressing a man who is quiet -- and 
                         yet not quiet, if I may offer a 
                         riddle...

               He sets down the teacup and rises.

                                     DORR
                         ...Perhaps you can show me the room, 
                         Mrs. Munson, and allow me to explain.

                                     MRS. MUNSON
                         Well you can see the room, but I 
                         don't like double-talk.

               Mrs. Munson precedes him...

               INT. MUNSON HOUSE - STAIRCASE - NIGHT

               ...up the stairs.

                                     DORR
                         You see, madam, I am currently on 
                         sabbatical from the institution where 
                         I teach -- the University of 
                         Mississippi at Hattiesburg. I am 
                         taking a year off to indulge my 
                         passion -- I don't believe that is 
                         too strong a word -- for the music 
                         of the Renaissance. I perform in -- 
                         and have the honor of directing -- a 
                         period instrument ensemble that 
                         performs at Renaissance fairs and 
                         other cultural fora...

               INT. MUNSON HOUSE - DORR'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

               They enter a small bedroom. There is a small bed on a brass 
               frame, a chair, a wash basin, and cheerful yellow chintz 
               drapes on the window. Dorr appreciatively takes it in.

                                     DORR
                         ...thoo-out central and southern 
                         Mississippi. We perform on the 
                         instruments for which the music was 
                         originally composed, in the belief 
                         that... that... Why, this is lovely...

                                     MRS. MUNSON
                         Wait a minute. You got some kind of 
                         band?

               Dorr once again wiggles quotes with his fingers:

                                     DORR
                         The word "band" would be, in this 
                         context, something of an anachronism. 
                         Though we do play together -- hence 
                         the word "ensemble" -- the nature of 
                         the music is such that one would 
                         hesitate to apply the epithet "band" 
                         with its connotations of jangling 
                         rhythm and ear-popping amplification.

                                     MRS. MUNSON
                         So you don't play hippity-hop, "I 
                         Left My Wallet in El Segundo," songs 
                         with the titles spelt all funny?

                                     DORR
                         Madam, I shudder. I quake. The 
                         revulsion I feel for modern popular 
                         music, and all other manifestations 
                         of contemporary decay, is, I have no 
                         doubt, the equal of y'own. Why, we 
                         play music that was composed to the 
                         greater glory of God. Devotional 
                         music. Church music.

                                     MRS. MUNSON
                         Gospel music?

                                     DORR
                         Well-inspired by the gospels, 
                         certainly. The vintage, of course, 
                         is no more recent than the Rococo.

                                     MRS. MUNSON
                         Rococo, huh? Well, I guess that'd be 
                         okay.

                                     DORR
                         But I certainly don't propose to 
                         inflict our rehearsals on you. May I 
                         enquire -- do you have a root cellar?

               INT. MUNSON HOUSE - CELLAR - NIGHT

               Dorr ducks while descending the steep, narrow stair in order 
               to avoid an overhead beam. He is followed by Mrs. Munson.

                                     DORR
                         Yes, yes, yes, this looks promising...

               He pulls on a hanging string to light a bare bulb overhead.

                                     MRS. MUNSON
                         Little dank, ain't it?

                                     DORR
                         Oh, indeed, but that only improves 
                         the acoustics...

               He experimentally claps his hands.

                                     DORR
                         ...Marvelous. These earthen walls 
                         are ideal for baffling the higher 
                         registers of the, uh, lute and, uh, 
                         sackbutt. That's why so much music 
                         of the cinquecento was played in 
                         crypts and catacombs. Yes, this will 
                         do nicely...

               He dry-washes his hands with enthusiasm, but his tone remains 
               mournful.

                                     DORR
                         ...This is perfect. This is more 
                         than perfect. I can scarcely contain 
                         my glee.

                                     MRS. MUNSON
                         You containing it okay.

               He starts to peel cash out of a large, well-worn billfold:

                                     DORR
                         Allow me to pay you a week in advance. 
                         Allow me to pay you two weeks in 
                         advance. Allow me to pay you a month 
                         in advance. I cannot countenance the 
                         thought of these charming apartments 
                         being tenanted by someone 
                         unappreciative of their special je 
                         ne sais quoi.

                                     MRS. MUNSON
                         That would be a shame.

               INT. CASINO - DAY

               TRACKING ON A GARBAGE CART

               On the cart is a boombox. It is playing "I Left My Wallet in 
               El Segundo."

               It is being pushed through a casino empty of customers.

               As the cart stops and a wastebasket is emptied into it:

                                     VOICE (V.O.)
                         You gotta peel this shit out sticks 
                         to the bottom.

               WIDER

               shows two youngish black men in the khaki uniforms of 
               custodians. Emptying the wastebasket is WEEMACK-MACKATEE 
               FUNTHES. He is instructing GAWAIN MACSAM.

                                     WEEMACK
                         ...You wouldn't believe this shit, 
                         sometimes even out here on the casino 
                         floor you gonna find sanitary napkin 
                         shit stuck there, Tucks, I don't 
                         know what the fuck people do while 
                         they're gambling here man.

                                     GAWAIN
                         I ain't peelin' funky shit with my 
                         human hands, man. That's a 
                         prescription for disease and viruses 
                         and shit, attackin' y'insides.

               As they roll on we see more of the gambling floor, which is 
               on something less than the scale of a Las Vegas casino. The 
               floor is not yet open and dealers stack and count chips at 
               the tables, pit bosses with clipboards looking over their 
               shoulders. Other dealers strap on visors and sleeve garters, 
               preparing to work.

                                     WEEMACK
                         You gotta do it. Mr. Gudge checks 
                         everything. Man is a motherfuck. 
                         Shit -- looka this.

               After a furtive look around he plucks a chip from the next 
               wastebasket and slips it in his pocket.

                                     WEEMACK
                         ...You keep an eye out, man. I found 
                         a hundred-dollar chip once.

                                     GAWAIN
                         Fuck that, man. I ain't pawin' through 
                         used Tucks for a fi' dollar chip.

                                     WEEMACK
                         I said it was a hundred.

                                     GAWAIN
                         Man, your guts gonna turn to soup'n 
                         leak outcha fuckin' asshole.

               SERVICE HALL

               The cart jitters loudly on the dimpled plastic floor.

                                     WEEMACK
                         This tunnel leads back onto land. To 
                         the office for all the people work 
                         for Mannex. Mannex Corporation. Owns 
                         the Lady Luck 'n three other boats...

               INT. CASINO - SERVICE HALL - DAY

               The two men are entering a windowless fluorescent-lit office 
               area. A row of wooden office doors and one heavy steel door.

                                     WEEMACK
                         ...This is where they think on their 
                         corporate shit, Gudge and them.

               He stops to empty a wastebasket.

                                     WEEMACK
                         ...The lights is ugly but it ain't 
                         as many Tucks.

               He bangs on the steel door:

                                     WEEMACK
                         ...YO, motherfuck! Lemme in!

                                     MUFFLED VOICE (O.S.)
                         What's the password?

                                     WEEMACK
                         Kiss my ass.

               We hear a deep chuckle and the door, steel reinforced, swings 
               open.

               INT. CASINO - COUNTING ROOM - DAY

               The two men enter, WeeMack nodding at the security man 
               (ELRON).

                                     WEEMACK
                         This is where they count the dough. 
                         You try to take any of it Elron there 
                         shoot your ass.

               Again the security man chuckles. WeeMack picks up some fast-
               food wrappers.

                                     WEEMACK
                         ...This place is a fuckin' pigsty. 
                         You a pig, man, nothin' but a squeaky 
                         ol' motherfuckin' pig...

               Elron chuckles. He is an enormously fat man; his chuckles 
               come from deep, deep in his chest.

                                     WEEMACK
                         ...You got fuckin' Kocoa Krispies in 
                         ya uniform man, still got breakfast 
                         there and you eatin' motherfuckin' 
                         lunch.

               Elron uses one hand to swipe crumbs off his uniform shirt, 
               chuckling.

                                     WEEMACK
                         ...You a disgrace before motherfuckin' 
                         God...

               Elron chuckles.

                                     WEEMACK
                         ...You a motherfuck-- oh, hello Mr. 
                         Gudge, how we be this mornin'?

               A man in a buttoned white shirt nods at him.

                                     GUDGE
                         Funthes. How's the new man?

                                     WEEMACK
                         He is a cleaning motherfucker, man!

                                     GUDGE
                         Is that a fact.

               INT. SOUNDSTAGE - SMOKING FIELD SET - DAY

               HIGH ANGLE

               It is a ruin of a field; charred trees point bare and gnarled 
               limbs toward a gray sky; smoke drifts across the desolate 
               waste.

               Something is bounding towards us from the deep background. 
               We BOOM DOWN as it approaches: a bulldog, running avidly 
               toward us on its stumpy little legs.

               An OFFSCREEN male voice (CLARK PANCAKE):

                                     PANCAKE (O.S.)
                         One, Mountain!

               There is an explosion that showers dirt in front of the dog 
               and makes it veer. Something strapped around the dog's neck 
               bounces as he runs.

                                     PANCAKE
                         ...Scrub two! Scrub three! Four, 
                         Mountain!

               Another explosion makes the dog veer back so that it once 
               again bears on us. The thing that has been bouncing around 
               its neck flies off.

               Our CONTINUING BOOM DOWN has brought us to ground level just 
               as the dog arrives in front of us to feed at a dog food bowl 
               in the foreground. The yellow plastic bowl has a K-Ration

               We hear another OFFSCREEN voice (DIRECTOR):

                                     DIRECTOR (O.S.)
                         Cut, goddamnit. His canteen fell 
                         off.

               The Director's feet enter in the foreground. He hooks the 
               dogs belly with one foot and hoists it roughly away from the 
               bowl. We

                                                                 CUT UP TO:

               The DIRECTOR. He scowls down at the animal.

                                     DIRECTOR
                         ...Props!

               A man in a Hemingway field-jacket with multiple pockets, and 
               also a loaded utility belt, trots up toward him, his belt 
               jangling as he runs. This is CLARK PANCAKE.

               Pancake is a florid beer-bellied man in his late fifties. He 
               has a full blond-grey Grizzly Adams beard and wears multi-
               pocketed shorts that form an ensemble with his Hemingway 
               jacket.

               The director is angry.

                                     DIRECTOR
                         ...The goddamn thing's canteen fell 
                         off. It would have been a good take.

               Pancake is unperturbed.

                                     PANCAKE
                         Okay. Okay. We're prepared for that...

               He hits a button on the radio on his belt and talks into his 
               headset:

                                     PANCAKE
                         ... Mountain, bring Otto with the 
                         apparatus.

               PULLING ANOTHER BULLDOG

               He strains at his lead, muscling forward as quickly as his 
               minder and his own stumpy little legs will allow.

               He peers through the two goggly eyeholes of an antique leather 
               gas mask, its pignose breathing apparatus covering his own 
               snout. His phlegmy breathing is amplified by the device.

               We TILT UP the lead to show his minder, MOUNTAIN GIRL. She 
               is a solid woman in her late forties with freckles beginning 
               to merge into age spots. Her long straw-colored hair is 
               tightly braided into Heidi pigtails bound with red ribbon. 
               Otherwise her dress is unadorned.

               The director squints at the dog.

                                     DIRECTOR
                         What the hell is this?

               Pancake's manner is professorial:

                                     PANCAKE
                         World War I vintage gas mask. It's 
                         authentic. Strapped on, of course, 
                         so it can't fall off. The animal is 
                         free to be as active as he wants, 
                         doesn't inhibit his movement, and I 
                         think it really sells the whole 
                         doughboy thing--

                                     DIRECTOR
                         It looks like a fucking joke.

               Pancake stares at the director for a moment and, though not 
               doing anything, makes a sound of concentrated effort:

                                     PANCAKE
                         ...Nnnnrnff!

               The director squints at him:

                                     DIRECTOR
                         What?

               Pancake comes out of his trance, or whatever it was:

                                     PANCAKE
                         No, nothing, uh... you're absolutely 
                         right, the gas mask is a whimsical 
                         concept--

                                     DIRECTOR
                         How the hell does it eat when it 
                         gets to the Kennel Rations?

               The dog looks up from person to person as each speaks, 
               twisting its neck to peer through the eyeholes. Its breathing 
               is growing louder.

                                     PANCAKE
                         Well, you're absolutely right-

                                     DIRECTOR
                         Don't let the client see this.

                                     PANCAKE
                         Of course not, that would be 
                         inappropriate--

                                     DIRECTOR
                         Or the Humane fucker.

                                     PANCAKE
                         No no--

               The dog gets down on its knees, slowly, like a camel, 
               breathing ever more loudly.

                                     DIRECTOR
                         They'll shut the fucking spot down, 
                         Pancake. Put the goddamn canteen 
                         back on. That says he's a soldier. 
                         Dented tin canteen. Just tie the 
                         damn thing to his collar.

               The dog flops over into the mud.

                                     PANCAKE
                         Easiest thing in the world. I just 
                         thought -- but the canteen is much 
                         better. Good concept. Let's go with 
                         that--

                                     DIRECTOR
                         What's he doing?

               The dog has started to convulse.

                                     PANCAKE
                         Well, he's uh... Just breathe 
                         normally, Otto.

                                     DIRECTOR
                         The fucking dog can't breathe.

                                     PANCAKE
                         Oh, he can breathe, that thing is -- 
                         just breathe normally, Otto.

               The dog's breath is rasping and horrible.

                                     DIRECTOR
                         The fucking dog cannot breathe! Get 
                         that fucking thing off him!

                                     PANCAKE
                         Of course. Easiest thing in the world.

               He stoops and fiddles at the straps.

                                     PANCAKE
                         ...It's on good and tight, I, uh... 
                         Just breathe normally, Otto.

               He starts thumping at his pockets.

                                     DIRECTOR
                         Get the fucking thing off him!

                                     PANCAKE
                         Don't have my Leatherman. Mountain! 
                         Give me your Leatherman! Chop chop!

                                     DIRECTOR
                         Get the fucking thing off him! Chitra, 
                         make sure the Humane fucker doesn't 
                         come over here! Bring him to craft 
                         services!

               As he makes to scoop up the dog:

                                     PANCAKE
                         Good idea! Ice water, treats-

                                     DIRECTOR
                         Not the dog, you idiot! The Humane 
                         fucker! Distract him!

                                     PANCAKE
                         Right! Of course!

               He goes back to work on the mask.

                                     DIRECTOR
                         Oh my god, he's bleeding!

                                     PANCAKE
                         No, that's me -- I -- the 
                         Leatherman... here we go.

               His hand gouting blood, he finally manages to get the gas 
               mask off.

               A crowd is starting to gather and gape. The director barks 
               at a grip:

                                     DIRECTOR
                         Put up a couple solids here -- I 
                         don't want the client seeing this!

               Pancake thumps on the inert dog's chest.

                                     PANCAKE
                         Come on, Otto!

                                     DIRECTOR
                         Otto is fucking dead!

                                     PANCAKE
                         Mountain, have electric run me a 
                         stinger! Don't give up on me, Otto! 
                         Mountain, I need two live leads!

               More people crowd in to look.

                                     MOUNTAIN GIRL
                         Clark, the gennie's a hundred yards 
                         away!

                                     PANCAKE
                         Goddamnit! Otto's gonna have brain 
                         damage in about ninety seconds! Okay!

               He pulls the dog's lips back, exposing its teeth and slobbered 
               tongue.

                                     PANCAKE
                         ...Kiss of life!

               He sucks in a deep breath and starts mouth-to-mouthing the 
               beast.

               EXT. FOOTBALL FIELD - DAY

               POV

               We are looking out from inside a football helmet; we hear 
               the super-present breathing of the helmet's occupant. Just 
               over the breathing we can hear the muffled shouting of a 
               snap count.

               We are in a crouch position looking downfield. At the call 
               of "Hike!" we and everyone on the field spring into action.

               We sprint downfield, the breathing becoming even louder. A 
               very big person downfield is sprinting toward us.

               After several yards, still on the move, we PAN quickly around 
               to look back for the quarterback. Barely visible among 
               converging bodies, he is releasing the football toward someone 
               else.

               Easing up on the run we PAN BACK around to look downfield 
               just as the oncoming defender is upon us and -- CRUNCH -- 
               slams into us. A STROBING PAN leaves us looking up at the 
               sky. Our loud breathing has stopped.

               After a long beat the breathing resumes with a raggedy labored 
               inhale. It continues irregularly. Another helmeted player 
               appears above us to peer down into our helmet. He extends a 
               hand to help us up.

               HUDDLE

               We are looking back and forth around the circle at our 
               gathered teammates.

                                     QUARTERBACK
                         Delta thirty-seven. On four!

               All, with a simultaneous hand clap:

                                     TEAM
                         Huh!

               LINE OF SCRIMMAGE

               Lined up opposite us is a snarling defender.

               Once again, over loud breathing, we can just hear the shouted 
               count.

               At "Hike!" we straighten to meet the defensive lineman lunging 
               at us. His mouthpiece clatters against ours and in horrific 
               CLOSE-UP he strains against us, his animal gurgles of effort 
               audible over our own ragged breath.

               With a primal roar from the defenseman our POV tips back and 
               up, BOOMING DOWN to stop with a CRUNCH against the ground, 
               staring up. Once again our breathing has stopped.

               After a beat a foot is planted on our helmet as a looming 
               running back steps on us in his charge downfield. He is 
               pursued by defenders some of whom leap over us and some of 
               whom by the sound of it step on various body parts.

               HUDDLE

               The same back-and-forth PAN.

                                     QUARTERBACK
                         Okay, Epsilon twenty-two! You the 
                         man!... Hey! BUTTHEAD!

               This brings our wandering attention PANNING back to the 
               quarterback:

                                     QUARTERBACK
                         You the man!

               A very, very present VOICE (HUDSON):

                                     HUDSON (O.S.)
                         Me the man?

                                     TEAM
                         Huh!

               LINE OF SCRIMMAGE

               The same breathing and count.

               On "Hike!" we sprint downfield.

               The same distant defender sprinting toward us.

               We hear low but very present a dismayed:

                                     HUDSON (O.S.)
                         Unh... oh no...

               Our breathing is torn by rasping wheezes of effort as we 
               continue to run.

               We look back.

               Every player is looking directly at us.

               A huge spiralling football coming at us -- too close, too 
               soon -- and--

               BONK!

               It bounces off our mouth guard and flies up.

                                     HUDSON (O.S.)
                         ...shit...

               We are looking forward just as

               CRUNCH!

               We are hit by the defender.

               We once again land face-up.

               Very steeply FORESHORTENED, right over us, we see the defender 
               juggling the live ball.

               With a moan, our own hand reaches weakly up towards the ball 
               and the high, distant defender.

               He finally gathers in the ball and securely tucks it, and 
               starts back upfield.

               We climb wearily to our feet. We look back upfield just in 
               time to see the defender start an elaborate victory dance in 
               the end zone. He pauses for a moment to point a gloved hand 
               directly at us, then resumes his strut.

               Shouting from the sidelines brings our PANNING attention 
               over.

               The coach, face twisted with fury, is shouting at us and 
               using his clipboard to wave us off the field.

               We trot toward the sidelines.

               All of our teammates stare at us - some in shock, some in 
               anger, some in pity.

               At the sideline bench our POV swings round as we seat ourself. 
               A hand reaches up to the mouth guard to pull off the helmet 
               and we

                                                              MATCH CUT TO:

               Our first OBJECTIVE SHOT as the player (HUDSON) finishes 
               pulling off his helmet. He is a big blond boy. His entire 
               body, including his face, is solidly built.

               The boy, Hudson, turns to look, and we cut to one last

               POV

               The COACH is striding up, swinging his clipboard at the

               EXT. MINI-MALL / HI-HO DONUT - DAY

               HIGH ANGLE

               It is a typical sunbaked concrete strip mall with a Seven-
               Eleven, a launderette, and a Hi-Ho Donut. The Hi-Ho Donut 
               sign shows a pink donut with sprinkles and says in much 
               smaller lettering: And Croissants.

               A beat-up Impala pulls into the lot, pulsing hip-hop music. 
               After a long rumbling idle the ignition is killed. Both front 
               doors open. Two BLACK KIDS get out and look around with a 
               manner that is if anything too casual.

               INT. HI-HO DONUT - DAY

               There is faint muzak and loud air-conditioner hum. Glass 
               cases display donuts identified as GLAZED, JELLY, and FANCIES. 
               Fancies ooze yellow goo. The jelly on the jelly donuts is 
               developing a crust of age. The glazed also look moth-eaten.

               One customer, a disheveled older man, sits at one of the 
               little formica tables staring into a coffee cup. Next to the 
               coffee is a brown paper bag from which a straw protrudes.

               Behind the counter is a middle-aged VIETNAMESE WOMAN in a 
               neat white blouse.

               The two youths enter pulling out enormous handguns from 
               underneath their windbreakers.

                                     YOUTH #1
                         All right Dragon Lady, give us all 
                         the fuckin' money!

               The woman stares blankly.

                                     YOUTH #1
                         We want that donut money!

                                     VIETNAMESE WOMAN
                         Yao gin nyap!

               A man appears from the kitchen in back. He is a middle-aged 
               Vietnamese gentleman in a crisply pressed khaki leisure suit. 
               An ascot is knotted at his neck. He wears aviator eyeglasses. 
               In his mouth smolders a half-burned-down filterless cigarette. 
               This, we shall learn later, is THE GENERAL.

                                     YOUTH #2
                         Okay papa-san, we want that donut 
                         money.

                                     YOUTH #1
                         And we ain't fuckin' around, Mr. Hi-
                         Ho.

                                     VIETNAMESE WOMAN
                         Hi-Ho.

               The two youths look at her briefly. Nothing else is 
               forthcoming.

               The drunk looks up from his paper bag.

                                     YOUTH #2
                         Look, this fuckin' thing, it ain't 
                         complicated. You give us all the 
                         fuckin money, you don't get shot in 
                         the head, you make more donuts, get 
                         more money. That's how it works, 
                         see?

               The General stares at him. As with his wife, none of it seems 
               to register; unlike his wife, he seems unperturbed.

                                     YOUTH #1
                         Give us the money!

               He is pointing the gun directly at the General's head.

                                     YOUTH #1
                         ...You got three fuckin' seconds. 
                         You understand one-two-three? I'm 
                         gonna count one-two-three and then 
                         shoot. Okay? Three sec- huh!

               The General has swung his fist up to hook two fingers inside 
               the youth's nostrils. His gun clatters to the floor. The 
               fingers are way, way up his nose. Only one knuckle shows on 
               each finger.

               The youth is staring cross-eyed at his own nose.

               His friend is also stupefied.

                                     YOUTH #1
                              (very nasal)
                         His fingers are way the fuck up my 
                         nose.

                                     YOUTH #2
                         GET... YA FINGAS... OUT... THE 
                         MAN'S... NOSE!

               The General still impassively sucks on his cigarette. The 
               first youth is on the verge of tears:

                                     YOUTH #1
                         I think they're in my brain, man...

                                     YOUTH #2
                         MOTHERFUCK!

               He raises his gun to start firing.

               As he does so the General uses his hook-hold on the other 
               youth's nose to slam his head backwards, down into some 
               Fancies.

               The door opens and a customer walks in, a semi-elderly lady 
               with a cane.

               Youth #2, eyes rolling, wildly swings to cover the door, 
               then back to the General who has his friend's head pressed 
               into the Fancies, then uncertainly over to the Vietnamese 
               woman who is loudly yelling at him in Vietnamese.

               Cigarette still dangling from his lower lip, the General 
               calmly plucks a pot of coffee from the coffee warmer and 
               tosses it into Youth #2's face.

               Youth #2 screams.

               EXT. HI-HO DONUT - DAY

               HIGH ANGLE

               The car is still pulsing hip-hop music. Youth #2 stumbles 
               out of the Hi-Ho, hands covering his face and sinks to his 
               knees.

               INT. HI-HO DONUT - DAY

               The General now has the first youth's face pressed into the 
               Fancies from behind. Without disturbing his smoking, the 
               General repeatedly kicks the youth in the ass.

               His wife, muttering irritably in Vietnamese, is wheeling a 
               water bucket and mop to where the floor is covered with 
               coffee.

               INT. CHURCH - DAY

               At the CUT many voices are swelling in a song of worship. It 
               is a black Baptist church, and the music has great energy.

               The white-robed choir finishes singing; a preacher takes the 
               podium.

                                     PREACHER
                         I know you all remember that when 
                         Moses came down the mountain, carrying 
                         the word a God, come down that Sinai 
                         peak, he caught those Israelites red-
                         handed. What he catch 'em doin'? He 
                         caught 'em worshipping a golden calf.

               Shouts of "That's right!"

                                     PREACHER
                         ...He caught 'em with their backs 
                         turned on God!

               More shouts of "That's right!"

                                     PREACHER
                         ...He caught 'em worshipping a FALSE 
                         God! A God of EARTHLY things! He 
                         caught them Israelites in DECLINE!

               "He caught 'em!"

                                     PREACHER
                         ...Because backslidin' is DECLINE, 
                         brothers and sisters! You hear talk 
                         these days, and I know you've heard 
                         this talk, you hear talk of DECLINE, 
                         well all that means is we done turned 
                         our back on God!

               "That's right!"

                                     PREACHER
                         ...People say civilization doin' 
                         this, civilization doin' that, 
                         civilization in DECLINE! Well it 
                         ain't no civilization! It ain't no 
                         them! It's US, brothers and sisters!

               "Amen!"

               We are TRACKING among the congregants, disproportionately 
               women, mostly of middle age and elderly, mostly wearing 
               elaborate go-to-church hats.

                                     PREACHER
                         ...It's what's in our hearts, each 
                         and every one of us when we like 
                         them Israelites! Slidin' awa-a-a-ay 
                         down that Godly slope, slippin' and 
                         slidin' toward the mire and muck a 
                         the stinkhole of greed -- that's 
                         DECLINE!

               "That's decline!"

               The CONTINUING TRACK brings us onto Mrs. Munson, wearing, 
               like most of her peers, an oversized hat; hers is adorned 
               with a great deal of plastic fruit.

                                     PREACHER
                         ...And what did Moses do when he saw 
                         those declinin' backslidin' never-

               "What he do?"

                                     PREACHER
                         ...Moses SMOTE those sinners in his 
                         wrath yes he did!

               "Yes he did!"

                         ...Y'all know what smote is! I smite! 
                         You smite! He smites! We done smote!

               "That's right!"

                                     PREACHER
                         ...To smite is to go UPSIDE the head!

               "Uh-huh!"

                                     PREACHER
                         ...Because sometimes, brothers and 
                         sisters, that is the ONLY way!

               "Yes it is!"

                         ...To smite is to reMIND! We got to

               "Amen!"

                                     PREACHER
                         ...'Stead a worshippin' that GOLDEN

               EXT. CHURCH - DAY

               It is a white clapboard country church. The preacher stands 
               at the door chatting with the congregants filing out.

               INT. MUNSON HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY

               Mrs. Munson is at the kitchen table. She folds a five dollar 
               bill into a sheet of paper, raising her voice as she does 
               so:

                                     MRS. MUNSON
                         It was a good sermon. That man has a 
                         lot to say.

               INT. MUNSON HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY

               We have CUT to the portrait of Othar over the mantel. He 
               does not answer.

               From the kitchen:

                                     MRS. MUNSON'S VOICE (O.S.)
                         ...Stout, too. It would've been a 
                         comfort to you...

               INT. MUNSON HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY

               Mrs. Munson has stuffed the paper-enclosed bill into an 
               envelope, which she is now laboriously addressing to Bob 
               Jones University.

                                     MRS. MUNSON
                         And the choir was all in good voice. 
                         Mm-mm-

               There is a knock at the door.

                                     MRS. MUNSON
                         ...Who could that--

               The cat yowls and hisses.

               I/E. MUNSON HOUSE - FOYER - DAY

               As Mrs. Munson swings open the door.

               G.H. Dorr stands on the stoop mournfully dry-washing his 
               hands and obsequiously ducking his head.

                                     DORR
                         My dear Mrs. Munson, I do so hope 
                         this is not an inopportune time for 
                         our first practice--

                                     MRS. MUNSON
                         Somebody die?

                                     DORR
                         I beg your-- Oh!

               He looks back at the long black vintage Lincoln hearse parked 
               at the curb behind him.

                                     DORR
                         ...No no, no bereavement, though it 
                         is so kind of you to enquire. No, 
                         the hearse is simply a vehicle 
                         commodious enough to accommodate all 
                         of the members of our ensemble. And 
                         of course our instruments, contrived 
                         in an age ignorant of 
                         miniaturization...

               He turns and gestures at the vehicle.

               At his sign, Gawain, the custodian, emerges from the driver's 
               side.

               Clark Pancake emerges from the front passenger side.

               The General, wearing a different but equally pressed khaki 
               suit and ascot, and with a smoking cigarette in his lips, 
               emerges from a back door.

               Gawain goes to the back of the hearse and opens its hatch to 
               let out Lump Hudson, the football player.

               Lump helps unload five large and oddly shaped instrument 
               cases, each man taking one except for Lump himself, who 
               carries two. As the parade of losers and misfits winds its 
               way up the walk:

                                     DORR
                         ...Let me introduce you to my friends, 
                         my colleagues, these devoted and 
                         passionate musicians... This is Gawain 
                         MacSam, our bassoonist...

               Gawain nods as he passes by.

                                     DORR
                         ...General Nguyen Pham Doc, viola da 
                         gamba...

                                     MRS. MUNSON
                         No smoking in this house.

               The General tosses his cigarette away and bows stiffly as he 
               passes.

                                     GENERAL
                         So sorry.

                                     DORR
                         ...Clark Pancake -- a multi-
                         instrumentalist, but with his 
                         remarkable embosser Clark specializes 
                         in wind instruments, and is especially 
                         accomplished on the French horn...

               He nods, passes.

                                     DORR
                         ...And, finally, Aloysius "Lump" 
                         Hudson. Lump is our sackbuttist and -- 
                         thank you, Lump -- I see you've also 
                         brought my fiddle...

               As he hands Dorr the violin case:

                                     LUMP
                         Here's your fiddle, Doctor.

               Mrs. Munson sizes up the group.

                                     MRS. MUNSON
                         You ain't gonna make a racket, are 
                         ya?

                                     DORR
                         Oh no. Oh no no no no no. No, we 
                         shall recuse ourselves to the basement 
                         where we shall be -- I think here 
                         the expression is uniquely 
                         appropriate...

               He gives a sickly smile.

                                     DORR
                         ...as quiet as the crypt.

                                     MRS. MUNSON
                         Hmph.

               INT. MUNSON HOUSE - CELLAR - DAY

               The General stands stock still, his nose an inch away from 
               the earthen wall, studying it, squinting through the smoke 
               of the cigarette pinched between his lips.

               The rest of the men are opening their cases and taking out 
               the instruments. Gawain's case contains, however, not a 
               musical instrument but a boombox and several tapes. He loads 
               one of the tapes into the machine.

                                     DORR
                         What do you think, General? Present 
                         any problems?

               After a beat the General turns away from the wall to give 
               Dorr a look into which one might read anything, or nothing.

               Gawain hits play on the boombox and the cellar is filled 
               with the fussy strains of baroque chamber music.

               Dorr nods.

                                     DORR
                         ...Good then.

               He spreads a map open on the sackbutt case.

                                     DORR
                         ...All right, gentlemen, why don't 
                         we all crowd around and go over the 
                         plan.

               The biggest feature on the map is a wavy, roughly north-south 
               pair of lines: a river. A boat icon sits at one edge and 
               from it a dotted rectangle extends inland.

               Dorr taps at the boat icon with his fiddle bow.

                                     DORR
                         ...This, gentlemen, is the Lady Luck, 
                         gambling den, cash cow, Sodom of the 
                         Mississippi delta -- and the focus 
                         of our little exercise. Here is 
                         Orchard Street...

               He is tracing a street that parallels the dotted rectangle 
               extending from the boat. The street is lined by small house 
               icons on either side; the bow comes to rest on one of those 
               icons.

                                     DORR
                         ...and here is the residence of Marva 
                         Munson, the charming lady whom y'all 
                         met moments ago. Gentlemen...

               Bow taps emphasize:

                                     DORR
                         ...You... are... here. Now. This 
                         brings us to this square...

               The bow indicates it, and then withdraws.

               Dorr uses the bow as a swagger stick to punctuate as he begins 
               to pace.

                                     DORR
                         ...Gentlemen, I believe you are all 
                         aware that the Solons of the State 
                         of Mississippi, to wit, its 
                         legislature, have decreed that no 
                         gaming establishment shall be erected 
                         within its borders upon dry land. 
                         They may, however, legally float 
                         upon any watercourse defining a state 
                         boundary. But while the gambling 
                         activity itself is restricted to 
                         riverboats, no such restriction 
                         applies to the functions ancillary 
                         to this cash besotted bidnis. The 
                         casino's offices, locker rooms, 
                         facilities to cook and clean, and 
                         most importantly its counting houses-
                         the reinforced, secret, and super 
                         secure repositories of the lucre -- 
                         may all be situated... wherever. 
                         Gawain -- where is wherever?

                                     GAWAIN
                         Say wha?

               Dorr's smug smile fades. Testily:

                                     DORR
                         Where is the money?

                                     GAWAIN
                         Oh. End of every shift pit boss brings 
                         the cash down to the hold of the 
                         ship in the locked cash box; once a 
                         day all the cash boxes're moved to 
                         the counting room.

                                     DORR
                         And where is the counting room?

                                     GAWAIN
                         Well, uh... in that square there. 
                         Where you pointing.

                                     DORR
                         And what, to flog a horse that if 
                         not at this point dead is in mortal 
                         danger of expirin', does the dotted 
                         square represent?

               Gawain hesitates, the question's obviousness suggesting to 
               him some trick.

                                     GAWAIN
                         ...Offices. Underground.

               Dorr's eyes close. A smile of feline contentment curls his 
               lips. He murmurs:

                                     DORR
                         Underground... Mmm... During the 
                         casino's hours of operation the door 
                         to the counting room is fiercely 
                         guarded, and the door itself is of 
                         redoubtable Pittsburgh steel; when 
                         the casino is closed the entire 
                         underground complex is locked up and 
                         the armed guard retreats to the 
                         casino's main entrance. There, then, 
                         far from the guard, reposes the money, 
                         cosseted behind a five-inch-thick 
                         steel portal, yes, but the walls, 
                         gentlemen, the walls of that room, 
                         are but humble masonry, behind which 
                         is only the soft loamy soil deposited 
                         over the centuries by Ol' Man, the 
                         meanderin' Mississip', as it fanned 
                         its way back and forth across this 
                         great alluvial plain...

               He has pried a fistfull of dirt from the cellar wall.

                                     DORR
                         ...This earth.

               He crumbles it, letting it sift to the floor, and then, 
               pleased with himself, he smiles.

                                     DORR
                         ...Any questions?

               Lump looks around, then hesitantly raises his hand.

                                     DORR
                         ...Yes, Lump?

                                     LUMP
                         What, uh... what does "cosseted" 
                         mean?

               Once again Dorr's smile fades. He does not dignify the 
               question with answer.

                                     DORR
                         The General here, whose curriculum 
                         vitae compahends massive tunneling 
                         experience thoo the soil of his native 
                         French-Indochina, will direct our 
                         little ol' tunnelin' operation.

               The General acknowledges with a curt nod.

                                     DORR
                         ...Clark Pancake, while a master of 
                         none, is a jack of all those trades 
                         corollary to our aim. He will be 
                         doin' such fabricatin' and demolition 
                         work as our little caper shall 
                         require.

               Clark acknowledges verbally:

                         Happy to be on board.

                                     DORR
                         Gawain is the proverbial "inside 
                         man". He has managed to secure a 
                         berth on the custodial staff of the 
                         Lady Luck, thereby placin' himself 
                         in a position to perform certain 
                         chores whose precise nature needn't 
                         detain us here, but whose performance 
                         shall guide this expedition to its 
                         happy conclusion.

                                     GAWAIN
                         Ya damn skippy.

                                     DORR
                         And this brings us to Lump. To look 
                         at Lump you might wonder, what 
                         function could he possibly fill, 
                         what specialized expertise could he 
                         possibly offer, to our merry little 
                         ol' band a miscreants. Well gentlemen, 
                         in a project of such magnitude and 
                         such risks, it is traditional -- 
                         nay, it is imperative -- to enlist 
                         the services of a hooligan, a goon, 
                         an ape, a physical brute, who will 
                         be our security, our fist, our 
                         batterin' ram. Lump is our blunt 
                         instrument, and on all our behalfs I 
                         wish him a warm Mississippi welcome.

                                     LUMP
                         Thanks, Professor.

                                     DORR
                         Well gentlemen, here you are, men of 
                         different backgrounds and differing 
                         talents, men with, in fact only two 
                         things in common: one, you all saw 
                         fit to answer my little advertisement 
                         in the Memphis Scimitar, and, two, 
                         you are all going to be, in 
                         consequence, very very incredibly 
                         rich. Let us revel in our adventure, 
                         gentlemen. Let us make beautiful 
                         music together. And above all, 
                         gentlemen, let us keep it to 
                         ourselves. What we say in this root 
                         cellar, let it stay in this root 
                         cellar.

                                     LUMP
                         There's no "I" in "team".

               All stare at him.

                                     DORR
                         ...Lump has a very excellent point.

               The music swells, supported now by a male chorus that has 
               the spirited manliness of the Red Army choir. We

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               INT. MUNSON HOUSE - BASEMENT - NIGHT

               The men at work, tunneling.

               The cat sits on the cellar floor, head cocked, gazing at the 
               hole now opened in the wall.

               Lump, in a sleeveless undershirt, glistening with sweat, 
               wields a pickaxe at the forward point.

               At the mouth of the hole Clark Pancake shovels dirt into a 
               heavy plastic refuse bag held open by Gawain.

               G.H. Dorr sits on a camp chair, one hand idly waving time to 
               the music, reading an old and yellowed tome with half-glasses 
               perched midway down his nose.

               The General hops nimbly out of the tunnel and unzips and 
               steps out of his all-in-one to reveal, underneath, his neatly 
               pressed leisure suit and ascot.

               INT. MUNSON HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

               Later, Dorr stands at the head of the cellar stairs, looking 
               around the empty parlor. He gives a nod down the stairs and 
               the men troop up past him, carrying sacks of earth.

               Over the mantelpiece, the eternal flame of the devotional 
               candle almost animating his features, Othar seems to watch 
               the men as they cross to the front door.

               EXT. MUNSON HOUSE - NIGHT

               The men load the earth into the hearse.

               EXT. MISSISSIPPI RIVER - NIGHT

               We are at the Mississippi bridge that we saw in the prologue 
               to the movie, but now, in dead of night, deserted.

               The hearse is pulling up at the middle of the bridge and 
               dimming its lights. The men emerge; when they open the back 
               of the hearse to pull out the sacks, the cat bounds out to 
               watch from a distance.

               We watch the men from HIGH, ANGLED DOWN along the masonry of 
               a tower that stands in the middle of the suspension bridge. 
               An ornamental gargoyle leers in the foreground.

               The garbage scow is approaching. We hear the low toot of its 
               horn as it nears the bridge.

               Lump is poised with the first sack hugged to his chest, 
               leaning over the railing.

               The nose of the barge enters below us.

               Lump releases the sack.

               We watch it drop dead away like a bomb from an airplane.

               It thuds distantly onto the barge. The next sack has been 
               passed up to Lump and is released.

               The cat watches. Its orange eyes blink. Its pupils adjust.

               INT. MUNSON HOUSE - CELLAR - NIGHT

               A PULL BACK shows that the cat is in fact back in the 
               basement.

               Its POV: continued tunneling.

               Back to the cat, watching, then turning its head at a noise:

               At the head of the stairs, the cellar door is opening.

               A whistle from the General and Lump and Clark Pancake scramble 
               from the tunnel. They whip a curtain over its opening and 
               all men grab up their instruments as Dorr, covering with a 
               cough, turns off the CD player.

               The General, his ever-present cigarette smoldering between 
               his lips, tongue-and-lips it up and backwards so that it is 
               inside his mouth, which he now closes.

               Marva Munson is heavily and carefully descending the stairs. 
               As the men come into view they are looking up at her, Lump 
               holding his sackbutt but still glistening with sweat and 
               smeared with dirt.

                                     MRS. MUNSON
                         That's okay, don't stop on account 
                         of me.

               Lump looks around, saucer-eyed, then blows gamely into his 
               sackbutt. It sounds like goose farts until Dorr waves him 
               down.

                                     DORR
                         No no, madam, we were about to take 
                         a break anyway. The glissandi on 
                         this particular piece are technically 
                         very demanding and I think we would 
                         all welcome a moment of relaxation.

                                     MRS. MUNSON
                         Huh. I just thought you might like 
                         to see-what a you gotten up to, honey? 
                         Why you sweatin' like that.

               It is directed at Lump, who looks down at his own sweat-
               stained undershirt.

                                     LUMP
                         I, uh...

                                     GAWAIN
                         That man plays one bitch barrelful a 
                         sackbutt. Ain't no one can blow the 
                         tenor sackbutt like Lump, hoowee! 
                         goes at that thing like it was a pu-- 
                         uh, like it was a woman! Goddamn! He--

               She cuffs him on the head.

                                     MRS. MUNSON
                         You mind! I don't want that kind of 
                         talk in my home, even in the root 
                         cellar. This is a Christian house, 
                         boy, none of that hippity-hop 
                         language.

                                     DORR
                         Sadly, Gawain is given to--

               WHAP! She slaps Gawain again.

                                     MRS. MUNSON
                         Sometimes it's the only way!

               He untenses after what seemed like the final blow, but -- 
               WHAP! -- she slaps him again.

                                     MRS. MUNSON
                         ...I'm tryin' to help you, son!

               WHAP!

                                     MRS. MUNSON
                         ...Better yaself!

                                     DORR
                         As well you should, ma'am. But Gawain 
                         at times is so far transported by 
                         his love of the music of the early 
                         Renaissance as to--

                                     MRS. MUNSON
                         Don't make no never-mind he's 
                         transported!

               Dorr has her by the elbow and is ushering her back up the 
               stairs.

                                     DORR
                         I understand your--

               She pulls her elbow away and sniffs.

                                     MRS. MUNSON
                         You been smokin'?

                                     DORR
                         Certainly not, madam. I understand 
                         your indignation. And I was offering 
                         explanation, not excuse. I myself am 
                         offended by those who cannot find 
                         the proper words to express themselves 
                         and have recourse to--

               Gawain calls up the stairs:

                                     GAWAIN
                         Don't you be explainin' me, dawg! 
                         You can't look into my mind, cape 
                         man!

                                     DORR
                         Yes, yes...

               Dorr's tone is soothing as he shuts the door at the top of 
               the stairs.

                                     DORR
                         ...A fiery lad! But then Youth is 
                         fiery! A fact often remarked upon by 
                         the poets of the Romantic era.

                                     MRS. MUNSON
                         My youth I was in church, I wasn't 
                         walkin' around fiery. Youth ain't no 
                         excuse for nothin'! Well, anyway... 
                         only came down to show you the fife.

               She hands him a thick, roughly whittled piece of cane. Dorr 
               holds it, looks at it dumbly. He is, for the first time that 
               we have seen anyway, non-plussed.

                                     MRS. MUNSON
                         ...Othar's fife. He burned his own.

               Dorr tries to summon conversation as the two sit with their 
               backs to the fireplace:

                                     DORR
                         ...Did he?

                                     MRS. MUNSON
                         Mm-hm. I thought maybe bein' a musical 
                         man you'd be interested.

                                     DORR
                         Oh, I am indeed--

                                     MRS. MUNSON
                         Cut it himself and burned the holes. 
                         Israelites called it a kalil.

                                     DORR
                         Ah.

                                     MRS. MUNSON
                         Kalil, fife, same thing. You can 
                         read about it in the Bible. Ain't 
                         nothin' new under the sun.

                                     DORR
                         Indeed not.

                                     MRS. MUNSON
                         Gone these twenty years. He was some 
                         kind of man.

               From Othar's POV, slightly high, we see them both twist in 
               their chairs to look up at the portrait.

               REVERSE of the portrait, LOW ANGLE. Othar looks down at us 
               with what appears to be bemusement.

               Marva Munson and Dorr gaze up at the portrait for a motionless 
               beat. At length, Marva Munson sighs:

                                     MRS. MUNSON
                         ...Blowed the kalil.

               Dorr's eyes remain on the picture as he inquires:

                                     DORR
                         ...I don't suppose Othar ever turned 
                         his hand -- or, uh, heh-heh-heh, 
                         turned his lip -- to the shofar?

               Prompted by her silence, he adds:

                                     DORR
                         ...The ceremonial ram's horn, sounded 
                         by the priests of the Hebrews?

                         I don't know nothin' 'bout that. 
                         Othar didn't study no shofar, to the 
                         extent a my knowledge. The kalil was 
                         good enough for my Othar...

               She gazes at the portrait.

                                     MRS. MUNSON
                         ...Some kind of man.

               TRACKING BEHIND A SASHAYING ASS

               following a woman in a red dress.

                                     GAWAIN (O.S.)
                         Hey baby, don't be cruel. Jus' sneak 
                         one little peek...

               The woman looks back over her shoulder, smiling, as she 
               continues to walk.

                                     GAWAIN
                         ...Don't let this uniform fool ya--

               REVERSE PULLING TRACK

               leads Gawain MacSam, pushing his wheeled trash bin.

                                     GAWAIN
                         You don't need to be gamblin', honey, 
                         you lookin' at a sure thing. They 
                         call me Mr. 21, baby, 'cause that's 
                         how I measure up. I am the original 
                         black Jack, honey, accept no 
                         substitutions. You can pull my lever 
                         all day long, sweet mama, I ain't 
                         never gonna come up lemons. That's 
                         right, sugar, you can blow on my 
                         dice any ol' time.

               INT. CASINO - GUDGE'S OFFICE - DAY

               Gudge has his feet up on the desk and is filing his nails 
               with an emery board.

                                     GAWAIN
                         But Mr. Gudge, she had an ass that 
                         could pull a bus. This lady was fine, 
                         fine, dandy, divine.

                                     GUDGE
                         I don't care how big her ass was, 
                         MacSam. You're fired.

                                     GAWAIN
                         Say what?

                                     GUDGE
                         There is no fraternizing with

                         But Gudge-

                                     GUDGE
                         Get out of here. You're fired.

                                     GAWAIN
                         You can't fire me. I sue your ass!

                                     GUDGE
                         Sue me? For what?

                                     GAWAIN
                         Sue you for fuckin' punitive damages, 
                         man!

                                     GUDGE
                         Punitive damages.

                                     GAWAIN
                         Ya damn skippy. I know you firin' my 
                         ass 'cause I'm black!

                                     GUDGE
                         Everyone on the custodial staff is 
                         black, MacSam. Your replacement's 
                         gonna be black. His replacement will 
                         no doubt be black.

                                     GAWAIN
                         Fuckin' judge is gonna be black,

               EXT. WAFFLE HOUSE - DAY

               VERY HIGH ANGLE

               We are looking down past the distinctive pylon-mounted yellow 
               letters: WAFFLE.

               INT. WAFFLE HOUSE - DAY

               The band of miscreants is seated around a table with cups of 
               coffee. Dorr's wardrobe makes no concession to the informality 
               of the setting; he still wears his cape and a black string 
               tie. His manner is more mournful even than usual:

                                     DORR
                         Oh my. Oh my my my my my. This is a 
                         severe setback. I am distraught. I 
                         am more than distraught, I am 
                         devastated. Oh my, this is quite the 
                         monkey-wrench heaved into the 
                         meticulously engineered construct of 
                         our little escapade.

                                     LUMP
                         Yeah, it fucks things up.

                                     DORR
                         I am beside myself. I am at a positive 
                         loss for words.

                                     GAWAIN
                         You still talkin' okay though.

                                     WAITRESS
                         Have you all decided?

               Dorr's intensely mournful agitation is brought to bear upon 
               her:

                                     DORR
                         Oh madam, we must have waffles. We 
                         must all have waffles forthwith!

               They hand in their menus.

                                     DORR
                         ...Oh we must think. We must all 
                         have waffles and think, each and 
                         every one of us to the very best of 
                         his ability! Perhaps if you apologized 
                         to the man and gave him flowers, or 
                         perhaps a fruit basket, with a card 
                         depicting a misty seascape and 
                         inscribed with a sentiment.

                                     GAWAIN
                         Shit, man, it ain't about apologizin'! 
                         He fired me 'cause I'm black!

                                     PANCAKE
                         He can't do that. You could sue him. 
                         Open and shut case.

                                     GAWAIN
                         Fuckin' A.

                                     PANCAKE
                         This is not 1952.

                                     GAWAIN
                         Man's a fuckin' bigot.

                                     DORR
                         Well then, perhaps, surely, a 
                         chocolate assortment has been known 
                         to warm the heart of even the most 
                         hardened misanthrope, especially if 
                         it's a premium chocolate, imported, 
                         say, from Switzerland, or the 
                         Netherlands, or some other of the so-
                         called "Low" countries be they Dutch 
                         or Flemish or Walloon--

                                     GAWAIN
                         Walloon my ass, the man ain't gonna 
                         roll over for a fuckin' candy bar!

                                     PANCAKE
                         I'm afraid there's a setback on the 
                         tunneling front too. We've run into 
                         a pretty large rock, and--

                                     GENERAL
                         -- Rock!

               All turn to look at the General. He continues to stare at a 
               spot in space. He slowly releases some inhaled cigarette 
               smoke, murmuring:

                                     GENERAL
                         ...Very bad.

                                     DORR
                         Oh my my, it seems that the poet was 
                         right: Troubles never singly come.

                                     PANCAKE
                         Oh, we can get through the rock, no 
                         worries there. Simplest thing in the 
                         world. Why we blow right through it; 
                         I've got a pyro license, we bore a 
                         hole in the rock, pack in a little 
                         plastique; igneous blows pretty good, 
                         and we--

                                     LUMP
                         Is he gonna want a piece of the 
                         action?

               All turn to look at Lump.

                                     PANCAKE
                         ...Who?

               Lump hesitates, looking at the inquiring faces that surround 
               him.

                                     LUMP
                         ...Igneous?

               A female Voice:

                                     MOUNTAIN GIRL (O.S.)
                         Hello Clark. Am I ordering the prima 
                         cord?

               The men look up at her.

                                     PANCAKE
                         Yes, Mountain, we were just talking 
                         about that, and some plastique.

               All the men are staring at her, agog.

                                     GAWAIN
                         ...The fuck is this?

                                     PANCAKE
                         This is Mountain Girl. Mountain is 
                         my right hand. She helps me with 
                         ordnance. Helps me with damn near 
                         everything.

               The men stare.

                                     GAWAIN
                         ...You brought your bitch to the 
                         waffle house?!

               There is tension in the air. Dorr clears his throat.

                                     DORR
                         I confess myself to be puzzled as 
                         well. I thought we all understood 
                         that, so far as our little enterprise 
                         is concerned, mum, as the saying 
                         would have it, is the word--

                                     PANCAKE
                         Of course. I understand that. But 
                         this is Mountain...

               He chuckles.

                                     PANCAKE
                         ...I don't keep secrets from Mountain. 
                         That's not how you maintain a loving, 
                         caring relationship.

                                     GAWAIN
                         ...You brought your bitch to the 
                         waffle house?

               He looks around.

                                     GAWAIN
                         ...Man brings his bitch to the waffle 
                         house!

                                     PANCAKE
                         Look, you, I'll thank you to stop 
                         referring to Mountain that way. She's 
                         the other half of my life.

                                     GAWAIN
                         Everybody lookin' at me like I'm a 
                         fuck-up, losin' that sorry-ass job, 
                         and this motherfucker bring his bitch 
                         to the waffle house!

               Pancake lunges across the table, sending dishes clattering 
               to the floor as he grabs Gawain by the shirt.

                                     PANCAKE
                         You son of a bitch punk! Shut your 
                         goddamn mouth!

               He shakes him vigorously and rears back to take a swing at 
               him.

               Gawain draws a gun.

                                     GAWAIN
                         Come and get me motherfuck! Come on, 
                         baby, let's get it on!

               Mountain starts screaming.

               People look, aghast.

                                     DORR
                         Gentlemen, please!

               The other men pry Pancake and Gawain apart.

                                     DORR
                         ...Gentlemen, this sort of behavior 
                         does you no credit in the eyes of 
                         your colleagues, or in those of the 
                         other patrons of this waffle house!

               Pancake grumbles as he composes himself and straighten his 
               clothes.

                                     PANCAKE
                         ...Nobody talks to Mountain Girl 
                         that way. She had an abusive family!

                                     GAWAIN
                         Fuck you, man.

                                     PANCAKE
                         Little punk. I got syrup on my safari 
                         jacket.

               He embraces Mountain, who continues to sob quietly.

                                     DORR
                         Gentlemen, I propose that we consider 
                         the matter of this woman, Mountain 
                         Water, to be--

                                     PANCAKE
                         Mountain Girl.

                                     DORR
                         I am so very sorry. I propose that 
                         we consider this matter to be closed, 
                         and we shall chose to trust her, 
                         since we now have no choice, and 
                         since she shall share only in Mr. 
                         Pancake's portion of the booty.

               Over the shoulder of the quietly weeping Mountain Girl:

                                     PANCAKE
                         Of course. Wouldn't have it any other 
                         way.

                                     GAWAIN
                         Damn right you won't.

                                     PANCAKE
                         Up yours, punk.

                                     DORR
                         Gentlemen! And the manner of disposing 
                         of our igneous impediment is also 
                         settled. That leaves only the question 
                         of Gawain retrieving his job.

                                     LUMP
                         Couldn't you just bribe the guy?

               All turn to look at Lump.

               INT. MUNSON LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

               Othar looks serenely down from his spot over the mantelpiece. 
               Marva Munson knits; G.H. Dorr sits nodding over an ancient 
               volume of half-forgotten lore, reading glasses perched midway 
               down his nose. Curtains waft lazily in the summer night 
               breeze.

                                     MRS. MUNSON
                         ...You just a readin' fool, ain't 
                         you Mr. Dorr.

                                     DORR
                         Yes yes, I must confess, madam, that 
                         often I feel more at home in these 
                         ancient volumes than I do in the 
                         hustle-bustle of our modern world. 
                         To me, paradoxically, the literature 
                         of the so-called "dead tongues" has 
                         more currency than this mornin's 
                         newspaper.

                                     MRS. MUNSON
                         Mm-mm.

                                     DORR
                         In these books...

               He removes his glasses and lazily twirls them.

                                     DORR
                         ...In these volumes, there is the 
                         accum'lated wisdom a mankind which 
                         succours me when the day is hard or 
                         the night lonely and long.

                                     MRS. MUNSON
                         Wisdom of mankind, what about the 
                         wisdom of the Lord?

                                     DORR
                         Oh yes, the Good Book, mm. I have 
                         found reward in its pages. But for 
                         me there are other good books as 
                         well; the heavy volumes of Antiquity, 
                         freighted with the insights of Man's 
                         glorious age. And then of course I 
                         love, love, love the works of Mr. Ed 
                         G'Allan Poe.

                                     MRS. MUNSON
                         I know who he is. Kinda creepy.

                                     DORR
                         Oh no, madam, noooo. Not of this 
                         world, true; he lived in a dream, an 
                         ancient dream...

               Dorr himself is lost in a dream:

                                     DORR
                         "Helen, they beauty is to me Like 
                         those Nicean barks a yore That gently, 
                         o'er a perfumed sea, The weary, 
                         wayworn wanderer bore To his own 
                         native shore... "

                                     MRS. MUNSON
                         Who was Helen? She wasn't a loose 
                         woman, was she? Some kinda whore a 
                         Babylon?

               Dorr is still lost:

                                     DORR
                         One doesn't know who Helen was, though 
                         I picture her as bein' very, very 
                         extremely... pale.

               He comes to himself, focuses on Mrs. Munson.

                                     DORR
                         ...Miz Munson, I was tryin' to think 
                         of some way of expressin' my gratitude 
                         to you for takin' in...

               He chuckles.

                                     DORR
                         ...this weary, wayworn wanderer...

               The Professor takes a small ticket envelope from where it 
               had served as bookmark, and hands it across.

                                     DORR
                         ...It's just a modest little ol' 
                         present, why it's practically nothing 
                         at all.

               Beaming, she takes two tickets out of the envelope and 
               inspects them.

                                     MRS. MUNSON
                         Oh Mr. Dorr, why you are such a 
                         gallant man...

                                     DORR
                         Oh no madam, I blush. I melt. No, I 
                         just happened to hear of this gospel 
                         concert tomorrow night, The Mighty 
                         Mighty Clouds of Joy, and I thought 
                         you and a friend from church, 
                         perhaps...

                                     MRS. MUNSON
                         Othar loved that music... Yes, I got 
                         a widow-lady friend...

                                     DORR
                         The concert is up in Memphis, but I 
                         have arranged for a car service to 
                         transport you thither and, needless 
                         to say, back home at the concert's 
                         termination. My friends and I will 
                         be rehearsing here tomorrow evening 
                         so you needn't worry about the 
                         security of your charming little old 
                         house...

               There is a knock at the door.

                                     MRS. MUNSON
                         Huh? Excuse me.

               I/E. MUNSON HOUSE - FOYER - NIGHT

               Mrs. Munson swings the door open to Sheriff Wyner. His squad 
               car is parked at the curb.

                                     MRS. MUNSON
                         Sheriff Wyner, how you doin'...

               INT. MUNSON HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

               The Professor's eyes widen with concern as he hears the 
               voices, off:

                                     SHERIFF (O.S.)
                         Evenin', Miz Munson, I just came 
                         by...

               I/E. MUNSON HOUSE - FOYER - NIGHT

               The sheriff is tipping his hat and already backing away, 
               trying to make his visit brief:

                                     SHERIFF
                         ...to let you know I had a word with 
                         WeeMack. He says he gonna comply 
                         with your request, keep the music 
                         down and neighborly.

                                     MRS. MUNSON
                         Mm-hm.

               He calls from the bottom of the stoop:

                                     SHERIFF
                         So you have a pleasant evening now, 
                         and just let us know--

                                     MRS. MUNSON
                         Hang on there, Sheriff, somebody I 
                         want you to meet.

                                     SHERIFF
                         Ma'am, I'm a little pressed for time--

                                     MRS. MUNSON
                         Why, you chasin' a gang of bank 
                         robbers? Get on in here say hello.

               INT. MUNSON HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

               The Voices approach:

                                     MRS. MUNSON
                         ...We was just havin' tea, talkin' 
                         about Othar--

               The two enter and Mrs. Munson stops short, looking.

               The living room is empty. Even the Professor's teacup is 
               gone.

                                     MRS. MUNSON
                         ...Hm... Bussed his own dishes. You 
                         can always tell a gentleman.

               The sheriff, hat in hand, gazes about.

                                     SHERIFF
                         Someone was here, ma'am?

                                     MRS. MUNSON
                         Mm-hm, with me'n Othar.

               Once again, he tries to excuse himself:

                                     SHERIFF
                         Well, maybe I'll catch him next 
                         time...

                                     MRS. MUNSON
                         Come on up to his room.

               INT. MUNSON HOUSE - DORR'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

               The door opens and the two look in.

               The neatly made bed next to the small, barren dresser.

                                     MRS. MUNSON
                         Mm, he's neat.

                                     SHERIFF
                         Very neat.

                                     MRS. MUNSON
                         Probably went down to the cellar to 
                         play with his friends.

               She turns.

                                     SHERIFF
                         Ma'am, I really have to...

               POV FROM UNDER THE BED

               Top-teased by a dust ruffle in the foreground, we see Mrs. 
               Munson's heavy orthopedic shoes turning to pass Sheriff 
               Wyner's shiny black boots.

               REVERSE

               shows Dorr, cheek pressed to the floor, his teacup and saucer 
               under the bed with him.

                                     SHERIFF
                         ...be gettin' back...

               BACK TO NORMAL PERSPECTIVE

               Mrs. Munson is about to go out the door but notices something:

               A corner of the Professor's cape, protruding from under the 
               end of the bed.

                                     MRS. MUNSON
                         What the...

               BACK TO DORR

               fearfully watching.

               HIS POV

               The heavy orthopedic shoes approach, and then, with loud Mr. 
               Mogul sounds of effort, Mrs. Munson's hands and knees hit 
               the floor.

               Her head drops in to view to peer in, her own cheek against 
               the floorboards.

                                     MRS. MUNSON
                         ...What the... Why, Professor!

               We see the Sheriff watching and his HIGH POV of Mrs. Munson's 
               enormous ass.

                                     MRS. MUNSON
                         ...What you doin' havin' tea down 
                         there?!

               Dorr makes silent hand waves to disavow his own presence.

               Mrs. Munson roars with laughter.

               With difficulty she pushes herself back upright, still 
               laughing.

                                     MRS. MUNSON
                         ...Land of Goshen! Get out from under 
                         there!

                                     SHERIFF
                         Miz Munson, my pager just went off...

                                     MRS. MUNSON
                         Why of all the...

               INT. MUNSON HOUSE - STAIRCASE/FOYER - NIGHT

               The Sheriff is already backing down the stairs:

                                     SHERIFF
                         'Fraid I gotta respond...

               He opens the front door and calls up:

                                     SHERIFF
                         ...I'll try to meet your friend some 
                         other time.

               INT. MUNSON HOUSE - DORR'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

               Dorr shimmies out from under the bed.

                                     DORR
                         Well that was very... refreshing... 
                         As you know...

               He gets to his feet, slaps dust from the front of his pants.

                                     DORR
                         ...we academics are inordinately 
                         fond of wedgin' ourselves into 
                         confined spaces. At Yale the students 
                         will see how many of their number 
                         they can enclose in a telephone booth; 
                         Harvard, a broom closet.

                                     MRS. MUNSON
                         Why I never!

                                     DORR
                         There was the goldfish-swallowin' 
                         craze, of course, a different but 
                         related phenomenon... Ahem... I hope 
                         I didn't spill any tea...

               INT. CASINO - GUDGE'S OFFICE - DAY

               CLOSE ON A BOX OF CHOCOLATES

               The box is being pulled open.

                                     GUDGE (O.S.)
                         What the hell is this?

               WIDER

               shows Gawain in Mr. Gudge's office as Gudge, behind the desk, 
               looks at the gift-wrapped box.

                                     GAWAIN
                         It's just my way of sayin', well, 
                         goddamnit, I don't know what it's 
                         like walkin' in your shoes, bein' 
                         all tightass and all, and you don't 
                         know what it's like to walk in my 
                         shoes, but, well...

               Gudge is opening a card that was inside the box. Its floral 
               front says in gold script, "I'm Sorry... If I hurt your 
               feelings... "

                                     GAWAIN
                         ...You know, there's the custodian, 
                         and then there's the man inside the 
                         custodian, y'understand what I'm 
                         sayin'...

               Gudge opens the card. Inside is a hundred-dollar bill.

                                     GAWAIN
                         ...and that man has needs, dig, and 
                         I guess those needs, Mr. Gudge, which 
                         they usually involve women with big 
                         asses, well those motherfuckin' needs 
                         sometimes well up over the custodian 
                         like the motherfuckin' Johnstown 
                         Flood. But my point is it ain't gonna 
                         happen again. Not if it's humanly 
                         possible...

               Gudge reads the card, flips it over to look at its back.

                                     GUDGE
                         Hmm...

                                     GAWAIN
                         But Jesus, if you'd seen the ass on 
                         that girl, Mr. Gudge, you'd a wanted 
                         her sitting on your face too.

                                     GUDGE
                         Well, we're all human.

                                     GAWAIN
                         Ya damn skippy.

                                     GUDGE
                         This apology buys you a one-week 
                         probationary period. Stay away from 
                         the customers, MacSam.

               INT. TUNNEL - NIGHT

               Pancake is on his stomach, wearing goggles, boring a hole 
               into a rock face with a power drill.

               INT. MUNSON HOUSE - CELLAR - NIGHT

               We hear the whine of the drill faintly here, all but covered 
               by the sound of the chamber music on the boom box.

               The other men sit around. Dorr gives a casual glance at his 
               watch as the whine subsides.

               Pancake emerges from the tunnel covered with grime.

                                     PANCAKE
                         The drill bit's getting awfully hot. 
                         Gawain, maybe you could fill a hudson 
                         sprayer and spritz it down while I 
                         drill.

                                     GAWAIN
                         Fuck you, man, I ain't your house 
                         nigger. I'm the inside man!

                                     PANCAKE
                         Look, are you gonna have a bug up 
                         your ass for the rest of the time we 
                         work together?

                                     LUMP
                         I'll get the sprayer.

                                     PANCAKE
                         No no, me and this gentleman here 
                         have to get square. Let me tell you 
                         something, MacSam. You wanna know 
                         something?

                                     GAWAIN
                         I don't wanna know shit from you.

               Pancake leans against the wall and pushes his goggles up on 
               his forehead, leaving raccoon eyes.

                                     PANCAKE
                         I'm gonna tell you how I came down 
                         to Mississippi. Wasn't born here, 
                         you know. I'm from Scranton, 
                         Pennsylvania...

               Abruptly, he stares off into space.

                                     PANCAKE
                         ...Nnnff!

                                     GAWAIN
                         Huh?

               Pancake's eyes regain their focus:

                                     PANCAKE
                         ...Scranton, Pennsylvania. Came down 
                         here in 1964. Greyhound Bus. With 
                         the Freedom Riders. You know who the 
                         Freedom Riders were, MacSam?

                                     GAWAIN
                         I don't give a shit who they were. 
                         Just tell me when they gonna leave.

                                     PANCAKE
                         The Freedom Riders, my fine young 
                         man, were a group of concerned 
                         liberals from up North -- whites, 
                         Negros, and yes, Jewish people -- 
                         all working together, just like we 
                         are here. Concerned citizens who 
                         came down here so that local black 
                         people could have their civil 
                         liberties. So that people like you 
                         could have the vote.

               All look at Pancake. Quiet, except for the delicate chamber 
               music.

               Gawain's tone softens:

                                     GAWAIN
                         ...You know what, man?

                                     PANCAKE
                         What, brother?

                                     GAWAIN
                         I don't vote. So fuck you.

               Pancake darkens:

                                     PANCAKE
                         Why you fucking--

                                     GAWAIN
                         And the bus you rode in on!

                                     PANCAKE
                         That's it!

               He peels off his coat.

                                     PANCAKE
                         ...Let's step outside, MacSam!

               There is a knock on the cellar door. The men freeze 
               momentarily, then scramble for their instruments. The General 
               flips his cigarette backwards into his mouth.

               Dorr turns off the boom box, then calls:

                                     DORR
                         Yes, madam?

               The door opens and Mrs. Munson comes down the stairs, holding 
               a large plate covered by a checked napkin.

                                     MRS. MUNSON
                         My friend Mrs. Funthes is here so 
                         I'm about to go on out. I just wanted 
                         to leave y'all with some cinnamon 
                         cookies...

               She takes the napkin off and carries the plate from person 
               to person; each obediently takes a cookie with a murmured 
               "Thank you, ma'am."

                                     MRS. MUNSON
                         ...Y'all sound pretty good. It'd be 
                         nice if you'd come by the church 
                         some day, give us a recital.

               Dorr takes her by the arm and escorts her back to the stairs.

                                     DORR
                         Oh madam, you are too kind. Our music, 
                         however, is -- how shall I put it? -- 
                         rather Roman in its outlook; many of 
                         our pieces were commissioned by the 
                         Holy See.

                                     MRS. MUNSON
                         Oh, I see all right, but we don't 
                         make a big whoop-dee-do about 
                         denominations; everybody welcome at 
                         our church. We've had Methodists 
                         come in. Episcopals. Even had a Jew 
                         come in once with a guitar back in 
                         the sixties.

                                     DORR
                         Indeed. Excuse me, one moment, ma'am, 
                         and I shall see you off...

               They have reached the top of the stairs and the Professor 
               ushers her out but stays behind himself. He turns to address 
               the rest of the men below:

                                     DORR
                         ...If you gentlemen can labor 
                         harmoniously in the course of my 
                         absence, then perhaps upon my return 
                         we shall be prepared to explode that 
                         vexin' ol' piece a igneous.

                                     GAWAIN
                         He's the motherfuckin' piece of 
                         igneous.

               INT. MUNSON HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

               The Professor emerges from the cellar. Mrs. Munson awaits 
               with her friend who is likewise togged out in fancy Sunday 
               dress and carrying a shiny black purse.

                                     MRS. MUNSON
                         Professor, this is Rosalie Funthes, 
                         Rosalie, Professor G.H. Dorr, Ph.D.

                                     ROSALIE
                         Oh my, that's an awful lot of letters.

                                     DORR
                         Well of course in my youth I was 
                         simply known as Goldthwait...

               INT. MUNSON HOUSE - CELLAR - NIGHT

               Pancake is taking the boom box off the table to clear some 
               space.

                                     PANCAKE
                         All right, safety meeting, let's 
                         listen up. General, could you hand 
                         me the prima cord and the compound 
                         there. Before we set the charge we'll 
                         run through our procedure.

               Various paraphernalia are laid out on the table.

               The cat sits in a corner of the cellar, watching carefully 
               and, it seems, listening attentively.

                                     PANCAKE
                         ...I have earplugs for whoever wants 
                         them. Just wedge them in your ears. 
                         Now here we have -- not yet, Lump.

               Lump stops putting in his earplugs.

                                     PANCAKE
                         ...Now. Prima cord. Gelatinite. C4. 
                         Time comes, we pack the hole in the 
                         rock with the C4 and insert two leads. 
                         A...

               He holds up one lead.

                                     PANCAKE
                         ...and B.

               He holds up the other lead.

                                     PANCAKE
                         ...Charge comes from a battery that 
                         is inside this plunger. Ordinary 
                         auto battery, you can pick it up at 
                         Sears, easiest thing in the world...

               EXT. MUNSON HOUSE - NIGHT

               A black town car idles at the curb. Dorr is just escorting 
               the two ladies out the front door and down the stoop.

                                     DORR
                         I remember my father telling me -- 
                         and it is one of the few memories I 
                         retain of the man, from one of his 
                         visits home, and how I do cherish it -- 
                         he said, "Goldthwait, you are not 
                         formed as other little boys."

                         He a man of learnin'?

                         G.H. number two was self-educated; 
                         he had no career, as such, though 
                         the state recognized the breadth of 
                         his readin' by making him librarian 
                         at the state nervous hospital in 
                         Meridian, where he was a distinguished 
                         inmate.

               INT. MUNSON HOUSE - CELLAR - NIGHT

               Pancake sets down the two electrical leads and picks up a 
               hammer.

                                     PANCAKE
                         This is the same procedure we will 
                         be using when we collapse the tunnel 
                         after entering the casino vault and 
                         returning to the root cellar.

               He looks pointedly at Gawain.

                                     PANCAKE
                         ...This is for your own protection, 
                         so pay close attention. Once these 
                         materials are combined only the 
                         professionals may handle them. That 
                         means me, or the General. Separately 
                         they are harmless-completely inert. 
                         Why, you could light this stuff on 
                         fire, hit it with a hammer--

               He swings the hammer down onto the plastique--

               EXT. MUNSON HOUSE - NIGHT

               --and there is the dull thud of an explosion and the house's 
               windows rattle in their frames.

               The Professor, at the open door of the car into which the 
               two ladies have just sat, looks up at the house, as do the 
               ladies.

                                     MRS. MUNSON
                         ...What in the name of heaven was 
                         that?

               Dorr stares at the house, appalled.

                                     DORR
                         I'm... quite sure... that there is... 
                         no cause for alarm...

               He struggles for self-possession.

                                     DORR
                         ...Why, I'm not even absolutely 
                         certain that I heard anything at 
                         all.

                                     MRS. MUNSON
                         Didn't hear anything?!

                                     DORR
                         Well, something, perhaps, but...

               Marva Munson starts to get out of the car.

                                     DORR
                         ...nothing that need discompose us, 
                         was the sense I was trying to 
                         convey...

               He urges her back into her seat.

                                     DORR
                         ...Miz Munson, I will not have you 
                         missing your musical recital. Why, 
                         you go ahead now. Miz Funthes, you 
                         as well, I beg of you...

               He is backing up the walk.

                                     DORR
                         ...I shall call the gas company, or 
                         the water company, or whatever 
                         subterranean utility is implicated 
                         in this little... occurrence... I 
                         shall see to the matter... as only a 
                         highly educated classicist could.

               At the door now, he gives the two women peering out the car 
               window a smiling but vigorous wave away, which they do not 
               heed, and then he enters.

               INT. MUNSON HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

               The room is filled with smoke.

               Othar, slightly askew over the mantel, looks a little huffy.

               We hear clomping and screaming on the cellar stairs.

               Lump bursts out, shrieking:

                                     LUMP
                         Blood, Professor! Oh my God! Blood!

               The General comes bounding up the stairs like a panther, a 
               cigarette burning in his lips. He lands catlike in the living 
               room, glides to the blubbering Lump, grabs one shoulder firmly 
               with one hand, and with the other slaps him sharply, once 
               forehand, once backhand.

               Lump stares at him, shocked, his blubbering cut short.

               More noise is coming from the stairs:

                                     PANCAKE
                         ...why, it's nothing to make a fuss 
                         about. Perfectly all right... happens 
                         all the time...

                                     GAWAIN
                         ...You gotta go find it, dipshit!

               Pancake emerges from the stairwell, his hair singed, his 
               face and the front of his jumpsuit darkened by the blast. He 
               is clutching one hand with the other.

                                     PANCAKE
                         ...No, no. Really, I'm perfectly all 
                         right.

               Gawain has ascended just behind to hector him over his 
               shoulder:

                                     GAWAIN
                         Perfectly all right? You just blew 
                         your fucking finger off!

                                     PANCAKE
                         Sure, but--

                                     GAWAIN
                         Well get back down there and find 
                         it, man! I ain't pickin' up your 
                         goddamn finger!

                                     DORR
                         I gather there was a premature 
                         detonation--

                                     GAWAIN
                         They can sew that shit back on, jack! 
                         Like that guy his wife cut his dick 
                         off! Just sewed that motherfucker 
                         back on!

                                     PANCAKE
                         Of course. Simplest thing in the 
                         world. Microsurgery--

                                     GAWAIN
                         Saw that motherfucker in a porno! 
                         Thing still works!

               Pancake is pale from loss of blood and his pontifications 
               lack full conviction:

                                     PANCAKE
                         Oh yes, they have remarkable abilities 
                         in the, uh...

               EXT. MUNSON HOUSE - NIGHT

               Quiet.

               The two women sit in the idling car, looking at the house.

               From the house there is very muted bellowing.

               Still looking toward the house, Mrs. Munson offers a word of 
               explanation to her friend:

                                     MRS. MUNSON
                         They using the house to practice 
                         music a the rococo.

               INT. MUNSON HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

               The cat, with a human finger in its mouth, sidles cautiously 
               to one side, warily eying someone.

                                     VOICES (O.S.)
                         Get him!

               The General, pluming cigarette in his mouth, tensed arms 
               extended outwards, sidles cautiously to cut him off.

                                     DORR
                         I propose that we get our fallen 
                         comrade to the hospital, and the 
                         General shall follow when he manages 
                         to recover the severed digit.

                                     PANCAKE
                         I don't know what all the fuss is 
                         about.

               The cat jumps.

               The General leaps to follow.

               EXT. MUNSON HOUSE - NIGHT

               The two women looking.

               The front door of the house opens. Lump, the Professor, and 
               Gawain emerge, escorting Pancake. Just before Gawain finishes 
               closing the door the cat slips out.

                                     MRS. MUNSON
                         PICKLES!

               The door is yanked fully open and the General races out after 
               the cat.

                                     MRS. MUNSON
                         ...You catch Pickles now!

               The cat races across the lawn and, with no break in stride, 
               up his favorite tree.

               The General follows and, also without breaking stride, 
               clambers up the tree after it.

               Tree limbs shake with activity hidden by the leaves. We hear 
               the hiss of the cat.

               The men are bundling Pancake into the hearse. Dorr calls to 
               the women before climbing in:

                                     DORR
                         The house is perfectly in order, but 
                         we need medical attention for Mr. 
                         Pancake who, during the disturbance, 
                         pinched his finger in a valve of the 
                         sackbutt.

               The cat leaps out of the tree and runs away down the road.

                                     MRS. MUNSON
                         You let the cat out!

               The General leaps out of the tree to land catlike on the 
               street, arms tensed, casts a look both ways, and then pursues 
               the animal down the road. We hear the retreating padding 
               footsteps of all six feet.

                                     DORR
                         The General is even now exercising 
                         every effort to retrieve your 
                         mischievous little pet. Please go, 
                         go and enjoy your concert, and we 
                         shall see you later in the evening. 
                         Au revoir, mes dames!

               EXT. MISSISSIPPI RIVER - NIGHT

               A new day. The garbage scow chugs down the mighty Mississippi. 
               It toots its horn.

               It shows the underground complex and, stretching towards it 
               in a line drawn with a blunt pencil, is the tunnel. It is 
               now almost to the vault.

               A violin bow enters to tap at the line.

                                     DORR (O.S.)
                         Despite our little setback we find

                         the vault...

               The bow taps at the vault outline.

                         rock to pieces during Miz Munson's 
                         choir practice.

               The violin bow withdraws.

                                     DORR
                         ...Clark, perhaps you can run us

               A bandaged hand enters frame and a finger-stump points at 
               the end of the penciled line.

                                     PANCAKE (O.S.)
                         Of course. Why, it's child's play 
                         now, easiest thing in the world. 
                         Only a couple of feet separate us 
                         from the vault...

               WIDER

               The men are clustered around the map, spread out on the 
               sackbutt case in the cellar. Clark continues:

                                     PANCAKE
                         ...Just the usual spadework until we 
                         hit the masonry of the vault, and 
                         then we drill through.

                                     DORR
                         And will you be able to wield the 
                         drill with your maimed extremity?

                                     PANCAKE
                         Oh, I should think so, it's only one 
                         finger. Inhibits me in doing finer 
                         work, of course. I'll always have to 
                         live with that... Ahem. Maybe, and 
                         I'm just thinking out loud here, 
                         maybe since, as you say, it will 
                         present problems later...

                                     DORR
                         Yes, Clark?

                                     PANCAKE
                         Well, maybe -- and this is something 
                         I've talked over with Mountain Girl, 
                         and she agrees with me, so it's not 
                         just one person's opinion -- maybe I 
                         should get a little extra compensation 
                         for the accident.

               A long, stony silence.

                                     PANCAKE
                         ...Somewhat larger share. Why, if 
                         this were any other line of work I'd 
                         be getting workmen's comp, wouldn't 
                         I? Might even have a pretty good 
                         lawsuit.

                                     GAWAIN
                         You gonna sue yaself for blowin' off 
                         your finger?

                                     PANCAKE
                         Well that is simply asinine--

                                     DORR
                         Yes but you see, Clark, this is not 
                         what you just called "some other 
                         line of work."

                                     PANCAKE
                         But if it were--

                                     DORR
                         This is a criminal enterprise, not 
                         to put too fine a point on it, 
                         entailin' all manner a risks not 
                         involved in honest labor. Governmental 
                         regulations an' civic safeguards 
                         cannot be assumed to apply to 
                         antisocial pursuits.

                                     LUMP
                         Yeah, but he lost his finger.

                                     GAWAIN
                         We don't give a shit! Man can blow 
                         his own dick off, don't make no 
                         nevermind to us! We don't gotta pay 
                         the man for goin' around blowin' off 
                         body parts! Getcha head outcha ass, 
                         man!

                                     PANCAKE
                         Look, you--

                                     DORR
                         I think that in this instance Gawain 
                         has a very excellent point. I--

                                     GENERAL
                         No extra share!

               All stop and stare at the General.

               Clark grumbles:

                                     PANCAKE
                         Well, okay, majority rules, like I 
                         say, it was just a trial balloon. 
                         Hand's not so bad really, I even get 
                         some phantom feeling.

                                     GAWAIN
                         You pull on your prick you get phantom 
                         feeling. Greedy motherfuck.

                                     DORR
                         Now that that matter is settled, let 
                         us synchronize our watches before 
                         Gawain reports to work. In... twenty 
                         seconds... it will be twelve-sixteen 
                         exactly... fifteen...

                                     PANCAKE
                         It will be twelve-fifteen?

                                     DORR
                         No, in fifteen seconds -- now eleven 
                         seconds -- it will be twelve-
                         sixteen... eight...

                                     LUMP
                         Professor?

                                     DORR
                         Six... five -- yes, Lump?

                                     LUMP
                         I don't have a watch.

               EXT. CASINO - DAY

               It is the weathered doorway to the main entrance of the Lady 
               Luck. A hand enters to rap.

                                     ELRON (O.S.)
                         Yeah?

                                     GAWAIN
                         Me, dickwad.

               A low, chesty chuckle. The door swings open and Gawain enters.

               INT. CASINO - DAY

               RUMBLING WHEELS ON NUBBY FLOOR

               A garbage bin is being wheeled across the empty casino floor.

               WIDER

               Gawain is wheeling it. He is approaching the tunnel to the 
               corporate annex.

               BACK TO THE WHEELS

               As they roll down the tunnel.

               INT. CHURCH - DAY

               Loud singing at the cut. We are looking at Mrs. Munson in 
               the middle of the choir, holding forth in song.

               INT. CASINO - SERVICE HALL - DAY

               Gawain leans back against the wall next to the vault door, 
               arms folded across his chest. Faintly, from inside the vault, 
               we hear the whine of a power tool. Gawain leans over and 
               punches the button on boom box that hangs from the rolling 
               garbage bin. The hallway pulses with "I Left My Wallet In El 
               Segundo."

               INT. CHURCH - DAY

               More singing, Mrs. Munson and the rest of the choir now 
               clapping as they sing.

               INT. CASINO - VAULT - DAY

               The power-tool whine is louder here. We are looking at a 
               patch of wall.

               After a beat, and with a loud rev as resistance gives way, a 
               drill bit emerges from the wall, spitting out bits of the 
               masonry.

               The drill withdraws.

               After a beat, hammer blows.

               The chunk of masonry begins to buckle.

               INT. CASINO - SERVICE HALL - DAY

               The General opens the door, still somehow immaculately 
               groomed. Gawain enters.

               INT. CHURCH - DAY

               The gospel number rising to climax, supported by the organist 
               and the rest of the congregation.

               INT. CASINO - VAULT - DAY

               Clark and Lump, covered in dirt and plaster dust, have started 
               stuffing bundled bills and small sacks into large garbage 
               bags. An irregular hole, about three feet across, gapes in 
               the far wall.

               Gawain punches off the boombox, looking at all the money.

                                     GAWAIN
                         Well ain't that somethin'.

               Clark suddenly freezes in the act of collecting money. He 
               straightens slowly.

                                     PANCAKE
                         Hnnnn. Arrunggggh! Rnffff.

               He stands stock still, wincing, gazing off into space.

                                     PANCAKE
                         ...Mmmmnggh!

               He whispers hoarsely, urgently:

                                     PANCAKE
                         ...IBS!

               The other men look at him.

                                     GAWAIN
                         ...Say what?

                                     PANCAKE
                         IBS! Irritable Bowel Syndrome! Is 
                         there a men's room down here?!

                                     GAWAIN
                         Oh man, you shouldn't be using the 
                         men's room--

                                     PANCAKE
                         Or a lady's room! IBS! Quickly!

                                     GAWAIN
                         You shoulda shit back in the house, 
                         man! We don't want Elron finding you 
                         in the goddamn crapper!

               Clark's voice is still hoarse. He does small knee bends of 
               urgency:

                                     PANCAKE
                         No choice! Quickly! It's a medical 
                         condition!

                                     GAWAIN
                         You are disgusting, man. All right, 
                         follow me.

               INT. CASINO - DAY

               We are CLOSE ON Gawain peering anxiously to one side.

               He turns and peers the other way.

               We hear a toilet flush and, after a beat, Clark emerges from 
               the men's room door next to which Gawain stands. His manner 
               is now completely relaxed.

                                     PANCAKE
                         Feel thirty pounds lighter.

               They start walking back to the vault.

                                     PANCAKE
                         ...Thank you for being so 
                         understanding. Not everyone is, of 
                         course, which is why the biggest 
                         challenge of IBS is educating the 
                         public. Afflicts over two million 
                         people yet most of us have never 
                         heard of it. And it strikes without 
                         regard to age, gender or race.

                                     GAWAIN
                         Oh fuck, man, I don't wanna know 
                         about it.

                                     PANCAKE
                         That's the kind of attitude we're 
                         fighting.

                                     GAWAIN
                         Well maybe you should sign me up, 
                         man, 'cause you startin' to irritate 
                         my bowel.

               INT. CHURCH - DAY

               The choir finishes a number and sits -- all except for Marva 
               Munson, who unties the knot on her robe at the nape of her 
               neck, slips it off and, with murmured goodbyes, slips away.

               INT. CASINO - VAULT - DAY

               As the two men enter Clark is still holding forth:

                                     PANCAKE
                         ...I guess I never told you, that's 
                         how Mountain Girl and I met. They 
                         had an IBS Weekend at Grossinger's, 
                         in the Catskills. Of course the 
                         tourist business up there has 
                         suffered, with the demise of the 
                         Borscht Belt. So they have different 
                         promotions, mixers, so on. This was 
                         a weekend for Irritable Bowel singles 
                         to meet and support each other and 
                         share stories.

                                     GAWAIN
                         Man, I don't wanna hear a single one 
                         a them stories.

                                     PANCAKE
                         Well, some of them are very--

                                     GAWAIN
                         Not one fuckin' story! You one fucked-
                         up motherfucker! You--

               They stop short, looking:

               The General and Lump are standing in the middle of the floor, 
               stock still, each clutching a bag of money, staring up at 
               the same corner of the ceiling.

               Lump turns to Clark and Gawain.

                                     LUMP
                         Hey, lookit that.

               Gawain and Clark join them in the middle of the vault and 
               look up at the corner of the ceiling.

               A small video camera, aimed squarely at the four men.

               THROUGH THE CAMERA

               Black-and-white video, very WIDE ANGLE HIGH SHOT, of the 
               four motionless men below goggling up at the lens. Smoke 
               plumes from the General's cigarette.

               BACK TO NORMAL PERSPECTIVE

                                     PANCAKE
                         Huh. Looks like an Ikegami.

               He slips on his reading glasses as he gets a leg up on a 
               shelf just below the camera and hoists himself. He peers in 
               at the lens.

               THROUGH THE LENS

               Clark looming into EXTREME CLOSE SHOT.

                                     PANCAKE
                         ...Oh yeah. Mm-hm. I'm not sure 
                         whether it's broadcasting...

               NORMAL PERSPECTIVE

                                     PANCAKE
                         ...Um-hm... No...

               He is fingering the back of the camera.

                                     PANCAKE
                         ...Hard wire...

               Down below, Gawain looks at the wire snaking along the seam 
               of wall and ceiling. At the opposite corner it travels down 
               the joint of the two walls.

               He traces its path down and then across one wall at chair-
               rail height towards the door. The other men follow in an 
               anxious herd as he traces one finger along it.

               Just before reaching the vault door the wire goes through 
               the wall in a hole finished off with a grommet. Gawain goes 
               out the vault door...

               INT. CASINO - SERVICE HALL - DAY

               ...and picks up the line where it emerges on the other side, 
               travels down to the joint of wall and floor, and then 
               continues along the floor. Gawain follows it and the other 
               men continue to follow him.

               He traces it anxiously down the hall in a hunched lope. The 
               other men scuttle behind into...

               INT. CASINO - MONITOR ROOM - DAY

               The wire winds around into the room, back up to chair-rail 
               height, along one wall, behind some cabinetry which Gawain 
               hurries past to find it again on the far side, and then down 
               to a video recorder.

               It is not, however, hooked up to the video recorder: its 
               pronged end swings loose just by where it would be plugged 
               in.

               Inside the video recorder is a casette, which Gawain ejects. 
               The men crowd to look over his shoulder as he examines it:

               "Shevann's Schvanz".

               There is a pile of other videos by the monitor: "Charlayne 
               and the Chocolate Factory," "Big Dick Blaque's Big Night 
               Out," "Lemme Tell Ya 'Bout Black Chicks," "Anus & Andy." 
               Just next to the pile is an old bowl of Kocoa Krispies.

               INT. CASINO - VAULT - DAY

               The General climbs into the tunnel with a garbage bagful of 
               money, followed by Lump, likewise encumbered. Lump hands 
               back out a satchel to Gawain, who sets it on the vault floor 
               by the hole. From the way he handles it, it is quite heavy. 
               Pancake, also with a bag of money, is getting ready to climb 
               in:

                                     PANCAKE
                         Look, I didn't choose to have IBS--

                                     GAWAIN
                         Shut the fuck up!

               Lump hands Gawain a smaller, lighter satchel which he likewise 
               sets on the floor.

                                     PANCAKE
                         There's no cure, you know. Only 
                         control. Lifelong condition. Not 
                         complaining, just fact. And I did 
                         meet Mountain.

                                     GAWAIN
                         Grab your bag and get in that fucking 
                         hole!

               EXT. CHURCH - DAY

               Mrs. Munson is leaving, with singing still audible from the 
               service that continues inside.

               INT. MUNSON HOUSE - CELLAR - DAY

               We are looking from inside the tunnel towards its mouth, 
               where the Professor stoops slightly to peer in, anxiously 
               dry-washing his hands.

               A REVERSE shows the hunched-over men scuttling along the 
               tunnel towards us, holding large garbage sacks.

                                     DORR
                         Welcome back, gentlemen, mission 
                         accomplished I see. I am so very 
                         very delighted...

               He gives a hand down to each man as he exits the tunnel.

                                     DORR
                         ...Congratulations. Congratulations. 
                         I have some cold duck on ice for the 
                         occasion.

                                     LUMP
                         Maybe we could have something to 
                         drink, too.

               INT. CASINO - VAULT - DAY

               Gawain, left behind, is muttering to himself as he uses a 
               trowel and other instruments from his satchel to patch up 
               the hole at his end of the tunnel.

                                     GAWAIN
                         Motherfucker can't stop talking, 
                         can't stop shitting. Motherfucker 
                         tell everyone about his motherfuckin' 
                         asshole. No one gives a shit about 
                         his asshole. Nobody interested in 
                         another man's asshole. Or his bitch's.

               EXT. MUNSON HOUSE - DAY

               Mrs. Munson is letting herself in.

               INT. MUNSON HOUSE - CELLAR - DAY

               The men are sitting around the table, champagne glasses 
               raised. On the table sits the money, stacked in orderly piles.

                                     DORR
                         Gentlemen, to we few. We who have 
                         shared each other's company, each 
                         other's care, each other's joy, and 
                         who now reap the fruits of our 
                         communal effits, shoulder to shoulder, 
                         from each accordin' to his abilities 
                         so forth whatnot. We have had our 
                         little diffences along the way, it's 
                         true, but I like to think they have 
                         only made us value one another the 
                         more, each coming to understand and 
                         appreciate the other's unique 
                         qualities, potencies, and, yes, 
                         foibles. I suggest that we shall 
                         look back upon this caper one day, 
                         one distant day, grandchildren dandled 
                         upon our knee, and perhaps a tear 
                         will form, and we shall say, Well, 
                         with wit, and grit, and no small 
                         amount of courage, we accomplished 
                         something on that day, a feat of 
                         derring-do, an enterprise not ignoble -- 
                         we, merry band, unbound by the 
                         constraints of society and the 
                         prejudices of the common ruck, we 
                         happy few. Gentlemen -- to us!

                                     MEN
                         To us!

               They clink.

               INT. MUNSON HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY

               Upstairs Mrs. Munson runs water into a teapot, humming to 
               herself.

               INT. CASINO - VAULT - DAY

               Having finished patching, Gawain starts painting. He turns 
               on his boombox, and out comes the big bassy "I Left My Wallet 
               in El Segundo."

               INT. MUNSON HOUSE - CELLAR - DAY

               The men, having drunk deep, are setting down their glasses. 
               Pancake looks at his watch with some concern.

                                     PANCAKE
                         Charge should've gone off already.

                                     DORR
                         I do beg your pardon?

                                     PANCAKE
                         The charge to collapse the tunnel. I 
                         set it for eight minutes.

               Dorr looks at his watch.

                                     DORR
                         Well that time, and more, has most 
                         certainly elapsed.

               FROM INSIDE THE TUNNEL

               Looking toward the mouth. The men stoop over and peek 
               fearfully in.

               They again stand upright. A silence.

               Dorr clears his throat.

                                     DORR
                         I need not remind you of the 
                         importance of obliterating any trace 
                         of a connection between the vault 
                         and this house. It was of the essence 
                         of this plan that it should appear 
                         that the money had simply vanished. 
                         Without a trace. Spirited away, as 
                         it were, by ghosts.

                                     PANCAKE
                         Of course. I understand.

                                     DORR
                         The conundrum of the undisturbed yet 
                         empty vault, the unsolvable riddle 
                         of the sealed yet violated sanctum, 
                         is of the utmost importance not only 
                         to make our caper innelectually 
                         satisfying. It is also exigent as a 
                         matter of practical fact: I remind 
                         you that if a tunnel is ever found 
                         leading to this house, this house's 
                         owner knows all of your names.

                                     PANCAKE
                         She certainly does.

                                     DORR
                         Therefore -- to draw the unavoidable 
                         conclusion -- someone shall have to 
                         reenter the tunnel to reset that 
                         charge.

               INT. TUNNEL - DAY

               Pancake, hunched over, scurries along the tunnel. He reaches 
               the remnants of a large rock, where the tunnel grows smaller.

               He drops to crawl position and elbows his way forward, 
               toolbelt clanking along.

               We are getting closer and closer to a muffled but thuddingly 
               bassy "I Left My Wallet in El Segundo."

               INT. CASINO - VAULT - DAY

               The music loudly present at the cut. Gawain takes a handheld 
               blowdryer out of his satchel and flips it on, directing it 
               at the fresh paint on the wall whose repairs are now 
               invisible.

               INT. TUNNEL - DAY

               Music once again muffled. Pancake has reached a little LED-
               displaying timer with leads trailing off of it.

               He grabs it, puts on his reading glasses, squints.

               The display shows: TIME REMAINING: 00:12.

               The colons in the display rhythmically blink, but the number 
               does not advance. For some reason, stuck.

                                     PANCAKE
                         Huh.

               He reaches to his tool belt, pulls out his Leatherman.

               INT. MUNSON HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY

               Mrs. Munson is setting places at a large table. There are 
               about a dozen place settings.

               INT. TUNNEL - DAY

               Pancake now has a mini-mag light clenched between his teeth, 
               aimed down at the timer. He opens the phillips head on his 
               Leatherman but abruptly stops and stares off into space.

                                     PANCAKE
                         Nnnnrungh...

               He is squinting with pain.

               The muffled hip-hop song is beginning to recede.

               INT. VAULT - DAY

               Gawain is wheeling his garbage cart out the door. The vault 
               is completely empty but looks completely undisturbed.

               He closes the heavy vault door behind him, leaving quiet.

               INT. TUNNEL - DAY

               Quiet here as well, now. Pancake's moan trails off to nothing. 
               He relaxes. The moment, whatever it was, has passed.

               He looks back down at the unit, flicks it with his finger, 
               and it emits a soft beep.

                                     PANCAKE
                         ...Huh?

               He squints at the back of the unit.

               As it beeps again, he turns the unit over to look at its 
               face.

               The readout now says: 00:10.

               As he watches, peering down through the bottom of his glasses, 
               it continues to advance with a beep as each second slips by: 
               9... 8...

                                     PANCAKE
                         ...What the--

               His eyes widen and he frantically shakes the unit. It 
               continues beeping. He briefly and sloppily tries to fit the 
               phillips head into one of the four screws on the back of the 
               unit but immediately gives up and starts a panicked wriggle 
               back up the tunnel, whimpering.

               INT. CASINO - DAY

               Gawain is wheeling his garbage cart past Elron.

               INT. MUNSON HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY

               Mrs. Munson is placing the last piece of silverware, just 
               so.

               INT. TUNNEL - DAY

               Pancake is in full panicked awkward flight as--

               INT. MUNSON HOUSE - CELLAR - DAY

               --BOOM! We CUT TO the cellar and Pancake is shot out the 
               tunnel like a human cannonball, trailing a comet-tail of 
               dirt, dust, and debris that wafts what were neatly stacked 
               bills up into the air.

               INT. MUNSON HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY

               The portrait of Othar jostles back to square. He now looks a 
               little angry.

               The cat arches her back, emitting a startled yowl.

               Mrs. Munson stands, frozen, then looks slowly around, trying 
               to assimilate what has just happened.

               INT. CASINO - DAY

               Gawain and Elron are staring at each other, frozen, also 
               reacting to what just happened.

               Finally:

                                     GAWAIN
                         ...You just fart?

                                     ELRON
                         Heh-heh-heh.

               INT. MUNSON HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY

               Mrs. Munson is looking at the cellar door. Dust drifts out 
               from under it.

               She takes a slow step towards it. Another step. She opens 
               the door.

               There is no visibility in the cellar due to swirling clay 
               dust.

               She takes one step down the stairs, waving at the air in 
               front of her face.

               Paper money wafts in and out of the dust.

               We hear Voices:

                                     PANCAKE (O.S.)
                         Perfectly all right. Not a problem.

                                     LUMP (O.S.)
                         Well there sure as shit ain't no 
                         tunnel left.

               The clearing dust reveals the caped Professor anxiously 
               dancing from foot to foot, gathering money out of the air. 
               As he reaches up to grab a bill that has him facing up in 
               Mrs. Munson's direction, he freezes.

               His POV reveals her through dissipating dust.

                                     MRS. MUNSON
                         Professor, I'm surprised.

               There is a long beat, through which all stare at her.

                                     DORR
                         ...Properly speaking, madam, we have 
                         been surprised; you are taken aback. 
                         Though I acknowledge that the sense 
                         you intend is gaining currency through 
                         increasing use.

               Further dissipation of the dust reveals how much money there 
               is, settling now to cover the floor of the cellar.

                                     DORR
                         ...You have returned from your 
                         devotions betimes.

               We hear the ring of the doorbell.

                                     MRS. MUNSON
                         I hadda fix tea. I wanna talk to 
                         you, Professor, don't you be leavin'. 
                         And don't make any more noise! And 
                         you!

               She points at the General who, in the excitement, has 
               neglected to hide his ever-present cigarette.

                                     MRS. MUNSON
                         ...I told you, I don't want any 
                         smokin' in here!

               She clomps upstairs and shuts the cellar door.

               INT. MUNSON HOUSE - LIVING ROOM

               We PULL HER towards the front door, angry and lost in thought. 
               Her look softens somewhat as she opens the door.

               It is a chattering infestation of hens: all of her friends 
               from church push in wearing church dresses and elaborate 
               hats.

               INT. MUNSON HOUSE - CELLAR - DAY

               The men are still frozen looking up toward the door. The 
               muted cackle of church ladies.

               The men gradually unfreeze.

                                     LUMP
                         She saw everything. She saw our 
                         hole...

               He turns to Dorr, near tears:

                                     LUMP
                         ...She saw our hole, Professor!

               Dorr rubs his hands anxiously, thinking:

                                     DORR
                         Yes... Yes...

                                     LUMP
                         What do we do?

                                     DORR
                         Well, first, my dear boy, we follow 
                         the General's example...

               The General remains staring up at the door, frozen but for 
               the smoke pluming from the cigarette in his mouth.

                                     DORR
                         ...and refrain from panic. Secondly, 
                         we cooly, calmly, collectedly think... 
                         think...

               The gaze of all the men drifts back up to the cellar door, 
               and we look down at them, gazing up.

               INT. MUNSON HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY

               The chattering ladies are gathered at the table, Mrs. Munson 
               pouring them tea.

               The cellar door creaks noisily -- one might almost say 
               gothically -- ajar, and the Professor peers out with an 
               ingratiating smile.

                                     DORR
                         Hsst... Madam...

               The chattering abates and the ladies all look at him. His 
               smile broadens into ghastliness and he crooks a finger toward 
               Mrs. Munson.

                                     DORR
                         ...Mrs. Munson, if I might have a 
                         word...

                                     MRS. MUNSON
                         You get back down those stairs!

                                     DORR
                         I assure you I shall be--

                                     MRS. MUNSON
                         Hush! Down those stairs! We havin' 
                         tea now! I be down shortly.

               He nods meekly and retreats, easing the door creakily shut.

               The ladies look inquisitively at Mrs. Munson as his footsteps 
               are heard descending the stair.

                                     MRS. MUNSON
                         ...He's the tenant.

                                     LADIES
                         Mm-hm.

               INT. MUNSON HOUSE - CELLAR DAY

               As the Professor rejoins the still staring and silent group. 
               The money has been picked up and is once again in stacks 
               upon the table.

                                     DORR
                         She shall be down shortly...

               Explaining, he indicates upstairs with a jerk of the head:

                                     DORR
                         ...Tea. Dainties.

               The men nod, murmuring.

               The cellar door squeaks open. There is the clomp of careful 
               footsteps on the stair.

               Using only tongue and teeth, the General flips his smoking 
               cigarette inwards into his mouth and gives Mrs. Munson his 
               usual deadpan look.

               She halts halfway down the stairs, still wearing an apron 
               and holding a spatula.

                                     MRS. MUNSON
                         I don't know what you boys been up 
                         to but I wasn't born yesterday and I 
                         know mischief when I see it. Now I 
                         want an explanation, but first I 
                         want you boys to get your fannies up 
                         here with y'alls period instruments. 
                         I been tellin' the ladies about your 
                         music and they wanna hear you play.

               She turns to head back up the stairs but abruptly stops to 
               turn and give the General a hard look which he innocently 
               returns.

                                     MRS. MUNSON
                         ...Hmph.

               She turns again and clomps back up the stairs.

               The General opens his mouth and, again without using his 
               hands, restores his cigarette to its usual place on his lower 
               lip.

               Lump is fretful:

                                     LUMP
                         Professor?

                                     DORR
                         Yes, Lump?

                                     LUMP
                         I can't really play the buttsack.

               INT. MUNSON HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY

               The cellar door opens and the men troop out, G.H. Dorr leading 
               and the other men following rather sheepishly behind.

                                     DORR
                         Madame -- or rather, mesdames -- you 
                         will have to accept our apologies 
                         for failing to perform since, as you 
                         see, we are shorthanded. Gawain is 
                         still at work and we could no more 
                         play with one part tacit than a horse 
                         could canter shy one leg.

                                     LADIES
                         Mm-hmm.

                                     MRS. MUNSON
                         Hmph.

                                     DORR
                         Perhaps I could offer as a poor but 
                         ready substitute a brief poetic 
                         recital. Though I don't pretend to 
                         great oratorical skills, I will 
                         happily present, with your ladies' 
                         permission, verse from the unquiet 
                         mind of Mr. Ed G'Allan Poe.

               Lump, Pancake, and the General sit and awkwardly accept dainty 
               teacups.

               The Professor rises, spreads his hand, and pronounces:

                                     DORR
                         ..."Ladies, thy beauty is to me Like 
                         those Nicean barks of yore..."

               CLOSE-UPS of the various ladies, some sipping tea or slowly 
               munching biscuits, but all eyes glued to the declaiming man 
               in the cape.

                                     DORR
                         "That gently, o'er a perfumed sea 
                         The weary, wayworn wanderer bore To 
                         his own native shore... "

               Murmuring Voice:

                                     VOICE
                         Amen.

               A slurp of tea from another quarter.

               Dorr bears on:

                                     DORR
                         "On desperate seas long wont to roam, 
                         Thy hyacinth hair, thy classic face, 
                         Thy Naiad airs have brought me home 
                         To the glory that was Greece And the 
                         grandeur that was Rome... "

               A long silence.

               Then, scattered:

                                     VOICES
                         Mm-mm. Glory hallelujah.

               A lady holding a teacup turns to the General:

                                     LADY
                         That was soooome poem.

               The General stares at her.

                                     LADY
                         ...You know any?

               We hear the front door opening and Gawain enters, still 
               wearing his Lady Luck custodial uniform. He looks.

               His POV: church ladies with teacups and his comrades seated 
               among them, also holding teacups and scones.

                                     GAWAIN
                         Y'all been celebratin'?.

               INT. MUNSON HOUSE - FOYER - LATER (EVENING)

               The bustling and chattering ladies are just finishing leaving; 
               Mrs. Munson is seeing them off at the door. Evening is 
               gathering, and we hear the lonely toot of the distant garbage 
               scow.

               The men as well stand by the door and, affecting good cheer, 
               wave off the departing ladies.

                                     DORR
                         Goodbye, ladies. We had such a 
                         pleasant time.

               Mrs. Munson closes the door and her manner instantly darkens.

                                     MRS. MUNSON
                         Now, I wanna know what's goin' on.

                                     DORR
                         Yes indeed, and the thirst for 
                         knowledge is a very commendable thing. 
                         Though in this instance, I believe 
                         when you hear the explanation, you 
                         will laugh riotously, slappin' your 
                         knee and perhaps even wipin' away a 
                         giddy tear, relieved of your former 
                         concern.

                                     MRS. MUNSON
                         Hmph.

                                     DORR
                         You see Lump here is an enthusiastic 
                         collector of Indian arrowheads and, 
                         having found one simply lying on 
                         your cellar floor, a particularly 
                         rare artifact of the Natchez tribe, 
                         he enlisted us in an all-out effort 
                         to sift through the subsoil in search 
                         of others. Well, in doing so, we 
                         apparently hit a motherlode of natural 
                         gas -- I myself became acutely aware 
                         of the smell of "rotten eggs" -- and 
                         it was at just this unfortunate moment 
                         that the General here violated one 
                         of the cardinal rules of this house 
                         and lit himself a cigarette.

               The General stiffly bows:

                                     GENERAL
                         So sorry.

               The Professor, nodding, smiling, and dry-washing his hands, 
               continues to look at Mrs. Munson, though his story, 
               apparently, has ended.

               She returns his ingratiating look with a stare.

                                     MRS. MUNSON
                         ...What about all that money?

               Dorr's smile fades.

                                     DORR
                         ...Ah. The money. The money is... 
                         Mr. Pancake's.

                                     PANCAKE
                         That's right.

                                     DORR
                         He only just re-mortgaged his house 
                         in order to pay for the procedure 
                         that will correct the wandering eye 
                         of his common-law wife, Mountain 
                         Water, who suffers from astygmia and 
                         strabismus and a general curdling of 
                         the vitreous jelly. Mr. Pancake 
                         however is an ardent foe of the 
                         federal reserve and is in fact one 
                         of those eccentrics about whom one 
                         occasionally reads, hoarding his 
                         entire life savings either under the 
                         proverbial mattress or, as in Mr. 
                         Pancake's case, in a Hefty bag that 
                         is his constant companion.

               Under her stare, he elaborates:

                                     DORR
                         ...Steel Sack.

                                     PANCAKE
                         Don't trust the banks. Never have.

               She thinks, decides.

                                     MRS. MUNSON
                         This don't smell right. I'm callin' 
                         Sheriff Wyner.

               A chorus of gasps.

                                     DORR
                         Madam -- if you please. Yes! Yes! It 
                         was a lie! A fantastic tale! You 
                         have us! Dead to rights! But please 
                         allow me to tell you the truth -- in 
                         private.

               INT. MUNSON HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - EVENING

               He escorts her to sit beneath the portrait of Othar, sits 
               across from her, and leans confidentially in.

                                     DORR
                         Madam...

               He agonizes. The words do not come easy.

                                     DORR
                         ...What I am about to reveal to you, 
                         you may find... shocking. Mrs. Munson, 
                         I must tell you that we are not... 
                         what we appear.

                                     MRS. MUNSON
                         Mm-hm.

                                     DORR
                         We are not in fact musicians of the 
                         late Renaissance. Nor of the early 
                         or mid period. We are, in fact... 
                         criminals! Desperate men, madam! We 
                         have tunneled into the nearby offices 
                         of the Lady Luck gambling emporium 
                         and have relieved it of its treasure!

                                     MRS. MUNSON
                         Lord have mercy!

                                     DORR
                         It is true that the Lady Luck is a 
                         den of iniquity, a painted harlot 
                         luring people into sin and exciting 
                         the vice of greed with her false 
                         promise of easy winnings. Oh, her 
                         gains are ill-gotten, yes, but I 
                         offer no excuses -- save one! We men 
                         have each pledged half of our share 
                         of the booty to a charitable 
                         institution -- the General, to a 
                         placement service for Southeast Asian 
                         refugees; Mr. Pancake to the Blue 
                         Ridge Parkway Conservancy; and Lump 
                         to the United Jewish Appeal. As 
                         compensation for use of your house 
                         we had planned to donate a full share 
                         to Bob Jones University, without 
                         burdening you with guilty knowledge 
                         by informing you of same. But you 
                         have wrested the information from 
                         me! Now it is all on the table. Now 
                         you have it, the whole story, the 
                         awful truth.

                                     MRS. MUNSON
                         Stolen money!

                                     DORR
                         Yes, yes, shamefully I admit it, 
                         yes! But find the victim, Mrs. Munson, 
                         I challenge you! Even the casino 
                         itself, that riparian Gomorra, shall 
                         suffer no harm! It has an insurance 
                         company, a financial behemoth that 
                         will cheerfully replenish its depleted 
                         vaults! That is its function! And 
                         the insurance company itself is made 
                         up of tens and tens of thousands of 
                         policy-holders so that -- we have 
                         done the calculations, Mrs. Munson! -- 
                         so that at the end of the day, at 
                         the final reckoning, each policy-
                         holder shall have contributed only 
                         one penny -- one single solitary 
                         cent -- to the satisfaction of this 
                         claim.

                                     MRS. MUNSON
                         ...Just one penny?

                                     DORR
                         Think of it, Mrs. Munson! One cent 
                         from thousands upon thousands of 
                         people so that Bob Jones University 
                         can continue on its mission! Why, I 
                         have no doubt that, were the policy-
                         holders aware of the existence of 
                         that august institution, why, each 
                         and every one of them would have 
                         volunteered some token amount to the 
                         furtherance of its aims!

                                     MRS. MUNSON
                         Well that's prob'ly true...

               The Professor, warming, has resumed dry-washing his hands:

                                     DORR
                         Yes madam, sadly, the criminal stain 
                         is upon my soul, but the benefit 
                         shall accrue to any number of worthy 
                         causes. As long, that is, as the 
                         secret stays with us. And I, surely, 
                         shall not be the one to divulge it.

               Mrs. Munson nods, musing.

                                     MRS. MUNSON
                         Well... it's hard to see the harm in 
                         it... One penny...

               Her gaze drifts around the room, a smile beginning to warm 
               her face. The smile freezes, though, as her look catches on 
               something.

               Her POV: Othar, above the mantle, looks down with a 
               disapproving scowl.

                                     MRS. MUNSON
                         ...I'm sorry, Professor.

               Dorr is taken aback:

                                     DORR
                         Excuse me, ma'am?

                                     MRS. MUNSON
                         No. It's wrong. Don't you be leadin' 
                         me into temptation.

                                     DORR
                         Madam, I must strenuously protest--

                                     MRS. MUNSON
                         No, it's just plain wrong. Stealin'. 
                         I know your intentions were good, 
                         and I won't call the police if you 
                         give the money back. But I gotta see 
                         that you do it.

                                     DORR
                         Madam--

                                     MRS. MUNSON
                         And all a you gotta go to church 
                         with me next Sunday.

               The Professor is incredulous:

                                     DORR
                         And... engage in divine worship?

                                     MRS. MUNSON
                         I made up my mind. You can double-
                         talk all you want, but its church or 
                         the county jail.

                                     DORR
                         But--

               She rises.

                                     MRS. MUNSON
                         You think it over. I gotta feed the 
                         cat.

               INT. MUNSON HOUSE - CELLAR - NIGHT

               The men all sit around the card table, lit from below by an 
               oil lamp. The General is neatly packing the stacks of 
               banknotes into the sackbutt case.

                                     GAWAIN
                         Motherfuck!

                                     DORR
                         Yes. Unfortunately, Mrs. Munson has 
                         rather complicated the situation--

                                     GAWAIN
                         I know how to discomplicate it! Put 
                         a cap in the old lady's head! Then 
                         everything simple again!

               The group lapses into silence, considering. Even Gawain needs 
               a moment to digest the horror that he himself has proposed.

               The Professor is solemn:

                                     DORR
                         ...Not easy to do. Many reasons. 
                         Practical ones: a quiet neighborhood, 
                         a sleepy town. Reasons of moral 
                         repugnance: a harmless woman, a deed 
                         conceived and executed in cold blood. 
                         No, Gawain; would that it were simple!

                                     GAWAIN
                         Well -- fuck, man! What we gonna do, 
                         give the money back and go to church?!

                                     DORR
                         I shudder. I quake.

               He turns to the General.

                                     DORR
                         ...You sir, are a Buddhist. Is there 
                         not a middle way?

               The General grunts as he closes the clasps on the sackbutt 
               case full of money:

                                     GENERAL
                         Must float like a leaf on the river 
                         of life. And kill old lady.

               The men murmur.

                                     DORR
                         Well... I suppose you are right. It 
                         is the active nature of the crime, 
                         though, that so horrifies -- the 
                         squeezing of the trigger, the plunging 
                         of the knife. But, think a moment -- 
                         look at the other tools we have at 
                         hand.

               He looks around.

                                     DORR
                         ...We have the cellar. We have masonry 
                         and trowel. Perhaps we could simply... 
                         immure her.

                                     PANCAKE
                         Sure, easiest thing in the world. I 
                         could whip up a little mortar in one 
                         of those snow saucers, lay the bricks, 
                         anchor in some chains, Mountain has 
                         a source for the manacles...

                                     DORR
                         Ahh but gentlemen, we delude 
                         ourselves. Think of the woman's 
                         piteous moans as we lay tier upon 
                         tier of brick. Think of her 
                         lamentations as we fit the last brick 
                         into place, appealing to our better 
                         selves, the higher angels of our 
                         nature, our recollections of our own 
                         sainted mothers... No, I fear that 
                         we lack the sand to commit such an 
                         act. No... no... shortest and most 
                         painless is best. Let us confront 
                         reality. Gawain's gun... the retort 
                         muffled by a pillow... into the 
                         brain... the affair of an instant. 
                         The only question is... who wields 
                         the weapon.

               He looks around the table. Silence. No volunteers.

                                     DORR
                         ...I believe it is traditional, in 
                         such circumstances, to draw straws.

                                     PANCAKE
                         Well, sure, fair enough.

               He takes a broom leaning against the wall, bends back and 
               snaps a handful of its bristles.

                                     PANCAKE
                         ...I'm thinking, though, that since 
                         I lost my finger -- I mean, literally 
                         lost it because of that goddamn cat -- 
                         maybe I should be excused from this 
                         thing. Hard for me to squeeze a 
                         trigger anyway--

                                     GAWAIN
                         You one whiney motherfucker! I squeeze 
                         your nutsack you keep that up!

                                     PANCAKE
                         Listen, punk--

                                     DORR
                         Gentlemen, no special pleading, no 
                         exceptions. It's in the nature of 
                         the situation that we would all prefer 
                         to be excused.

               Pancake grumbles as he counts out five bristles, takes one 
               and snaps it in half, displaying the short straw to the group, 
               and then hands the four long and one short to the Professor:

                                     PANCAKE
                         Well, okay... it was just a trial 
                         balloon...

               With a flap of his cape the professor jumbles the straws and 
               encloses them in one hand.

               Sweaty CLOSE-UPS. Each man stares at the straws. Some 
               hesitant, some resolute, they draw:

               First, the General: long straw. His reaction: impassive.

               Next, Lump: long straw. His reaction: relieved.

               Next, Pancake. Long straw.

                                     PANCAKE
                         Long straw. You all see it. All your 
                         fuss over nothing, punk.

               Two straws left. Gawain stares at them, licks his lips.

               He reaches for one straw, touches it, hesitates.

                                     GAWAIN
                         ...Motherfucker...

               He touches the other straw, hesitates.

               He goes back to the first straw, closes his hand around it, 
               closes his eyes, and pulls.

               He lifts the straw into frame before his squeezed-shut eyes, 
               raises his eyebrows, and slowly opens fluttering eyelids to 
               look: short straw.

               The Professor, smiling, opens his fist to confirm that he 
               holds the last long one.

               Gawain moans.

               INT. MUNSON HOUSE - CELLAR - NIGHT

               PULLING HIM UP THE STAIRS

               Slowly, slowly, Gawain mounts the cellar stairs. Behind him, 
               gathered in a semi-circle and looking up from the foot of 
               the stairs, the other men wait.

               As he plants one plodding foot in front of the other Gawain 
               raises the gun, slides back its primer to make sure there is 
               a round in the chamber, and then slides it shut as he reaches 
               the door.

               INT. MUNSON - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

               In the foreground Mrs. Munson sits knitting, humming an old 
               temperance tune. In the background the cellar door swings 
               open. Marva Munson doesn't notice; her knitting needles 
               continue their rhythmic clack.

               We PULL Gawain, gun at the ready, as he takes slow, cautious 
               steps across the floor.

               We INTERCUT his POV of the back of the old lady's head, bowed 
               over her knitting.

               As Gawain passes the sofa he picks up a cushion and buries 
               in it his hand holding the gun.

               He looks back up at the old lady. But now, still cautiously 
               approaching, he cocks his head, his expression bemused.

               HIS POV

               nearing the old lady is now different somehow. The perspective 
               is somewhat lower; the humming woman sounds not quite the 
               same; the rocking chair and the room itself are subtly 
               different.

               WHEN WE CUT BACK TO GAWAIN

               he is a runty, TEN-YEAR-OLD CHILD walking slowly across the 
               floor; he is cradling not a gun in a pillow but a squirming 
               little puppy dog.

               The dog yips; the woman turns to look at us. It is not Mrs. 
               Munson, but another black woman of about the same age.

                                     MAMA
                         What you got there, Gawain?

                                     CHILD GAWAIN
                         Why -- nothin', mama.

                                     MAMA
                         Nothin' my ass! You got a dog there!

                                     CHILD GAWAIN
                         No, Mama!

                                     MAMA
                         A filthy noisy little pest of a puppy 
                         dog gonna shit all over the house!

                                     CHILD GAWAIN
                         He won't shit in the house, Mama, 
                         I'm gonna train him, I promise, gonna 
                         train him real good--

               WHAP! She cuffs him on the side of his head.

                                     MAMA
                         I'm gonna train you real good! I 
                         told you don't bring no stray dogs 
                         into this house!

               WHAP! Another slap.

                                     MAMA
                         ...You wait til your Daddy gets home, 
                         he gonna lay into you proper!

               WHAP!

               The little boy, weeping, throws his arms around his mother:

                                     CHILD GAWAIN
                         Please don't hurt me no more! I love 
                         you, Mama!

                                     MAMA
                         Daddy gonna kick your ass!

               WHAP!

                                     MAMA
                         ...Bringin' in a filthy dirty dog!

               WHAP! Gawain's little brothers and sisters, drawn by the 
               commotion, have gathered excitedly to watch.

                                     SISTER
                         Mama's whuppin' Gawain's ass!

                                     BROTHER
                              (eagerly)
                         Ain't you gonna use the strap, Mama?

               WHAP! WHAP! Gawain is sobbing:

                                     CHILD GAWAIN
                         Please don't hurt me, Mama!

               Now it is the adult Gawain blubbering.

               The clack of knitting needles stops and Mrs. Munson turns to 
               look.

                                     MRS. MUNSON
                         What you doin'? What you doin' with 
                         my pillow there?

               He surreptitiously slides the gun into his pocket, sniveling:

                                     GAWAIN
                         I'm sorry, ma'am, I--

               WHAP! She cuffs him on the side of the head.

                                     MRS. MUNSON
                         I'm displeased with you! Colored boy 
                         like you, falling in with that trash 
                         downstairs!

               WHAP!

                                     MRS. MUNSON
                         ...Ashamed a yourself! Didn't your 
                         mama raise you right!

               INT. MUNSON HOUSE - CELLAR - NIGHT

               Gawain is tramping down the stairs.

                                     GAWAIN
                         I can't do it!

               The men are stunned.

                                     DORR
                         Why... this is most... irregular.

                                     GAWAIN
                         She reminds me of my mama. I can't 
                         shoot my mama! You motherfuckers 
                         just draw straws again.

                                     PANCAKE
                         Wait a minute. You've got to accept 
                         your responsibilities, young man.

                                     GAWAIN
                         Fuck you. And your irritated bowel. 
                         I can't shoot that old lady.

                                     GENERAL
                         Must shoot!

                                     PANCAKE
                         Now look here, it's the easiest thing 
                         in the world. Pretend her head is a 
                         casaba melon, and the gun is a melon-
                         baller, and--

                                     GAWAIN
                         What the fuck you talkin' about, 
                         man? You think this a melon-baller, 
                         you do it, man!

                                     DORR
                         My my, this is most irregular.

                                     PANCAKE
                         Look, with equal rights come equal 
                         responsibilities--

                                     DORR
                         I'm afraid that Mr. Pancake is right, 
                         my dear fellow. We cannot draw straws 
                         again; the exercise loses all 
                         credibility if you show that the 
                         loser can simply beg off doing the 
                         job.

                                     GENERAL
                         Must shoot!

               Gawain shoves the gun toward Pancake.

                                     GAWAIN
                         She just an old colored lady to you -- 
                         you do it, man!

                                     PANCAKE
                         Why you sniveling little coward!

                                     GAWAIN
                         What you say, you whiney motherfucker? 
                         I come up your irritated ass with 
                         this -- motherfuckin' gun--

               He is waving the gun.

                                     PANCAKE
                         You think you scare me, you mewling 
                         punk! You don't scare me! Bull Connor 
                         and all his dogs didn't scare me!

               He shoves Gawain.

                                     PANCAKE
                         ...Be a man!

                                     GAWAIN
                         You fuck!

               He shoves him back.

               Pancake shoves:

                                     PANCAKE
                         Be a man!

                                     GAWAIN
                         You ain't no fuckin' man, fuckin' a 
                         sixty-year-old lady in pigtails!

                                     PANCAKE
                         WHY YOU BASTARD PUNK! MOUNTAIN GIRL 
                         IS FIFTY-THREE!

               They are shoving each other now, getting into it.

                                     PANCAKE
                         ...SHE COULD RIDE YOUR ASS TO JELLY!

               He lunges at him with a bear hug and his inertia sends both 
               men tumbling to the floor, where they roll and wrestle.

                                     DORR
                         Gentlemen, please!

                                     GAWAIN
                         I seen Virginia hams I'd rather stick 
                         my dick in than your old--

               BANG! A muffled gunshot.

               Quiet.

               The two men have stopped rolling.

               They stare at each other where they lie, Pancake on top.

               At length:

                                     PANCAKE
                         ...Oh my god...

               Horrified, he slowly rises.

                                     PANCAKE
                         ...I think he's hit!

               The men gather round and look down.

               Gawain still stares up at the ceiling.

               Pancake stoops, waves his hand in front of his eyes. No 
               reaction.

                                     PANCAKE
                         ...I'll just check the carotid artery.

               He checks the carotid artery.

                                     PANCAKE
                         ...That's a negative.

                                     LUMP
                         Oh, fuck.

                                     DORR
                         Oh my.

                                     LUMP
                         Is he dead, Professor?

                                     PANCAKE
                         Sure he's dead. I checked his carotid 
                         artery.

                                     DORR
                         Well this is most irregular. We will 
                         need a Hefty bag.

               INT. MUNSON HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

               THE CELLAR DOOR

               Creaking open. The Professor, Lump, and the General peek 
               out.

               The living room is empty but a sliver of the kitchen is 
               visible; its light is on, and we can hear water running.

               Dorr hisses:

                                     DORR
                         She is in the kitchen. I shall 
                         distract her while you steal out 
                         with the carcass.

               INT. MUNSON HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT

               Dorr enters breezily; Mrs. Munson is at the sink, filling a 
               teapot.

               Dorr positions himself so that, to talk to him, Mrs. Munson 
               has her back to the living room.

                                     DORR
                         Well, my dear Mrs. Munson, I have 
                         outlined your position to my 
                         colleagues and I now return to you 
                         to return our collective verdict.

                                     MRS. MUNSON
                         Mm-hmm.

               Behind her, the General peers around the corner and starts a 
               catlike advance across the living room.

                                     DORR
                         There was much spirited discussion 
                         and an atmosphere of frank give-and-
                         take. Some of our number were 
                         initially appalled at your proposal 
                         that we simply return the money; 
                         some were more receptive.

                                     MRS. MUNSON
                         I don't care they was receptive or 
                         not!

                                     DORR
                         And that attitude, madam, was a factor 
                         in our discussions. To a man, I must 
                         say, they were devastated at the 
                         prospect of not being able to 
                         contribute to their respective 
                         charities.

               The General signals to Lump who now crosses the living room 
               with a big garbage bag slung over one shoulder in a fireman's 
               carry.

                                     MRS. MUNSON
                         Well that is a shame.

                                     DORR
                         Indeed. But at the end of the day, 
                         your position prevailed, and the men 
                         have decided that we shall return 
                         the money -- every last cent of it! -- 
                         and attend Sunday services, rather 
                         than spend the remainder of our years 
                         wasting away in the Mississippi Men's 
                         Correctional Facility. Though that 
                         was the original preference of some.

                                     MRS. MUNSON
                         Well I'm glad y'all came to see the 
                         light, anyway. I'm gonna have some 
                         tea and go to bed.

               The Professor, seeing that the General and Lump have made it 
               out the door, is anxious to wind things up:

                                     DORR
                         So the money shall be returned 
                         tomorrow at the opening of the casino 
                         office. Enjoy your tea, madam...

               Backing out, he looks to one side.

               Through the living room window he can see the hearse pulling 
               away from the curb. There is another car -- an old Volkswagon 
               microbus -- slowly tooling the opposite way down the street.

               Dorr looks back to Mrs. Munson.

                                     DORR
                         ...and congratulations on having 
                         recalled to the fold five poor, 
                         confused sheep who had momentarily 
                         strayed.

               EXT. MISSISSIPPI RIVER - BRIDGE - NIGHT

               We are at the middle of the bridge, the tower gargoyle looking 
               blankly down at the doings below.

               In the misty night Lump and the General are braced over the 
               railing, looking down, each holding one of the feet that 
               protrude from the Hefty bag cinched around Gawain's ankles. 
               A cigarette burns on the General's lower lip. Behind the two 
               men we can see the idling hearse.

               There is the toot of the garbage scow. Lump and the General 
               release Gawain's feet.

               Their POV shows the sack receding and flumping into the 
               garbage piled onto the scow that slips by below.

               A flock of scavenger birds, disturbed by the impact, lifts 
               off the scow with angry caws.

               INT. MUNSON HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

               Dorr skulks at a corner of the living room's picture window, 
               peering out at the street.

               EXT. MUNSON HOUSE - NIGHT

               DOOR'S POV

               The Volkswagon microbus again cruises slowly down the street 
               in the same direction as previously; apparently it has been 
               circling.

               INT. MUNSON HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

               The Professor scowls.

               EXT. MUNSON HOUSE - NIGHT

               DORR'S POV

               The hearse pulls up to the curb.

               INT. MUNSON HOUSE - CELLAR - NIGHT

               The Professor clomps down the cellar stairs. Pancake is 
               loading their digging implements into a satchel.

                                     PANCAKE
                         They back yet?

               Dorr is absent:

                                     DORR
                         Yes... yes, they just arrived.

               Pancake straightens from the satchel.

                                     PANCAKE
                         Good. I'll go dump these in the 
                         hearse.

               He mounts the stairs with a satchel in either hand. We can 
               hear the front door opening as the other men enter.

               Dorr, bemused, but apparently moved by a hunch, advances 
               slowly to the sackbutt case.

               He slides the catch that lets its spring clasp pop up.

               He lifts the lid.

               Mother Jones magazine. Piles of Mother Jones magazines.

                                     DORR
                         What in heaven's name...

               He riffles a pile, confirming that it is in fact all magazine, 
               no money.

               Lump and the General are clomping down the stairs.

                                     DORR
                         ...General!

               EXT. MUNSON HOUSE - NIGHT

               We are PULLING Clark down the street, a satchel in either 
               hand.

               HIS POV

               The microbus, parked halfway down the block, ominously idling.

               THE BUS

               We are CLOSE on its side-view mirror. Someone leans from the 
               driver's seat for a view into the mirror, and in the mirror 
               we see her, pigtails swinging: Mountain Girl.

               HER POV

               Clark Pancake, still rather small, approaching up the empty 
               street.

               PANCAKE

               PULLING him again. A smile is beginning to play at the corners 
               of his mouth.

                                     PANCAKE
                         No extra share, huh...

               The smile abruptly fades.

               He stops in his tracks for no discernible reason. At length:

                                     PANCAKE
                         ...Nnnrnf.

               He pants.

               Behind him, in the deep background, we see the General 
               bounding into the street and silently toward us.

                                     PANCAKE
                         ...Oof!

               The moment passes. Pancake shakes his head, as if to clear 
               it, and resumes his walk.

               HIS POV

               We are nearing the bus.

               THE BUS

               Mountain Girl sits in the idling bus, waiting.

               With a thunk and a gentle rock of the bus, we hear its back 
               doors opening, and Pancake's voice.

                                     PANCAKE
                         Mountain.

                                     MOUNTAIN GIRL
                         Clark.

               We hear an oof! of exertion as Pancake hoists each of the 
               two satchels into the back. The oofs are followed by:

                                     PANCAKE
                         ...Nnrungh! Aaarmh... Ninnnff... 
                         Offffflleghhll...

                                     MOUNTAIN GIRL
                         IBS, dear?

                                                                 WE CUT TO:

               THE BACK OF THE BUS

               to show Pancake being garotted by the General.

                                     PANCAKE
                         Nnnnnmmmmfffgh!

               EXT. MISSISSIPPI RIVER - BRIDGE - NIGHT

               The tower gargoyle stares sightlessly down.

               Lump and the General are at their accustomed place, each 
               holding a foot shod in a large hiking boot.

               Behind them we see the hearse idling.

               Near them on the bridge, both hands grasping the railing as 
               he gazes dreamily out into the night, is the Professor.

                                     DORR
                         "...Like those Nicean barks of yore 
                         That gently, o'er a perfumed sea..."

               We hear the toot of the boat's horn and the men drop the 
               body.

                                     LUMP
                         Quick! Grab Clark!

               They quickly stoop and grab another bag-swaddled body out of 
               which even larger hiking boots protrude.

                                     DORR
                         "...The weary, wayworn wanderer 
                         bore... "

               They drop the second body.

                                     DORR
                         "...To his own native shore."

               We hear the distant flump and the cawing of scavenger birds.

               INT. MUNSON HOUSE - CELLAR - NIGHT

               CLOSE ON A FIST

               With three protruding straws.

               SWEATING CLOSE-UPS:

               Lump picks a long straw: relief.

               The General picks a short straw. A short grunt.

                                     DORR
                         Excellent. I believe, at last, we 
                         have the right man for the job.

               INT. MUNSON HOUSE - MRS. MUNSON'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

               Mrs. Munson lies on her back gently snoring. At the open 
               window, sheers ripple in the evening breeze.

               A large clock ticks upon the mantle. It is almost one o'clock.

               INT. MUNSON HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

               THE CELLAR DOOR

               It creaks open. The General looks stealthily out. A cigarette 
               in his mouth plumes smoke.

               He pushes the door fully open, emerges.

               Mrs. Munson's snore catches on an inhale. She mutters 
               something, sighs, and resumes snoring.

               INT. MUNSON HOUSE - STAIRCASE - NIGHT

               The General treads lightly, noiselessly, up the stairway 
               leading to the second floor. He slides one hand into his 
               jacket, pulls out a garotte.

               With the faintest whoosh he whips it in a complicated loop 
               and snags the other handle with his other hand.

               INT. MUNSON HOUSE - UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - NIGHT

               The General emerges from the staircase and advances on the 
               closed bedroom door. As he reaches for the knob he performs 
               the no-handed flip of the burning cigarette into his mouth.

               INT. MUNSON HOUSE - MRS. MUNSON'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

               The door swings noiselessly open. The General pauses to 
               survey:

               The still room. The ticking clock. Mrs. Munson, a large 
               sleeping mound upon the bed.

               The General advances, raising the garotte in both hands.

               He closes on her sleeping form.

               The garotte is lowered toward her exposed neck.

               It is a foot -- half a foot -- inches-away...

               Somewhere a muted gear ratchets and triggers the toll of--

               The clock, striking one. It is a cuckoo clock but, instead 
               of a bird emerging, a berobed Jesus comes out with his hand 
               resting on the head of a child who gazes up in adoration.

               The General starts at the noise and then suddenly freezes, 
               his eyes widening.

               Jesus retreats back into the clock.

               The General has swallowed his cigarette.

               He reaches up to his throat, panicked. In a silent frenzy, 
               he yanks loose his ascot.

               He gazes wildly about.

               He reaches for the water glass at Mrs. Munson's bedside.

               He tips it back into his mouth. There is a rattling sound.

               HIS POV

               The uptilted water glass is sending false teeth -- full uppers 
               and lowers -- rattling toward his face.

               THE GENERAL

               He frantically -- but still noiselessly -- sets the glass 
               back down. Wildly looks about, one hand clamped to his throat.

               A mad but silent dash for the door.

               INT. MUNSON HOUSE - UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - NIGHT

               Plunging for the head of the stairs--

               --a brief yowl from the cat--

               --recoiling from where its tail has been stepped on, a hiss 
               and a flash of its claws at the General's leg--

               INT. MUNSON HOUSE - STAIRCASE/LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

               --and he falls down the stairs, each thudding impact bouncing 
               his body like a rag doll's.

               At the bottom of the stairs he lies still.

               A CLOSE-UP shows his head bent at an unnatural angle, 
               unblinking eyes staring. Traces of smoke wisp from each 
               nostril and his open mouth.

               Over the mantle, Othar returns the dead man's stare. He looks 
               somewhat smug.

               INT. MUNSON HOUSE - CELLAR - NIGHT

               The Professor and Lump, responding to the noise, look slowly 
               up toward the ceiling.

               EXT. MISSISSIPPI RIVER - BRIDGE - NIGHT

               The body is laid out in a garbage bag by the rail.

               The Professor stands looking at it, contemplatively.

               Lump stands looking at it, contemplatively.

               The cat sits nearby on its haunches looking at it, 
               impassively.

               The professor muses:

                                     DORR
                         ...T'was our até brought us to this 
                         pass...

                                     LUMP
                         What, Professor?

               There is the toot! of an approaching scow. Dorr's manner is 
               still absent, his regard still on the corpse:

                                     DORR
                         Our overweening pride... The old 
                         woman is a more potent antagonist 
                         than one had imagined...

               He rouses himself, goes over to the bagged corpse. Lump 
               follows him and the two men hoist the body over the rail.

                                     DORR
                         ...Now, Lump, I'm afraid it falls to 
                         you to finish the job.

               They let the body fall onto the scow passing below.

                                     DORR
                         ...The comedy must end.

               The Professor turns to Lump and tries to hand him Gawain's 
               gun, but Lump, uncomfortable, declines to take it.

                                     LUMP
                         ...Professor, I been doing some 
                         thinking.

                                     DORR
                         Oh dear. Oh dear oh dear oh dear.

                                     LUMP
                         Maybe she's right! Maybe we should 
                         be going to church!

                                     DORR
                         Oh dear, Lump. I feared that those 
                         would be your words. Not that I don't 
                         appreciate your giving the matter 
                         the benefit of your thought. But 
                         please recall, young man, our 
                         respective functions in this 
                         enterprise. I am a professor, the 
                         professor as you yourself so often 
                         say, the thinker, the "brains of the 
                         operation," trained in fact in the 
                         arts of cogitation. You, Lump, are 
                         the goon, the hooligan, the dumb 
                         brute whose actions must be directed 
                         by a higher intelligence.

                                     LUMP
                         Yeah, I know, but--

                                     DORR
                         No buts, dear boy! Do not repeat the 
                         error of thinking! Now is the moment 
                         of praxis! Now, my dear boy, you 
                         must act!

               Lump reluctantly takes the gun that the Professor thrusts 
               upon him.

                                     LUMP
                         I can't do it, Professor! A nice old 
                         lady like that!

                                     DORR
                         Think of the riches, Lump, that you 
                         and I alone shall divide! Recall the 
                         dream of wealth untold that first 
                         drew you to this enterprise!

                                     LUMP
                         But--

                                     DORR
                         And reflect also that if you decline 
                         to act, forcing me to do so, then 
                         you shall no longer have any 
                         entitlement to the money! Your offices 
                         shall have been nugatory!

                                     LUMP
                         You mean -- you mean -- you're gonna 
                         kill her?!

                                     DORR
                         Of course! My hand would be forced!

                                     LUMP
                         I can't let you do that, Professor! 
                         A nice old lady like that!

                                     DORR
                         You?! Allow? Not allow? What 
                         presumption! You stupid boy! You 
                         very very extremely stupid boy!

               We hear the toot of an approaching scow -- this one very 
               long, sustained under all of the following:

                                     LUMP
                         Oh yeah?

               He points the gun at the Professor and--

                                     LUMP
                         ...Well who looks stupid now?

               --squeezes -- click -- on an empty chamber.

                                     LUMP
                         ...Huh?

               He turns the gun to have a look.

                                     LUMP
                         ...No bullets?

               HIS POV

               shows the foreshortened barrel as he experimentally squeezes 
               the trigger.

                                                                 WE CUT TO:

               the Professor on the BANG! and, after a sad shake of his 
               head,

                                                               CUT BACK TO:

               Lump in time to see him finish toppling back over the rail.

               The scow-horn ends.

                                     DORR
                         Perhaps... it had to be thus.

               He goes to the railing to look down.

               Lump, face-up on a pile of garbage, glides away. Disturbed 
               birds flap upward.

               The professor muses:

                                     DORR
                         "...Lo, in yon brilliant window-niche 
                         How statue-like I see thee stand..."

               His gaze rises with the ascending birds.

               Among the white gulls is one black bird. The Professor eyes 
               it as it rises past him.

                                     DORR
                         ...Hm. A raven?

               FROM VERY HIGH

               we look down on the Professor, the black bird rising to perch 
               on the gargoyle on the suspension tower in the foreground.

               The bird settles on a loose, teetering piece of masonry.

               BACK TO THE PROFESSOR

               looking at the receding red light on the bridge of the 
               receding scow:

                                     DORR
                         "...The agate lamp within thy hand... 
                         "

               BACK HIGH

               The teetering chunk of masonry tips away and the perchless 
               bird flaps off.

               BACK TO THE PROFESSOR

               very dreamy: he sees something in the distance, beyond time 
               and space:

                                     DORR
                         ...Ah, Psyche! from the regions which 
                         Are Holy land!"

               This is punctuated by the crunching impact of masonry scoring 
               a direct hit on his head. He falls over the rail.

               His cape snags on the railing and he hangs limp and lifeless. 
               Directly below his dangling body the stern of Lump's barge 
               is slipping away to leave black waters and the clanking of 
               chains.

               The fabric of the Professor's cape begins to tear. His body 
               drops in fits and starts as the fabric gives way.

               Finally the body rips free. It falls away from us. As it 
               does so the clanking chains are pulling into view the second-
               banger -- a garbage barge being chain-towed by the receding 
               scow.

               Dorr's body lands neatly on the barge.

               A gust of wind.

               The cape flaps free of the railing and is wind-tossed away 
               amidst the cawing birds.

               The cat, watching, blinks.

               INT. MUNSON HOUSE - MRS. MUNSON'S BEDROOM - DAY

               DRINKING GLASS

               It is resting on the very edge of the night table -- 
               protruding, in fact, past the table's edge.

               It is morning. We hear rustling from the bed.

               Hands reach INTO FRAME and hesitate, finding the glass empty 
               of water and precariously perched.

                                     MRS. MUNSON (O.S.)
                         Hmm.

               The hands tip the glass and take the teeth. We hear 
               complicated oral noises.

               EXT. MUNSON HOUSE - DAY

               The door opens away to reveal the morning paper lying on the 
               stoop. Mrs. Munson leans INTO FRAME to pick it up and we 
               ADJUST as she straightens to have a look:

               The headline says: $2.6 MILLION DISAPPEARS FROM LADY LUCK 
               CASINO. The subhead: POLICE BAFFLED.

                                     MRS. MUNSON
                         Mm-hm.

               INT. MUNSON HOUSE - CELLAR - DAY

               Mrs. Munson is walking down the stairs.

                                     MRS. MUNSON
                         Professor!

               She stops midway down and looks:

               The empty cellar.

               Money stacked neatly on the card table.

               Mrs. Munson sadly shakes her head.

                                     MRS. MUNSON
                         ...Hmm. Couldn't face the music.

               EXT. SAUCIER MUNICIPAL BUILDING - DAY

               Mrs. Munson is climbing the porch in her Sunday best. She 
               feints at the dog who lies curled in the sun:

                                     MRS. MUNSON
                         Scoot now! Outa the way!

               INT. SAUCIER MUNICIPAL BUILDING - DAY

               The sheriff is busy on the phone; there is a DEPUTY today 
               also on the phone. The sheriff, seeing Mrs. Munson enter, 
               covers the phone with one hand.

                                     SHERIFF WYNER
                         Miz Munson.

                                     MRS. MUNSON
                         Sheriff, I gotta make a statement.

                                     SHERIFF WYNER
                         Could it possibly wait, ma'am? We're 
                         a little busy today.

                                     MRS. MUNSON
                         I guess it can wait, but it's about 
                         that casino money.

               The sheriff exchanges a significant look with the deputy, 
               then murmurs into the phone:

                                     SHERIFF WYNER
                         Call you right back.

               He cradles the phone and smiles at Mrs. Munson.

                                     SHERIFF WYNER
                         ...You know something about it?

                                     MRS. MUNSON
                         Something? Everything! I got it at 
                         home.

                                     SHERIFF WYNER
                         You... you have what at home, now?

                                     MRS. MUNSON
                         The money. Two point six million 
                         dollars. Down in my root cellar. All 
                         stacked up nice and neat.

                                     SHERIFF WYNER
                         Mm-hmm.

               The deputy pauses to look up from his phone:

                                     DEPUTY
                         How'd it get there, Marva?

                                     MRS. MUNSON
                         Bunch a desperate men that stole it 
                         put it there, that's how! They was 
                         musicians of the Renaissance period, 
                         played the sackbutt and so on -- 
                         well, it turns out they really 
                         couldn't play, although they could 
                         recite poems to break your heart. 
                         Their ringleader speaks in dead 
                         tongues.

                                     SHERIFF WYNER
                         Does he now.

                                     MRS. MUNSON
                         I tried to get you to see him! That 
                         night?

                                     SHERIFF WYNER
                         Oh yes.

                                     MRS. MUNSON
                         I had to yell at 'em 'bout stealin' 
                         all that money and I guess I made 
                         'em feel pretty bad 'cause they picked 
                         up and left without takin' the money. 
                         But I was peeved with 'em, Sheriff, 
                         they'd been up to all sorts of 
                         mischief, come close to blowin' up 
                         the house, disturbed Othar no end.

                                     SHERIFF WYNER
                         Angry, was he?

                                     MRS. MUNSON
                         Wouldn't you be? All that racket!

                                     SHERIFF WYNER
                         I expect so.

                                     MRS. MUNSON
                         And they let Pickles out too!

               The sheriff sighs.

                                     SHERIFF WYNER
                         So you want us to go fetch him.

                                     MRS. MUNSON
                         No, he's back, but what you want me 
                         to do with the money?

                                     SHERIFF WYNER
                         Well...

               He and the deputy exchange looks. The sheriff looks back at 
               Mrs. Munson.

                                     SHERIFF WYNER
                         ...Why don't you just keep it, Miz 
                         Munson.

                                     MRS. MUNSON
                         Keep it?

                                     DEPUTY
                         You keep it, Marva.

                                     MRS. MUNSON
                         Well... I know it's only a penny 
                         offa everybody's policy...

                                     SHERIFF WYNER
                         How's that ma'am?

                                     MRS. MUNSON
                         I know folks don't much care. Could 
                         I... You s'pose I could...

                                     SHERIFF WYNER
                         Yes ma'am?

                                     MRS. MUNSON
                         Could I give it all to Bob Jones 
                         University?

                                     SHERIFF WYNER
                         That'd be nice, ma'am.

               She picks up her handbag and heads for the door.

                                     MRS. MUNSON
                         ...Well, long as everybody knows.

                                     SHERIFF WYNER
                         Thank you for the information, ma'am.

                                     MRS. MUNSON
                         You're welcome, sheriff. Just doin' 
                         my duty.

               EXT. SAUCIER, MISSISSIPPI - DAY

               Mrs. Munson is walking home. It is a beautiful spring day.

               From far off, wafting toward us on the breeze, we can hear 
               the church chorus singing. Mrs. Munson joins in. She has a 
               strong voice:

                                     MRS. MUNSON
                         Leaning, Leaning, Safe and secure 
                         from all harm. Lean on Jesus, Lean 
                         on Jesus, Leaning on the everlasting 
                         arm.

               She turns up the walk to her house.

                                     MRS. MUNSON
                         ...What a fellowship, What a peace 
                         of mind, Safe and secure from all 
                         harm. Lean on Jesus, Lean on Jesus, 
                         Leaning on the everlasting arm...

               When she opens the front door the cat slips out.

                                     MRS. MUNSON
                         ...Pickles!

               It races off down the street.

                                     MRS. MUNSON
                         ...Pickles!

               EXT. MISSISSIPPI RIVER - BRIDGE - DAY

               Pickles scurries along the walkway. We hear the toot! of an 
               approaching scow.

               The cat reaches the middle of the bridge. He sticks his head 
               through the bars of the railing.

               When we CUT CLOSE on the cat as he looks down at the water, 
               we see that he holds in his mouth a human finger.

               As the scow passes underneath, the cat opens its mouth and 
               lets the finger drop.

               The finger falls away and is barely visible by the time it 
               hits the scow.

               The cat looks up INTO THE LENS, and blinks. Its sideways 
               irises adjust.

               The scow is gliding away. With the low mournful toot of its 
               horn we tilt up the river to the great garbage island where 
               scavenger birds pick through the trash.

                                         THE END

    WHITE      -   9-7-8                                       1.

    FADE IN:

1   OPENING CREDIT SEQUENCE. Images and sounds are surreal,          1
    dreamlike, disturbing:

    A HAND is trying to dial three simple numbers. Trembling
    fingers miss, try again...we hear boop-boop-boop.

                                  911 OPERATOR
                           (filtered)
                    911 operator, what is your emergency?

    The phone rises, gripped tightly. Knuckles white. We're TIGHT,
    it's dark, we see no face -- just slack, trembling lips.

    Whoever it is, he can't talk. All we hear is breathing, all
    we sense is grief and panic and deep shock.

                                  OPERATOR (V.O.)
                           (filtered)
                    Hello? Can you hear me? Can you
                    speak?

                                  CLYDE
                    ...eyes...

                                  OPERATOR (V.O.)
                    What? Can you speak up?

                                  CLYDE
                    ...her...eyes...

2   EXT. ROAD - NIGHT                                                2

    Lights appear like phantoms over blacktop, flashing. Police
    cars coming our way.

                                  OPERATOR (V.O.)
                    Sir, what is the nature of your
                    emergency?

    The man can't speak.

                                  OPERATOR (V.O.)
                    Sir? Are you injured? Do you need
                    medical attention?

    The cars blast by us...

3   INT. HOUSE - NIGHT                                               3

    TIGHT ON PHONE AND MOUTH:

                                  CLYDE
                    ...her eyes...she can't...

4   EXT. HOUSE - NIGHT                                                4

    POLICE VEHICLES converge in SLOW-MOTION, dreamlike. Doors fly
    open, COPS jump out, weapons drawn as WE MOVE with them to:

    Front door. RAMP TO NORMAL CAMERA SPEED as it opens, revealing:

    BENSON CLYDE, phone still gripped. He barely registers the
    weapons aimed at his face. CAMERA CLOSES IN ON HIM, as:

                               CLYDE
                 She can't...close her eyes.

    He's pulled from frame. CAMERA KEEPS MOVING, following COPS
    into the house...

    Dark as hell inside. And tense. Arms training weapons. Moving
    up a tight hallway, emerging into...

    THE LIVING ROOM

    ...where the flashlight beams find blood-spatter patterns.
    Furniture shattered and overturned. A kid's sneaker.

    The flashlights play across TWO BODIES in the wreckage -- a
    woman's pale hand, a child's motionless leg.

    CAMERA DRIFTS AROUND to the cops' faces, as:

                               COP #1
                        (unsnaps shoulder radio)
                 Dispatch, we have multiple 10-55s,
                 need full response, 11-41.

5   EXT. HOUSE (SLO-MO) - NIGHT                                       5

    Chaotic now, vehicles and lights. The eye of the storm is
    Clyde on the lawn, hugging his knees, fetal with horror and
    grief. He's screaming at the sky, but no sound is coming out.
    EMS TECHS enter shot, steal the frame, race toward the door...

6   INT. HOUSE (SLO-MO) - NIGHT                                       6

    TRACKING SHOT at floor level, photos being taken. FLASHES
    bathe the foreground wreckage. FORENSIC TECHS step gingerly.
    Uniformed cops hang grimly back, hugging the walls...

    CAMERA BRINGS US TO CLOSEUP: A PROFILE IN DEEP SHADOW in the
    foreground, face tilted obliquely in the wreckage.

    A CAMERA FLASH reveals the face with shocking glare and the
    IMAGE FREEZES. A TEN YEAR-OLD GIRL, eyes open, staring at us.

                               CLYDE (V.O.)
                        (prelap)
                 Her eyes. That's how they were.
                 Open like that. You see?

7   INT. CITY HALL - CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY                            7

    Clyde is seated, speaking slowly and precisely. ANGLE WIDENS,
    revealing the room, light filtering through blinds, as:

                                 CLYDE
                  When I found my wife and child dead,
                  my little girl's eyes were open.
                         (pause)
                  The last thing she saw of this earth
                  were the faces of the men who took
                  her life. Can you understand that?

                                NICK (O.S.)
                  Yes. Yes, I can.

                                CLYDE
                  Can you? Really?
                         (looks to somebody else)
                  You?

                                CANTRELL (O.S.)
                  Mr. Clyde. I don't see this helping.

                                CLYDE
                  No? You married? Children?

    ANGLE HAS NOW WIDENED/DRIFTED to include D.A. JONAS CANTRELL,
    Senior Attorney for the State. He wears thick glasses and is
    suffering the early stages of macular degeneration.

                                CANTRELL
                  Divorced. I have a son and daughter.
                  Both in college.

                                CLYDE
                  My daughter was ten. I married late
                  in life.

    Clyde spreads the crime scene photos further on the table.
    ANGLE COMES AROUND to reveal the third man in the room:

    NICK PRICE

    The D.A. under Cantrell -- focused, exceptional at what he
    does, the man you'd want on your side.

                                CLYDE
                  You, Mr. Price? Married? Kids?

    Nick doesn't answer, stays focused on the task:

                                NICK
                  I've seen the crime scene photos,
                  Mr. Clyde. Many times. They're
                  horrifying. But they don't alter
                  the facts of the case.

    BLUE   -   9-19-08                                        4.

                               CLYDE
                 Facts? Those men are guilty. Both
                 of them. You know they are.

                               NICK
                 This isn't about what we know. It's
                 about what we can prove in court.

                               CANTRELL
                 Things have gone against us. Tainted
                 crime scene, evidence thrown out...

                               CLYDE
                 Maybe you just haven't tried hard                     *
                 enough.

                               NICK
                 Look. We've had only one real break
                 in this case. The fact that one
                 asshole has decided to testify
                 against the other asshole.

                               CLYDE
                 In return for immunity. So he gets
                 away with it.

                               CANTRELL
                 The other man doesn't. He'll go
                 down for the crime. That has to
                 count for something.

                               CLYDE
                 Yes. It counts for half.
                        (pause, quietly)
                 Don't reward one of the men who
                 murdered my family. Please.

                               NICK
                 Mr. Clyde. I can't claim to know
                 what it's like to be in your
                 position. Losing your wife and child.
                 But please try to grasp how limited
                 our options are. This is how the
                 justice system works.

    Clyde sits for a long moment, numb, absorbing this.

                               CLYDE
                 Ah. I see my mistake. I came for
                 justice. Instead I got a system.

8   INT. CITY HALL - HALLWAY - DAY                                 8

    SARAH LOWELL, fresh out of law school, is waiting anxiously
    for the meeting to end, arms full of file folders.                 *

glancing impatiently at his watch.                                *

accidentally plowing into Sarah as he passes.                     *

                 Sorry. My fault.

                               SARAH
                 It's okay.

    On he goes. Nick and Cantrell exit the room.

                               SARAH
                 You're due upstairs in three minutes!
                 You're gonna be late!

                 Thank you, voice of doom.

    They move toward the elevators with Reynolds. Sarah's at their       *
    heels, sensing the tension and keeping her mouth shut.

                 just tumble off the fucking truck.
                 Do the math...

    Cantrell has trouble seeing the elevator button, misses. Nick
    presses it for him. (This is thrown away without comment;
    both men are used to Cantrell's bad eyes by now.)

    They elevator opens, they get on...                                  *

    Nick shoots him a withering look, glances back at Sarah.

                 What do you think?

                  Young lady. Someday you might have

                  the case before the court. Speak.

                                SARAH
                  Okay. Um. You can take both men to
                  trial, spend a year and millions of
                  taxpayer dollars, and probably lose.
                  Or you can cut a deal and at least
                  put one of the men who did the crime
                  on death row. It's a no-brainer.                      *

     CLARENCE DARBY is the focus, Bill Reynolds at his side.           *

                                JUDGE BURCH                             *
                  The agreement has been vetted by
                  both sides? Satisfactory to all?

                                REYNOLDS
                  Yes, your Honor. Defense approves.

                                CANTRELL
                  State also approves, your Honor.

     Nick places a document before DARBY, along with a pen.

                                NICK
                  Clarence Darby. This document
                  guarantees that you will provide
                  testimony against Rupert Ames in
                  the matter of which you were both
                  accused. In return, you will be
                                (MORE)

     BLUE   -   9-19-08                                           7.

                                NICK (CONT'D)
                  shielded from further prosecution
                  for those capital crimes. But you
                  will plead guilty to the lesser
                  charge of breaking and entering.

                                REYNOLDS
                  You'll do a maximum of five years.
                  With good behavior, you could be
                  out in three.

                                JUDGE BURCH
                  That also depends on your testimony
                  and the level of your cooperation.

                                DARBY
                  Your Honor need not worry on my
                  account. I assure the court that I
                  am aware of the opportunity I've
                  been given. And I am deeply grateful
                  to all concerned.

     Nick gives Cantrell a glance, both stoically enduring this
     proceeding. Darby pulls the document closer.

                                 DARBY
                  If I may. It has come to my attention
                  that Rupert Ames has been spreading                   *
                  lies about me to the tabloid press.                   *

                  which I have no knowledge. Sexual
                  and otherwise. Libel and
                  slander...yes?

                                 NICK
                         (dryly)
                  You can always sue him.

                                DARBY
                  Well, no matter. My tongue will wag
                  in court, under oath. His tongue
                  will wag in hell.

     He puts pen to paper, looks to Nick.

                                DARBY
                  He'll get the chair?

                                NICK
                  We don't do chair. We do needle.

11   INT. CITY HALL - GRAND INTERIOR STAIRCASE - DAY                   11

     Cathedral-like, pigeons fluttering. The door from the hallway
     opens and BETSY, a months-old GERMAN SHEPHERD PUPPY, bounds
     toward us on a leash pulling Cantrell toward the top of the
     vast marble staircase. Nick trails them, nervous as hell:

     BLUE   -   9-19-08                                         8.

                                NICK
                  Whoa, Jonas, take my elbow.                          *

                                CANTRELL
                  I'm not blind. Yet. I'll do it.

                                NICK
                  You're shitty on stairs. At least
                  let me take the leash so the dog
                  doesn't pull you down.

                                CANTRELL
                  No. She needs to imprint on me. Not
                  you, not somebody else.

     Cantrell starts down. Nick's at his side, hovering and ready
     to grab him, jumping at every little lurch Cantrell makes.

                                CANTRELL
                  That's the whole point of this phase.
                  She needs to get the idea that she
                  and I are partners. Then the real
                  training can begin. Unless you wanna
                  lead me around the rest of my life.

                                   NICK
                  I'll pass.

12   EXT. COURTHOUSE STEPS - DAY                                     12

     Nick and Cantrell emerge into daylight and find Darby in the
     protective custody of a FEDERAL MARSHAL on the courthouse
     steps, surrounded by a crush of REPORTERS:

                                DARBY
                  ...it was a burglary gone wrong. We
                  thought the house was empty. Rupert
                  found the woman and child at home
                  and went crazy. I was stoned and in
                  fear of my own life, so I fled...

     They catch sight of Bill Reynolds, the defense attorney.

                                CANTRELL
                  Bill! You let all your clients give
                  testimony on the courthouse steps?

                                REYNOLDS
                  Hellooo, kettle to pot. Since when
                  do you shy away from publicity?

                                NICK
                  Since everything in this case has
                  gone sideways so far. Tell your boy
                  to save it for the courtroom.

BLUE   -     9-19-08                                        9.

                             REYNOLDS
               He's your boy too now. You tell
               him.

Reynolds proceeds down the steps...

                                NICK
               Asshole.

                                REYNOLDS
               Dickwad.

                                CANTRELL
               Fuckface.

...and vanishes in the crowd. Nick glances sourly toward Darby.

                             DARBY
               ...and may I say for the record how
               very sorry I am that I failed to
               prevent Rupert Ames from committing
               those terrible crimes...

                                NICK
               You good here?

                             CANTRELL
               Long as nobody bumps into me.

CAMERA FOLLOWS Nick through the crowd toward Darby...

                             DARBY
               ...been given a chance to put the
               drugs and foul living behind me. To
               atone for my past failings and
               weakness of character. It is a gift
               given me by God's grace...

Darby sees Nick, grabs his hand, shaking it for the cameras.

                              DARBY
               ...and the grace and wisdom of this
               court. I cannot thank you enough,
               sir. I cannot.

A BARRAGE OF CAMERA FLASHES. Nick caught off guard before the     *
press, Darby not letting go. Then Nick sees:                      *

NICK'S POV

Clyde, a tiny defeated figure far below, waits at the bus
stop. He's gazing up, seeing this photo op happen.

NICK

breaks the handshake with a flush of discomfort, signals the
federal marshal:

     WHITE   -   9-7-8                                           10.

                                NICK
                  Marshal, escort your man, please!
                         (to the reporters)
                  Mr. Darby is done here!

     Darby is hustled down the steps. The reporters surge to Nick,
     surrounding him, shouting questions.

     Nick looks over their heads and glimpses Clyde getting on a
     bus. The door closes, the bus pulls away...

13   INT. NICK'S HOUSE - NIGHT                                         13

     Nick enters. Dark. He drops his briefcase by the door.

14   INT. BATHROOM - NIGHT                                             14

     REFLECTED IN THE MIRROR: KELL, Nick's wife, is just out of
     the bath, wearing a robe and toweling her hair.

     Nick enters behind her. She cranes back for a kiss, keeps
     toweling her hair in the mirror. He hugs her from behind,
     buries his face in her neck. Drained.

                                  KELL
                  Shit day?

                                 NICK
                  Shit day. Better now.
                         (pause)
                  How's she doing?

                                KELL
                  Fine. She drove me a little crazy
                  today.

                                  NICK
                  She was busy?

                                KELL
                  In overdrive. Here. Feel.

     He reaches around, slowly unties her robe, pulls it open...

     ...revealing her pregnant belly. (Our angles have avoided
     this till now.) He places his hand, feeling for movement.

                                KELL
                  Of course she stops kicking the
                  moment you get home.

15   INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT                                              15

     SLOW TRACKING SHOT finds them in bed, Nick with his head on
     Kell's chest. Pensive.

WHITE   -   9-7-8                                           11.

                           NICK
             I had to say some things to a man
             today I didn't want to say. And I
             did something I didn't want to do.

                           KELL
             You didn't lie to him. Or bullshit
             him. Or shine him on.

                           NICK
             None of those things.

                           KELL
             So you had your reasons. You did
             what you had to. It's not your fault
             the world sucks.

Nick smiles, eases his face to her belly.

                           NICK
             You in there. Listen up. Your mother
             just said the world sucks. You may
             wanna rethink this whole thing. My
             advice? If you're asking? Just stay
             in there. I promise you, nothing
             will ever make as much sense as it
             does right now...

                           KELL
             What is wrong with you?

                           NICK
             ...plus there's shit you don't need
             to know about. Rap. Internet porn.
             Madonna's entire back catalog.

                           KELL
             Did someone drop you on your head?
             Seriously. I have swollen ankles
             and all I do is pee. That baby's
             coming out.

                           NICK
                    (weighs that)
             Okay. I'm sure you heard that. Then
             again there are the Beatles. 70's
             funk. Louie. Ella. Be a shame to
             miss those.
                    (beat, getting serious)
             All right, kid. Bring it on. But
             when you're old enough for the world
             to disappoint you, I hope you won't
             blame your old man for bringing you
             into this mess. Give me that at
             least.

16   INT. BEDROOM - DAWN                                               16

     Nick and Kell asleep. She's no longer pregnant -- it's now
     ten years later. A long beat of quiet...

     A small face peers in from the hallway. EMMA, their 10 year-
     old daughter. She darts in, puts her face to Nick's.

                                  EMMA
                           (whispering)
                  Dad?

                                  NICK
                  Huh? Wha--?

                                EMMA
                  You know what it is?

                                  NICK
                  What?

                                EMMA
                         (hollering)
                  IT'S MY BIRTHDAAAAAY!

     She jumps up on the bed, bouncing up and down and dancing
     around, hollering at the top of her lungs:

                                EMMA
                  IT'S MY BIRTHDAY, IT'S MY BIRTHDAY,
                  IT'S MY BIRTHDAY!

     Nick and Kell are too groggy to do anything but ride it out.
     Emma sails off the bed and vanishes out the door, hollering
     all the way up the hallway:

                                EMMA
                  I'M SO COOL IT'S MY BIRTHDAAAY!

     Nick and Kell are left groping with blankets, heart rates,
     and consciousness:

                                KELL
                  Glad it's once a year.

17   INT. KITCHEN/BREAKFAST AREA - MORNING                             17

     Nick and Emma finishing breakfast, getting ready to leave,
     Kell packing Emma's lunch at the counter:

                                EMMA
                  Why can't you be here?

                                NICK
                  It's a work thing. Grownup stuff.
                  You know that happens sometimes.

     BLUE   -   9-19-08                                       13.

                                EMMA
                  But it's...
                         (draws sneakily close)
                  ...MY BIRTHDAAAAAY!

     He claps his hand over her mouth.

                                NICK
                  I believe we've established that. I
                  let go, you'll stop reminding me?
                         (she nods, he lets go)
                  We'll celebrate this weekend. Tonight
                  is all about your friends. Knock                    *
                  yourselves out, don't give mom any                  *
                  grief. I'll try to be home in time
                  to tuck you in, okay?

                                EMMA
                  Okay. But what are you doing tonight
                  that is more important than...

     She's doing that "sneakily drawing close" thing again. Nick
     holds up his finger, cautioning her to say it quietly.

                                EMMA
                         (leans in, whispers)
                  ...my birthdaaaaay.

                                KELL
                  Something he'd get out of if he
                  could. Here. Take lunch. Grab                       *
                  backpack. We go.                                    *

     Emma grabs her stuff, kisses dad, races from the room. Kell
     grabs her keys to follow, kisses Nick goodbye.

                                NICK
                  Nice evasion. Thanks.

18   EXT. RURAL ROAD - DUSK                                         18

     Cars are traveling an old service road...

19   INT. TOWN CAR - DUSK                                           19

     Nick's in back with Cantrell. The years have left Cantrell
     90% blind; his glasses are beyond Coke bottle-thick.

      BLUE   -   9-19-08                                         14.

      Between them sits Betsy the German shepherd, now ten years
      old, wearing a guide-dog harness. She looks miserable wearing
      a big cone-shaped POST-SURGERY COLLAR.

                                 NICK
                   How long she have to wear this stupid
                   thing?

                                 CANTRELL
                   Till the stitches heal. Week or
                   two.

      Nick dotes on the dog, they're old pals:

                                 NICK
                   Poor honey. Sucks, doesn't it? But
                   you're very pretty. Yes, you are.
                   Even with a radar dish on your head.

                                 SARAH
                   There they are. Like clockwork.

      ANGLE SHIFTS TO Sarah -- much more confident and power-suited
      than last time we saw her -- riding up front with the driver.

19A   EXT. AERIAL ESTABLISHING - GEORGE HILL PRISON - LATE DAY          19A*

      The car pulls up to the gate as CAMERA RISES to reveal the         *
      new facility positioned right next to the old one...               *

20    INT. EXECUTION CHAMBER - NIGHT                                    20

      The condemned, RUPERT AMES, is placed against the upright
      execution table and buckled in. The table is tilted back to
      vertical. All Rupert can do is lay there and watch, as:

      MEDICAL TECHS swab his arms with alcohol, prepare the needles,
      find his veins. The needles are inserted, taped off. The I.V.
      lines are attached. Very methodical.

      The techs leave the room. The curtain is drawn aside, revealing
      the big window that separates the chamber from:

     BLUE   -   9-19-08                                          15.

21   INT. VIEWING ROOM - NIGHT                                         21

     Nick and his colleagues are among SEVERAL DOZEN WITNESSES
     seated in chairs. They watch as WARDEN IGER faces Rupert.

                                WARDEN IGER
                  Rupert Ames. Do you have anything
                  to say?

     Rupert doesn't have much of an IQ and he's scared shitless,
     but he does his best:

                                RUPERT
                  I'm here. Clarence Darby ain't. And
                  that ain't right. 'Cause that man
                  is evil, ain't no other way to say
                  it. All them things he done, and
                  him turn witness against me for it.

     He pauses, trying to untangle his thoughts.

                                 RUPERT
                  I did wrong too. I guess I'll pay
                  up. But it was always him sayin'
                  jump and how high, and I just went
                  along. Now he's killin' me and he
                  got you people to do it. And that's
                  a shame. A goddamn shame. And...
                         (pause)
                  ...and I guess that's all.

     Nick trades a look with Sarah. Cantrell is stoic.

     Warden Iger nods to TWO GUARDS manning the LETHAL INJECTION
     MACHINE, on which EIGHT OVERSIZED GLASS CYLINDERS in a vertical
     row are the main feature, filled with various clear liquids.

     There are two switches -- one a dummy, the other live (no way
     to know which is which). The guards power up the machine.
     Lights activate on the board. Each man grabs a switch, waits.

     Nick watches the wall clock. It hits 7 o'clock. The warden         *
     nods and the guards flick their switches, quickly leaving the      *
     room. The warden follows them out, closes the door.

     We hear the pumps quietly activate. Rupert is taking shallow
     breaths, terrified...then lays back to wait.

     PLUNGER ONE slowly descends, emptying its contents into the
     I.V. lines...

     Rupert sags as the fast-acting barbiturate spreads through
     his veins...his breathing slows...his head drops back... he
     loses consciousness...

     PLUNGER TWO depresses, sending the second vial of liquid into
     the I.V. lines with a quiet whir of pumps...

BLUE   -   9-19-08                                         16.

PLUNGER THREE activates...then PLUNGER FOUR...the row of
cylinders emptying in sequence...

Rupert lies unconscious, just drifting away...

He suddenly comes to. He draws in a long, shaky breath. It
catches in his throat. His eyes go wide. His entire body starts
to clench against some increasing pain.

Nick is surprised, uncertain. Betsy starts GROWLING SOFTLY at     *
Cantrell's side. Her head comes up, hackles rising.               *

Nick glances to the dog...then to Iger, sees the stunned look
on the warden's face. Something is definitely wrong.

The pumps keep whirring, the plungers keep descending...

Rupert he throws his head back, mouth wide...

                              RUPERT
             Ah...ah...AH!

The witnesses go tense, confused -- what the hell?

                           RUPERT
             Ah--ah--Jesus, don't that HURT!

Rupert looks down at his arms, his expression turning to sheer
horror, because: The veins are turning angry red, then
blackening, as the liquids course through them...

                           RUPERT
             OH FUCK, OH FUCK, THAT HUUUURTS!

Those are last coherent words he speaks. From then on, he's
just shrieking and bouncing against his straps, because:

His veins are starting to smoke. Noxious and foul. The flesh
starts giving away, blood eating though skin like acid.

Shock sweeps the onlookers:

                              SARAH
             Oh, Jesus.

                           CANTRELL
             What's going on? Nick?

People are on their feet. Horror and incomprehension.

                           CANTRELL
             Nick, goddamn it, what?

                              NICK
             I don't know!

Rupert is fast becoming a horror:

     BLUE   -   9-19-08                                       17.

     It's going down his arms and legs, up his neck, infusing his
     ears -- a nauseating discoloration courses through his body,
     using his veins as a road map, going from red to yellow to
     black like bruises birthing spontaneously before our eyes...

     People in the room scream, turning away. Nick pushes his way
     to the viewing glass, shouting at the techs:

                                NICK
                  WHAT THE FUCK'S GOING ON? DO
                  SOMETHING!

     The techs dash into the chamber -- but are instantly gagging      *
     and choking on the toxic fumes billowing from Rupert. They        *
     retreat coughing, pulling the door shut again.                    *

     Rupert's screams spew forth toxic fumes...breath blows smoke
     from his nostrils...eyes liquefy...he's arching against his
     restraints so hard that bones begin snapping, blood spewing
     and smoking through his skin...

     All Nick can do is stand at the glass in horror as whatever
     is happening runs its course and the victim collapses in a
     cloudy, toxic haze...

22   EXT. PRISON YARD - PARKING AREA - NIGHT                          22

     Drained and waiting: Nick sitting against the town car.
     Cantrell across from him with Betsy at his side (the guide
     dog will always be at his side in this movie, specified or
     not). EMERGENCY LIGHTS are swirling all around them.

     A PARADE OF PEOPLE descends: DETECTIVE DUNNIGAN, Sarah, Warden
     Iger, COPS, PRISON STAFF. Intense:

                                IGER
                  We're still trying to sort through
                  this thing.

                                CANTRELL
                  Gentlemen, we face a terrible
                  shitstorm of scrutiny in the days
                  to come. We need answers. Start
                  with what we know.

                                IGER
                  Lethal injection is a series of
                  drugs given in a specific order.
                  Somebody had to have replaced one
                  or more of those ingredients with
                  something else.

                  I'll ask because somebody has to.                    *
                  Is there any chance, no matter how
                  remote, that this was an accident?
                  A mix-up? Weird shit happens?

     A beat of awkward silence. The warden hesitating.

                                SARAH
                  Show them. The bad part.

23   INT. PHONE JUNCTION ROOM - NIGHT                                23*

     Dunnigan brings our group in. ELECTRICIANS huddle at an array    *
     of circuits and trunk lines. In the dancing flashlight beams:    *

                                DUNNIGAN                               *
                  Some kind of bypass on the phone                     *
                  lines.

     Nick sees a CIRCUIT-BOARD spliced into the wiring.

                                DUNNIGAN                               *
                  Twenty minutes before the execution,                 *
                  the prison stopped receiving incoming
                  calls and emails. Cell service went                  *
                  dark too. Signal was probably jammed.

                                SARAH                                  *
                  The bad part. I was just on with
                  the Governor's office. He commuted
                  Rupert Ames' sentence. They were
                  trying to call us to stop the
                  execution. They couldn't get through.

     Nick and Cantrell are stunned as this sinks in.

                                DUNNIGAN
                  The Governor's incoming number
                  triggered this device and shut out
                  any further calls.

     Cantrell removes his glasses, rubs his eyes. Softly:

                                CANTRELL
                  Oh, fuck me. Fuck me.

                  One more thing.                                       *

     Dunnigan aims his maglight and swings the junction box cover
     all the way open. Scrawled on the inside of the door in red
     are the words: "HIS TONGUE WILL WAG IN HELL."

                                DUNNIGAN
                  This mean anything to you?                            *

     CAMERA PUSHES IN on Nick...

24   EXT. PRISON YARD - PARKING AREA - NIGHT                          24

     Nick's LAPTOP sits on an unmarked car, streaming the D.A.'S
     DATABASE by wireless. Nick taps the keys, as:

                                NICK
                  Clarence Darby. That's what he said
                  when he agreed to testify against
                  the man we executed tonight.

                                DUNNIGAN
                  "His tongue will wag in hell." Those
                  very words? It was ten years ago.

                                SARAH
                  I remember it too. Some things stick
                  in your head.

                                 NICK
                  Check the court transcripts, they're
                  public record.

     DARBY'S MUGSHOT (ten years ago) scans up, along with pertinent    *
     info of that time. GARZA, Dunnigan's partner, peers at it.        *

                  he's one of our C.I.s.

     Surprised looks are traded.

                                DUNNIGAN
                  You think, or you know?

     BLUE   -   9-19-08                                       20.

                                GARZA
                  That's not the name he uses now.                    *
                  But I'm pretty sure he's one of
                  Bernstein's informants.

                                DUNNIGAN
                  Okay, raise Bernstein, I want
                  everything he's got, including an
                  address. We roll with tactical.

                  How about I ride-along? Give you a

                                CANTRELL
                  Is that necessary?

                                NICK
                  You said yourself we should move
                  fast. This thing'll be all over the
                  morning news cycle. We'd all look a
                  lot better if we have the right man
                  in custody by then.

     Off Cantrell's look...

                                NICK
                  I think so. Hard to tell.

     Dunnigan scrolls the classified police data pertaining to the
     informant: dates, number of convictions attributed...

     BLUE   -   9-19-08                                       21.

                  Jesus, look at this. No wonder
                  Bernstein loves him.

                                GARZA
                  We scored a lot of good intel off
                  this fuckhead through the years.
                  Almost a shame to bag the guy.

     A snort from Nick. The cops glance back.

                                   NICK
                  A shame?

                                 GARZA
                  He's helped us put a lot of bad
                  people behind bars. Look. Arrests,

                                NICK
                  I can read a C.I. profile. What I
                  see is an asshole dirty up to his
                  ears in the drug trade. So you cops
                  look the other way? He gets a free
                  pass as long as he keeps feeding
                  you convictions?

                                DUNNIGAN
                  Isn't that what you did ten years
                  ago? Give this guy a free pass in
                  return for a conviction?
                         (off Nick's look)
                  Maybe we played this asshole to our
                  advantage on the street, but you're
                  the one who put him there. So, no
                  offense, but you might wanna go
                  fuck yourself a little.

     Nick stares at the man on the dashboard computer screen...

27   INT. CLARENCE DARBY'S HOUSE - NIGHT                               27*

     ...who is indeed Clarence Darby, naked and drenched with sweat,    *
     taking a hit off a crack pipe. A woman's HAND flails up into
     frame, trying to grab for it.

                                   DARBY
                  Wait...wait...

     He sucks in a full breath, hands the pipe off to: LISA, the
     thin tattooed skank he's got bent over his bed and is fucking
     from behind. She flares the bowl with a lighter, barely
     registering any reaction as he keeps pumping her.

BLUE    -   9-19-08                                      22.

              Almost. Almost.

                            LISA
              This shit makes you soft, baby.

                            DARBY
                     (thrusting, grimacing)
              Thank you...for stating the
              obvious...you...bitch...

He grits his teeth. Screams. Finishes. He sags, catching his
breath, and glances at the PLASMA TV SCREEN, which has been
playing silently. He grabs the remote, unmutes the set:

              well due to technical flaws, but
              that has yet to be confirmed...

                            DARBY
              "Did not go well." Way to go, Rupert.
              You even fucked up dying.

                            LISA
              You know that guy?

                            DARBY
              Knew. Past tense.

CELL PHONE RINGS, he answers.

              Wayne?

                            VOICE
              Somebody who doesn't want to see
              you in jail. Look out your window.
                     (Darby hesitates)
              Argue later. Do it now.

Darby goes to the window. Headlights in the distance. Lots of
them. He grabs binoculars off the sill.

BINOCULAR POV: VEHICLES

All cop. Racing this way. No lights, no sirens.

DARBY

lowers the binoculars, stunned.

     BLUE   -   9-19-08                                         23.

                  way. I'd get out the back. Now.

     Click -- line dead. Darby frozen for a moment, looking around
     at all the drugs and paraphernalia. He scrambles, tossing on
     his pants, grabbing his shirt. Lisa jumps off the bed --

                                  LISA
                  What?

     She goes to the window, sees cars sweeping from the darkness.

                                LISA
                  Are those fucking cops?

     Darby lunges to a bookcase, grabs a REVOLVER from behind the         *
     books, sails out the bedroom door...

28   INT. DOWNSTAIRS - NIGHT                                             28

                                LISA
                  You ain't leaving me here!

     She catches him halfway across the room, holding him back. He
     smashes the gun into her face repeatedly...

                                  DARBY
                  OFF'A ME!

     ...and knocks her bleeding and crying to the floor. He sails

29   EXT. DARBY'S HOUSE - NIGHT                                          29

     ...and bursts through the screen door, fleeing barefoot across
     the back yard as VEHICLES AND COPS swarm the front of the
     house. A cruiser nails him with a spotlight:

                                COP VOICE
                         (over car speakers)

     Darby, never slowing, swings his arm around, FIRING his
     revolver blindly at all the lights...

30   EXT. FRONT YARD - NIGHT                                             30

     ...whoa, fuck, gunshots! Cops scramble and dive.   Nick has
     just gotten out of Dunnigan's car -- a cruiser's   window takes
     a blind hit nearby, exploding glass. Nick ducks,   total shock,      *
     out of his element. Drawing, Dunnigan throws him   to the ground.    *

                                  DUNNIGAN
                  STAY DOWN!

31   EXT. BAD NEIGHBORHOOD - NIGHT                                     31

     Darby runs like an amped-up rat in a maze, hearing cop cars
     in the night: Engines ROARING, tires SQUEALING...

     Suddenly, the SOUND OF A HELICOPTER above. Darby dashes for
     cover against a garage, lost in shadow. A massively bright
     searchlight sweeps from above, probing...

     Darby crouches, heart hammering, watching the searchlight
     scan over rooftops. His phone RINGS, he answers:

                                VOICE
                  Ditch the gun. Wipe the prints.

                                  DARBY
                  Kiss my ass.

                                VOICE
                  I heard six shots. Revolver? Bring
                  extra ammo?

     Darby glances at the gun, realizing. He bangs his head back
     against the garage wall in frustration -- fuck!

                                VOICE
                  You shot at cops. That's attempted
                  murder if they find the gun on you.
                  You're in deep enough without that.

     Darby frantically wipes the gun with his shirttail, as:

                                VOICE
                  You'll need my help getting out.

                                DARBY
                  What'll it cost me?

                                VOICE
                  We'll discuss terms later. Go south,
                  across 10th. Past the El tracks.
                  Alley behind the clinic.

                                  DARBY
                  What's there?

                                VOICE
                  A cop. Take his ride, he won't give                    *

     BLUE   -   9-19-08                                         25.

     Click -- line dead. Darby breaks cover, heaves the gun into
     somebody's yard, keeps moving...

32   EXT. DARBY'S HOUSE - NIGHT                                       32

     Chaotic with cops and lights. Lisa is dragged out, shrieking
     and bleeding, her face a broken mess. ANGLE TO Nick watching
     it all unfold. He sees Dunnigan approach:

                                DUNNIGAN
                  No way he's getting out of this
                  neighborhood.

33   EXT. ALLEY - NIGHT                                               33

     Darby finds a POLICE CRUISER parked in the moonlight, window
     down. Dark inside. A LOCAL COP is sprawled across the front
     seat...groaning, coming to.

     Darby jumps in, passenger side, wrestles the cop upright. He
     yanks the cop's service revolver, slapping him awake.

                                  DARBY
                  Drive.

     Darby reaches over and keys the engine to life.

                                DARBY
                  Drive, fucker! I'll put your brains
                  on the dash!

                                COP
                         (disoriented)
                  Don't shoot! Don't hurt me, okay?

                                DARBY
                  Depends on you. Go.

     The cop hits the gas. Tense moments go by as they accelerate
     up a dark road. Darby ducks as COP CARS stream past.

34   EXT. DARBY'S HOUSE - NIGHT                                       34

     Dunnigan and Nick tense, hearing a VOICE over the radio:

                                COP VOICE
                         (heavily filtered)
                  ...air unit three...see no sign of

Dunnigan -- angry, at a loss -- doesn't reply. Cops are          *
scrambling in all directions.                                    *

Nick turns, steps TOWARD CAMERA INTO A TIGHT SHOT, gazing off    *
into the darkness. Something very weird just happened here,      *
but he has no idea what. Softly:                                 *

35   EXT. INDUSTRIAL ZONE - NIGHT                                      35

     Tracks and factories, remote and deserted. Far away, the POLICE
     COPTER is still buzzing, searching...

     The police cruiser appears, stops. Darby emerges with gun and      *
     flashlight leveled, motions for the cop to get out. The cop        *
     complies with hands raised, shaking.

                                  DARBY
                  In the ditch.

                                COP
                  ...please...don't kill me...

                                DARBY
                  Knees. Let's go.

     Darby shoves him stumbling into the ditch. The cop sinks to
     his knees and starts to weep.

                                COP
                  I'll never see my wife and little
                  girl again. I'll never see them.

                                DARBY
                  It's fucked up.

     Darby steps closer, draws the hammer back, takes aim for a
     head shot...but his PHONE RINGS. He pulls it fast.

                                DARBY
                  This my guardian angel?
                         (beat)
                  Hello?

     On his knees in the muck, the cop's quiet weeping becomes
     soft laughter. He brings up a cell phone, speaks into it:

                                COP
                  I see you got out okay.

     Darby draws back, confused, gun still aimed. The cop snaps
     his cell phone shut, rises to face him.

                                COP
                  You know why I'll never see my wife
                  and daughter again?

     He takes his hat off, peels his moustache away. Darby pins
     him with the flashlight, finally and fully revealing:

                                BENSON CLYDE
                  You took them from me.

     Recognition floods Darby. He pulls the trigger, and:

       BLUE      -   9-19-08                                    27.

       Nothing. Just a click, Darby freezing, a hiss of pain. Not
       comprehending.                                                   *

       Clyde reaches for the gun, pries open Darby's fingers, pulls
       it from his grasp... revealing the TINY NEEDLES that sprang
       from the pistol's grip into Darby's palm.

       Darby stares at his perforated palm. His knees give out and
       Clyde catches him, eases him to the ground.                      *

36     OMITTED                                                        36*

39     INT. FARM SHED - NIGHT                                         39*

       ANGLE: A head encased in a hood. The hood is pulled off,
       revealing Darby -- eyes wide, lying on a rough table. Benson
       Clyde leans over him, checks his pupils.

                                      CLYDE
                       Can't speak?

       He displays the prop gun rigged with the needles.

                                     CLYDE
                       Tetrototoxin. Fascinating stuff. It
                       paralyzes you, but leaves all other
                       neurological functions intact.

WHITE   -   9-7-8                                          28.

He sets the gun down, starts rooting through some instruments
that Darby can't see (though he's straining to).

                           CLYDE
             That means you can't move. Or talk.
             But you can see. Hear. Feel.
                    (busying himself)
             That last one's important. Feel.
             You can feel everything.
                    (glances at bottled drugs)
             Got some other items here. Drugs to
             revive you in case you pass out.
             Stuff like that.

Darby almost manages to speak, thrashing weakly. Clyde leans
over, checks his pupils again.

                           CLYDE
             Wearing off a little. No worries.

He tucks a padded block under Darby's head like a pillow,
raising his head so he can see better. Clyde moves down the
table, tightens straps holding Darby down. But the worst part:

TOURNIQUETS are tied on Darby's arms and legs at various
points. Darby sees them and starts hyperventilating.

                           CLYDE
             Oh. These. Don't want you bleeding
             out. This will take a while.

Clyde puts on a thick coat, like a meat-packer's. He returns,
sorting implements, Darby trying to see. Clyde obliges him,
holding things up:

                             CLYDE
                      (pliers)
             Teeth.
                      (hacksaw)
             Balls.
                    (bolt cutter)
             Fingers. Maybe toes.
                    (scalpel)
             Eyelids. In case you insist on
             shutting your eyes.

Darby's screaming -- but with the tetrototoxin in his system,
all that's coming out is air, like a slow leak.

Clyde picks up an object, unfolds it -- a full-body plastic
coat. He puts it on over his other coat, as:

                           CLYDE
             Earlier on the phone? I said I'd
             get you out? You asked me what it
             would cost? Well.

     BLUE   -   9-19-08                                       29.

     He finishes buttoning up, crosses back to the table, raises a
     new object into view: a CIRCULAR POWER SAW.                        *

                                 CLYDE
                  We'll start with an arm and a leg.
                  Go from there.

     Pause. The reality of what he's about to do washing over him:     *

                                CLYDE
                  I've been waiting to say that line                    *
                  for years. But it wasn't very funny,
                  was it? No. Played much better in
                  my head. Maybe it's my delivery.

     He puts a construction-site face protector atop his head, the
     kind with a full plastic face shield that can be flipped down.    *

     He turns and undoes the slipknot of a laundry cord stretching     *
     up to the ceiling. He feeds the cord and a full-length mirror     *
     tilts down horizontally above the table. Darby finds himself      *
     staring straight up into it -- he'll see everything.              *

     ANGLE FROM BEHIND VIDEO CAMERA

     The CAMERA'S LCD SCREEN looms large in our shot. The LCD is
     dark, the camera inactive. It's mounted high on a tripod,
     aimed down at the table. Clyde approaches b.g., pauses.

                                CLYDE
                  Gosh. My heart's beating. You?                        *

     He flips his visor down -- dark, no face visible. He reaches
     up, turns the camera on. The LCD screen activates.

     ANGLE CLOSES IN until all we see is:

     THE LCD IMAGE. Grainy in low light. Clyde, now faceless behind
     the visor, crosses to the squirming figure on the table. We
     hear the CIRCULAR SAW BUILD TO A HIGH SHRIEK...

                                              FADE TO BLACK

     ...and the SHRIEKING SAW FADES...

40   HOLD IN BLACK.                                                   40

     THE BLACKNESS OPENS UP -- we're in a cop car's trunk looking
     up as the lid is opened. A FIGURE in a meat-packing coat looms
     over us, faceless and scary behind a dark face protector.

     ANGLE INTO TRUNK                                                   *

     reveals OFFICER HILTS hand-cuffed and duct-taped. He's spent      *
     the night in here. He recoils, terrified and blinded by glare.    *

     BLUE   -   9-19-08                                      29A.

     The figure opens a wicked-sharp butterfly knife, CLICK-CLACKS
     it open. He leans down, slits the tape binding Hilts' arms,
     drops the keys in the cop's hands.

41   EXT. COUNTRY DIRT ROAD - DAWN                                   41

     The police cruiser sits on a dirt road, a FEMALE DISPATCHER'S
     VOICE issuing softly and incessantly from the radio:

     BLUE   -   9-19-08                                          30.

                                FEMALE VOICE
                  ...unit twenty one, come in...unit
                  twenty one, please respond...report
                  your location...

     The mysterious figure strides from the police cruiser to a
     MIDNIGHT BLUE 1965 LINCOLN CONTINENTAL in superb condition,
     shrugging off his thick coat. He gets in, hits the gas.

     Hilts struggles to uncuff himself in the cruiser's trunk,          *
     arms and legs cramping, as:                                        *

     The Lincoln becomes a CLOUD OF DUST receding in the distance...    *

42   INT. NICK'S KITCHEN - MORNING                                     42*

     Cleaning up the aftermath of the party: Nick up on a step-
     stool taking down the birthday banner; Kell in her robe feeding
     the dishwasher; Emma zooming in and out shuttling paper plates
     and plastic cups into a big trash bag...

                                EMMA
                  ...and while we were singing karaoke,
                  Ashley was all dancing around and
                  jumping up and down and suddenly
                  she gets this look on her face...

                                KELL
                  I saw it coming.

                                EMMA
                  ...and suddenly she just went barf.
                  Total puke moment. And we were all
                  like, ewwww gross! It was so funny...

     She's out of the kitchen to grab more stuff. Kell starts
     preparing a bowl of cereal for Emma.

                                KELL
                  Funny for her. I cleaned it up.

                                NICK
                  I had my "ewwww gross" moment last
                  night too.

                                KELL
                  Hey. I had a house full of shrieking
                  ten year-old girls.

                                NICK
                  Hey. I saw a guy's veins dissolve.

                                 KELL
                  Honey. It's not a competition.
                         (off his look)
                  Okay, you win.

     BLUE   -   9-19-08                                        31.

     Emma re-enters, dumping more trash:

                                EMMA
                  ...so Tara says that's what you get
                  for eating too much cake and that
                  almost made Ashley puke again...

     The DOORBELL RINGS. Kell glances out the window.

                                KELL
                  Delivery.

                                EMMA
                         (grabs her cereal)
                  I'll get it!

     She runs out. Nick comes off the step-stool, gratefully accepts
     a cup of coffee from Kell. He suddenly freezes, notices:

     The kitchen TV is playing CNN: a top-of-the-hour story on the
     Rupert Ames execution and foul-up.

                                NICK
                  Oh, shit. We've gone national.

43   INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY                                            43

     At the front door, a MESSENGER hands Emma a GIFT BASKET
     trailing mylar balloons with "Happy Birthday Emma" on them.

                                EMMA
                  Thank you!

     She closes the door, turns toward us, finds a CARDBOARD
     ENVELOPE on the basket -- a card? She opens it, finds:

     Not a card. An unlabeled DVD.

44   EXT. COUNTRY DIRT ROAD - DAY                                      44

     LOCAL SHERIFFS (not city cops) are spreading out across the        *
     fields, beating the grass, looking for clues...

     ANGLE TO Officer Hilts, blanket-draped and still rattled by
     his night-long ordeal, being interviewed by a SERGEANT:

                                SERGEANT

                  let you out of the trunk this
                  morning?

                                HILTS
                  I never saw a face...either time...he
                  wore a thing, a face shield...

     Suddenly, we hear a DISTANT VOICE shouting in panic:

     BLUE   -   9-19-08                                          32.

                                VOICE
                  Sergeant! Sergeant!

     Everybody's gaze snaps up, tense. Across the fields, a YOUNG
     COP is stumbling away from a distant farm shed, pointing:          *

                                YOUNG COP
                  Come quick! You gotta see this!

45   INT. NICK'S KITCHEN - DAY                                         45

     Nick at the table with Kell, riveted to CNN: STATE OFFICIALS,
     including Iger, are being grilled in a media frenzy. Cantrell
     was right, it's a shitstorm of scrutiny...

46   INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY                                            46

     Emma, munching her bowl of breakfast cereal, slots the DVD in
     the player. She backs up, hits play with the remote.

     An IMAGE appears on screen, grainy. Emma looks perplexed.
     It's not a normal DVD -- more like a bad home movie:

     A figure in a plastic coat and face shield turns from the
     camera to a table, where another man is strapped down.

     The first man raises a circular saw. The man on the table is
     thrashing weakly, trying to move. Emma still has no idea what
     she's looking at. Suddenly:

     The man with the saw makes a quick sweep across the table,
     across the other man's leg at the shin. The move was so fast
     and casual that it's taking a moment to sink in:

     Emma stands frozen, clutching her cereal bowl.

                                 EMMA
                  Daddy?

     B.G., we see Nick lean back in his chair, reacting to her
     tone of voice...and by what sounds like a shrieking saw.

     On screen, the man with the saw picks up the severed limb and
     shows it to the victim. It's been lopped off below the knee.

     Emma drops her bowl -- it shatters at her feet. Nick and Kell
     enter behind her, confused, not sure what they're seeing...

     On screen, the man with the saw lops off the victim's forearm.

                                 KELL
                  Oh my God!

     Emma turns, throws herself into her parents' arms. They drop
     to their knees, shielding their sobbing daughter. PUSH IN ON
     them staring at the shrieking saw...

     BLUE   -   9-19-08                                          33.

                                KELL
                  What the hell is this? Jesus Christ,
                  Nick! Turn it off! Turn it off!
                         (comforting Emma)
                  It's okay, baby, I'm here...

     Nick lunges to turn off the TV as:

     FROM THIS POINT ONWARD, WE PLAY THE SEQUENCE AS MONTAGE:

47   INT. FARM SHED - DAY                                              47*

     The door is swung open in a blaze of sunlight. The local cops
     enter with pistols drawn and shotguns leveled. Faces go stark
     with horror as their eyes adjust.

                                SERGEANT
                  Oh my Lord.

48   INT. A RENOVATED FARMHOUSE SOMEWHERE - DAY                        48*

     A RECORD is pulled from a sleeve. An old-school vinyl LP.

49   INT. FARM SHED - DAY                                              49*

     Cops easing in. ANGLE SWINGS QUEASILY AROUND as they enter,
     WIDENING to reveal a scene of nightmare intensity: Blood
     everywhere. Streaks. Spatters. And body parts. Strewn and
     discarded. Intestines nailed to the rafters overhead.

50   INT. FARMHOUSE - DAY                                              50

     A RECORD PLAYER NEEDLE DROPS, hits the groove with a HISS of
     vinyl. MUSIC STARTS TO PLAY LOUDLY, BOOMING through the space.     *

     FOCUS REMAINS WITH the spinning record. An OUT-OF-FOCUS FIGURE
     in a rolling chair pushes away from the record player and
     sails across the room toward a brightly-lit work table...

51   INT. FARM SHED - DAY (SONG CONTINUES)                             51*

     Cops are covering their mouths with handkerchiefs, gagging.
     The stench is incredible. Flies are buzzing and swarming. One
     cop turns away and doubles over, trying not to puke.

     The Sergeant moves cautiously forward, finds: A HEAD. On the
     wooden dissection table. Clarence Darby, not that you'd
     recognize him. His eyes are gone. His lips are missing. His
     teeth...well, most of them are scattered about.

52   INT. FARMHOUSE - DAY (SONG CONTINUES)                             52

     A MINIATURE CIVIL WAR SOLDIER is held in extreme magnification
     before us under a tabletop magnifier, the tip of a paintbrush
     delicately evoking stunning detail...

     BLUE   -   9-19-08                                          34.

53   INT. NICK'S HOUSE - DAY (SONG CONTINUES)                          53

     Emma is still sobbing into her mother's arms as Nick takes
     the frame f.g., shouting into the phone:

                                NICK
                  My daughter is traumatized! She's                      *
                  only ten! It's a goddamn snuff film!                   *
                  In my home!                                            *

54   INT. DETECTIVE'S BULLPEN - DAY (SONG CONTINUES)                   54

                                GARZA
                         (motioning O.S.)
                  Price got a video of it happening
                  delivered to his house...

     Dunnigan enters frame f.g., snatches up his extension. He
     listens for a few beats, trying to get a word in:

                                DUNNIGAN
                  Yeah, we know. Nick, we know. The
                  body's been found. The pieces,
                  anyway. Call just came in.
                         (beat)
                  In some old shed on a farm outside                     *
                  the city. About a hundred and fifty
                  acre piece of property.

55   INT. NICK'S HOUSE - DAY (SONG CONTINUES)                          55

                                NICK
                  Belonging to who?

56   INT. FARMHOUSE - DAY (SONG CONTINUES)                             56

     A GIANT EYEBALL stares at us, unnaturally magnified by a
     tabletop magnifier. The lens is swept aside, revealing:

     Benson Clyde. In addition to the tabletop magnifier, he's
     wearing MAGNIFYING LENSES on his head. He examines the figurine
     with his naked eye, then flips the glasses down to continue...

57   EXT. COUNTRY HIGHWAY - DAY (SONG CONTINUES)                       57

     VEHICLES race along two-lane blacktop: CRUISERS, UNMARKED
     CARS, TACTICAL VANS. A POLICE HELICOPTER skims along just
     above them at scary-low altitude...

     The cars veer off pavement and up a dirt road, kicking up an
     awesome trail of dust as the copter sweeps wide, pacing...

58   INT. CARS - DAY (SONG CONTINUES)                                  58

     Tense faces: Dunnigan, Garza, Nick.

     WHITE   -   9-7-8                                           35.

59   INT. FARMHOUSE - DAY (SONG CONTINUES)                             59

     Clyde pauses, hearing a RUMBLE under the music. Glances up as
     the rumble passes overhead -- a helicopter? He clicks on a
     tiny fan, holds the figurine under it, giving it a final dry.

60   EXT. FARMHOUSE - DAY (SONG CONTINUES)                             60

     A shitstorm descends: vehicles swerving in, COPS jumping out,
     machine gun-toting SWAT TACTICAL TROOPS pouring from vans...

61   INT. FARMHOUSE - DAY (SONG CONTINUES)                             61

     Clyde, still holding the figurine under the whirring fan,
     leans to one side in his chair, glancing out the window.

     He glimpses scurrying figures behind cars, cops darting and
     surrounding the house, motioning with hand signals...

     He holds up the figurine for a final look. Satisfied with it,
     he places it onto:

     A CHESSBOARD -- the last piece. All the others are also hand-
     painted, gorgeous. Real craftsmanship here.

     He stands. Calmly moves to the middle of the room. Kicks off
     his shoes. Peels off his shirt and undershirt. Even takes off
     his pants. There will be no confusion about hidden weapons.

     He positions himself, very precise and purposeful. Lifts his
     hands high above his head. Presenting himself. Waiting.

     Then, bam: doors EXPLODE in and windows SHATTER as the SWAT
     tactical troops storm the room, bad-asses in black, machine
     guns aimed, encircling him, everybody shouting:

                                SWAT TROOPS
                  DO NOT MOVE--FREEZE MOTHERFUCKER--
                  DON'T EVEN TWITCH--WE WILL FIRE
                  UPON YOU--LET'S SEE THOSE HANDS--

     Clyde is the calm eye of a pissed-off storm of highly
     professional cops with itchy trigger fingers. He remains
     serene, looking around at them, hands raised high...

                                SWAT CAPTAIN
                  ON THE FLOOR! FACE DOWN! DO IT NOW!

     He compliantly goes to his knees, then prone, offers his hands
     behind his back. They move in, cuff him, as troops spread
     throughout the house yelling "Clear!"

62   EXT. FARMHOUSE - DAY                                              62

     Nick, wearing his kevlar, follows Dunnigan and Garza. Nick
     glances over and sees a perfect 1965 midnight-blue Lincoln
     Continental in the carport...

     BLUE   -   9-19-08                                          36.

63   INT. FARMHOUSE - DAY                                              63

     Clyde is pulled to his feet just as Nick enters. UNIFORMS
     spread out, securing the house. Dunnigan faces Clyde...

                                DUNNIGAN
                  Benson Clyde. You have the right to
                  remain silent...

     ...as the full Miranda is read, Nick and Clyde have their
     eyes locked throughout -- this moment is all about them...

                                DUNNIGAN
                  ...understand your rights as I have
                  explained them?

                                CLYDE
                  Yes.

     Clyde is hustled outside, leaving Nick with Dunnigan and Garza
     in the farmhouse -- it's renovated, clean, very loft-like.

     Nick drifts to the table, sees the chess board, can't help
     admiring the pieces. Then his eyes go to a floor-to-ceiling
     bookcase. He's stunned to realize: they're all law books.

                                GARZA (O.S.)
                  Check this shit out.

     Nick turns, moves to Garza's side. Dunnigan joins them. All
     three staring at a wall. ANGLE SHIFTS around to reveal:

     The long-ago PHOTO (clipped from a newspaper) of Nick and
     Clarence Darby shaking hands on the courthouse steps.

     ANGLE WIDENS to reveal:

     Photo after photo. The crime scene photos...photos of Clyde
     and his family in happier times...photos clipped from magazines
     and newspapers about the murder and trial...all very neatly
     and precisely arrayed. The entire wall covered with them.

     THE MUSIC KEEPS BOOMING from the record player. Dunnigan turns     *
     TIGHT TO CAMERA and yells:

                                DUNNIGAN
                  CAN SOMEBODY TURN THAT FUCKING MUSIC
                  OFF, PLEASE?

64   INT. POLICE INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY                              64

     Clyde sits alone and isolated in a small room. WIDEN to reveal
     Sarah at the observation glass. She turns as Nick steps up.

                                SARAH
                  He says he'll only talk to you.

WHITE   -    9-7-8                                         37.

Nick and Dunnigan prepare to go in. Dunnigan takes off his
gun and holster, lays them on a table, as Garza activates the
VIDEO. Cantrell finds a chair by feel, sits down, as:

INNER ROOM

Nick and Dunnigan enter. Dunnigan melts into a corner to
observe as Nick sits across the table from Clyde.

                            CLYDE
              Counselor.

                            NICK
              Mr. Clyde.

                            CLYDE
              Why so formal? We go way back. Call
              me Benson. Or Ben.

Nick sits across the table from Clyde, settles in.

                            NICK
              Well. I'm here. So?

                            CLYDE
              So. Maybe you can explain what this
              is all about.

Nick almost laughs -- not what he expected to hear.

                            NICK
              I think that's obvious.

Clyde spreads his hands questioningly -- not really.

                            DUNNIGAN
              You murdered two people. Rupert
              Ames and Clarence Darby.

                            CLYDE
                     (shifts his gaze)
              Detective...?

                            DUNNIGAN
              Dunnigan.

                            CLYDE
              Dunnigan. I thought I'd made it
              clear I would only speak to the
              gentleman across the table from me.

Dunnigan glowers at him, looks to Nick.

                            NICK
              You murdered two people. Rupert
              Ames and Clarence Darby.

BLUE   -     9-19-08                                  38.

                             CLYDE
               Darby? I knew about Ames, of course.
               I've been following the news about
               his horribly botched execution. But
               Darby too? Quite a coincidence.

                             DUNNIGAN
               Cut the shit. We know you did it.
               Save everybody a lot of time and
               trouble and just confess.

                             CLYDE
               Are you going to continue to insist
               on being part of this conversation?

                             DUNNIGAN
               Yes.

                             CLYDE
                      (beat, gives in)
               Fine. Far be it from me to be rude.

                             NICK
               Clarence Darby was found on your
               property. Old abandoned shed?                *

                             CLYDE
               I didn't know I had one. It's 150
               acres, uncultivated. The other day
               I found a creek I never knew I had.
               Hunters trespass all the time. You
               going to try to pin the dead deer
               on me too?

OBSERVATION AREA

                             SARAH
               I don't believe this guy.

                             CANTRELL
               That man is frosty.

INNER ROOM                                                  *

                             CLYDE
               It occurs to me that an even
               moderately clever person could try
               to frame me for the murder simply
               by killing him on my property. One
               of Darby's drug rivals? That's an
               unsavory world.
                      (off Nick's stare)
               A jury would have to weigh that
               possibility. What else you got?

BLUE   -   9-19-08                                       39.

                           NICK
                    (temper flaring)
             How about video of you dismembering
             Darby while he was still alive?

                           CLYDE
             That's odd. See, if I were to do
             such a thing, I'd probably wear
             something so I couldn't be
             identified. Some kind of mask maybe.
             But you say it's actually me on the
             video? Did the camera capture my
             good side?                                          *

Nick snaps, lunges across the table, grabs Clyde.

                           NICK
             You sick fuck, you sent it to my
             house! My daughter saw that video!
             It fucking traumatized her! She
             couldn't stop sobbing!

Dunnigan moves in fast, trying to pull Nick off (but failing):

                           DUNNIGAN
             Whoa-whoa, Nick, ease off!

                           CLYDE
             No trouble here, Detective, we're
             fine. Thank you, though.

Dunnigan backs off. Clyde turns back to Nick, who's still got
him in his grasp, their faces close.

                           CLYDE
             Your daughter is, what, ten now?
             That's a wonderful age. My daughter
             was always so busy at that age, so
             interested, so into everything.
             Jumping around. I called her "Bean,"
             she jumped around so much.

Nick is easing off by inches, subtly and ineffably weirded-
out, unable to break Clyde's gaze. Softly:

                           CLYDE
             I am sorry, Nick, that your daughter
             experienced that. You're right.
             That video should not have arrived
             that way. The person who sent it
             should have thought twice.

Dunnigan moves in again, gently but firmly pulls Nick away.

                             DUNNIGAN
             Okay, enough.

WHITE   -   9-7-8                                   40.

                           CLYDE
             Unless there's hard evidence tying
             me to these crimes -- forensic or
             otherwise -- why am I here? Why are
             we having this conversation?

                           NICK
             We know you did it.

                            CLYDE
             It's not about what you know. It's
             about what you can prove in court.
                    (off Nick's look)
             Your words. Like when you called it
             a justice system. You know the thing
             about a system, Nick? Any system
             can be played.

                           NICK
             You think you can play us? You gonna
             take me on?

                           CLYDE
             Clarence Darby did. And I'm much
             smarter than he was. Or you.

Nick advances, furious, held back by Dunnigan:

                           NICK
             I'm gonna bury you, fucker!

                           CLYDE
                    (lunges to his feet)
             That's it, that's what I want! That
             fire in the belly! That's what I
             wanted ten years ago! Do it, Nick!
             Bury me!

                           DUNNIGAN
                    (shouting at Clyde)
             Sit down! Sit the fuck down!

Clyde does, settles in, speaking calmly:

                           CLYDE
             Or. Set me free.

                           NICK
             What?

                           CLYDE
             Did I stutter? Make your case. Or.
             Shake my hand on the courthouse
             steps and send me on my way.
                    (off Nick's look)
             I'll even make it easy on you. I
             will confess, how's that?

     BLUE   -   9-19-08                                  41.

                                NICK
                  You're gonna confess.

                                CLYDE
                  Let's start tomorrow after a good
                  night's sleep. We'll all be fresh
                  and rested.

65   EXT. CITY HALL COURTYARD - DAY                            65

     Nick paces agitated, with the group:                        *

                                SARAH                            *
                  Ten years he's been planning this?             *
                  Patient people make me nervous.
                  This? This freaks me out.                      *

                                DUNNIGAN                         *
                  Is he serious about confessing?                *
                  What's his deal, is he crazy?

                                NICK
                  Confession or not, we're gonna nail
                  him on two counts of first-degree.

                                CANTRELL
                  Agreed, but softly. Nothing hard-
                  ass, no grand-standing. Kid gloves.

                                NICK
                  Kid gloves? He's a psycho with a
                  power saw.

                                 CANTRELL
                  Depending on who's writing the
                  headline, he's a grieving husband
                  and father who got revenge on the
                  men who murdered his wife and child.
                         (off Nick's look)
                  Public sympathy is to be respected
                  and feared. This could blow up in
                  our faces if we're not careful. We
                  can't look like we're pissed off or
                  have an ax to grind.
                         (stops)
                  Are we pissed off? Do we have an ax
                  to grind?

                                NICK
                  No.

     BLUE   -   9-19-08                                          42.

                                CANTRELL
                  Then stop acting like it.

     Beat. Nick takes a deep breath.

                                NICK
                  Okay. He got under my skin a little.
                  That's done.

66   EXT. CITY HALL - DAY                                              66

     STEADICAM TWO SILHOUETTES: We're following Nick and Sarah
     through one of the pedestrian tunnels to the street:

                                NICK
                  ...background check's gotta be
                  thorough, I want to know everything
                  there is to know about this son of
                  a bitch. Get all the ADAs on it,
                  tell 'em I better not see them
                  sitting around on their asses or
                  texting their pals...

                                SARAH
                  How about outside help? That P.I.
                  who helped us on the Jacovitz case?

                                NICK
                  Yeah, he was good. And Hanson's                        *
                  always reliable. But try to limit
                  their hours, okay?

     We find a MERCEDES at the curb -- Kell at the wheel, Emma in
     back. Nick gets in. Sarah leans down, happy to see them. Emma's
     face lights up -- the little girl obviously adores her.

                                KELL
                  Well, hello there beauty!

                                SARAH
                  Hey Kell! Hey Emma, how's my dynamo?

                                EMMA
                  Hi, Sarah!

                                KELL
                  We haven't seen you in so long it's
                  ridiculous. When are you gonna come
                  by for a visit?

                                SARAH
                  Who needs a life, right? Talk to
                  your husband, maybe he'll give us a
                  day off one of these years.

                                KELL
                  Soon, huh? Seriously, we miss you.

     BLUE   -   9-19-08                                       43.

     Sarah blows Emma a big extravagant kiss. Emma returns it,
     waves as they pull away. Nick and Kell glance back, happy to
     see their daughter acting a bit more like her old self...

67   INT. NICK'S HOUSE - NIGHT                                       67

     Late. Nick, in t-shirt and pajama bottoms, comes up a dark
     hallway with a file in his hand, rubbing his eyes. He comes
     to his daughter's bedroom door, quietly turns the knob...

     EMMA'S BEDROOM

     ...and finds the bed empty. Sheets thrown back.

     Nick stands for a moment, every irrational fear he's ever had
     washing over him. CAMERA FOLLOWS HIM fast down the hallway...

     ...into the master bedroom, where he finds Emma sleeping with
     Kell. He stands for a moment, heart hammering. Softly:

                                   NICK
                  Fuck.

     Kell stirs, sees him, puts a finger to her lips. In whispers:

                                NICK
                  I saw her bed empty. Scared the
                  shit out of me. Don't know why.

                                KELL
                  She had a bad dream. She wanted to
                  sleep with us tonight.

                                  NICK
                           (feels his heart race)
                  Jesus.

                                   EMMA
                         (stirs)
                  Daddy...?

     He climbs onto the bed, cuddles up, Emma between them.

                                EMMA
                  I had a nightmare. That man.                         *

                                NICK
                  I know. Shhh. We're all good. You're
                  safe. Nobody's gonna hurt you.

                                KELL
                  Especially not that man. Daddy's
                  gonna put him in jail forever. That's
                  what daddy does. He makes sure the
                  bad people stay locked away.

     Nick lays there, listening...

     BLUE      -   9-19-08                                    44.

69   INT. "THE DOME" - DAY                                            69*

     A huge domed chamber. In the center of the floor stands a
     smaller free-standing domed cage, like a bizarre birdcage.

     Inside the birdcage: Nick and Garza wait. Garza mans a camera.

     Outside the birdcage: Observers. Some (Cantrell and Sarah)
     occupy floor-level, where the video monitors are. Others (Iger
     and Dunnigan) are on a catwalk above that encircles the room.

     A door opens and Clyde is brought into the birdcage. He gazes
     around, checking his surroundings.

                                   CLYDE
                     I admit I expected something more
                     modern. That jail downtown?                        *

                                   NICK
                     Filled to capacity. It has been for
                     years. They had to re-open this for
                     the overflow. Part of it anyway.                   *

                                    GARZA
                     Welcome to the county jail annex.                  *
                     All new inmates come here. It was                  *
                     in the papers.

                                   CLYDE
                     Right. Prison crowding. It's a
                     problem.

     He sits. Nick joins him, pulls out a legal pad.

                                   NICK
                     For the record: You've waived legal
                     counsel. You've offered to confess
                     to the murders of Clarence Darby
                     and Rupert Ames. Yes?

                                   CLYDE
                     We'll get to that. First, what I'd
                     really like to talk about is the
                     cot in my cell. It's lumpy.
                            (off Nick's stare)
                     Hardly any padding? Steel springs?
                     Very uncomfortable?

BLUE   -   9-19-08                                       45.

                           NICK
             I know what lumpy means. Sorry to
             hear it. But we're not here to talk
             about prison conditions, we're here
             to talk about things you've done.

                           CLYDE
             Start with things I haven't done.
             Like get any sleep last night.
                    (beat, leans forward)
             I said let's begin today fresh and                *
             rested. You recall my words?                      *

                           NICK                                *
             What do you want from me?

                           CLYDE
             A bed in my cell.

                           NICK
             A bed. In your cell.

                           CLYDE
             Yes, please. One of those Sleep-
             Matic adjustables. Those are best.                *

                           NICK
             You want the variable temperature
             control too?

                           CLYDE
             That would be nice.

Beat. Nick tosses his legal pad on the table, swivels around
in his chair to the observers up on the catwalk, spreads his
arms in a "help me" gesture.

                           NICK

                  going to let a bed prevent this
                  confession from taking place.

                                NICK
                  You looking to deal? All right,
                  how's this? How about I don't kick
                  your fucking teeth down your throat?

     Clyde is mildly taken aback. The cops tense up.

                                   CANTRELL
                  Nick.

                                NICK
                  Sorry, Jonas. Okay, kid gloves.
                         (to Clyde)
                  My daughter slept in our bed last
                  night. She hasn't done that since
                  she was six. You gave her nightmares.
                  So excuse me if I don't feel like
                  cutting any little deals today.

                                CLYDE
                  My daughter can't have nightmares,
                  because she died with Clarence                  *
                  Darby's breath in her face. You                 *
                  gave him a reduced sentence and his             *
                  freedom. All I want is a good night's
                  sleep.

     Cantrell weighs it, decides:

                  We're talking a high-profile double

71   INT. CELLBLOCK - CLYDE'S CELL - DAY                             71

     Clyde watches as MAINTENANCE MEN remove the unbolted cot from
     the cell and his Sleep-Matic is rolled in.

     CONVICTS watch, dumbfounded. Clyde's cellmate, a towering
     Aryan Brother named DWIGHT DIXON, stands quietly amazed...

                                CLYDE (V.O.)

     Back in the birdcage:

                                CLYDE
                  I hacked the Fedex database, diverted
                  the package to me, made the switch,
                  sent the package on. It's automated
                  tracking numbers moving millions of
                  packages daily. Nobody's questioning
                  who receives what, or why.

                  And the prison phones?

                                CLYDE
                  Get a phone company uniform, hack
                  the prison database, schedule an
                  official visit. They'll wave you
                  through the gate, like they did me.
                  It's simple if you know how things
                  work.
                         (off Nick's look)
                  It's a system. You learn how it
                  works. You play it. Any system.

                  I saw him die. That stuff burned
                  his veins. He suffered terribly.

                                CLYDE
                  Score.

     Nick flips to a new page on his pad.

                                NICK
                  Let's move on to Clarence Darby.

                  it. It's like air in my lungs. So
                  the thing about Clarence Darby is,
                  I want my record collection and
                  player brought to me. The vinyl
                  discs as well as CDs.

     Reactions all around the room. Iger leans forward:

                                IGER
                  Vinyl records and CDs can be broken
                  into shards. They make excellent
                  weapons. My answer to that one, Mr.
                  Clyde, is not no, but hell no.                       *

     Clyde absorbs that, looks to Nick, as:

                                NICK
                  It's a legitimate concern.

                                CLYDE
                         (beat, calls to Iger)
                  How about my ipod and speaker dock?

73   INT. CELLBLOCK - CLYDE'S CELL - DAY                              73

     AN IPOD AND SPEAKER DOCK now occupy a small plywood shelf
     attached to the railing outside Clyde's cell. A GUARD plugs
     it in via a long orange extension cord.

     ANGLE WIDENS to Iger, who turns to the bars and hands a remote
     control through to Clyde. Dixon's watching balefully, as is
     every inmate on the cellblock.

     WHITE   -   9-7-8                                        49.

                                IGER
                  The player stays out here. You hand
                  the remote to the on-duty guard
                  every night at lights out. Those
                  terms aren't negotiable.

                                CLYDE
                  I appreciate your compromise.

     Iger draws close to the bars. Quietly:

                                IGER
                  You looking to get your ass kicked?
                         (off Clyde's look)
                  By every inmate on this cellblock.
                  You keep this up, they'll take it
                  out on you. Harshly.

     Clyde glances back to Dwight. Dwight's watching, glowering,
     agreement in his silence. Clyde turns back to Iger.

                                IGER
                  Just trying to keep you alive in
                  here. That's all.

     Iger walks away. Clyde aims the remote. MUSIC STARTS PLAYING.
     He leans his head on the bars, listening, blissed. Cons all
     over the cellblock are staring daggers at him.

                                CLYDE (O.S.)
                         (pre-lap)
                  I took his fingers with a bolt
                  cutter. His toes with a pair of tin
                  snips. His balls with a hacksaw...

74   INT. "THE DOME" - DAY                                           74

                                CLYDE
                  ...his penis with a box cutter. His
                  skin with a filet knife. His teeth
                  with pliers. His eyes...for those I
                  used my fingers.
                         (looks to Nick)
                  Check the video I made. All that
                  will match up. I kept him alive for
                  an hour, give or take. Time it.

     Nick trades looks with the others in the room -- everybody
     have what they need? People nod. Nicks closes his pad.

                                CLYDE
                  What now?

                                NICK

BLUE   -   9-19-08                                       50.

Nick rises, putting things in his briefcase. People get ready
to leave -- but Clyde motions Garza to keep it rolling.

                           CLYDE
             How about a signing bonus? The small
             concessions you've made so far have
             kept my cooperation flowing...why
             not give me a reward for signing?

                           NICK
             You don't want to sign, don't sign.
             We've got you on videotape, we'll
             go to trial. In ten years, when
             your appeals are exhausted, I'll
             attend your execution. I'll make
             sure nobody tampers with the drugs.

                           CLYDE
             Don't be such a hard-ass, Nick. I
             don't want much. Just a good meal.
                    (directed at Iger)
             The food here? Sucks. No offense.

Dunnigan glances at Nick and stifles a smile, enjoying where
this is going in spite of himself:

                           DUNNIGAN
             What do you have in mind?

                           CLYDE
             There's a place in town on Halston.
             La Traviata. Ever been?                            *

                           DUNNIGAN
             It's a little above my pay grade.

                           CLYDE
             You know it, don't you, Nick?                      *

             would like my meal delivered to my

             silverware, crisp linens...

                           NICK
             Not gonna happen.

                           CLYDE
             Why not?

BLUE   -   9-19-08                                          51.

                           NICK
             Because I have no interest in making
             it happen. And you have nothing
             left to bargain with.

                           CLYDE
             C'mon, Nick. We've just started
             bargaining. You haven't even heard
             what I'm offering yet.

This makes people pause. Something in the tone of his voice.

                           CLYDE
             Miss Lowell? Is your laptop still
             on? Would you please do a search?

She flips the laptop opens, dread mounting even though she's
not sure why, poises her fingers over the keys.

                           CLYDE
             William...Baxter...Reynolds.

Cantrell's quietly stunned as the name sinks in. Pin-drop
silence now. Laptop keys CLACKING SOFTLY. People frozen.

                           DUNNIGAN
             Who's William Reynolds?

                           CANTRELL
             Clarence Darby's defense attorney.
             He brokered the testimony deal with
             us ten years ago. He's been missing

disappearance.                                                    *

                           CLYDE
             Detectives Dunnigan and Garza will
             like this offer, Nick. It'll clear
             one of their department's missing-
             persons files. And it'll solve them
             their third homicide this week.

                             NICK
             Tell me.

             How do you think I located Clarence
             Darby after he got out of jail and
             legally changed his name? Reynolds
             told me -- though it took some                       *
             convincing.                                          *

     A HELICOPTER THROTTLES UP, everything moving fast: an FBI
     FIELD TEAM, led by AGENT SAM DAVIES, emerges from a staircase
     door onto the roof, where they are met by Nick and Dunnigan.
     Davies dons his kevlar vest on the move toward the waiting

     They get to the helicopter, feds loading in as Nick pulls a
     business card, hands it to Davies.

                                NICK

     Davies gets in, signals the PILOT. The copter takes to the
     air, buffeting Nick and Dunnigan...

     Nick enters, moves through the bullpen. ADAs (assistant
     district attorneys) are working and grimly focused. Nick pokes
     his head into Sarah's office. She looks up.

                                NICK

     Nick gazing out the window, Cantrell seated with his dog,
     Sarah reading the report thus far:

     ...because here comes the rolling La Traviata cart -- gleaming
     domes keeping food warm, silver utensils, crisp linens, a
     ROSE in a bud vase. A red-jacketed LA TRAVIATA WAITER is
     pushing the cart, accompanied by GUARDS and Warden Iger.

     More cons appear at their bars, faces peering, an angry grumble
     growing in the cellblock as the cart goes by. The waiter's
     looking around, nervous...

                                SARAH (V.O.)
                  He votes. He gives money to charity,

     The waiter, hemmed by guards, nervously reads the order:

86   EXT. NEW JERSEY HILLTOP - DAY                                    86

     THE HELICOPTER ROARS IN, lands. Davies and his men jump out.

     AN FBI GROUND TEAM is waiting for them. A CAMDEN FIELD AGENT
     runs up and points at the ground, shouting:

                                FIELD AGENT
                  WE THINK WE'VE GOT A CAIRN HERE!
                  SOMEBODY LAID A BED OF STONES AND

     Davies signals his team. SHOVELS AND PICKS hit the ground...

87   INT. CELL - DAY                                                  87

     ...while GORGEOUS FOOD hits paper plates. It's being slopped
     unceremoniously from the fine china by the guards. TILT UP to
     Iger overseeing this process, passing china and utensils to
     the waiter, who's flustered:

                                WAITER
                  You're bruising the crepes.

                                GUARD
                  Life's a bitch, then you die.

     Clyde's got the rose, teasing his nose with it. All around        *
     the cellblock, inmates are shouting insults and threats...

89   EXT. HILLTOP - DAY                                                89

     Digging. Sod coming off, being set aside on plastic. FLASH
     PHOTOS being taken. Stones being pried up...

90   INT. CELLBLOCK - DAY                                              90

     Waiter and guards exit with the cart. The entire cellblock is
     SHOUTING. Iger pauses, gives a final glance back. Softly:

                                 IGER
                   Idiot.

     Then he too departs, as:

     CLYDE

     aims his remote. MUSIC for dining. Clyde glances back at            *
     Dwight, who's poised and tense.

                                 CLYDE
                   I suppose if I don't share, you'll
                   beat the shit out of me. Make me
                   squeal like a piggy. That sort of
                   thing.

                                 DWIGHT
                   Fuckin' A.

     Clyde motions "join me, won't you?" They each take a seat.

     Clyde passes Dwight a crisply-folded linen napkin. Dwight
     tucks it like a bib. Clyde lays his on his lap.

     A hurled object CLANGS off their bars. The cons are now
     throwing things, hollering to raise the dead. Clyde cranks
     the music a bit louder, motions for Dwight to dig in.

     Dwight goes for it, cramming food in his mouth and grabbing
     for more, fingers digging in...

91   EXT. HILLTOP - DUSK                                               91

     ...fingers digging in, pulling loose soil, prying stones. A
     layer of soil is brushed aside to reveal:

     A face. Embedded in the dirt. He's been there a long time.
     FLASH PHOTOS highlight desiccated lips and teeth...

     ...lips and teeth -- Dwight chewing, laughing. Oddly enough,
     he and Clyde seem to have started enjoying each other's
     company. THE MUSIC PLAYS in bizarre counterpoint to:                *

     THE CACOPHONY of an angry cellblock -- if the cons weren't in
     their cells, this would be a riot. All imaginable items are
     being hurled through bars: toilet paper rolls, books, shoes,
     clothes, all raining down, showering the cellblock floor...

                                CLYDE
                  I wonder what the little people are
                  eating tonight?

     Dwight throws his head back and laughs...

93   INT. OFFICE - DUSK                                                93

     ...while, in deep silence, Nick unwraps a sorry-looking deli
     sandwich, swaps his pickles for Cantrell's potato salad (their
     long-standing ritual). They both keep glancing at the phone...

94   INT. CELL - DUSK                                                  94

     ...as Clyde and Dwight indulge their food orgy. Dialogue is
     not important, so we won't hear any -- we'll let the MUSIC         *
     take over and carry -- because it's all about tone:

     They're laughing and talking, winding each other up. And the
     more Clyde wisecracks, the more Dwight laughs.

     Clyde finishes gnawing a lamb rack and says something to Dwight
     about the ruckus. Dwight turns, glances out, as:

     Clyde casually, but with purpose, lowers the bone onto his
     lap -- adding it to one already there. He picks up a fresh
     one, starts chewing the meat off...

95   EXT. HILLTOP - DUSK                                               95

     Dark enough now for flashlights. In the beams, we see the
     body mostly excavated. Forensic team members gather, in gloves
     and breather masks, getting ready to try lifting.

                                FORENSIC TECH
                  Okay, let's see if we can get him

     Clyde laughing, chewing, gnawing that third bone. ANGLE CLOSES
     DOWN as he brings it to his lap...

      TIGHT REVEAL: His napkin wrapped tightly around his hand
      provides padding for his palm. The two earlier bones are
      already held between his fingers -- he places the third, makes
      a fist -- and the bones now protrude from his clenched knuckles
      like a trio of spikes.

      TILT UP to Clyde...he reaches across, turns a paper plate
      over to cover the crepes...

97    INT. OFFICE - DUSK                                                97

      cart slamming into the wall as the lamb bones protruding from
      his fist go slamming into Dwight's throat...

      Clyde rises into the shot, calm now, covered with blood. He
      unwraps the napkin from his hand, snaps it open, uses it to
      wipe the blood from his face.

      He takes his seat, positions the cart, uncovers the crepes
      and resumes eating...

      A steel gate slides open, revealing Nick. Flanking him are
      Cantrell, Dunnigan, Davies (banged up and bandaged), Iger,

                   He killed his cellmate. We had to
                   separate him out.

                   We don't have the authority. Not
                   without a court order. This place
                   was re-opened under protest as it
                   is. Some areas are off-limits to
                   our use -- tied up in a legal
                   challenge by the ACLU as cruel and
                   unusual. Especially solitary.

      Clyde waits in the birdcage, shackled. The group spreads into
      the room, silence thick. Nobody will enter the birdcage this
      time. Clyde occupies it alone -- owning it, in fact -- as:

             Nice trick with the rack of lamb.
             Didn't see that one coming.

                           NICK
             Why'd you kill your cellmate?

                           CLYDE
             I claim self-defense.

                           NICK
             Here's what I think. You suckered
             us in. You ordered that meal for
             the purpose of killing him.

                           CANTRELL
             Which makes it premeditated. Again.

                           CLYDE
             And, again, you'll have to prove
             that in court. As I've said before...

             That is correct, Agent Davies.

                   Judge Burch with an answer for you.

107   INT. JUDGE'S CHAMBERS - DAY                                     107

                                 JUDGE BURCH
                   I'm the ACLU's biggest fundraiser
                   in this state. You wanna put that
                   piece of shit in solitary? Good. As
                   far as I'm concerned, you can bury
                   him in the bowels of hell.

108   INT. "THE DOME" - DAY                                           108

                   Thank you, Judge Burch.

                   Consider your court order signed.
                          (moves to Clyde)
                   Freedom? Not likely. In fact, you
                   just bought a one room suite in the
                   dungeon. Very exclusive.

                                 IGER
                   You'll have it all to yourself --
                   the first man down there in over
                   twenty years. Quite an achievement.

      Clyde sinks with a sigh of resignation and defeat, rests his
      head wearily on the bars. Nick moves in, speaking quietly:

                                 NICK
                   You're doing everything wrong. Making
                   all the wrong moves.

                                 CLYDE
                   It would seem that way.

      The wording catches Nick -- but he dismisses it, turns:

                                 NICK
                   Sam. I know you got hit hard. I

                   my shot at prosecuting this case.

                   I like it. Keep going. This is our

             Wake up, blind man! It's been exactly
             that since I watched him shake
             Clarence Darby's hand on the steps
             of the Hall of Justice ten years
             ago! The Hall of Justice!

His voice echoes off. In the silence that follows:

             You wanna take this fuck down? Be

             It's on you now, Nick. It's your

             You do, they'll scapegoat you. That's         *

                    (to Davies)
             Good call, Sam. Making me disappear
             was a bad idea. You couldn't have
             handled the blowback.

      "The Dungeon" -- a small underground block of FIVE CELLS dating
      back a century or more. A GUARD is spraying WD-40 into the
      lock of a cell, trying to turn the key. It finally does, as:

      Clyde is brought in. GUARDS have him on poles connected to a
      leather collar around his neck, and they're none too gentle.
      Clyde tosses a final glance back at Nick and Iger.                  *

                   What can he do? We've got him boxed
                   in. He's isolated, for God's sake.

                                 NICK
                   Let's keep him that way. Strict
                   rules apply. Law says he gets one
                   hour outside his cell a day, that's
                   what he gets. Just one, under heavy
                   guard. The other twenty-three hours,
                   he's in that cell, he's a ghost, he
                   doesn't exist. No contact whatsoever.

                   This is our place. You love it here.                   *
                          (as a waiter approaches)
                   You should have said something...                      *

      She raises her menu -- yes, we're in La Traviata. And the
      waiter is the same guy who brought Benson Clyde his meal:

                                 WAITER
                   Have we decided?

      Nick's CELL PHONE RINGS. He pulls it, checks the number, gives
      them a look -- sorry, gotta take this.

                   Sam? What is it?

                   Not far, maybe six blocks. I'm having
                   dinner with my wife.

                   Nick, don't ask questions. I was on
                   the phone all day. Believe me when
                   I say we've got one shot at this.

      He clicks off...

113   INT. NICK'S OFFICE - NIGHT                                        113

      ...and faces Nick and Cantrell in the dimly-lit office:

                                 NICK
                   He's coming here?

                                 DAVIES
                   So I'm told. It's called inter-agency
                   cooperation, but don't ask me what
                   agency because I wouldn't know.
                   This isn't even back-channels, this
                   is Theseus in the fucking Labyrinth.
                          (off their looks)
                   I just blew thirty years' worth of
                   favors today calling in this one
                   chit. I hope it's worth it.                            *

      The desk phone RINGS. Nick answers, listens a beat:

      WHITE   -   9-7-8                                        66.

                                 NICK
                   Yes. Yes, we're all here. Downstairs?
                   Okay. Understood.
                          (hangs up)
                   He said not to take the elevator.

      Off their puzzled looks...

114   INT. CITY HALL - SPIRAL STAIRCASE - NIGHT                        114

      Huge, descending seven floors, circles within circles dropping
      into darkness. Nick and Davies lead the way down. Cantrell
      brings up the rear with his dog and cane...

                                 SPOOK (O.S.)
                   That's good there.

      They freeze. Nick and Davies peer down. They start to make
      out a FIGURE in the murky darkness one level below.

                                 SPOOK
                   Which one of you is Davies?

      Davies takes a step forward. THE SPOOK eases partially into
      the light -- flinty gaze, military-style haircut.

                                 SPOOK
                   You must be well thought of, Agent
                   Davies. I don't do this. But I was
                   asked nicely by the right people.
                   They briefed me on your problems
                   with Benson Clyde.

                                 NICK
                   What are we dealing with?

                                 SPOOK
                   Things I can neither confirm nor
                   deny. Things of which, if I'm asked,
                   I will disavow any knowledge.

      The guys trade a look. Cantrell can't help chuckling.

                                 CANTRELL
                          (to Davies)
                   You gotta be kidding me with this
                   guy.

                                 SPOOK
                   He's not. Tell me you grasp the
                   implication of what I've said, or
                   we're done here.

                                 CANTRELL
                          (smile fades)
                   Yeah. Okay. I get it.

WHITE   -   9-7-8                                    67.

                           NICK
             What was Clyde? Some kind of spy?

                           SPOOK
             Spooks like me are a dime a dozen.
             Clyde was a brain. He ran a think-
             tank, inventing things for use in
             the field. Ways to kill people.
                    (off their looks)
             You need to get rid of somebody.
             It's not a situation where you can
             get close. What do you do?

                           NICK
             Ask Clyde?

                           SPOOK
             That's right. Ask Clyde. And he'd
             figure something out. Gizmos,
             strategy. He was good at it.

                           NICK
             How good?

                           SPOOK
                    (beat)
             You play chess?

                           NICK
             Yeah. Tournament level in college,
             matter of fact.

                           SPOOK
             In my line, we use an aptitude
             profile based on chess. A tournament-
             level player like you can think
             five to eight steps ahead of an
             average player, did you know that?
             Me, I think about ten steps ahead,
             so I'd take you in a game.

                           NICK
             What about Clyde?

                           SPOOK
             Off the charts. If you're eight
             steps ahead, he's twenty. Or fifty.
             He's already got the game won on
             the first move, you don't even know
             you're playing yet.
                    (further into the light)
             This cellmate he killed? You think
             that was random? Bullshit. That was
             a pawn taken off the board. If I
             were you, I'd be trying to figure
             out what the move was.

BLUE   -   9-19-08                                       68.

                           NICK
             I have been. Any thoughts?

                           SPOOK
             Top of my head? Was the cellmate
             ever connected with this case? Or
             with Clyde? Was anybody else in
             that facility? Guards? Cons? The
             janitor? Any connection at all, no
             matter how remote. Because if Clyde
             says he has things in play, he does.

                           DAVIES
             Like what? He's locked up. What can
             he do?

                           SPOOK
                    (gives him a look)
             You're an average chess player,
             aren't you?

                           DAVIES
             Actually, I kind of suck.

                           SPOOK
             I can tell. But I like your tie.

                           DAVIES
                    (perplexed)
             Thank you. Father's Day.

                           SPOOK
             There's this tie -- we call it the
             Albert, after Albert DeSalvo. They
             tiptoe in one night, thread a piano
             wire with a ratchet gizmo into one
             of your ties. Sounds crazy, but                     *
             trust me it works. You put your tie                 *
             on and all day long it slowly
             tightens. You don't even notice
             it's cutting off the blood-flow to
             your brain. Then you drop dead.
             Brain-dead or plain dead, doesn't
             much matter at that point.
                    (beat)
             Clyde invented that.

The Spook melts back into the shadows. The guys crane forward,
trying to see. There's a brief spill of light below as a
doorway opens and closes...he's gone.

The three of them stand there absorbing everything they've
heard. Nick sits on a step. Quiet looks are traded...

...and they all start taking off their ties...

      WHITE   -   9-7-8                                        69.

115   INT. NICK'S HOUSE - NIGHT                                       115

      Nick enters tie-less, subdued, distracted. Kell and Emma are
      in the living room playing Scrabble.

                                    EMMA
                   Daddy!

      Emma jumps up and runs over for a hug.

                                  EMMA
                   Mom said I could stay up late. Wanna
                   play Scrabble?

                                 NICK
                   Let me talk to mom first.

      Emma returns to the couch. Kell comes to Nick, noticing his
      weird vibe: he's looking around at the room.

                                 NICK
                   Sorry about date night.

                                 KELL
                   It's fine. You learn anything?

                                    NICK
                   Thing or two.

      He moves up the hallway -- slowly, as if noticing the walls
      for the first time, the picture frames, the light fixtures...

                                    KELL
                             (following him)
                   Nick?

                                 NICK
                   Hey, I was thinking. Maybe you could
                   pack an overnight bag for you and
                   Emma in case you need to...you
                   know...spend the night in a hotel.
                   Or something.

                                 KELL
                   Why would we wanna do that?

                                 NICK
                   No reason. It's like a fire-drill
                   thing. You know. In case.

116   INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT                                            116

      He comes in, opens the closet, reaches up for some overnight
      bags -- but pauses, drawn to his tie-rack inside the door.

      He stares at the ties hanging in neat rows...starts touching
      them, running his hands up and down the fabric...

BLUE   -   9-19-08                                        70.

Kell stands in the doorway watching. Wondering what the fuck
is going on. And getting a little creeped out.

                           KELL
             Honey?

He freezes, feeling something in the seam of a tie. Runs his
fingers up and down, thinking something's in there.

Emma appears in the doorway too, at her mother's side. Both
staring now. They watch as:

Nick grabs a pair of scissors from Kell's sewing kit, carves
the tie lengthwise, rips it open, feverish and faster, finds
nothing inside but mangled fabric and thread and -- stops.
Looks back. Realizes they're staring at him.

                           KELL
             What the hell are you doing?

Nick pauses -- what the hell is he doing? He starts to regain
his sense, laughs at himself in amazement.

                           EMMA
             Daddy?

                           NICK
             It's okay, baby -- I'm fine, I
             promise. Go back to your game.

Dubious, Emma departs. As soon as she's out of earshot:

                           KELL
             Seriously, Nick. What the fuck.

                           NICK
             Nothing. I got paranoid for no
             reason, that's all. I'm fine now. I
             can't believe I let that son of a
             bitch Clyde get to me like that.

                           KELL
             Are you in danger? Are we?

The question hangs there -- the real question.                  *

                           NICK
             I'm sure we're fine.                               *

      ADAs are parking their cars along the wall, directed by a
      waving GUARD. ANGLE FINDS a lot of people: cop, prison, FBI.    *
      Sarah jumps out of her car and hurries over to Nick and the
      others with a flock of EIGHT ADAs at her heels.

                                 NICK
                   Ready to turn this place upside
                   down?

                   anybody who might have had anything
                   to do with the original Darby-Ames

      JAMESON glances up in dismay from his keyboard.

                                 JAMESON
                   This could take days.

      Sarah, grabbing a stack from a filing cabinet and slamming
      the door shut with her hip, gives him a laser look:

                                 SARAH
                   We boring you, Jameson? You got

      Jameson dives onto the keys, starts clack-clacking. Sarah
      gives Nick a nod -- she's got this in hand. Nick exits...

119   EXT. PRISON GROUNDS - NIGHT                                       119

      ...and finds a FORENSIC TEAM disassembling Clyde's Sleep-Matic
      bed -- nuts, bolts, struts, electronics. The mattress is being
      razored open, wadding pulled out and run under fluoroscopes.

                   Well?

                                 DUNNIGAN
                   It used to be a Sleep-Matic
                   adjustable bed. Now it's not.

      CAMERA FOLLOWS them to a table where an FBI TEAM is focusing
      all their skills and tech on Clyde's ipod and speaker dock.
      The TEAM LEADER places the buds in his ears, listening.

                                 NICK
                   What do you have?

                                 TEAM LEADER

                          (off Nick's look)
                   What do you want from me, it's a
                   fucking ipod.

      The other agents snicker, not hiding their amusement, but:         *

120   INT. CLYDE'S CELLBLOCK - NIGHT                                    120

      GUARDS, FEDS, BOMB-SNIFFING DOGS -- they're cruising the
      cellblocks, flashlights swiveling, beams catching the faces
      of sleepy cons in their cells or at their bars...

      We find Nick and Iger at Clyde's now-empty cell. TWO FBI            *
      emerge, shake their heads.                                          *

121   INT. SOLITARY WING - CLYDE'S CELL - NIGHT                         121

      Two doors: solid steel outer door, inner barred door. The
      outer slides aside, reveals Nick outside the bars. Inside
      stands a shadow, waiting: Clyde.

                                 CLYDE
                   You're up early. Trouble sleeping?

                                 NICK
                   It was a good bluff. But you're
                   done. Fucking with my head. Scaring                    *
                   my family half to death. Done.

      Clyde moves closer to the bars, into the light.

                                 CLYDE
                   Amazing, isn't it? How primal that
                   is. That pull? What a man is capable
                   of when it comes to his family?                        *

                                 NICK                                     *
                   You strip away all the polite shit,                    *
                   that's what we're really about.

                                 CLYDE                                    *
                   I hope you never face what it is to                    *
                   lose them, Nick. It's like dying
                   yourself. There's nothing worse.

      That could play as a threat, of course -- but it's not. It's       *
      genuine. And pained. And sincere. And Nick knows it.

                                 NICK
                   Good night, Ben.

                                 CLYDE
                   Good night, Nick.

      And then the moment's gone and the mocking Clyde returns:

                                 CLYDE
                   Is it casual Friday?
                          (off Nick's look)
                   I've never seen you not wear a tie.

      And that says volumes: Clyde's totally aware of what they've
      been up to and is tickled by it.

      The outer door GRINDS SHUT...

122   EXT. PRISON GROUNDS - DAWN                                        122

      Night has passed, day is coming. All the earlier energy has
      dissipated into anticlimax and weariness. People straggle
      across the yard in groups toward their vehicles...

BLUE   -   9-19-08                                         74.

Nick, Dunnigan, Davies, Iger -- all look whipped. Sarah
approaches, briefcase in hand, files under her arm.

                           SARAH
             We dug pretty deep for one night.
             Still got a ways to go, but on a
             first look? Nothing. Nada. Zip.

                           IGER
             Well, that's good news.

                           NICK
             So far. Now we double-down. Make                    *
             absolutely certain.                                 *
                    (nods after ADAs)                            *
             Let them all sleep a few hours,                     *
             then bring 'em back for round two.                  *

                           SARAH
             Due diligence. My middle name.                      *

She trudges toward her car, following the ADAs toward their
vehicles. Nick trades relieved looks with the men -- everybody
coming down from a tense night. Davies shakes their hands:

                           DAVIES
             Fellas. For once, glad not to be of
             assistance.

                           DUNNIGAN
             Love it when they cry wolf.

The men separate in different directions. Dunnigan catches a
glimpse of Sarah almost at her car -- she loses a page from
under her arm, which flutters away on the breeze.

                           DUNNIGAN
                    (calls to her)
             Miss Lowell! Lost something!

She looks back, sees the page skittering slowly across the
ground. Weary, she blows a strand of hair from her eyes, sets
down her briefcase, walks back to get it...

Dunnigan smiles, keeps walking. The other men too. Nick stands
a moment, watching, then starts toward his car...

The ADAs are getting to their cars, pulling key fobs, aiming
them to unlock their cars...

Sarah is getting to the page, leaning down...

The ADAs are pressing the remotes, a CHORUS OF CHIRPS...

And WHAM -- the cars EXPLODE in a stunning SERIES OF
DETONATIONS, killing the ADAs, throwing bodies through the
air, kicking cars off the ground and flipping a few skyward...

      BLUE   -   9-19-08                                          75.

      Nick is knocked flat by heat and shrapnel ripping the air...

      Sarah goes flying. An arcing car slams upside-down nearby on
      a rocket-booster of flame and shattering axle...

      And from this point on the visuals and sound are surreal:          *

      NICK

      pries himself off the ground, stunned, looking around, trying
      to figure out what the fuck just happened. He's disoriented,
      all sound muffled. Smoke drifting. Flames billowing.

      Dunnigan runs up to Nick, shouting something. We can't tell
      what, because Nick can't hear. Dunnigan sees Nick is alive,
      turns and keeps going, running to help the others...

      Nick looks over, sees bodies being pulled clear by responders,
      men running in, beating at flames...

      Nick, dazed, looks through the drifting smoke and sees Sarah
      trying to sit up. There's something wrong with her leg.

      Nick pulls himself to his knees, staggers to his feet as sound
      filters back in: screams, shouts, the roar of flames.

      He stumbles through the smoke to Sarah. She's on the ground
      in shock, sobbing and flailing, crying out. Nick sees the
      jagged piece of metal that slammed deep into her calf, nearly
      severing it. He drops to his knees, tries to calm her:

                                 NICK
                   You're gonna be all right.

      He pulls the metal from her leg -- mistake. Blood sprays. He
      clamps down hard with both hands, blood going everywhere.

                                 NICK
                   MEDIC! I NEED A MEDIC!

      He keeps clamping down, Sarah screaming and sobbing, as we

123   IN A SERIES OF FADE-TO-BLACKS, THE FOLLOWING IMAGES:              123

      FIREMEN spraying the flaming rubble of the cars...

      TANGLES OF WRECKAGE billowing smoke...

      A BODY BAG dragged across the ground, added to a ROW OF BODY
      BAGS awaiting transport...

      EMERGENCY VEHICLES parked haphazardly, lights spinning...

      COPS AND RESPONDERS dealing with the scene...

      BLUE   -   9-19-08                                       76.

      SARAH being wheeled on a gurney to a PARAMEDIC VAN by an EMS
      TEAM, oxygen mask on her face, gravely injured but stabilized,
      everything swirling around her, Dunnigan clearing a path...

      NICK appears, takes her hand. She clasps it weakly. They load
      her on and the vehicle pulls out with siren and lights...

124   EXT. PRISON GROUNDS - DAY                                        124

      Back to "real time" -- Cantrell is just getting out of his
      town car with his dog. WE FIND Nick on his cell:

                                 NICK
                          (on cell)
                   Baby. Listen. Don't be worried or
                   scared. But I want you to pack those
                   overnight bags... I don't have time
                   to explain now. Just do it, okay?
                   I'll call you back as soon as I can --
                   please, honey, I gotta go.

      He clicks off as ANGLE COMES AROUND, revealing Davies and his
      TEAMS coming his way:

                                 DAVIES
                   Each car had an explosive charge on
                   the gas tank.

                                 NICK
                   He's got someone working with him.
                   On the outside. He's got to.

                                 DAVIES
                   Not necessarily. Everything looks
                   pre-rigged.

                                 BOMB EXPERT
                   We found a short-range transmitter
                   beacon buried outside the prison
                   wall. When your people showed up
                   here and drove in through the gate,
                   the signal armed the bombs.                           *

                                 DUNNIGAN
                   He could have planted those bombs a
                   month ago.

                                 CANTRELL
                          (grappling for sense)
                   No...no, we've got two dozen ADAs
                   on payroll. Those eight were picked
                   last night on the spur of the moment.
                   How could he know which eight would
                   show up?

      WHITE   -   9-7-8                                        77.

                                 DAVIES
                   He didn't. Our people just found
                   bombs on every car in your ADA pool.
                   All two dozen. We're disarming those
                   now.

125   INT. "THE DOME" - DAY                                          125

      TIGHT ON CLYDE shoved into the birdcage. The neck-poles are
      disengaged. He moves forward, gazing through the bars...

                                 CLYDE
                   I want a phone in my cell. If I'm
                   conducting my own defense, it would
                   be useful. Also in case you and I
                   need to be in touch, Nick.

                                 NICK
                   Fuck you.

                                 CLYDE
                          (glances at clock)
                   Your twenty four hours are about
                   up. In return for the phone, I'll
                   extend you another twelve hours.

                                 NICK
                   If not?

                                 CLYDE
                   How many more people die while you
                   stand around dithering? How many do
                   you get killed before my point starts
                   sinking in?

      Cantrell closes in, tracking Clyde by voice:

                                  CANTRELL
                   Motherfucker! Whatever point you
                   had was lost long ago! Eight kids
                   dead in that yard, most of them
                   just out of college! Eight! I have
                   to talk to their families. I have
                   to try to explain why their loved
                   ones are dead.

      Clyde leans down, right in Cantrell's face, intense:

                                 CLYDE
                   I've been waiting for my explanation
                   for ten years. So far...
                          (shouts)
                   ...NOBODY'S FUCKING BOTHERED!

      Beat. Cantrell spits in his face, turns away trembling with
      rage. Clyde calmly wipes it off, rises to address them all:

BLUE   -   9-19-08                                       78.

                           CLYDE
             If it hasn't dawned on you, this is
             a war. As in any war, there will be
             collateral damage. The question, as
             always, is how much damage you're
             willing to take before you withdraw.

                            DUNNIGAN
             Maybe I got a better idea. Maybe we
             end this war right now.
                    (looks around)
             Fourteen people dead! I have to say                  *
             this out loud?
                    (moving toward Clyde)
             Prisoners die in custody all the
             time. Attacking a guard. Trying to
             escape. Shit like that.

Clyde, eyes locked, pulls his shirt open -- here's your target.
Dunnigan, temper flaring, yanks his revolver and aims.

                           DUNNIGAN
             Don't tempt me.

                           GARZA
             Jesus Christ, man, dial it back...

                           CLYDE
             Do it. It would be decisive. Stupid,
             but decisive.
                    (off Dunnigan's look)
             Can you handle the blowback,
             Detective? The "shit like that?"

Nick's stunned, seeing the whole situation spiraling out of
control. He steps in, seizing the moment back:

                           NICK
             Put the gun away! Are you crazy?

                           DUNNIGAN
                    (calmly reholsters)
             It's an option. All I'm saying.
             Risk the blowback. Ride it out.

                           NICK
             We're not risking anything. Or
             letting him tear us down.
                    (to Clyde)
             You're not getting us to throw out
             the rules, like you. No way.

      BLUE   -   9-19-08                                       79.

                                 CLYDE
                   I like rules. I've wanted you to
                   follow them from the start. Like
                   the one that says you prosecute a
                   man who murders my family.
                          (re-buttons)
                   So. Rules. A phone buys you another
                   twelve hours. But if you haven't
                   cut my deal and let me go by the
                   deadline...

                                 NICK
                   What? What then?

                                 CLYDE
                   I'll kill someone in this room.

      That sucks the air out of the conversation -- everybody stares
      as that sinks in. Glances are traded.

                                    NICK
                   Who?

      He looks at the room full of people, scans their faces as if
      trying to pick. He points his finger, starts going from one
      end of the group to the other...

                                 CLYDE
                   Eenie...meenie...miney...moe...

      ...from person to person, to the end, moving back again...

                                 CLYDE
                   ...my mother...told me...to pick...a
                   person...and that...person...is...

      He lands on Cantrell. Silence. Cantrell obviously can't see.

                                 CANTRELL
                   Who's he pointing at?

126   EXT. PRISON COURTYARD - DAY                                      126*

      Everybody on the move, emotions high:

                                 CANTRELL
                   Fuck him. Let him try.

                                 NICK
                   That's not helpful! We have fourteen                  *
                   dead! You could ask them what he's
                   capable of, but they're in no

                    (beat, tight)
             Point taken.

                           DAVIES
             We'll give him his phone. We'll tap
             in and monitor every call.

                           DUNNIGAN
             Buys us another twelve hours, we
             could use that right now. That puts
             the deadline at...
                    (checks his watch)
             ...about 7:30 tonight.

                           CANTRELL
             Shit. I'll be in front of a room
             full of lawyers. The A.B.A. dinner.
             I'm the keynote speaker.

                           NICK
             No way. Find a replacement.

                           DUNNIGAN
             Until his deadline passes, you're
             in protective custody. Not
             negotiable.

Cantrell isn't happy about it -- but nods.

                           NICK
             And have them switch the location
             of that dinner.

                           CANTRELL
             That's last minute.

      BLUE   -   9-19-08                                       81.

                                 NICK
                   Exactly. He could have gotten your
                   schedule in advance -- been planning
                   to take you out at the dinner along
                   with everybody else. That eenie-
                   meenie act could have been horseshit.
                          (off their looks)
                   We have to get a few moves ahead.
                   Plan for every contingency.

                                 DUNNIGAN
                   This way, Mr. Cantrell. Garza, you're
                   with Mr. Price.

      They split up. Dunnigan leads Cantrell to an unmarked car
      while Nick and Garza head toward Nick's. Nick's phone RINGS.
      He checks the number, answers:

                                 NICK
                   Hey baby -- no, I'm fine. Really.
                   Honey, calm down...

      He listens a beat, calls to the men getting in the other cars:

                                 NICK
                   Our shit just hit the fan in a big
                   way -- we're all over the news...
                          (on phone)
                   Yes, all eight died. Sarah's in
                   surgery right now...
                          (beat)
                   ...they think so, but...
                          (beat)
                   ...okay, I'll meet you there. Love
                   you.

      He hangs up, aims his key fob -- and hesitates. He and Garza
      trade a look, thinking the same thought. ANGLE SHIFTS to:

                                 BOMB EXPERT                            *
                   You're good. Car's been swept.

                                 NICK
                   Of course it has. Thanks.

      Nick, feeling foolish, presses the fob. Nothing but a tiny
      CHIRP. He and Garza get in.

      Dunnigan drives. Cantrell and his dog ride in back. Both men
      tense and silent. TWO POLICE CRUISERS provide escort...

128   INT. NICK'S CAR (MOVING)/EXT. HOSPITAL - DAY                     128

      Nick is pulling up toward the hospital, sees a TV NEWS VAN at
      the entrance, a MINICAM CREW arguing with hospital security.

                   Go around. I'll get us in back.

      Nick hits the gas, drives past the news van...

129   INT. HOSPITAL - DAY                                               129

      ...and they come past the nurse's duty desk. UNIFORMS are
      stationed in the hallway. Garza pushes a path through:

                                 GARZA
                   Keep the press off this floor,
                   understand?

      Nick squeezes past. The floor is busy. He finds Kell in the
      waiting area. She looks up, spots him.

      Kell rises. She and Nick pull into a tight embrace. No words
      for a long moment. Kell's shaken, fighting tears.

                                 NICK
                   Any word?

                                 KELL
                   She's in surgery now. They're saying
                   she'll be okay.

                                 NICK
                   Thank God. That's good.

                                 KELL
                   Good? You'll have to explain the
                   good part, Nick. I'm missing it.
                   This is crazy. What if something
                   happened to you? What would I say
                   to Emma? What would we do?

                                 NICK
                   You didn't lose me. You won't. Does
                   the school know we're pulling Emma
                   out of class?

                                 KELL
                   I called, yeah, but -- I'd rather
                   be here for Sarah when she wakes
                   up. Nick -- and for you. I want to
                   do something...

                   You are. Getting our daughter out
                   of harm's way. And yourself.

                           (to Kell)
                   There's not much time. I'll be there
                   to see you off. Okay? Please?

      gathering. ANGLE TO A REPORTER on-camera:

      CAMERA FOLLOWS him outside to a podium set up before a swarming
      MOB OF PRESS shouting questions. ANGLE COMES AROUND to reveal:

      Kell and Emma on the platform, Garza hovering nearby, CROWDS
      swarming around them as boarding calls come over the P.A.
      system. Kell is looking around, anxious.

      Nick appears on the platform, hurrying. They see him. Emma
      runs, throws herself into Nick's arms as he crouches.

             You're kinda full of shit, Dad.

Nick's taken aback -- not sure whether to laugh. He trades a
look with Kell, who's too tense with worry to care.

                           NICK
             Okay, you're right. Maybe I am a
             little. But only a little. The part

envelope, hands it to her...

             Emma's right. This sucks.

She embraces him, fears and emotions swirling.

                           KELL
             Be goddamn careful.

      She breaks the embrace. Nick stands, watching them get on the
      train. The doors close. The train starts out...

      Nick turns. Garza's been watching -- a look of sympathy for
      what Nick's going through...

134   INT. TRAIN - DAY                                                  134

      Kell and Emma on the train, watching buildings slide by outside
      the window. Kell troubled, holding her daughter...

135   EXT. AERIAL SHOT OF TRAIN - DAY                                   135

      WE FOLLOW the train traveling a path through canyons of
      buildings, leaving the city...

      ANGLE SWAPS TRAIN FOR CAR as we drift over a bridge and find
      Nick's car racing across the span...                                *

136   INT. CANTRELL'S HOUSE - DAY                                       136

      Nick and Garza enter. ANGLE COMES AROUND to reveal the house
      swarming with HIGH-TECH FBI FORENSIC TEAMS turning the house
      upside-down, tearing things apart, X-RAY SCANNING walls...

      Cantrell sits isolated, near tears of frustration, as the
      place is trashed around him. He glances up, hearing:

                                    NICK
                   Jesus.                                                 *

                                 CANTRELL
                   Nick? These guys won't even let me
                   pack a bag. Not even a toothbrush.

      Davies enters frame, accompanied by FORENSIC TECHS -- not the
      guys from downtown, but people who work serious ops.

                                 DAVIES
                   We have granules of an unidentified
                   substance in the ice-maker...

      He holds up a drinking glass with a few ice cubes, runs a
      black-light wand behind it -- dark granules become visible on
      each pass, embedded in the ice.

                                 DAVIES
                   I'm betting something lethal.

                                 TECH #1
                   Like this salt.
                          (pours a small amount)
                   Not sodium chloride. Potassium
                   chloride. It's a neuro-blocker,
                   stops the heart -- they use it in
                   lethal injections. You'd be dead
                   before you got up from the table.                      *

Nick tosses the others a grim look.                      *

                           NICK
             I'm telling you, Clyde has someone          *
             working with him. Someone on the
             outside.

                           CANTRELL
             Who? Who could he have?

                           NICK
             Somebody from his past. Could be            *
             that spook we met on the stairs,            *
             for all we know -- he'd know how to         *
             plant this shit...

                           CANTRELL
             Him? No--why would Clyde let him
             come talk to us?

                           NICK
             To fuck with our heads? To get us
             to bring in our ADAs so he could
             blow them up?

             It would be a Clyde move. But it's          *

             your house before he was arrested?

             Jonas, think -- last few days, have         *
             you used any ice? Any salt?

                           CANTRELL
                    (confused, grappling)
             I don't use salt--my cholesterol.
             Ice? Yeah--not long ago.

                           NICK
             Before or after he was arrested?

                           CANTRELL
             I don't remember! You track your            *
             use of ice, Nick? You keep a daily          *
             log?

TECH #2 calls from the kitchen:

                   In his tea pot. Same way the Russians
                   killed Litvenenko. Took him two
                   weeks to die.

                   need is a trace amount. Rips through
                   your organs and bone marrow.

      Nick's been listening, thunderstruck, paler by the moment. He
      looks to Cantrell sitting there, quiet and shaking.

138   INT. HOTEL ROOM - DAY                                             138

      The door opens, revealing Nick, Cantrell, et al. They come
      into the room...actually, "room" undersells it. It's the most
      spectacular suite known to man -- huge open floor plan, with
      a stunning view of all the downtown buildings surrounding us.

                                 NICK
                   Holy shit.

                   didn't pick me.

      Cantrell laughs -- and it lightens everybody's mood. Nick          *
      drifts to the windows, gazing out, as:                             *

                   person who stayed here was actually
                   a president. Of a country. Security
                   here is amazing.

                   It's not bad, Jonas. I think you
                   can muddle through.

                                 DAVIES
                   You're muddling with him. I don't
                   want you back at your house until
                   my people sweep it. You need pajamas,

139   EXT. COUNTY JAIL ANNEX - DAY                                    139

      A STEEL DOOR opens. Clyde steps out, shackled, blinking at
      daylight. He comes down a short flight of steps...

      CAMERA COMES AROUND to reveal his surroundings: not within
      prison walls, but rather behind the prison -- a loading area
      we haven't seen, comprised of fences and razor wire.

      Nick walks in the rear gate, passed through by Warden Iger
      himself -- this is clearly an off-the-books meeting. Nick and
      Clyde walk to each other, meet halfway.

             For what? A talk? Or...
                    (gazes around)
             Maybe you've decided to take
             Detective Dunnigan's advice.

He's noticing GUARDS atop the prison wall and surrounding
roofs -- all with sniper rifles.

                           NICK
             Be the perfect place for it. Outside
             the wall. Look like you were shot
             trying to escape.

WIDE ANGLE FROM ABOVE

Nick and Clyde below. A SCOPE suddenly rises into frame,
turning our shot into a SNIPER SCOPE POV, jumping Clyde's
face into magnification. He smiles in the crosshairs...

             You have some kind of signal worked
             out? You scratch your nose and blam,

             No. It's to prove a     point.

             Just because I have     the power,

             Ah. Nice. Good one.

We see Clyde's brain bend a little -- trying to wrap his head
around it. It's almost painful for him.

             I think we've come a little too far
             for that, haven't we, Nick? I mean,
             what do I say? Sorry, my bad? Which
             way to the execution chamber?

             slip the dogs of war, you go with                  *
             it. You don't just stop because                    *
             someone says hey wait. By then the
             dogs are dragging you.

             ...you were right. I was wrong.

             prosecuted both men ten years ago?

                           CLYDE
             I'd say you're making progress. You
             should have, you know. Prosecuted
             both.

                              NICK
             I'd have lost.

                           CLYDE
             With your head held high. And without
             any blame from me.

Nick's CELL RINGS -- he turns away, answers:

Clyde glances around at the snipers with a laugh.

                            CLYDE
             Just a guess. It's what I would do.
             Get 'em out, make sure they're safe.
                     (reproachful)
             C'mon. Like I'd ever have hurt them
             anyway.

             No?

                           CLYDE
             There are limits. Even in war. I
             may be many things, Nick. But I'm
             not Clarence Darby. I'm not Rupert
             Ames. I'm not that kind of monster.

                           NICK
             What kind are you?

                           CLYDE
             Not the kind who'd hurt your wife
             and child. Christ, look at me. Mine
             were my salvation -- then they were
             killed -- and all I had left was
             this. Life without them in this
             fucking charnel-house world.

Pause. Drawing close:

                           CLYDE
             It hurt to lose them, didn't it?
             Your family. Even knowing they'd
             come back.

                           NICK
             Yeah.

                           CLYDE
             Imagine knowing they wouldn't.

                           NICK
             I can't. I can't imagine that.               *

                                 CLYDE
                   Good. I envy you. For me, knowing                     *
                   mine won't come back is the only
                   thing that's crowded my thoughts
                   for ten years. If I could take a
                   rusty knife and cut out that part
                   of my brain, I would.

                                 NICK
                   I won't make any more deals with
                   murderers. If hearing that makes a
                   difference...if that was the point
                   of all this...you've won.

      We see Clyde's brain hurting again -- he's trying to believe
      that, would like to believe that...

                                  CLYDE
                   Counselor. I have no doubt, as we
                   stand here, that you really believe
                   that. I wish I could.
                          (pause)
                   Are we done? You gonna scratch your
                   nose, or can I go?

      Silence now. Nothing left to say. They turn and walk in
      opposite directions...

      (Not Cantrell's hotel, but one close by.) A SIGN reads: "A.B.A.
      Dinner." PEOPLE are entering, passing a GREETER. ANGLE FINDS
      Judge Burch arriving...

144   INT. JUDGE BURCH'S OFFICE - DUSK                                  144

145   INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DUSK                                       145

      Nick peers in. Sarah's in bed, leg braced, in traction. She's
      awake but groggy -- which isn't stopping her from giving
      instructions to Royce, who's scribbling notes at her bedside:

                                 SARAH
                   ...tell Hansen we need hard info on
                   those addresses...don't let the
                   shell game on ownership title slow
                   him down...at this point we'll take
                   educated guesses...

      Sarah looks over, sees Nick step in, gives him a weak smile.

                                    NICK
                   Hey.

                                 SARAH
                   Hey. Nice flowers. Thanks.

      He comes to the bed, takes her hand, squeezes it.

                                    NICK
                   How you doing?

                                 SARAH
                   This place has great drugs. Damn. I
                   should've totaled my leg long ago.

      But her emotions are in turmoil -- she puts her hands over
      her face, holding back a sob.

                                 SARAH
                   They're all dead?

                                    NICK
                   I'm afraid so.

She absorbs that, angrily wipes her eyes.

                           SARAH

      Cantrell on the upper level, wearing brand-new sweats, white
      cane tapping the unfamiliar place, Betsy at his side. He
      follows VOICES around the corner...

      Inside a room, Garza's playing poker with three other cops:
      LASZLO, FLEMING, and MITRIUS.

                                    CANTRELL
                   Who's winning?

                                 FLEMING
                   Laszlo, the cheatin' prick...

                                    LASZLO
                   Yer mama...

                                    GARZA
                   Wanna sit in?

                                 CANTRELL
                   If I had my Braille set, I'd clean
                   you out. Not much of a game if you
                   have to tell me what my cards are.

                                    GARZA
                   Right...sorry.

      The other guys toss Garza a look -- what a moron.

                                 CANTRELL
                   People forget. No worries.
                          (turns away)
                   Enjoy your game, fellas.

                                  FLEMING
                   Need help? Want one of us should
                   walk you down?

                                 CANTRELL
                   I'm good. Unfamiliar places take me
                   a little longer. But I get there.

                                 GARZA

                   Holler if you need anything.
                          (back to the game)
                   Okay, who's in, who's out...

148   INT. CANTRELL'S SUITE - NIGHT                                     148

      That incredible city view -- skyscrapers all around, aglow
      with lights. Cantrell enters frame, drawn to the glass...

      A POLICE HELICOPTER IS ROARING slowly past out there, drifting
      among the buildings at our eye level. Cantrell raises his
      hand, places it on the glass, feeling the vibrations...

      The copter's searchlight sweeps the windows, highlighting him
      briefly with incredible light he can't see...

149   INT. OTHER HOTEL BALLROOM - NIGHT                                 149

      ...but we can see the copter going by from here, searchlight
      playing over Cantrell's building -- which is plainly visible
      just across the way.

      ANGLE WIDENS to find Judge Burch at a table, as:

                                 M.C.
                   ...please join me in a warm welcome

150   EXT. CHINESE RESTAURANT - NIGHT                                   150

      Nick exits, arms loaded down with bags of takeout, talking on
      his cell phone as he heads for his car:

                                 NICK
                   ...yes, you pain in the ass, of

151   INT. CANTRELL'S SUITE - NIGHT                                     151

      Cantrell's sitting in front of that incredible view with Betsy
      at his feet, on the phone:

                                 CANTRELL
                   How long, man, I'm starving...

152   EXT. CHINESE RESTAURANT - NIGHT                                   152

      Nick gets to his car, checks his watch -- and pauses. The
      time reads: "7:27." Nick is suddenly hit with a momentary
      sense of dread. He glances up the street...

      WHITE   -   9-7-8                                        97.

      ANOTHER ANGLE

      reveals Nick in deep f.g. looking up the broad avenue -- in
      the distance stands Cantrell's skyscraper.

                                    NICK
                      I'm minutes away. Relax.

      Nick shakes off his misgivings, hangs up, gets in the car...

153   INT. CANTRELL'S SUITE - NIGHT                                   153

      Cantrell eases to the floor, sits with Betsy. He strokes her
      fur. She WHINES, uneasy.

                                    CANTRELL
                      It's okay. It's gonna be okay.

154   INT. BALLROOM - NIGHT                                           154

      Judge Burch at the podium:

                      ...Jonas was upset not to be here
                      with you tonight...a personal matter
                      came up...but he wanted me to give
                      you all his fondest regards...

155   EXT. A ROOFTOP - NIGHT                                          155

      ANGLE LOOKING UP at Cantrell's hotel -- a FIGURE steps into
      our shot, his back to us. He pulls a cell phone from his
      pocket, flips it open, sees the time: "7:29."

      The thumb starts pressing numbers -- boop...boop...boop...

156   INT. CANTRELL'S SUITE - NIGHT                                   156

      ANGLE DRIFTING ACROSS THE FLOOR -- Cantrell and Betsy against
      the incredible city view...

      He finally gets fed up with that surgery collar she's worn
      the entire movie, reaches around, unsnaps the plastic. He
      puts the collar aside, gently ruffs her shaggy neck.

                                    CANTRELL
                      There. That's better.

      He puts his arm around her, taking comfort in her presence. A
      quiet, pensive moment...

157   INT. NICK'S CAR (MOVING) - NIGHT                                157

      Nick driving, a block from the hotel now...

      WHITE   -   9-7-8                                           98.

158   EXT. ROOFTOP - NIGHT                                              158

      ...as the FIGURE finishes dialing. The thumb hovers a moment,
      then presses "send." We hear the call RINGING through...

159   INT. CANTRELL'S SUITE - NIGHT                                     159

      ...and Cantrell hears a strange SOUND...almost like a phone
      ringing -- sort of close but not -- weirdly muffled.

      He looks around, trying to pinpoint it. His head finally
      swivels down to Betsy lying at his side. She's WHINING, getting
      a little freaked, licking her stitches...

      Cantrell's hand travels down her fur to her belly...fingertips
      tracing the stitching...and what he can't see is the strange
      glow building under her skin...

      But he can sense it. His eyes widen slightly...

      ...and WHAM! The room is swallowed in a DETONATION --

160   EXT. CANTRELL'S FLOOR - NIGHT                                     160

      -- which BLOWS OUT THE ROOM IN A HUGE EXPLOSION, the rows of
      windows vanishing in a storm of flame and shattering glass...

161   INT. BALLROOM - NIGHT                                             161

      Judge Burch and the others gasp as the explosion lights up
      the night from the building across the way...

162   EXT. NICK'S CAR - NIGHT                                           162

      Nick slams on his brakes -- he cranes forward, gazing up in
      horror as the explosion is reflected in his windshield...

163   EXT. ROOFTOP - NIGHT                                              163

      The blast kicks from the face of the building, fireball rising
      with eerie grace into the night sky, as:

      The FIGURE steps into frame, pockets the cell phone. CAMERA
      PIVOTS BEHIND him, losing Cantrell's building and bringing
      the other hotel into view -- the one with the lawyers...

164   EXT. NICK'S CAR - NIGHT                                           164

      Nick jumps out, stunned. He runs up the street toward the
      hotel as glass and debris rains onto the sidewalk...

165   INT. BALLROOM - NIGHT                                             165

      ...and the FIGURE bends down, picks something up. He hefts it
      onto his shoulder: a LAWS ROCKET-LAUNCHER. He flips up the
      sight, takes aim at the other hotel, fires...

      WHOOOSH -- the rocket streaks, leaving a contrail...

      FAST CUT: Judge Burch and those around her reacting as the
      glare of the rocket approaches in a heartbeat --

      WHAM! OUR SECOND EXPLOSION of the night takes out the ballroom,
      killing dozens, blowing flame and debris across the room...

      Nick sees it: the contrail, the second blast, all of it. It
      stops him dead in his tracks. Just overwhelmed.

      A 30-foot-high hand-painted domed ceiling above, an equally
      huge ROUND TABLE below -- an imposing room that says power.

      Nick is ushered in. A DOZEN OR MORE PEOPLE are seated -- top-
      echelon city brass -- political, fire, police.

      Also present are Davies and Dunnigan. (Dunnigan is not seated --
      he's getting his ass reamed today.)

The top dog: THE MAYOR. He's seething but not a screamer -- a
man who keeps it tightly reined:

                           MAYOR
             We're worldwide news this morning.
             Almost twenty dead, among them some
             of this country's top attorneys. I
             had friends in that room. Hell, I
             almost attended myself.

                           NICK
             The second explosion. I saw a rocket               *
             fired.                                             *
                    (to Davies and Dunnigan)
             Clyde does have somebody on the
             outside.

                           MAYOR                                *
             What you saw or think you saw is                   *
             beside the point. What matters is                  *
             that the FBI wanted to rendition                   *
             this man out of my city. The reason                *
             he's still here causing havoc is
             you. You wanted to prosecute this
             case. Your ambition kept him here                  *
             and provoked this tragedy.

                           DUNNIGAN
                    (mutters)
             ...not entirely fair...

                           MAYOR
             Detective. Your job is hanging by a
             thread. I'd think a man of your
             experience would know when to keep
             his mouth shut and his ass covered.

Dunnigan -- formidable though he is -- looks away, keeps his
mouth shut. The Mayor approaches Nick, looks him in the eye.

                   When I go in front of the cameras
                   today -- unlike some people who
                   seem unwilling to do so when asked --
                   I'm going to make goddamn sure the
                   media doesn't hang this abject
                   disaster around my neck. Why? Because
                   I'm hanging it on yours.
                          (beat)
                   You're done. Gone. Fired. Non-
                   existent. Get the fuck out.

      People going about their business.

      Nick exits, dazed, comes down the steps. He sits on a step,
      vacant -- a man completely at a loss and out of options.

      His CELL RINGS. He rouses himself, flips it open.

                   How'd you kill Jonas? I know about
                   the second explosion, I saw the
                   contrail, so I know you got somebody
                   working for you. But the first

             You own the vet, you own the dog.
             Explosive wasn't even that big.

             Hidden in plain sight. That's my

             out yet?

Nick sighs, rubs his eyes, can barely even speak.

                           CLYDE
             What's next for you? Mulling career
             options? I suppose law is out.

             I'm trying to get over my friend
             being dead. Aside from that, fuck
             you.

                           CLYDE
             Fair enough.
                    (beat)
             I'll miss you Nick. It was a good
             dance.

                           NICK
             Didn't bring your family back,
             though, did it?
                    (off Clyde's silence)
             Has it made you feel better? All
             this? You done making your point?

                           CLYDE
             Just warming up. This is Clausewitz
             shit, my friend. Total war.

CAMERA PUSHING IN on Nick, listening, as:

                           CLYDE
             I'm gonna pull the whole thing down.
             I will topple the gleaming pillars
             and drag the whole fucking diseased,
             corrupt temple down on my head.
                    (beat)
             Stay tuned. It'll be Biblical.

Click -- line goes dead. Nick sits staring at the phone...

      Nick enters, finds Sarah crying. A WALL-MOUNTED TV IS PLAYING
      A NEWS REPORT of the explosions -- file footage of Jonas
      Cantrell pops up. Nick drifts over, sits at her bedside, as:

                                 REPORTER
                   ...going live now to City Hall where
                   Mayor Tilden is about to make a
                   statement...announcing, we're told,
                   among other things, the dismissal
                   of District Attorney Nick Price...

      The IMAGE cuts to the Mayor stepping to the mic.

                                 MAYOR
                   Thank you all for gathering on this
                   solemn and anxious occasion...

      WHITE   -   9-7-8                                       103.

      Nick MUTES it. He and Sarah don't speak for long moments --
      he's waiting for her to pull herself together.

      She finally does, going into professional mode, pulling her
      laptop and files and reports around her.

                                 SARAH
                   We got the latest batch of background
                   in. Hansen and the other guy did
                   some good work here--

                                 NICK
                   Sarah. Give it a rest. It's over.
                   We're done.
                          (off her look)
                   I'm done. The mayor is nailing my
                   coffin shut. The best thing you can
                   do right now is distance yourself
                   from me as much as you can -- see
                   what you can salvage of your career.

      Sarah is staring at him with "fuck you" in her eyes. She picks
      up a multi-page list of addresses, hands it to him.

                                 SARAH
                   This lists over fifty shit-value
                   properties in industrial zones that
                   nobody in their right mind would
                   want to own -- stuff around chemical
                   plants, factories. All are owned by
                   Benson Clyde. Look at twenty-two.

      Nick, not caring, scans down to:

                                  NICK
                   "Joe's Lube-and-Drive Garage." Went
                   out of business in '94.
                          (looks up, irritated)
                   Now why would Joe's extinct Lube-
                   and-Shit Garage be of the slightest
                   possible fucking interest to you,
                   me, or anyone?

                                 SARAH
                          (tight, pissed)
                   The garage, not so much. But the
                   address. Look at the location.

      Nick looks down at the list again...staring...

175   EXT. JOE'S LUBE-AND-DRIVE GARAGE - DAY                           175

      A shitty garage in a shitty industrial park. Bordering it, on
      the other side of some fencing, are municipal train tracks.

      Nick's car pulls up. He gets out. It's a ghost town here.

      BLUE   -   9-19-08                                        104.

      He goes to the garage window -- glass thick with dirt. He
      wipes with his sleeve, but it doesn't help him see in.

      TIGHT ON ROLL-UP DOOR -- a CAR JACK jams in under the lip. We
      hear CRANKING and the door rises...

      Nick drops down, peering in. He squeezes under the door, stands
      up. Gloomy in here. He hits the door switch -- it RATTLES up       *
      on its tracks, flooding the place with light...                    *

      He looks around. Cobwebs. Dust. A CAR under a tarp on the
      hydraulic floor-lift. Old shelves and pallets of tools. Rust.
      Grime. The crap of ages.

      He sighs, turns and walks out...

177   EXT./INT. GARAGE - DAY                                            177

      ...and pauses. Something tickling his brain.

      Suddenly, a SHRIEKING COMMUTER TRAIN blasts by -- gone,
      dwindling. It was a bizarre, distinctive sound...like the one
      Nick heard during his last phone call with Clyde.

      Nick stands frozen, pieces in his head tumbling and threatening
      to fall into place. Something about the shape of that car
      under that tarp...

      He turns, staring at it. Goes back in, drawn to it -- it's
      long, distinctly old-school, with sharp boxy corners...

      He draws the tarp off -- finds a 1965 Lincoln Continental,
      midnight-blue, in excellent condition. The last time he saw
      it, it was parked in a carport at Benson Clyde's farmhouse.

      What's it doing here? More pieces falling into place. Nick
      leaves the garage again, walking out...

      CAMERA TRACKS HIM across the tarmac, and as we come around
      the corner of the building, we reveal:

      The County Correctional Annex is right there, a backwater
      corner of the prison not sixty feet away...

      Nick stares up at it -- a very curious location indeed.

      FAST CUTS: Nick searching...behind shelves...the toilet...in
      closets...the grimy little office...

      He stops. Looks at the car. There's a mechanic's pit below
      that hydraulic lift. He goes to the control, hits "up"...

      ANGLE FROM MECHANIC'S PIT

      Nick's face comes slowly into view as the hoist rises...

      IN BLACKNESS, WE HEAR: Boop-boop-boop...a cell being dialed.
      The line RINGING. A voice answering:

                   Look. No hard feelings, but there

                   I'll ask again. Do we finish this

      Poor Dunnigan looks tortured. He catches Garza's eye...

      The garage quiet in moonlight. The area deserted. Beat. The
      garage door rolls up on its tracks. Darkness within.

      A PAIR OF HEADLIGHTS kick on, blinding us. The Lincoln emerges,
      moves off into the night as the door rolls down again.

      We hear SOFT STATIC from a police radio, and a voice:

      BLUE   -   9-19-08                                      106.

                                 DUNNIGAN (O.S.)
                   All units. Subject vehicle is on
                   the move.

      ANGLE WIDENS to reveal we're in an UNMARKED CAR -- Dunnigan        *
      at the wheel, Nick beside him. Dunnigan's on the radio:

                                 DUNNIGAN
                   Everybody maintain distance.

      Dunnigan puts the car in gear, pulls out...

      FROM THIS POINT ON, WE'RE VERY MUCH IN MONTAGE STYLE (IT GOES
      WITHOUT SAYING THIS NEEDS THE RIGHT PIECE OF MUSIC):

181   EXT. AERIAL SHOT - NIGHT                                          181

      DRIFTING MAGICALLY THROUGH the downtown skyscrapers...neon-
      lit rooftops...city lights reflecting off glass buildings...

      AN FBI HELICOPTER drops into shot. CAMERA COMES AROUND, pacing,
      the copter's reflection in the buildings we're passing...

182   EXT. AERIAL SHOT LOOKING STRAIGHT DOWN - NIGHT                    182

      SKYSCRAPERS pass the lens below us...

      There's a midnight-blue Lincoln traveling the streets far
      below. It turns a corner, moving up a long boulevard. CAMERA
      PIVOTS around a skyscraper, following...

183   EXT. STREETS - VARIOUS ANGLES - NIGHT                             183

      The Lincoln cruising, cold reflections of street lamps kicking
      off sheet metal, flowing along its body and windshield...

      WE START ZOOMING AND RACKING FOCUS to the unmarked cars tailing
      it in traffic....visually, it becomes a surreal dance of
      headlights and traffic signals...

184   EXT. AERIAL SHOTS - VARIOUS ANGLES - NIGHT                        184

      A POLICE COPTER joins the FBI copter in the air...both cruising
      eerily against a kaleidoscopic wash of city lights...

                                 VOICE #1 (V.O.)
                   Maintain two thousand foot ceiling...

185   INT. DUNNIGAN'S CAR (MOVING) - NIGHT                              185

                                 VOICE #1 (V.O.)
                   Subject vehicle turning south off
                   of Hudson...into an alley...

                                 DUNNIGAN
                          (clicks hand-mic)
                   Hang back...hang back...

      WHITE   -   9-7-8                                          107.

186   EXT. ALLEY - NIGHT                                                186

      The Lincoln pulls to a loading door. The door rises...

187   INT. BUILDING - NIGHT                                             187

      ...and the Lincoln enters. It stops next to a LARGE CUBE VAN
      with the logo: "Nomos Custodial Services."

      CAMERA PUSHES IN as the car door opens, feet step out...

      TILT UP to Clyde dressed in a custodial services uniform. He
      slams the car door, gets in the van, fires up the engine...

188   EXT. AERIAL VIEW OF ALLEY - NIGHT                                 188

      Far below us, the van emerges from the same door, comes out
      of the alley and back onto the street...

                                 VOICE #2 (V.O.)
                   I got a white van...large cube
                   type...think he switched vehicles...
                   moving north again on Hudson...

189   INT. DUNNIGAN'S CAR - NIGHT                                       189

                                 DUNNIGAN
                   Five and six, stick with that
                   building in case he's trying to
                   cowboy us. All other units, stay
                   with the van...

      Dunnigan pulls out into traffic, resuming the tail...

                                 VOICE #3 (V.O.)
                   I have visual on van. Logo on side
                   reads "Nomos Custodial Services."

                                 NICK
                   Where the hell is he going?

190   EXT. CITY HALL - ESTABLISHING - NIGHT                             190

      The glorious old building looms above us. TILT DOWN to reveal
      a red carpet event brewing -- LIMOS AND LUXURY CARS pulling
      up, GUESTS in expensive attire getting out...

      The NOMOS VAN STEALS THE FRAME as it drives past and turns to
      go around the back of the building...

      A LIMO STEALS THE FRAME BACK as it pulls to the curb. The
      Mayor steps out, waving and smiling for FLASHING CAMERAS...

191   INT. DUNNIGAN'S CAR (MOVING) - NIGHT                              191

      Nick and Dunnigan drive past all the hoopla...

      BLUE   -   9-19-08                                       108.

                                 NICK
                   You don't suppose Nomos Custodial                    *
                   has a service contract with City
                   Hall, do you?

      Off Dunnigan's look of "oh shit"...

192   EXT. CITY HALL SERVICE ENTRANCE - NIGHT                         192

      TIGHT ON A CARD SCANNER as a card is swiped. THUNK -- the
      lock disengages. TILT UP to Clyde as he rolls a loaded
      custodial cart (with mops and trash barrel) inside...

193   INT. CITY HALL SERVICE AREA - NIGHT                             193

      A GUARD mans the security desk -- he glances up from a BANK
      OF LIVE-FEED VIDEO MONITORS as Clyde rolls his cart in.

                                 SECURITY GUARD
                   Mr. Nomos! Ain't seen you around.

                                 CLYDE
                   Ted...had to get that vacation in.
                   Visited my sister in the Keys...

                                 SECURITY GUARD
                   Nice. Good for you.

                                  CLYDE
                   Hey, what's all that hoopla at the
                   main entrance?

                                 SECURITY GUARD
                   Mayor's got a big fuckin' thing.
                   Thousand dollar a plate whatever.
                   They say the Governor might come.

                                 CLYDE
                          (moving on)
                   I'll stay out of their way.

                                 SECURITY GUARD
                          (calls after him)
                   They're up on six, avoid that floor.
                   They got more security than God...

194   EXT. AERIAL SHOT LOOKING STRAIGHT DOWN - NIGHT                  194

      Far below: The entrance lit up with arriving cars and guests,
      CAMERAS FLASHING...

      A HELICOPTER DRIFTS through the shot just below us in SLOW-
      MOTION, rotors thrumming eerily...

195   INT. SERVICE ELEVATOR - NIGHT                                   195

      ...while Clyde rides up. He stops at five, gets out...

      BLUE   -   9-19-08                                         109.

196   INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT                                              196

      ...and rolls his cart up the hallway. MUFFLED MUSIC from the
      floor above. He comes to a door, sorts his keys...

197   INT. EMPTY COURTROOM - NIGHT                                      197

      ...and enters in darkness. Moving swiftly, he reaches into
      his trash barrel, pulls a gleaming STEEL BRIEFCASE from under
      the shredded papers -- he strides to the judge's dais, lays
      the case atop it, turns and heads back to his cart...

198   INT. SERVICE AREA SECURITY DESK - NIGHT                           198

      ...as a STREAM OF TACTICAL COPS stampede into the building
      and up the stairs. ANGLE FINDS Nick, Dunnigan, and Davies
      looming over the nervous security guard:

                                 DUNNIGAN
                   What floor?

                                 SECURITY GUARD
                   I told him to avoid six...
                          (checking monitors)
                   There...

      On a monitor: Clyde rolls his cart from the courtroom...

                                 SECURITY GUARD
                   That's the main courtroom on five.                     *

                                 NICK
                   That's right below the ballroom.
                   The Mayor's event.

199   INT. 6TH FLOOR HALLWAY AND BALLROOM - NIGHT                       199

      Early arrivals are coming up, entering the ballroom. The place     *
      is crawling with SECRET-SERVICE TYPES in suits.                    *

200   INT. 5TH FLOOR HALLWAY - NIGHT                                    200*

      Clyde comes down the hallway B.G., rolling his cart...

      F.G., ANGLE FINDS tactical cops with machine guns pouring
      quietly up the stairs, taking up positions just around the
      corners, poised and tense. TIGHTEN IN as the TAC LEADER uses
      a small mirror to peek around the corner and spot Clyde:

                                 TAC LEADER
                          (whispering on headset)
                   Subject in sight. Do we take him?

      BLUE   -   9-19-08                                      110.

201   INT. ANOTHER STAIRCASE - NIGHT                                   201*

      Nick, Dunnigan and others are racing up the steps. Dunnigan       *
      raises his radio to say yes, but:

                                 NICK
                   No. Let him go.
                          (off Dunnigan's look)
                   We know where to find him. Let's
                   get to that courtroom.

      Dunnigan hesitates -- against every instinct in his body.

                                 DUNNIGAN
                   I hope you know what the fuck you're
                   doing.
                          (clicks mic)
                   Negative. We're letting him go. All
                   units hang back. Repeat. We are
                   letting the subject go.

202   INT. 5TH FLOOR HALLWAY - NIGHT                                   202

      The cops trade surprised glances. The elevator DINGS. Clyde
      gets on, the doors close. The cops swarm up the hallway...

203   INT. COURTROOM - NIGHT                                           203

      This all happens fast: Bang -- the doors slam open. Nick leads
      a huge phalanx of cops and FBI in, weapons and flashlight
      beams stabbing in all directions.

                                   NICK
                   There.

      They race to the judge's dais -- the steel case.

                                 DAVIES
                   Don't touch it! Could be motion
                   sensitive!

      Davies shoves his way to the front, grabs a small hand-held
      drill from one of his guys' tactical vests:

                                   DAVIES
                   I need light!

      Dozens of beams converge. Davies places the drill, goes to
      work on the case...grind, grind...

                                 VOICE #4 (V.O.)
                   I have visual...suspect leaving the                   *
                   building...different service exit...

204   EXT. CITY HALL - NIGHT                                           204

      Clyde exits a loading dock, gets in his van...

      BLUE   -   9-19-08                                       111.

205   INT. COURTROOM - NIGHT                                          205

      ...grind, grind...the drill taps through. Davies yanks it,
      feeds a fiber-optic tube into the hole, puts his eye to the
      eyepiece. He swivels the tube carefully, peering inside...

                                 DAVIES                                 *
                   Crap.                                                *
                          (glances up)                                  *
                   Explosives. Nasty ones.                              *

                                 DUNNIGAN
                   What? C-4?                                           *

      Davies takes his eye from the eyepiece, looks at them.

                                 DAVIES
                   C-4 is for girl scouts. This is
                   malglinite. Take out the whole floor
                   above us...maybe this entire corner
                   of the building...

                                 NICK
                   Can you open it? Disarm it?

                                 DAVIES
                          (back to eyepiece)
                   No, we got tripwires. We open this
                   lid, instant karma's gonna get us.
                          (keeps scanning)
                   Don't see a motion sensor. Trigger
                   looks simple...dial a cell phone,
                   incoming call arms the trigger --
                   trigger's set to count down from
                   forty seconds, then boom.
                          (off their looks)
                   That call comes in, we have forty
                   seconds to get as far away from
                   this thing as possible.

                                 DUNNIGAN
                          (to his men)
                   Alert the mayor's security team.                     *
                   Evacuate those people upstairs --                    *
                   clear that ballroom, go!

                                 NICK
                   No!

      Dunnigan turns on him, instant shouting match:

                                 DUNNIGAN
                   No? What the fuck are you talking
                   about, this could go off any second!

      WHITE   -   9-7-8                                         112.

                                 NICK
                   He won't set it off until that room
                   is full! People are still arriving,
                   red carpet shit, that's at least
                   another half hour!

                                 DUNNIGAN
                   I will not take that risk!

                                  NICK
                   You have to!

      Beat. Nick, no longer shouting, but intense and fast:

                                 NICK
                   If I'm him, I've rigged cameras in
                   that ballroom -- live video feed --
                   first sign of an evacuation, I

                          (off their looks)
                   We have to think ahead of this fuck!

      Pause. Looks traded.

                                  DAVIES
                   I'm open.

                                 DUNNIGAN
                   Okay, Nick. What's the move?

206   INT. LINCOLN/NOMOS CUSTODIAL - NIGHT                             206

      Clyde slams the van door, gets in the Lincoln. He pulls a
      handheld CLAMSHELL VIDEO MONITOR -- it shows a LIVE FEED of
      people entering the ballroom, mingling as they arrive...

      Clyde smiles, starts the engine...

207   INT. CITY HALL BALLROOM - NIGHT                                  207

      The Mayor enters, waving to everybody, shaking hands...

208   INT. JOE'S LUBE-AND-DRIVE GARAGE - NIGHT                         208

      The garage door rises. The Lincoln backs in, stops on the
      hydraulic lift. Clyde gets out, throws the tarp over it.

      Briefly checks his clamshell. Still plenty of time...

      He raises the lift a few feet, drops down and crawls under
      the car into:

209   THE MECHANIC'S PIT                                               209

      Duplicate controls. He hits the button and the car sinks down
      atop us, settling to the floor, sealing us into darkness.

      WHITE   -   9-7-8                                         113.

      Beat. A BRIGHT LIGHT turns on -- one of those gazillion
      candlepower flashlights. Clyde aims it and we see:

      A TUNNEL hewn into the wall of the mechanic's pit. Just large
      enough for Clyde to crawl into. He does...

210   INT. TUNNEL - NIGHT                                              210

      Hand-dug, rough dirt held up by two-by-four bracing. A wheeled
      platform is the transport -- Clyde's on his back, pulling
      himself along by an overhead rope, hand over hand...

211   INT. UNDER THE PRISON - NIGHT                                    211

      Clyde emerges in the suffocating darkness of a sub-basement
      laid into a foundation that dates back to the Civil War. He
      crawls free, shining his light as rats scurry in shadows...

      He's on his hands and knees at first because the ceiling's so
      low. He's finally able to rise, moving along at a crouch...

      ...and emerging into a proper sub-tunnel. Now able to walk
      normally, he navigates the tunnels and comes to:

212   INT. CLYDE'S STAGING AREA - NIGHT                                212

      We're just below the solitary wing. Clyde has it rigged with
      all his needs: computer, spare cell phones, various kinds of
      clothing, even a shelf lined with snacks.

      He quickly shrugs off his custodian's outfit, revealing his
      prison jumpsuit beneath. He gazes up a welded steel ladder
      (identical to four others in a row -- one for each cell).

      He checks his clamshell one last time, tweaking the bad
      reception with a relay -- ballroom looks full. He clicks off
      his lamp and clamshell, sets them on a shelf...

      He goes up the ladder to a hatch in the ceiling...

213   INT. CLYDE'S CELL - NIGHT                                        213

      ...and enters through a swiveling portal concealed behind the
      toilet. In deep darkness now, he pulls his cell phone, starts
      inputting a number -- boop...boop...boop...

      And he freezes. Realizing...

      There's somebody in there with him...a silhouette sitting on
      the floor by the door. The figure reaches out, pushes open
      the outer door a bit. Faint light spills in, revealing:

                                 NICK
                   I came to talk. Guess who wasn't in
                   his cell? Imagine my surprise.

BLUE   -   9-19-08                                      114.

                             CLYDE
             Imagine mine.

                           NICK
             Beautiful how you played us. Getting
             yourself tossed into solitary --                  *
             pre-rigged with exits from all five               *
             cells. Whichever one we put you in,
             you had your bases covered.
                    (faint smile)
             I thought I was such a bad-ass
             putting you down here. Turns out I
             was doing what you wanted.

                           CLYDE
             That's how you play. Make the other
             guy think it's his idea.
                    (beat)
             You came to talk, so talk.

                           NICK
             Been thinking. If I'd done things
             differently -- made different
             decisions from the start -- we
             wouldn't have gotten to this point.

                           CLYDE
             But it happened. And here we are.

                           NICK
             Here we are.
                    (beat)
             Your decisions put us here too.
             This mess is on both of us.                       *

                           CLYDE
             You want to hold hands? What's your
             point?

                           NICK
             We can't change decisions we've
             made. We can only account for
             decisions we make from here. I know
             what mine will be.
                    (beat)
             What about you? You gonna finish
             dialing that number, or what?

Clyde hesitating, thumb hovering over the number pad.

                           CLYDE
             If I don't? What are you offering?

                           NICK
             You looking to deal?

BLUE   -     9-19-08                                       115.

                             CLYDE
               I'm willing to listen.

                             NICK
               Okay, here's the deal. The deal
               is...there is no deal.
                      (off Clyde's look)
               I told you. No more deals with
               murderers. I'm sticking to that.
               That's my decision. It's what you                  *
               taught me. Strange as it sounds,                   *
               I'm grateful for the lesson.                       *

Nick rises, steps out -- pauses, turns back.

                             NICK
               Your turn. You make the right
               decision, I'll see what I can do
               for you. But the wrong decision is
               one you'll have to live with the
               rest of your life.

The moment stretches. Clyde poised -- all down to this. In        *
the end, he can't help himself: Boop-boop-boop -- hits send.      *

                             CLYDE
               I'm sorry.

                             NICK
               Me too...

Nick pushes the barred door shut...

                             NICK
               ...because like I said, it's a
               decision you'll have to live with
               the rest of your life. Which at
               this point I figure is...
                      (glances at watch)
               ...another 35 seconds.

...and turns the key in the lock -- klatch.

                             NICK
               Check mate.

Clyde hears a SOUND...like a phone ringing -- sort of close
but not -- muffled -- like the sound Cantrell heard...

Clyde, realization dawning, thrusts his hand out and jerks
the cot blanket up, revealing:

The steel briefcase under his cot. He glances up to see:

Nick gone.

Clyde scrambles to his portal, yanks on the handle...

      BLUE   -   9-19-08                                       116.

214   CLYDE'S STAGING AREA (UNDER THE CELLS)                           214

      ANGLE ON: The hatch handle rattles -- now padlocked shut.

215   INT. JOE'S GARAGE/MECHANIC'S PIT - NIGHT                         215

      FAST CUT: Dunnigan thrusts himself out of the tunnel, cops
      grabbing his arms, pulling him free...

216   INT. SOLITARY WING - NIGHT                                       216

      Nick comes through the sally-port at a fast stride, through
      another door, goes up the steps...

217   INT. CLYDE'S CELL - NIGHT                                        217

      Clyde wheels around, frantic as a caged tiger -- he lunges to
      the door, rattling the bars...

218   QUICK ANGLES                                                     218

      ...while Nick pounds faster and faster up staircase after
      staircase...

219   INT. CLYDE'S CELL - NIGHT                                        219

      Clyde -- enraged, bellowing -- picking up the steel briefcase,
      swinging it hard against the bars, trying to batter through...

      And then stopping. A self-awareness returning. Perhaps it's
      the Clyde that's been missing for years -- the sane one.

      Pause. He sets the briefcase down. Stands a moment.

      He sits down on the briefcase. Calm now. Pulls a SMALL PHOTO
      from his breast pocket. Gazes at it.

      It's his wife and daughter. He stares at them a while.

      Tucks the photo back in his pocket. Nods.

                                     CLYDE
                      Well played.

      BOOOOM! The DETONATION is staggering, instantly vaporizing        *
      Clyde and the cell he's in...

220   SOLITARY WING                                                    220

      ...BLOWING the bars right out of the stone on a WALL OF FLAME
      that overwhelms the lens...

221   FAST CUTS: CORRIDORS AND STAIRCASES                              221

222   EXT. PRISON COURTYARD - NIGHT                                     222

      ...and BLASTING TONS OF BRICK AND MORTAR skyward.

      Nick enters the shot as WE DOLLY BACK WITH HIM, walking away
      from the building going to dust and rubble B.G.

      CAMERA PANS HIM AROUND, now following him, as he approaches
      Davies standing with Iger. Iger is staring, agog:

                                   IGER
                   Jesus.                                                 *

                   Thank God that wing was empty.                         *

      A car arriving behind them: Dunnigan getting out, approaching.     *

                                 IGER
                   How do I explain this to the city?

                                 DUNNIGAN
                   I think the Mayor will have your
                   back.

      Nick approaches, comes abreast of them.

      Looks are traded with Dunnigan and Davies. Relief. Fellowship.
      A touch of sadness. Words aren't needed here.

      Nick keeps walking, pulls his cell phone, starts dialing.

      Dunnigan smiles. He knows exactly where Nick's going...

223   INT. TRAIN STATION PLATFORM - DAY                                 223

      LONG LENS: Nick sitting...waiting...

      An ARRIVING TRAIN moves massively into the shot, pulling into
      the station...

      Nick rises. A SQUEAL OF BRAKES, steel on steel...

      Nick engulfed in a crowd of arriving passengers, people getting
      off, swirling and jostling all around him, wiping frame...

      ...only two faces he wants to see...

      ...and there they are...

      He sweeps his family into his arms. The final moments of this
      movie are all about faces and joy...

          Le ciel gris du jour qui va bientôt se coucher, au-dessus de la
          cour de l'usine de matériel de Travaux Publics de Fernand Naudin à
          Montauban. Une pelleteuse à chenilles sort lentement d'un hangar,
          avec le godet en position haute. Derrière la pelleteuse apparaît
          Monsieur Fernand Naudin, le directeur de l'usine, en grande
          discussion avec un ouvrier. Il porte un costume gris très élégant
          avec chemise et cravate, et un manteau noir, lui aussi très
          élégant.
                         
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           C'est quand même pas la première fois, non ?
                         
                          PREMIER OUVRIER
           Je dis pas que c'est la première fois que vous montez à
           Paris, Monsieur Fernand, je dis que ça tombe mal. Si le
           vent est frisquet, vous avez une couverture à l'arrière et
           Germaine a mis du thé dans le thermos.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Et pourquoi pas de la quinine et un passe-montagne ? On
           croirait vraiment que je pars au Tibet.
                         
          Il s'approche de sa voiture, une Peugeot 404 noire, qu'un autre
          ouvrier vient d'amener dans la cour. Pendant qu'il enlève son
          manteau pour être plus à l'aise pour conduire, le premier ouvrier
          se précipite vers la voiture. Le deuxième ouvrier sort de la
          voiture.
                         
                          DEUXIÈME OUVRIER
           Au revoir, Monsieur Naudin.

           Au revoir, Gustave.
                         
          Il s'installe au volant.

          Fernand a fermé sa portière et il allume une cigarette. Le premier
          ouvrier se penche vers la vitre ouverte.

           même pas besoin de moi pour aligner dix tracteurs dans un
           stand, non ? Hein ?... Tachez plutôt qu'elle tombe pas en
           panne comme la dernière fois.

          Sur l'image, apparaît le générique en lettres blanches.
                         
          Le générique continue sur un plan rapproché du pare-brise de la
          voiture, avec Fernand au volant.
                         
          VOITURE FERNAND - INTÉRIEUR NUIT
                         
          Nous sommes maintenant à l'intérieur de la voiture, derrière le
          conducteur. Les maisons d'une bourgade endormie défilent derrière
          le pare-brise.
                         
          Le générique continue.
          ROUTE - EXTÉRIEUR NUIT
                         
          Retour sur le plan rapproché du pare-brise, avec la suite du
          générique.
                         
          Gros plan sur un feu clignotant de la voiture, sur lequel le
          générique continue.
                         
          L'arrière d'un « cube » Citroën, éclairé par les phares de la
          voiture de Fernand. Suite du générique.
                         
          Retour sur le feu clignotant. Suite du générique.
                         
          Le « cube » Citroën est doublé par Fernand. Suite du générique.
                         
          PARIS - CHAMPS-ÉLYSÉES - EXTÉRIEUR NUIT
                         
          Les Champs-Élysées déserts et éclairés par les lampadaires de
          chaque côté de l'avenue, avec l'Arc de Triomphe en face de nous.
          Suite du générique.
                         
          La voiture de Fernand avance vers nous, venant de la Place de
          l'Étoile. La caméra la suit. Le clignotant droit clignote. La
          voiture se range le long du trottoir. Suite du générique.
                         
          Plan rapproché sur Fernand, vu à travers la vitre de la portière.
          Il serre son frein à main, puis sort un papier de sa poche.
                         
          Fin du générique.
                         
          VOITURE FERNAND - INTÉRIEUR NUIT
                         
          Gros plan sur la papier, posé sur le volant : il s'agit d'un
          télégramme, sur lequel est inscrit : « Louis de retour. Stop.
          Présence indispensable. Stop. Snack 11 Champs Élysées. Stop.
          Urgent. Henri »
                         
           MONSIEUR FERNAND (voix off)
           « Louis de retour - présence indispensable »... Présence
           indispensable ! Après quinze ans de silence, y en a qui
           poussent un peu quand même.
                         
          Fernand replie le télégramme et le range dans sa poche. Il a le
          visage un peu fermé. On continue à entendre ses pensées.
                         
           MONSIEUR FERNAND (voix off)
           Quinze ans d'interdiction de séjour. Pour qu'il abandonne
           ses cactus et qu'il revienne à Paris, faut qu'il lui en
           arrive une sévère au vieux Louis, ou qu'il ait besoin de
           pognon, ou qu'il soit tombé dans une béchamel infernale.
                         
          Fernand ouvre sa portière et sort de sa voiture.
                         
          BOWLING - INTÉRIEUR NUIT
                         
          Fernand monte un escalier au décor assez neutre. On entend les
          bruits d'une salle de bowling.
                         
          Fernand arrive sur le palier et pénètre dans la grande salle de
          bowling. L'endroit est désert à cette heure très matinale. Un
          homme, en chemise à carreaux, est assis sur une chaise au fond de
          la salle. Fernand se dirige vers lui. L'homme se retourne en
          entendant les pas de Fernand.
                         
          L'homme, assis près des pistes de bowling, où un seul client est
          en train de jouer, se lève et se dirige vers Fernand en souriant.
          Il s'agit d'Henri, le patron du bowling. Les deux hommes se
          serrent la main. On aperçoit, derrière Henri, un autre homme
          chauve, en costume gris, assis à la table que vient de quitter
          Henri, et sur laquelle est étalé un tapis de feutrine, et sur le
          tapis, des cartes à jouer. Il s'agit de Raoul Volfoni. Il bat
          lentement les cartes
                         
                          HENRI
           Eh bien ma vieille, tu nous fais attendre, la route a pas
           été trop toc ?
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Ben, suffisamment.
                         
                          HENRI
           Ça fait plaisir de te revoir, le Mexicain commençait à
           avoir des impatiences.
                         
          Fernand donne une petite tape amicale sur la nuque d'Henri.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Ah, parce qu'il est revenu, c'est pas un char.
                         
                          HENRI
           Oh ben, je me serais pas permis.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Avoue que ça fait quand même une surprise, non ?
                         
                          HENRI
           Les surprises, t'es peut être pas au bout... Viens !
                         
          Il entraîne Fernand vers la sortie de la salle de bowling. Raoul
          les suit des yeux, la cigarette au bec, tout en continuant à
          battre ses cartes, mais il ne bouge pas de sa chaise.
                         
          PALIER D'IMMEUBLE - INTERIEUR NUIT
                         
          Palier d'un immeuble visiblement assez cossu.
                         
          Henri sort de l'ascenseur, suivi de Fernand. Il se dirige vers une
          double porte en bois, et appuie sur le bouton de la sonnette. La
          porte s'ouvre sur un homme en chemise blanche et cravate, la
          cigarette au bec. Il porte un holster, garni d'un pistolet. Il
          s'agit de Pascal, le garde du corps de Louis le Mexicain. Pascal
          regarde Fernand, le visage assez neutre.
                         
                          HENRI
           C'est Fernand !
                         
          Pascal hoche la tête et pénètre dans l'appartement. Henri et
          Fernand le suivent.
                         
          APPARTEMENT DU MEXICAIN - ENTRÉE - INTÉRIEUR NUIT
          Fernand referme la porte d'entrée. Une grande plante verte et des
          petits tableaux au mur. Une porte est ouverte sur une chambre.
          Pascal est dans la chambre, debout près de la porte, la main sur
          la poignée. Il fait un signe de tête vers l'entrée.
                         
                          PASCAL
           Monsieur Fernand est là !
                         
          APPARTEMENT DU MEXICAIN - CHAMBRE - INTÉRIEUR NUIT
                         
          Louis le Mexicain, en pyjama, est allongé sur le ventre sur son
          lit. On ne voit que son visage, mais on voit, par contre, le reste
          de la pièce, reflété dans la grande glace, qui couvre tout le mur
          derrière la tête du lit. En gros plan, au premier plan, une grosse
          seringue, que l'on est en train de remplir
                         
                          LOUIS
           Oui, qu'il entre, qu'il entre !
                         
          Dans la glace, on voit Pascal qui fait signe à Henri et Fernand
          d'entrer dans la pièce.
                          LOUIS
           Et ben, c'est pas trop tôt, je croyais que t'arriverais
           jamais... ou bien que t'arriverais trop tard.
                         
          Dans la glace, on voit Fernand s'approcher du lit. Henri reste en
          retrait près de la porte, que Pascal referme derrière lui avant de
          sortir de la pièce. La seringue disparaît du champ.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Tu sais, neuf cents bornes, faut quand même les tailler,
           hein.
                         
          Derrière Fernand, on voit passer le porteur de la seringue, un
          médecin apparemment, qui se dirige de l'autre côté du lit.
                         
                          LOUIS
           Ça fait quand même plaisir de te revoir, vieux voyou !
                         
          Dans la glace, on voit le sommet du crâne du médecin apparaître
          au-dessus de la tête capitonnée du lit.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           A moi aussi...
                         
          Fernand semble un peu gêné par le spectacle du médecin en train de
          piquer les fesses de Louis. Il détourne légèrement la tête.
                         
                          LOUIS
           Et j'ai eu souvent peur de clamser là-bas au milieu des
           macaques sans avoir jamais revu une tronche amie...
                         
          Louis fait une grimace et serre les dents, au moment où le médecin
          lui pique les fesses.
                         
                          LOUIS
           ... et c'est surtout à la tienne que je pensais.
          Fernand se dirige vers Henri, qui s'est assis dans un fauteuil,
          les bras croisés.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Tu sais, moi aussi, c'est pas l'envie qui me manquait
           d'aller te voir, mais on fait pas toujours ce qu'on veut,
           hein ?
                         
          Fernand enlève son manteau et le pose sur un autre fauteuil.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Et toi ? J'ai pas entendu dire que le gouvernement t'avait
           rappelé. Qu'est ce qui t'a pris de revenir ?
                         
          Il s'assoit sur une chaise, près du lit.
                         
          Dans son lit, Louis, maintenant allongé sur le dos, serre la main
          du médecin.
                         
                          LOUIS
           Merci toubib, merci pour tout.
          Le médecin borde un peu le lit avant de s'éloigner.
                         
                          LOUIS
           Henri, dis-leur de monter...
                         
          Le médecin récupère sa sacoche, posée sur un meuble. Fernand, dont
          la chaise est juste à côté de ce meuble, se lève et recule sa
          chaise, pour permettre au médecin d'être plus à son aise.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Pardon.
                         
          Henri se lève de son fauteuil. Le médecin referme sa sacoche et se
          dirige vers la porte. Fernand rapproche sa chaise du lit.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Tu crois pas qu'il vaut mieux quand même...
                         
                          LOUIS
           Me coupe pas, sans quoi on aura plus le temps.
                         
          Le médecin ouvre la porte, suivi par Henri.
                         
                          LOUIS
           Henri, fais tomber cent sacs au toubib !
                         
          Le médecin, avant de sortir, fait un petit signe de tête à Louis
          pour le remercier. Henri ferme la porte derrière eux.
                         
          Fernand est maintenant assis sur sa chaise, tout près du lit de
          Louis.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Bon alors ? Qu'est ce qui se passe, Louis ?
                         
          Louis parle lentement, avec une certaine fatigue dans la voix.
                         
                          LOUIS
           Je suis revenu pour caner ici et pour me faire enterrer à
           Pantin avec mes viocs. Les Amériques, c'est chouette pour
           prendre du carbure, on peut y vivre aussi à la rigueur,
           mais question de laisser ses os, hein... y a que la France.
                         
          Fernand allume une cigarette.
                         
                          LOUIS
           Et je décambute bêtement, et je laisse une mouchette à la
           traîne, Patricia, c'est d'elle que je voudrais que tu
           t'occupes.
                         
          Fernand a l'air surpris par la dernière phrase de son ami.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Et ben dis donc, t'en as de bonnes toi !
                         
                          LOUIS
           T'as connu sa mère, Suzanne « beau sourire » ?
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           T'es marrant, dis donc, c'est plutôt toi qui l'a connue.
                          LOUIS
           Au point de vue oseille, je te laisse de quoi faire ce
           qu'il faut pour la petite. J'ai des affaires qui tournent
           toutes seules. Maître Folace, mon notaire, t'expliquera.
           Bah, tu sais combien ça laisse une roulette, soixante pour
           cent de velours.
                         
          Fernand se lève.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Et sur le plan des emmerdements, trente-six fois la mise,
           hein ?
                         
          Il se dirige vers une petite table basse pour récupérer un
          cendrier.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Ah, écoute Louis, ta môme, tes affaires, tout ça c'est bien
           gentil mais... Moi aussi, j'ai mes affaires, tu comprends ?
           Et les miennes en plus, elles sont légales.
                         
          Fernand s'est rassis sur sa chaise.
                         
                          LOUIS
           Ouais, j'ai compris, les potes, c'est quand tout va bien.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Ça va pas toi, dis ? Hein ? J'ai pas dis ça, hein !
                         
          Fernand a haussé le ton.
                         
                          LOUIS
           Non, non, t'as pas dis ça, t'as pas dis ça, mais... tu
           livrerais ma petite Patricia aux vautours. Oh, mon petit
           ange...
                         
          La voix de Louis se fait pleurnicharde.
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Ton petit ange, ton petit ange, hein ?
                         
          Fernand se lève et marche de long en large dans la pièce.
                         
                          LOUIS
           Oui, oh, maintenant que t'es dans « l'honnête », tu peux
           pas savoir le nombre de malfaisants qu'il existe, le monde
           en est plein. Ils vont me la mettre sur la paille, ma
           petite fille. On va la dépouiller et on va tout lui
           prendre. Je l'avais faite élever chez les soeurs, apprendre
           l'anglais enfin... tout. Résultat : elle finira au tapin,
           et ce sera de ta faute. Hein, t'entends ? Ce sera de ta
           faute.
                         
          La voix de Louis est de plus en plus pleurnicharde, presque
          geignarde à la fin.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Écoute, arrête un peu, hein ? Depuis plus de vingt piges
           que je te connais, je te l'ai vu faire cent fois ton
           guignol, alors hein ? Et à propos de tout, de cigarettes,
           de came, de nanas, la jérémiade, ça toujours été ton truc à
           toi. Et une fois je t'ai même vu chialer, alors tu vas pas
           me servir ça à moi, non ?
                         
          Fernand s'est énervé au fur et à mesure qu'il parlait, et il
          termine presque en colère.
                         
                          LOUIS
           Si ! Ben, tu te rends pas compte, saligaud, qu'elle va
           perdre son père, Patricia, que je vais mourir ?
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Je te connais, t'en est capable. Voilà dix ans que t'es
           barré, tu reviens et je laisse tout tomber pour te voir et
           c'est pour entendre ça ? Et moi comme une pomme...
                         
          On frappe à la porte. Fernand s'arrête net de parler et se tourne
          vers la porte.
                         
          Louis a soudain l'air un peu inquiet. On frappe de nouveau, mais
          d'une façon un peu codé. Louis plonge les deux mains sous ses
          draps, puis il fait un signe d'acquiescement à Fernand.
                         
          Fernand se tourne vers la porte.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Entrez !
                         
          La porte s'ouvre. Pascal, le veston sur l'épaule, entre le
          premier, suivi d'Henri, puis de Raoul Volfoni, que nous avons déjà
          vu dans la salle de bowling. Derrière, entre un homme au type un
          peu allemand et au regard inquiétant. Il s'agit de Théo, qui est
          suivi de son « ami », car Théo est homosexuel. Paul Volfoni, le
          frère de Raoul, ferme la marche.
                         
          Fernand regarde les nouveaux arrivants d'un oeil interrogateur, et
          pas vraiment aimable. Il s'assoit sur une commode.
          Ils se rapprochent tous du lit de Louis, qui a toujours les mains
          sous ses draps. Louis tourne la tête vers Théo.
                         
                          LOUIS
           Ben dis donc, Théo, t'aurais pu monter tout seul ?
                         
                          THÉO
           Si sa présence doit vous donner de la fièvre...
                         
                          LOUIS
           Oui, chez moi, quand les hommes parlent, les gonzesses se
           taillent.
                         
          L'ami de Théo se penche vers lui.
                         
           L'AMI DE THÉO (chuchotant)
           Je t'attends en bas.
                         
                          THÉO (CHUCHOTANT)
           A tout de suite...
          L'ami se dirige vers la porte et sort, sous le regard de Pascal,
          qui monte la garde près de la porte. Il a remis sa veste, mais sa
          main est posé, à travers la veste, sur son arme.
                         
          Louis est assis dans son lit, calé sur ses oreillers, les mains
          toujours glissé sous les draps. Dans le miroir derrière lui, on
          peut voir tous ses « visiteurs », alignés au pied du lit.
                         
                          LOUIS
           Voilà... je serai bref. Je viens de céder mes parts à
           Fernand ici présent. C'est lui qui me succède.
                         
          Dans le miroir, on voit Fernand qui a un petit mouvement de
          surprise.
                         
          Raoul se rapproche du lit.
                         
                          RAOUL VOLFONI
           Mais... tu m'avais promis de m'en parler en premier !
                         
          Retour sur Louis allongé dans son lit.
                         
                          LOUIS
           Exact ! J'aurais pu aussi organiser un référendum, mais
           j'ai préféré faire comme ça. Pas d'objections ? Parce que
           moi, j'ai rien d'autre à dire.
                         
          Les frères Volfoni se regardent. On sent Raoul près à émettre une
          « objection », mais il croise le regard, et surtout le sourire
          narquois, de Pascal, planté près de la porte, et il comprend que
          son « objection » sera mal reçue !
                         
          Retour sur Louis sur son lit.
                         
                          LOUIS
           Je crois que tout est en ordre... Non ?...
                         
          Raoul sort le premier, suivi de son frère et de Théo.
          Henri tape sur l'épaule de Fernand, qui semble avoir quand même un
          peu de mal à digérer la décision inattendue de Louis.
                         
          Henri sort de la pièce, suivi de Pascal, qui lui sourit.
                         
          Gros plans sur le visage de Louis, couché sur ses oreillers. Il
          semble soudain très mal en point. Il chuchote :
                         
                          LOUIS
           Pascal... Pascal...
                         
          Fernand, perdu dans ses pensées, se redresse, le visage inquiet.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Oh Louis !...
                         
          Il se rapproche du lit, et secoue son ami.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Ben Louis ? Louis, quoi merde !... Louis...
          Il se tourne vers la porte et appelle :
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Pascal !...
                         
          Pascal entre dans la chambre, et, voyant la scène, ferme la porte
          et se précipite vers le lit.
                         
          Louis a la voix très affaiblie.
                         
                          LOUIS
           Je ne vais plus pourvoir tenir longtemps.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Déconne pas, Louis !
                         
                          LOUIS
           Tu sais de quoi je parle.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Tu veux pas que je t'ouvre la fenêtre un petit peu ? Hein ?
           Merde !...
                         
          Il se dirige vers la fenêtre, Pascal reste près du lit.
                         
          Fernand tire les rideaux. Le jour commence à poindre.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Tu vois ?... Regarde, il fait jour.
                         
          Pascal a posé sa main sur le front de Louis.
                         
                          LOUIS
           Ouais... D'ici... On voit que le ciel ! Mais je m'en fous
           du ciel...
                         
          Pascal ouvre les draps pour prendre le pistolet que Louis tient
          toujours serré dans sa main. Il le pose sur la couverture.
                          LOUIS
           J'y serai dans peu de temps.
                         
          Pascal récupère le pistolet serré dans l'autre main de Louis.
                         
                          LOUIS
           Non, ce qui m'intéresse... C'est la rue.
                         
          Pascal remet le drap en place sur le torse de Louis.
                         
          Gros plan sur le visage en sueur de Louis.
                         
                          LOUIS
           Et ils m'ont filé directement de l'avion dans
           l'ambulance... J'ai rien pu voir. Dis donc, ça a dû
           drôlement changer, hein ?
                         
          Pascal a remis sa main sur le front de Louis.
                         
          Fernand est devant la fenêtre, mais lui tourne le dos.
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Tu sais, pas... pas tellement quoi !
                         
          Retour sur le gros plan du visage de Louis. La main de Pascal est
          toujours sur son front et l'autre main masse la poitrine de Louis,
          dont, la voix est de plus en plus faible.
                         
                          LOUIS
           Raconte quand même !
                         
          Fernand tourne légèrement la tête vers la fenêtre, mais ne regarde
          pas vraiment la rue, et invente en fait ce qu'il raconte. Il a
          l'air assez ému.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Et ben... C'est un petit matin comme tu les aimes... Comme
           on les aimait quoi...
                         
          PARIS - CHAMPS-ÉLYSÉES - EXTÉRIEUR AUBE
                         
          Le jour se lève à peine sur les Champs, qui sont encore déserts.
          Mais les lampadaires sont déjà éteints.
                         
           MONSIEUR FERNAND (voix off)
           Les filles sortent du Lido, tiens ! Pareil qu'avant. Tu te
           souviens ? C'est à cette heure-là qu'on emballait.

          BOWLING - INTÉRIEUR JOUR
                         
          Fernand est debout devant le guichet de réception. Il a son
          manteau sur le bras. Derrière lui, Théo, dans une alcôve réservé
          au téléphone public, termine une conversation téléphonique et
          tient toujours le combiné dans sa main. Son ami est appuyé sur la
          cloison de l'alcôve.
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Si un jour on m'avait dit qu'il mourrait dans son lit
           celui-là !
                         
          Théo jongle avec le combiné et le raccroche.

           ein Blitz... pfft...
                         
          Théo éteint la lumière de l'alcôve. Fernand s'est tourné vers lui,
          et l'écoute sans comprendre ce qu'il raconte.
                         
                          THÉO

           blanc franchissant un fossé... un éclair... et c'est
           fait... »
          Il sort de l'alcôve, et prend un paquet de cigarette dans la poche
          intérieure de sa veste. Son ami s'est éloigné.

          Il sort une cigarette du paquet.
                         
          Henri est assis devant les pistes de Bowling, à côté de la table
          sur laquelle sont toujours étalées les cartes à jouer.
                         
                          HENRI
           On nait... On vit... On trépasse...
                         
          Paul Volfoni s'approche du bar, une chope de bière à la main.
          Derrière le bar, son frère, Raoul.
                         
                          PAUL VOLFONI
           C'est comme ça pour tout le monde.
                         
                          RAOUL VOLFONI
           Pas forcement ! Enfin, je veux dire, on meurt pas forcement
           dans son lit !
                         
          Il regarde Fernand qui passe le long du bar. Fernand s'est arrêté
          de marcher aux dernières paroles de Raoul.
                         
                          RAOUL VOLFONI
           Ben voyons !
                         
          Paul se tourne légèrement vers Fernand, puis regarde son frère en
          souriant. Il donne un élan à sa chope de bière, qui glisse sur
          toute la longueur du bar, et vient s'écraser sur d'autres verres.
                         
          Fernand s'approche d'Henri. Il regarde Paul qui s'éloigne le long
          du bar pour aller se chercher une autre bière. Il se tourne vers
          Henri en se frottant les yeux.
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Dis donc, je tiens plus en l'air, moi. T'aurais pas une
           bricole à grignoter, là.
                         
                          HENRI
           Bien sûr.
                         
          Il se lève. Fernand avise un paquet de cigarettes sur la table au
          milieu des cartes.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           C'est à toi, ça ?
                         
                          HENRI
           Sers-toi !
                         
          Henri passe derrière le bar. Paul revient s'installer devant son
          frère avec une bière fraîche. Fernand prend une cigarette dans le
          paquet, et s'installe à une autre table. Il pose son manteau sur
          un fauteuil, et s'assoit dans une autre fauteuil.
                         
          Raoul est toujours derrière le bar, et son frère en face de lui.

           ce qui l'a sauvé, c'est sa psychologie.
                         
          Il s'éloigne de l'autre côté du bar. Paul reste à sa place et se
          tourne vers Fernand.
                         
                          PAUL VOLFONI

          Pascal vient d'entrer dans la salle et se plante devant Théo, qui
          est toujours appuyé sur la cloison de l'alcôve téléphonique.

           C'est un peu sommaire, mais ça peut être efficace.
                         
          Raoul, un verre à la main, s'avance vers la table de Fernand.
                         
                          RAOUL VOLFONI
           Et le Mexicain, ça été une épée, un cador. Moi je suis
           objectif, on parlera encore de lui dans cent ans.
           Seulement, faut bien reconnaître qu'il avait décliné,
           surtout de la tête.
                         
          Il pose son verre sur la table de Fernand. Fernand prend le verre
          de Raoul et le pose sur la table voisine. Raoul se tourne vers le
          bar.
                         
          Son frère Paul continue à boire sa bière, accoudé au bar.
                         
                          PAUL VOLFONI
           C'est vrai que sur la fin, il disait un peu n'importe quoi.
           Il avait comme des vapes, des caprices d'enfants.
                         
          Henri apporte une assiette pleine, une demi-baguette de pain, un
          verre et une bouteille de vin qu'il pose sur la table devant
          Fernand.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Merci Henri.
                         
          Il se sert un verre de vin.
                         
                          RAOUL VOLFONI
           Enfin, toi qu'y a causé en dernier, t'as sûrement
           remarqué ?
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Remarqué quoi ?
                         
                          RAOUL VOLFONI
           T'as quand même pas pris au sérieux cette histoire de
           succession ?
          Fernand boit un peu de vin.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Pourquoi ? Fallait pas ? Ben, j'ai eu tort.
                         
                          RAOUL VOLFONI
           Ah ! Et voilà !
                         
          Paul se rapproche de son frère.
                         
                          PAUL VOLFONI
           Tu vois Raoul, c'était pas la peine de s'énerver, monsieur
           convient.
                         
          Raoul s'assoit en face de Fernand, qui beurre un morceau de pain.
          On entend un téléphone sonner. Henri s'approche du bar pour
          décrocher le téléphone posé dessus.
                         
                          RAOUL VOLFONI
           Y en a qui abuseraient de la situation, mais mon frère et
           moi, c'est pas notre genre. Qu'est ce qu'on peut faire qui
           t'obligerait ?
                         
          Fernand mange son morceau de pain beurré. Au bar, Henri répond au
          téléphone.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Décarrer d'ici. J'ai promis à mon pote de m'occuper de ses
           affaires. Puisque je vous dis que j'ai eu tort, là.
           Seulement tort ou pas tort, maintenant, c'est moi le
           patron. Voilà.
                         
          Henri met la main sur le micro du combiné et se tourne vers les
          pistes où Pascal, en chemise, est en train de jouer.
                         
                          HENRI
           Pascal !
          Pascal se retourne. Fernand et les Volfoni regardent dans la
          direction d'Henri.
                         
                          PASCAL
           Oui ?
                         
          Henri lui fait signe de venir au téléphone.
                         
          Assis à une table,juste au bord des pistes, donc en contrebas par
          rapport à celle de Fernand, Théo est en train de se raser avec un
          rasoir sans fil, en se regardant dans un petit miroir. Son ami,
          qui jouait au bowling, vient de s'assoir à côté de lui. Pascal,
          venant des pistes, passe derrière Théo. L'ami de Théo regarde
          Pascal s'éloigner.
                         
          Paul est toujours debout près de la table de Fernand.
                         
                          PAUL VOLFONI
           Écoute, on te connaît pas. Mais laisse-nous te dire que tu
           te prépares des nuits blanches, des migraines, des
           « nervousses brékdones », comme on dit de nos jours.
          Derrière Paul, Henri se rapproche de la table, et fait un signe
          discret à Fernand.
                         
          Fernand ramasse son manteau et se lève lentement de table.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           J'ai une santé de fer. Voilà quinze ans que je vis à la
           campagne, que je me couche avec le soleil, et que je me
           lève avec les poules.
                         
          Il ramasse un morceau de pain dans l'assiette.
                         
          Théo est toujours en train de se raser avec son petit rasoir de
          voyage.
                         
          Fernand ramasse le paquet de cigarettes, et se dirige vers le bar.
          Derrière lui, au bord des pistes, Théo s'est retourné pour le
          regarder. Il se lève, son rasoir toujours allumé à la main, et
          s'éloigne. Son ami le suit.
                         
          Devant le bar, Henri explique la situation à Fernand.
                         
                          HENRI
           Y a du suif chez Tomate. Trois voyous qui chahutent la
           partie. Les croupiers ont les foies pour la caisse, ils
           demandent de l'aide.
                         
          Derrière eux, Pascal, qui a remis sa veste, déballe un pistolet
          d'un emballage de papier blanc.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Ça arrive souvent ?
                         
          En contrebas, au bord d'une table, Théo souffle dans son rasoir
          pour le nettoyer.
                         
                          THÉO
           Jamais !
                         
                          PASCAL
           Ça doit pouvoir se régler à l'amiable.
                         
          Il introduit le pistolet dans le holster sous sa veste.
                         
                          HENRI
           Si tu tiens à regagner ta province rapido, t'auras intérêt
           à aller voir, ce serait toujours ça de gagner, c'est sur
           ton chemin.
                         
          Derrière eux, Théo, qui est remonté du bord des pistes, se
          rapproche d'eux, et s'assoit à une table.
                         
          Fernand tourne légèrement la tête vers les Volfoni. Raoul est
          toujours assis à la table que vient de quitter Fernand, Paul
          debout derrière lui. Fernand fait un petit signe discret à Henri.
                         
                          HENRI
           Oh ! Les Volfoni. T'inquiètes pas !
          Théo réajuste sa cravate.
                         
                          THÉO
           « La bave du crapaud n'empêche pas la caravane de passer ».
                         
          Henri hausse les épaules, passe devant Fernand et lui tapote
          légèrement l'épaule.
                         
                          HENRI
           Tchiao !
                         
          Fernand le regarde s'éloigner en finissant de manger son pain. Il
          se tourne vers Pascal.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Dis donc, ça te gêne pas qu'on y aille ensemble ?
                         
                          PASCAL
           C'est pas que vous gênez, Monsieur Fernand, mais je ne sais
           pas si ça va bien vous plaire ?
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Et ben ça, je te le dirais !
                         
          Derrière Fernand, Henri, debout les mains dans les poches, discute
          avec Raoul.
                         
          Fernand et Pascal se dirigent vers la sortie du bowling. Avant de
          partir, Fernand a un dernier regard vers Théo, qui le regarde
          partir, les bras croisés. L'ami de Théo remonte du bord des pistes
          et rejoint Théo
                         
           L'AMI DE THÉO (chuchotant)
           A ton avis, c'est un faux caïd ou un vrai branque ?
                         
                          THÉO
           Pour moi, c'est rien du tout. Un coup de téléphone, et dix
           minutes après... Il existe plus.
          PARIS - UNE RUE - EXTÉRIEUR JOUR
                         
          La voiture de Pascal roule dans Paris. Pascal est au volant,
          Fernand est assis à côté de lui. La voiture s'arrête, un peu
          brutalement, à un feu rouge.
                         
          Plan rapproché sur le pare-brise. On voit Fernand qui se frotte la
          joue.
                         
                          PASCAL
           J'admets qu'ils ont l'air de deux branques, mais je n'irais
           pas jusqu'à m'y fier, non ? C'est quand même des
           spécialistes. Le jeu, ils ont toujours été là-dedans, les
           Volfoni brothers, à Naples, à Las Vegas, partout où il y a
           des jetons à la clé, ils tenaient les râteaux, hein ?
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Mais... l'autre, là ? Le... le coquet ?
                         
                          PASCAL
           L'ami Fritz ?
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Hmm.
                         
                          PASCAL
           Il s'occupe de la distillerie clandestine.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           C'est quand même marrant, les évolutions. Quand je l'ai
           connu le Mexicain, il recrutait pas chez tonton.
                         
                          PASCAL
           Vous savez ce que c'est, non ? L'âge, l'éloignement. A la
           fin de sa vie, il s'était penché sur le reclassement des
           légionnaires.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Ah ! Si c'était une oeuvre, alors là !... Là, c'est autre
           chose.
                         
          Le feu repasse au vert. La voiture redémarre.
                         
          Fondu enchaîné.
                         
          VOITURE PASCAL - INTÉRIEUR JOUR
                         
          La voiture roule très lentement. A travers les vitres, on aperçoit
          une sorte de ferme, au milieu d'un terrain en friche. Une échelle
          est appuyé contre le mur de la ferme et atteint l'une des fenêtres
          du premier étage.
                         
                          PASCAL
           Voilà, ici c'est chez Tomate.
                         
          CHEZ TOMATE - EXTÉRIEUR JOUR
                         
          Plan rapproché sur la voiture, côté conducteur.
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Je m'attendais à quelque chose de plus important, mais
           c'est un clapier !
                         
          Pascal ouvre la porte de la voiture, et sort.
                         
                          PASCAL
           D'après Tomate, ce qui passionne le joueur, c'est le tapis
           vert.
                         
          Fernand sort à son tour de la voiture.
                         
                          PASCAL
           Ce qui il y a autour, il s'en fout, il voit même pas.
                         
          Soudain, Pascal semble en alerte.
                         
                          PASCAL
           Planque toi !
                         
          Il s'accroupit derrière la voiture. Fernand contourne la voiture
          et s'accroupit derrière la calandre.
          Une grosse voiture américaine noire arrive sur le chemin qui mène
          à la « ferme ». Elle roule lentement.
                         
          Plan rapproché sur la voiture. Les vitres sont ouvertes. En plus
          du conducteur, un passager est assis à l'arrière et tient une
          grosse mitraillette, dans le style de celles utilisées par les
          gangsters de Chicago à l'époque de la prohibition.
                         
          Fernand contourne la voiture de Pascal pour mieux se cacher. On
          entend la mitraillette tirer.
                         
          Plan rapproché sur l'américaine et le tireur de mitraillette en
          action.
                         
          Fernand court au milieu des voitures garées autour de lui.
                         
          A travers le pare-brise de l'une de ces voitures, on voit la tête
          de Fernand qui émerge lentement de l'autre côté de la voiture.
                         
          La voiture américaine s'éloigne de la « ferme ».
                         
          La tête de Fernand sort prudemment de derrière la voiture qui lui
          sert de refuge.
                         
          La voiture américaine fait demi-tour et revient vers la « ferme ».
                         
          Fernand court entre les voitures garées sur le parking improvisé,
          et va se cachet derrière un arbre. Derrière lui, l'arme à la main,
          Pascal sort en courant de derrière sa propre voiture.
                         
          Il s'accroupit devant une Deux Chevaux Citroën.
                         
          La voiture américaine revient. Au premier plan, derrière la Deux
          Chevaux, on aperçoit l'extrémité du canon silencieux du pistolet
          de Pascal.
                         
          L'homme à la mitraillette a passé la tête par la vitre arrière de
          la voiture américaine et vise vers Pascal et Fernand.
                         
          Le pistolet de Pascal est dirigé vers la voiture américaine. On
          entend les deux « plop » caractéristiques du tir avec un
          silencieux.
                         
          La vitre de l'une des voitures garées vole en éclats.
                         
          Le tireur à la mitraillette tire en direction de Pascal.
                         
          D'autres vitres de voiture volent en éclats.
                         
          Pascal se redresse et tire.
                         
          Le tireur à la mitraillette lâche son arme et fait une grimace de
          douleur. La voiture continue à rouler.
                         
          Pascal tire de nouveau.
                         
          Le conducteur de l'américaine s'écroule derrière son volant.
                         
          Gros plan sur la roue avant de l'américaine, qui pivote.
          Gros plan sur le pied du conducteur, coincé sur l'accélérateur.
                         
          A travers le pare-brise de l'américaine, on voit les buissons qui
          se rapprochent.
                         
          Gros plans rapides et successifs sur le conducteur mort, qui tient
          toujours son volant, sur la roue avant, qui pivote dans tous les
          sens, enfin sur la calandre de la voiture, qui part en tonneau.
                         
          La voiture américaine se retourne et se retrouve sur le toit. La
          portière s'ouvre sous le choc. Un chien aboie.
                         
          Fernand et Pascal observent la scène. Pascal a toujours son
          pistolet à la main.
                         
                          PASCAL
           A l'affût sous les arbres, ils auraient eu leur chance.
                         
          Pascal commence à dévisser tranquillement le silencieux de son
          pistolet, sous le regard intrigué de Fernand.
                         
                          PASCAL
           Seulement, de nos jours, il y a de moins en moins de
           techniciens pour le combat à pied, l'esprit fantassin
           n'existe plus.
                         
          Il souffle dans le silencieux de son pistolet.
                         
                          PASCAL
           C'est un tort.
                         
          Ils se mettent en marche vers la « ferme ».
                         
          Ils passent devant la voiture retournée sur le toit.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Et c'est le scénario de qui, d'après toi... les Volfoni ?
                          PASCAL
           Ce serait assez dans leurs sales manières.
                         
          Il s'arrête de marcher et retient Fernand par la manche.
                         
                          PASCAL
           Monsieur Fernand... Je serais d'avis qu'on aborde molo, des
           fois qu'on serait encore attendu...
                         
          Fernand se remet en marche. Pascal le retient de nouveau.
                         
                          PASCAL
           Mais, sans vous commander, si vous restiez un peu en
           retrait... Hein ?
                         
          Pascal passe devant. Fernand le regarde s'éloigner, un peu
          inquiet.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Ouais, n'empêche qu'à la retraite de Russie, c'est les mecs
           qu'étaient à la traîne qu'ont été repassés.
          Il suit Pascal vers la ferme.
                         
          CASINO TOMATE - INTÉRIEUR JOUR
                         
          Nous sommes au sous-sol de la « ferme ». Le chien aboie toujours.
          Une porte s'ouvre et Tomate apparaît. Il est en chemise ouverte et
          en veste de toile.
                         
                          TOMATE
           C'est toi qui fais tout ce foin ?
                         
          Pascal est debout devant l'escalier de descente, Fernand derrière
          lui.
                         
                          PASCAL
           Je m'excuse. Monsieur Fernand, le nouveau taulier.
                         
                          TOMATE
           J'étais pas au courant.
                         
                          PASCAL
           Comme ça, tu l'es !
                         
          Il entre dans la pièce, suivi de Fernand, que Tomate dévisage.
                         
                          TOMATE
           Je suis Tomate, le gérant de la partie.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Bonjour.
                         
                          TOMATE
           Enchanté, mais qu'est-ce que c'était que cette fusillade ?
           On ne se serait pas permis de vous flinguer sur le
           domaine ?
                         
          La pièce, dans laquelle ils viennent d'entrer, est visiblement la
          chaufferie, avec une grosse chaudière qui trône au milieu de la
          pièce. Derrière la chaudière, Freddy, « l'homme à tout faire » de
          Tomate.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Et ben, on s'est permis.
                         
          Pascal inspecte les bouteilles rangées sur des étagères sur le mur
          au fond de la pièce, devant un petit bar, sur lequel est posé un
          téléphone. Fernand passe devant Freddy et le dévisage longuement.
                         
          Derrière la chaudière, une longue table entourée de chaises.
          Pascal a ramassé des dés à jouer sur la table, et les fait jongler
          dans sa main.
                         
                          PASCAL
           Tomate ?
                         
                          TOMATE
           Oui ?
                         
                          PASCAL
           Tu devrais envoyer Freddy faire un tour. Y a une charrette
           dans le parc avec deux gars dedans, ça fait désordre...
                         
          Tomate fait signe à Freddy d'aller exécuter les ordres de Pascal.
          Freddy sort de la pièce
                         
                          PASCAL
           Où sont les autres ?
                         
                          TOMATE
           Quels autres ?
                         
                          PASCAL
           Les mecs qui faisaient du scandale.
                         
                          TOMATE
           Du scandale ici ? Mais j'aimerais comprendre.
                         
                          PASCAL
           Moi aussi.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Comment ? Mais c'est pas vous qui avez téléphoné ?
                         
                          TOMATE
           La nuit était tout ce qu'il y a de normal.
                         
                          PASCAL
           Qu'est ce que c'est que cette embrouille ?
                         
          Fernand se dirige vers le téléphone.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Le numéro d'Henri ?
                         
                          PASCAL
           Balzac quarante-quatre, zéro cinq.
          Fernand prend le téléphone du bar et commence à composer le
          numéro. Pascal continue à jongler avec les dés.
                         
          BOWLING - INTÉRIEUR NUIT
                         
          Le téléphone sonne sur le bar. Derrière la main qui décroche, on
          peut voir un agent de police en uniforme, avec képi et bâton
          blanc, et un type en imperméable et chapeau de feutre, qui est
          visiblement un inspecteur de police.
                         
          Henri est allongé par terre devant le bar, le corps entouré d'une
          marque à la craie. Il a perdu un de ses chaussons, posé à côté de
          son pied en chaussette, et lui aussi entouré d'un trait de craie.
          Il est entouré d'inspecteurs en civil et d'agents de police en
          uniforme. Un inspecteur le photographie. On entend la voix off de
          Fernand, qui commente les évènements.
                         
           MONSIEUR FERNAND (voix off)
           Maintenant, Henri, y peut plus expliquer les choses... à
           personne... Trois morts subites en moins d'une demi-heure.
           Ah ! ça part sévère, les droits de succession.
          MANOIR DU MEXICAIN - EXTÉRIEUR JOUR
                         
          La 404 de Fernand est garée devant un coquet petit manoir du XVIII°
          siècle, situé au milieu d'un parc boisé.
                         
          Pascal et Fernand viennent visiblement de quitter la voiture.
          Pascal précède Fernand et porte sa valise et un cintre sur lequel
          est pendu un costume sombre. Fernand porte son manteau sur
          l'épaule.
                         
          Ils montent les marches du perron de l'entrée principale.
                         
                          PASCAL
           Le Mexicain l'avait achetée en viager à un procureur à la
           retraite.
                         
          Pascal sonne à la porte.
                         
                          PASCAL
           Après trois mois... l'accident bête... Une affaire !
                         
          La porte s'ouvre. Pascal s'efface pour laisser entrer Fernand.
                         
          MANOIR DU MEXICAIN - VESTIBULE - INTÉRIEUR JOUR
                         
          Le vestibule, comme le reste du manoir d'ailleurs, est meublé en
          meubles anciens, qui semblent tous authentiques.
                         
          La porte d'entrée est maintenue ouverte par Jean, le maître
          d'hôtel. Il porte pantalon noir, veste blanche, chemise blanche et
          cravate noire.
                         
          Fernand entre le premier, suivi de Pascal. Fernand regarde autour
          de lui. Derrière son dos, Jean fait un signe discret à Pascal, qui
          lui répond par un autre signe affirmatif.
                         
                          JEAN
           Welcome sir, my name is John !
           (Traduction : Bienvenue, monsieur, je m'appelle Jean)
                         
          Fernand regarde Pascal d'un oeil interrogateur pendant que Jean
          referme la porte. Pascal hausse légèrement les épaules et fait une
          petite moue, qui signifie « sans importance », puis il s'éloigne
          avec la valise, qu'il dépose au pied de l'escalier. Il jette
          négligemment la veste sur la rampe en bois ouvragé. Fernand
          récupère sa veste, la secoue et l'accroche sur la rampe par le
          cintre. Jean, qui l'a suivi, lui indique le chemin à suivre.
                         
                          JEAN
           Please...
           (Traduction : S'il vous plait)
                         
          MANOIR DU MEXICAIN - CUISINE - INTÉRIEUR JOUR
                         
          Maître Folace est assis, en robe de chambre sur son pyjama, devant
          la table, terminant son petit déjeuner. Pascal est debout devant
          lui.
                         
                          PASCAL
           Il est mort, il y a deux heures.
          On découvre la table, sur lequel il y a un jeu d'échec, avec un
          livre sur les échecs ouvert devant Folace, qui termine son verre,
          et fume une cigarette, fichée dans un fume-cigarette. A côté des
          échecs, plusieurs bouteilles de Champagne vide.
                         
                          PASCAL
           On aurait pu être là plus tôt, mais on a été retardé. Des
           espèces de contestation. Et puis... Henri s'est fait
           descendre.
                         
                          MAITRE FOLACE
           Les Volfoni ?
                         
          Pascal écarte les bras et fait une moue signifiant « je n'en sais
          rien ».
                         
                          MAITRE FOLACE
           Quand le lion est mort, les chacals se disputent l'empire.
           Enfin, on ne peut pas demander plus aux Volfoni qu'aux fils
           de Charlemagne.
                         
          Fernand vient d'entrer, une cigarette au bec. Folace se lève.
                         
                          MAITRE FOLACE
           Ah ! Maître Folace, notaire.
                         
          Fernand et Folace se serrent la main.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Bonjour monsieur.
                         
                          MAITRE FOLACE
           Heureux de vous accueillir, j'aurais préféré, bien sûr, que
           ce soit dans d'autres circonstances. Votre chambre est
           prête, le Mexicain avait donné des ordres.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Et bien, vous êtes gentil, je vous remercie, mais... ce qui
           m'arrangerait surtout, c'est si on pouvait régler nos
           affaires dans la journée, quoi...
                         
          Folace marque un temps et revient lentement vers la table.
                         
                          MAITRE FOLACE
           Vous étiez l'ami de Louis depuis longtemps ?
                         
          Il se rassoit à sa place derrière la table.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Depuis toujours.
                         
          Jean, qui vient d'entrer dans la pièce, tend un briquet allumé à
          Fernand.
                         
                          JEAN
           Mademoiselle va avoir du chagrin.
                         
          Maître Folace s'est servi un café à partir du percolateur en verre
          posé devant lui.
                          MAITRE FOLACE
           Ah non... Stop... Sujet interdit ! Attention messieurs, pas
           de fausses notes, la volonté du défunt est formelle : pour
           Patricia, le plus longtemps possible, son papa se porte
           comme un charme. Il joue les centaures quelque part dans
           les sierras Mexicaines, mal desservies par la poste, ce qui
           explique son silence.
                         
          Pascal pose la main sur l'épaule de Folace.
                         
                          PASCAL
           Bon, je dois partir. Maître Folace sait toujours où me
           joindre, j'habite chez ma mère.
                         
          Fernand et Pascal se serrent la main.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Oui merci, hein !
                         
          Pascal sort. Fernand enlève sa veste.
                         
                          MAITRE FOLACE
           Je suis bien content que vous soyez là, vous savez. Parce
           que moi, avec la petite, j'y arrive plus. C'est peut être
           parce que je la connais depuis trop longtemps. Pensez,
           c'est moi qui l'aie tenu sur les fonts baptismaux, alors...
                         
          Fernand a posé sa veste sur une chaise, et il retrousse ses
          manches. Jean se rapproche de la table et verse du café dans une
          tasse.
                         
                          JEAN
           Y avait une belle cérémonie, mademoiselle était déjà
           ravissante.
                         
                          MAÎTRE FOLACE
           Dites-moi, mon ami, si vous montiez les bagages de Monsieur
           Naudin ?
                         
          Jean se met au garde-à-vous, et crie :
                         
                          JEAN
           Yes sir !
           (Traduction : Oui, monsieur)
                         
          Fernand sursaute.
                         
          Jean sort de la pièce. Folace fait un petit signe muet à Fernand.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Dites moi, si ça vous fait rien, j'aimerais bien qu'on
           aborde un petit peu les choses sérieuses. Parce que... les
           caprices d'une gamine c'est bien beau, ça, mais faut quand
           même pas s'en faire pour ça non, on est bien d'accord ?
                         
          Folace a repris son fume-cigarette.
                         
                          MAITRE FOLACE
           Ah mais moi, je ne m'en fais pas, je ne m'en fais plus.
           Maintenant que vous êtes là, c'est vous que ça regarde.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Comment ça, moi ?
                         
                          MAITRE FOLACE
           Eh ben ? Vous avez accepté de vous occuper d'elle, non ?
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Ben oui.
                         
          Folace soulève sa tasse de café.
                         
                          MAITRE FOLACE
           A la bonne votre, mon cher. Vous allez connaître tout ce
           que j'ai connu : les visites aux directrices, les mots
           d'excuses, les billets de renvoi...
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Vous allez quand même pas dire que mademoiselle Patricia
           s'est fait éjecter, non ?
                         
          Il se lave les mains dans l'évier.
                         
                          MAITRE FOLACE
           Ah ! De partout, mon cher.
                         
          Il se lève, prend un toast sur la table, le renifle, prend un air
          un peu dégoûté, et jette le toast en l'air.
                         
                          MAITRE FOLACE
           Mademoiselle n'a jamais tenu plus de six mois. Juste le
           temps d'user les patiences. Oui, vraiment, je suis content
           que vous soyez là.
                         
          Fernand coupe le robinet et se secoue les mains. Puis il prend un
          torchon pour se les essuyer.
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Oui, mais pas pour longtemps, parce que ça va changer, et
           vite, hein, c'est moi qui vous le dit. La boite que je vais
           lui trouver, va falloir qu'elle y reste, croyez moi ! Ou
           sinon, je vais la filer chez les vraies soeurs, les vraies,
           la pension au bagne avec le réveil au clairon et tout le
           toutim, non mais sans blague ?
                         
          Il jette son torchon d'un geste rageur.
                         
                          MAITRE FOLACE
           Et bien, faut le lui dire à elle.
                         
          Fernand remet sa veste.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Oh mais, je vais lui dire, et puis tout de suite. Où est-
           elle ?
                         
                          MAITRE FOLACE
           Elle dort. Elle a organisé une petite sauterie qui nous a
           entraîné jusqu'à trois heures du matin.
          Fernand exécute une légère courbette de surprise. Jean entre dans
          la pièce.
                         
                          JEAN
           Your room is ready sir !
           (Traduction : Votre chambre est prête, monsieur)
                         
                          MAITRE FOLACE
           Il veut dire que votre chambre est prête.
                         
          Jean ressort de la cuisine.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Ah bon. Dites donc, il picole pas un peu, votre British ?
                         
                          MAITRE FOLACE
           Oh la la ! Et puis il est pas plus British que vous et moi.
           C'est une découverte du Mexicain.
                         
          Les deux hommes se dirigent vers la porte de la cuisine.
                         
          MANOIR DU MEXICAIN - VESTIBULE - INTÉRIEUR JOUR
                         
          Les deux hommes sortent de la cuisine et longent l'escalier.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Il l'a trouvé où ?
                         
                          MAITRE FOLACE
           Ici, il l'a même trouvé devant son coffre-fort. Y a dix-
           sept ans de ça. Avant d'échouer devant l'argenterie, l'ami
           Jean avait fracturé la commode louis XV.
                         
          Folace commence à monter l'escalier, suivi de Fernand.
                         
                          MAITRE FOLACE
           Le Mexicain lui est tombé dessus juste au moment où
           l'artiste allait attaquer les blindages au chalumeau.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Et bien, je vois d'ici la petite scène.
                         
                          MAITRE FOLACE
           Vu ses principes, le patron pouvait pas le donner à la
           police, ni accepter de régler lui-même les dégâts.
                         
          Ils viennent d'arriver sur le palier du premier étage.
                         
                          MAITRE FOLACE
           Résultat : Jean est resté ici trois mois au pair comme
           larbin pour régler la petite note. Et puis, la vocation lui
           est venue, le style aussi, peut-être également la sagesse.
           Dans le fond, nourri, logé, blanchi, deux costumes par an,
           pour un type qui passait la moitié de sa vie en prison...
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Il a choisi la liberté quoi !
                         
          Ils continuent vers le deuxième étage, sur le palier duquel Jean
          les attend. Ils passent devant lui.
                         
          Fondu au noir.
                         
          MANOIR DU MEXICAIN - SALLE DE BAINS - INTÉRIEUR JOUR
                         
          Gros plan sur l'évier. On voit la main de Fernand qui pose le
          rasoir sur le rebord de l'évier, puis qui ouvre le robinet.
                         
          Zoom arrière. Avec ses deux mains, Fernand, qui est torse nu, ôte
          le reliquat de mousse sur son visage. Puis il prend une serviette
          de toilette pour s'essuyer.
                         
          Il relève la tête, et dans la glace de l'armoire de toilette au-
          dessus du lavabo, on voit Patricia debout à l'entrée de la salle
          de bains.
                         
                          PATRICIA
           Oh, c'est drôle, je vous voyais plus grand, plus bronzé,
           mais c'est pas grave. Vous êtes bien l'oncle Fernand ?
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Ben... Oui.
                         
                          PATRICIA
           On pourrait peut être s'embrasser ? Ça se fait.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Ah bon, ben alors... Si ça se fait, ben allons-y !
                         
          Ils se déposent mutuellement une bise sur chaque joue. Fernand
          renfile sa veste de pyjama. Il avait, bien entendu, gardé sa
          culotte de pyjama !
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Dis donc, heureusement que je viens de me raser, hein ?
                         
          Patricia porte une petite robe simple sans manche. Une broche de
          pierreries (vraies ou fausses ?) est accrochée sur la robe. Elle
          s'assoit sur le bord de la baignoire.
                         
                          PATRICIA
           Papa m'avait annoncé votre arrivée.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Quand ça ?
                         
                          PATRICIA
           Dans sa dernière lettre, il y a bien un mois. Ça vous
           étonne ?
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Euuuuh... Non... oh non !
                         
                          PATRICIA
           Y avait trois pages, rien que sur vous, vos aventures, vos
           projets, sans compter tout ce que vous avez fait pour lui.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Dis moi, tu sais, j'aimerais bien avoir un petit peu de thé
           et du pain, du beurre et peut être des oeufs au bacon aussi,
           hein ? Tu ne pourrais pas t'occuper de ça en bas ?
                         
                          PATRICIA
           Du thé à sept heures du soir ?
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           C'est à dire qu'en ce moment, je suis un tantinet décalé
           dans mes horaires... oui !
                         
                          PATRICIA
           Ah bon !
                         
          Elle va pour sortir, puis se ravise et se tourne vers lui.
                         
                          PATRICIA
           Oh ! Au fait, ça a du être quelque chose la fois où vous
           l'avez sorti du fleuve ?
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Qui ça ?
                         
          Elle rentre dans la salle de bains.
                         
                          PATRICIA
           Ben, papa. Il m'annonçait dans sa lettre : « Fernand m'a
           sorti d'un drôle de bain ». Ce qu'il a oublié de me dire,
           c'est quel fleuve c'était ?
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Écoute, soit gentille, moi, je meurs de faim, alors va
           t'occuper de mon petit en-cas, tu veux ? Hmm ?...
                         
                          PATRICIA
           Vous ne voulez pas me répondre ?
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Mais c'est pas que je veux pas, mais comment tu veux que je
           m'en rappelle moi, hein ? La-bas des fleuves t'as que ça, à
           droite, à gauche, devant, derrière, partout, et bourrés de
           crocodiles en plus, voilà t'es contente maintenant ? Bon
           alors maintenant va, et laisse-moi finir ma toilette, et
           puis on parlera après, hein ? Parce que tu t'en doutes,
           Patricia, faut quand même qu'on parle.
                         
          Il la raccompagne jusqu'à la porte.
                         
                          PATRICIA
           Oui, mon oncle.
                         
          Elle affiche un petit sourire un peu moqueur.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Qu'on parle de choses sérieuses.
                         
                          PATRICIA
           Oui, Tonton. Ça ne vous ennuie pas que je vous appelle
           Tonton ?
                         
          Elle sort. Fernand rentre dans la salle de bains, mais Patricia
          réapparait à la porte.
                         
                          PATRICIA
           Vous en avez tué beaucoup ?...
                         
          Fernand se retourne lentement.
                         
                          PATRICIA
           Des crocodiles ?
                         
          Elle rentre dans la salle de bains.
                         
                          PATRICIA
           Et là-bas y a que ça, devant, derrière, à gauche, à droite,
           partout ! Bon, eh bien, je vais m'occuper de votre thé.
                         
          Après avoir, tout en parlant, fait un tour complet autour de
          Fernand, elle ressort, les mains croisées derrière le dos, avec
          une fausse allure de petite fille bien sage.
                         
          Fernand regarde pensivement la glace de la salle de bains et se
          masse la nuque.
                         
          Fondu enchaîné.
                         
          MANOIR DU MEXICAIN - SALON - INTÉRIEUR JOUR
                         
          Un salon richement meublé. Dans une vitrine, des miniatures
          militaires napoléoniennes, visiblement d'époque et authentiques.
                         
          Folace, le fume-cigarette au bec, entraîne Fernand, habillé d'un
          costume sombre vers le milieu de la pièce.
                         
                          MAITRE FOLACE
           Puisque la fermeté a l'air de vous réussir, je vais vous
           donner l'occasion de vous distinguer.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Mais à propos de quoi ?
                         
                          MAITRE FOLACE
           D'argent !... D'argent qui ne rentre pas. Depuis deux mois,

           Tomate a plus d'un mois de retard, et Théo etc...
                         
          Folace a ramassé des documents sur une table, et il les feuillète
          sous le regard de Fernand.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Mais qu'est ce que c'est ? Une révolte ?
                         
                          MAITRE FOLACE
           Non sire, une révolution !... Personne ne paie plus rien !
                         
          Il donne les documents à Fernand, qui les feuillète à son tour.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Non mais, ces mecs-là auraient quand même pas la prétention
           d'engourdir le pognon de ma nièce, non ?
                          MAITRE FOLACE
           On dirait.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Le Mexicain était au courant.
                         
          Folace tire les double-rideaux sur la fenêtre.
                         
                          MAITRE FOLACE
           Ah non, non, surtout pas ! C'était un homme à tirer au
           hasard sans discernement, alors les ragots... dans la
           presse, si c'était tombé sous les yeux de la petite, vous
           voyez ça d'ici !
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Ouais, ce que je vois surtout, c'est que si on doit arriver
           à flinguer, vous préférez que ce soit moi qui m'en charge,
           hein, c'est ça ?
                         
                          MAITRE FOLACE
           Un tuteur, c'est pas pareil.
                         
          Fernand pose les documents sur la table.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Ça se guillotine aussi bien qu'un papa !
                         
                          MAITRE FOLACE
           Mais qui vous demande d'intervenir personnellement ? Nous
           avons Pascal. Je le convoque ou pas ?
                         
          Fernand se dirige vers la porte du salon.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Si je devais pas être à la foire d'Avignon dans quarante-
           huit heures, je dirais non, mais je suis pris par le temps.
           Et puis je reconnais que c'est jamais bon de laisser dormir
           les créances, et surtout de permettre au petit personnel de
           rêver.
                         
          Il sort du salon.
                         
          MANOIR DU MEXICAIN - PETIT SALON - INTÉRIEUR JOUR
                         
          Fernand entre dans un autre salon.
                         
          Un jeune homme portant un tricot gris ras-du-cou, et dessous une
          chemise et une cravate, lui saute dessus. Il s'agit d'Antoine
          Delafoy, le « fiancé » de Patricia.
                         
                          ANTOINE DELAFOY
           Vous parlez de rêver... rêvez-vous en couleur ? Antoine
           Delafoy, le plus respectueux, le plus ancien, le plus
           fidèle ami de Patricia.
                         
          Il s'incline respectueusement devant Fernand, qui semble on ne
          peut plus surpris.
                         
                          ANTOINE DELAFOY
           Je vous connais, monsieur, et je vous admire.
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Hein ?...
                         
                          ANTOINE DELAFOY
           Patricia vous évoque, vous cite, vous vante en toute
           occasion, vous êtes le gaucho, le centaure des pampas,
           l'oncle légendaire...
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Et moi, elle m'a jamais parlé de vous.
                         
          Il s'éloigne de lui. Antoine reste sur place, mais se retourne
          pour continuer à lui parler.
                         
                          ANTOINE DELAFOY
           Ah... Patricia n'a pas eu le temps, mais ça ne fait rien.
           je ferais donc mon panégyrique moi-même, c'est parfois
           assez édifiant et souvent assez drôle, car il m'arrive de
           m'attribuer des mots qui sont en général d'Alphonse Allais
           et des aventures puisées dans la vie des hommes illustres.
                         
          Il se dirige vers Fernand. Et l'on découvre que ce dernier est
          debout près d'un canapé, sur lequel Patricia est assise. Sur une
          table basse devant le canapé, quelques bouteilles d'alcool.
          Fernand regarde Patricia d'un oeil interrogateur.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Il est toujours comme ça ?
                         
                          PATRICIA
           Absolument pas ! C'est son côté agaçant, il faut qu'il
           parle. En vérité c'est un timide. Je suis sûre que vous
           serez séduit, quand vous le connaîtrez mieux.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Parce qu'en plus, monsieur séduit.
          Jean vient d'entrer dans la pièce, portant un petit seau à glaçons
          en cristal.
                         
                          ANTOINE DELAFOY
           Je ne séduis pas : j'envoûte...
                         
          Jean pose le petit seau sur la table basse. Antoine le lui prend
          des mains.
                         
                          ANTOINE DELAFOY
           Leave it, Jean, and I'll do it
           (Traduction : Laissez, Jean, je vais le faire)
                         
          Jean s'incline légèrement. Fernand s'assoit dans un fauteuil en
          face du canapé.
                         
                          JEAN
           Thank you, sir.
           (Traduction : Merci, Monsieur)
                         
          Antoine verse du whisky dans un verre. Jean sort lentement de la
          pièce. Avant de sortir, il regarde longuement Fernand, qui lui
          rend son regard. On comprend qu'ils ont, tous deux, la même
          opinion d'Antoine.
                         
                          ANTOINE DELAFOY
           Pour en revenir à vos rêves en couleur, savez vous que
           Borowski les attribuent au phosphore qui est contenu dans
           le poisson ?
                         
          Il tend le verre à Fernand, qui regardait Jean sortir et qui se
          retourne pour prendre le verre.
                         
                          ANTOINE DELAFOY
           Moi je préfère m'en tenir à Freud, c'est plus rigolo.
           Qu'est-ce que vous en pensez ?
                         
          Fernand prend une petite bouteille d'eau gazeuse sur la table
          basse.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Rien. Je ne rêve pas en couleur, je ne rêve pas en noir, je
           ne rêve pas du tout. Je n'ai pas le temps.
                         
          Antoine prend la petite bouteille de la main de Fernand.
                         
                          ANTOINE DELAFOY
           Je vous déconseille l'eau, ce serait un crime, il a dix ans
           d'âge.
                         
          Fernand reprend la petite bouteille d'un geste rageur. Il regarde
          Patricia avec, dans les yeux, une visible colère contenue.
                         
                          PATRICIA
           Tonton est débordé par ses affaires.
                         
          Antoine s'accroupit devant le fauteuil de Fernand. Derrière lui,
          on voit Jean qui rentre dans la pièce.
                         
                          ANTOINE DELAFOY
           Vous viendrez bien avec nous demain soir.
                         
          Jean est suivi par Folace.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Et où ça ?
                         
          Fernand verse de l'eau dans son whisky. Antoine grignote une
          olive.
                         
                          ANTOINE DELAFOY
           Il demande où ça ? Oh, oh, Dieu, qu'il est drôle. Franck
           Émile jouera pour la première fois à Pleyel.
                         
          Fernand, de plus en plus agacé par le déluge verbal d'Antoine, se
          tourne vers Folace, qui met la main devant sa bouche pour masquer
          son hilarité.
                         
                          ANTOINE DELAFOY
           Corelli, Beethoven, Chopin, tout ça c'est très dépassé,
           c'est très con...
          Fernand se tourne de nouveau vers Folace, qui, cette fois-ci, lui
          fait un petit signe discret, et sort de la pièce.
                         
                          ANTOINE DELAFOY
           ... mais avec Mills, ça peut devenir féroce, tigresque.
           Bref, tout le monde y sera.
                         
          Fernand repose son verre, tapote sur le genou d'Antoine, puis se
          lève lentement.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           D'accord, d'accord, je sais que c'est la coutume d'emmener
           l'oncle de province au cirque. Je vous remercie d'ailleurs
           d'y avoir pensé, mais vous irez sans moi.
                         
          Il ouvre vivement la porte. Mais il ne sort pas tout de suite. Il
          maintient la porte ouverte, tout en regardant longuement Patricia
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Moi demain à sept heures, je ne serais pas loin de
           Montauban, quant à mademoiselle Patricia, elle, sera à ses
           études, nous sommes bien d'accord, Patricia ?
                         
          Patricia hoche la tête.
                         
                          PATRICIA
           Oui, Tonton !
                         
          Fernand fait un petit signe de tête à Antoine, qui s'est approché
          de la porte et le regarde avec les mains dans les poches. Fernand
          sort de la pièce en refermant la porte derrière lui.
                         
          Antoine reste un instant devant la porte fermée, puis il se tourne
          vers Patricia en faisant une petite moue.
                         
                          ANTOINE DELAFOY
           Je crois que t'as raison, faut pas le brusquer.
          MANOIR DU MEXICAIN - VESTIBULE - INTÉRIEUR JOUR
                         
          Les mains sur les hanches, près de la porte qu'il vient de fermer,
          Fernand regarde Folace et Pascal, qui vient certainement
          d'arriver, car il a encore son imperméable sur le dos.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Qu'est-ce qui se passe encore ?
                         
                          MAITRE FOLACE
           Notre ami va se faire un plaisir de vous l'expliquer...
                         
                          PASCAL
           Les Volfoni ont organisé, à la péniche, une petite réunion
           des cadres, façon meeting si vous voyez ce que je veux
           dire, enfin quoi, on parle dans votre dos.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Et tu tiens ça d'où ?
                         
                          PASCAL
           Je ne peux pas le dire, j'ai promis, ce serait mal.
          Fernand fait un petit signe de tête à Folace.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Alors ?
                         
                          MAITRE FOLACE
           Eh bien, y a deux solutions : ou on se dérange... ou on
           méprise...
                         
          Il parle avec un petit sourire forcé. Il regarde Pascal, qui hoche
          lentement la tête. Son sourire s'efface.
                         
                          MAITRE FOLACE
           Oui, évidemment, n'importe comment, une tournée
           d'inspection ne peut jamais nuire, bien sûr !
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Eh bien, on va y aller !
                         
          Il va pour ouvrir la porte du petit salon, mais Pascal l'en
          empêche.
                         
                          PASCAL
           Monsieur Fernand ?... Y a peut être une place pour moi dans
           votre auto... Des fois que la réunion devienne houleuse ...
           J'ai une présence tranquillisante...
                         
          Il se frotte lentement les mains, avec un petit sourire entendu.
                         
          MANOIR DU MEXICAIN - SALLE A MANGER - INTÉRIEUR JOUR
                         
          La salle à manger communique avec le petit salon par une grande
          ouverture sans porte. On entend la porte du petit salon s'ouvrir.
          Patricia est en tain d'allumer des bougies, et sans se retourner,
                         ELLE DEMANDE :
                         
                          PATRICIA
           Vous préférez le foie gras pour commencer ou pour finir ?
                         
          Fernand s'avance vers elle, suivi par Antoine.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           C'est à dire que je le préférerais demain, je suis obligé
           de sortir. Un conseil d'administration...
                         
          Antoine s'accroupit légèrement, les mains tordues par une surprise
          un peu trop affectée.
                         
                          ANTOINE DELAFOY
           Quoi ? Vous n'allez pas dîner avec nous ? Moi qui venais de
           dire à Jean de nous monter du champagne ?
                         
          Fernand se tourne vers Antoine, mais lui parle d'une voix très
          froide.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Votre invitation me bouleverse ! Bon appétit quand même !
                         
          Derrière Antoine, on voit Fernand qui traverse le petit salon,
          puis sort de la pièce. Antoine s'avance lentement vers la table,
          ramasse quelque chose dessus et le mange. Puis il se penche pour
          sentir le foie gras.
                         
                          ANTOINE DELAFOY
           C'est du bidon !
                         
                          PATRICIA
           Sûrement pas. Il vient de Strasbourg, on le paie un prix
           fou...
                         
                          ANTOINE DELAFOY
           Non, je parle du conseil d'administration de ton oncle. Si
           tu veux mon avis, l'oncle des pampas va courir la gueuze.
                         
                          PATRICIA
           Tu crois ?
                         
          Antoine lui répond par une petit mimique très explicite.
                         
          PÉNICHE - SALLE DE JEU - INTÉRIEUR NUIT
                         
          La salle principale de la péniche sur laquelle les Volfoni ont
          organisé une sorte de casino clandestin. Cette salle principale
          est la salle de roulette. Au centre de la pièce, une grande table
          avec, dessus, une roulette et le tapis correspondant. Sur le côté
          de la pièce, un petit bar.
                         
          Raoul est debout en bout de table. Il semble très en colère.
                         
                          RAOUL VOLFONI
           Voilà quinze ans qu'on fait le trottoir pour le Mexicain,
           j'ai pas l'intention de continuer à tapiner pour son
           fantôme.
                         
          Il s'assoit. Assise à côté de lui, Madame Mado, la maquerelle
          semble apprécier moyennement les dernières paroles de Raoul.
                          MME MADO
           Le trottoir, le tapin, c'est drôle, ça ? On croirait que tu
           cherches le mot qui blesse ?
                         
          Paul, la cigarette au bec, debout, mais à moitié avachi sur la
          table, joue négligemment avec la roulette.
                         
                          PAUL VOLFONI
           C'est des images.
                         
                          MME MADO
           Les images, ça m'amusait quand j'étais petite, j'ai passé
           l'âge ! Je dis pas que Louis était toujours très social,
           non... il avait l'esprit de droite.
                         
          Assis à côté de Mado, Freddy joue négligemment avec les jetons,
          qu'il lance sur le tapis. Aux dernières paroles de Mado, il se
          tourne vers Raoul, qui réagit mollement.
                         
                          RAOUL VOLFONI
           Oh, dis... hé !
                          MME MADO
           Quand tu parlais augmentation ou vacances, il sortait son
           flingue avant que t'aies fini. Mais il nous a tout de même
           apporté à tous la sécurité.
                         
          Raoul tape sur la table et se lève d'un bond.
                         
                          RAOUL VOLFONI
           Ramasser les miettes, vous appelez ça la sécurité, vous ?
           Vous savez combien il nous a coûté le Mexicain en quinze
           ans ? Vous savez combien qu'il nous a coûté ? Oh, dis leur,
           Paul, moi je peux plus.
                         
          Il se rassoit, en proie à une émotion intense.
                         
                          PAUL VOLFONI
           A cinq cents sacs par mois, rien que de loyer, ça fait six
           briques par an, quatre-vingt-dix briques en quinze ans.
                         
                          RAOUL VOLFONI
           Plus trente briques de moyenne par an sur le flambe. Vous
           savez à combien on arrive ? Un demi milliard !
                         
          Il se tourne vers Tomate, assis à côté de lui en face de Mado.
                         
                          RAOUL VOLFONI
           Et toi, pareil pour la petite ferme.
                         
          Il s'emporte un peu.
                         
                          RAOUL VOLFONI
           Ben dis que c'est pas vrai !
                         
          Tomate s'amuse à empiler des jetons. Il reste très calme.
                         
                          TOMATE
           J'ai rien dis !
          Assis à côté de Tomate, Bastien, le porte-flingue des Volfoni,
          puis à côté de lui, Paul, toujours avachi sur la table et occupé à
          jouer avec la roulette.
                         
                          RAOUL VOLFONI
           Ben moi, je dis que je lâcherais plus une tune ! Et je vous
           invite à tous en faire autant.
                         
          A côté de Freddy, l'ami de Théo fume une cigarette, et à côté de
          lui, Théo fume un cigare. Théo est donc assis de l'autre côté de
          la roulette, en face de Paul. Il parle calmement avec son léger
          accent allemand.
                         
                          THÉO
           Vous invitez, vous invitez... C'est très aimable, mais il y
           a des invitations...
                         
                          RAOUL VOLFONI
           Qu'est ce qui te gêne, toi ?
                         
          Théo se tourne pour regarder Raoul droit dans les yeux.
                          THÉO
           Le climat... trois morts depuis hier, si ça doit tomber
           comme à Stalingrad... Une fois ça suffit. J'aime autant
           garder mes distances.
                         
          Raoul se lève. Il s'emporte progressivement au fur et à mesure
          qu'il parle.
                         
                          RAOUL VOLFONI
           Dis donc, t'essaierais pas de nous faire porter le chapeau
           des fois ? Faut le dire tout de suite, hein ? Il faut
           dire : « Monsieur Raoul, vous avez buté Henri, vous avez
           buté les deux autres mecs. Vous avez peut être aussi buté
           le Mexicain, puis aussi l'archiduc d'Autriche »...
                         
          PÉNICHE - PONT - EXTÉRIEUR NUIT
                         
          Sur un ponton, bâti sur la rive à côté de la péniche, on
          distingue, dans un halo de lumière au milieu de la pénombre
          ambiante, Pascal et à côté de lui Folace, une sacoche à la main.
                         
                          PASCAL
           Hé ! Léo, c'est moi, Pascal.
                         
          Il agite le bras. On entend une voix qui répond.
                         
           LEO (voix off)
           J'arrive... Qui est avec toi ?
                         
          Léo, habillé en marinier, marche sur le toit de la péniche, venant
          de la cabine de conduite.
                         
           PASCAL (voix off)
           Je suis avec le notaire.
                         
          Fernand grimpe sur une échelle qui part de la rive, en contrebas
          du ponton, pour atteindre le pont de la péniche.
          Léo, qui vient d'apercevoir Fernand, ramasse une grosse clé
          anglaise par terre.
                         
                          LEO
           Tu me dis que vous êtes deux, vous êtes trois...
                         
                          PASCAL
           J'annonce les employés, pas le patron...
                         
                          LEO
           Possible, mais j'attends un ordre de Monsieur Raoul.
                         
          Léo regarde, avec un visage peu aimable, Fernand s'avancer vers
          lui. Fernand, sans prévenir, lui balance un violent coup de poing
          dans le menton.
                         
          Léo recule sous le coup et bascule dans l'eau
                         
          Fernand se lèche un peu la main qui vient de frapper Léo. Derrière
          lui, Folace et Pascal grimpe à leur tour sur le pont par
          l'échelle. Folace, portant imperméable noir et chapeau de feutre,
          regarde Léo, que l'on entend barboter et gémir dans l'eau.
                          MAITRE FOLACE
           C'est curieux chez les marins ce besoin de faire des
           phrases...
                         
          Pascal leur fait signe de le suivre vers l'entrée de la péniche.
                         
                          PASCAL
           Allons !
                         
          Fernand pousse Folace devant lui.
                         
          PÉNICHE - SALLE DE JEU - INTÉRIEUR NUIT
                         
          Les personnes présentes n'ont pas changé de position. La salle est
          juste un peu plus enfumée. Raoul est debout en train de
          « haranguer ses troupes ».
                         
                          RAOUL VOLFONI
           Si vous marchez tous avec moi, qu'est-ce qu'il fera votre
           Fernand ?... Un procès ?
                         
          On frappe à la porte. Bastien se lève pour aller ouvrir la porte.
          Mais, d'un geste, Raoul l'arrête, et fait signe à Freddy d'aller
          ouvrir. Freddy se lève et se dirige vers la porte. Il débloque le
          verrou et ouvre la porte.
                         
          Fernand lui assène un violent coup de poing dans le menton. Freddy
          part à reculons et s'écroule contre le mur.
                         
          Fernand entre, immédiatement suivi de Pascal, qui a un pistolet
          dans chaque main.
                         
          Bastien, qui était resté debout, glisse la main sous sa veste pour
          prendre son arme.
                         
                          RAOUL VOLFONI
           Laisse.
          Folace entre le dernier, et enlève son chapeau. Il salue
          courtoisement les personnes présentes.
                         
                          MAITRE FOLACE
           Bonsoir messieurs ! Madame !
                         
          Fernand s'avance dans la pièce.
                         
                          RAOUL VOLFONI
           Je croyais pas t'avoir invité...
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Mais t'avais pas à le faire, je suis chez moi.
                         
          Il marche lentement vers Raoul.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Qu'est ce que t'organises ? Un concile ?
                         
          Bastien cherche à s'interposer. Fernand le repousse.
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Tu permets ?
                         
          Bastien glisse la main sous sa veste, mais, d'un signe, Raoul lui
          enjoint de rester calme.
                         
                          RAOUL VOLFONI
           Je les avais réunis pour décider ce qu'on faisait pour le
           Mexicain, rapport aux obsèques.
                         
          Fernand enlève son manteau et le donne à Bastien, qui le laisse
          tomber par terre.
                         
          Lentement, Fernand contourne la table de jeu.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Si c'est des obsèques du Mexicain dont tu veux parler,
           c'est moi que ça regarde, maintenant si c'est celle
           d'Henri...
                         
          Il est arrivé derrière la chaise de Raoul, dont il tient le
          dossier à deux mains.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           ... tu pourrais peut-être les prendre à ta charge.
                         
          Fernand s'assoit sur la chaise de Raoul.
                         
                          RAOUL VOLFONI
           Non, ça va pas recommencer, je vais pas encore endosser le
           massacre.
                         
          D'un claquement de doigt, Fernand donne l'ordre à Tomate de se
          lever. Ce dernier, la pipe au bec, s'exécute.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           On parlera de ça un peu plus tard.
          Folace s'installe sur la chaise de Tomate, ouvre sa sacoche, et en
          sort des dossiers.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Pour l'instant on a d'autres petits problèmes à régler,
           figure-toi. Priorités aux affaires. Je commence par le
           commencement.
                         
          Il prend l'un des dossiers que Folace vient de déposer sur la
          table.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Honneur aux dames. Madame Mado je présume ?
                         
                          MME MADO
           Elle-même.
                         
          Fernand feuillète le dossier de Mado.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Chère madame, Maître Folace m'a fait part de quelques...
           Pffff... quelques embarras dans votre gestion, momentanés
           j'espère. Souhaiteriez-vous nous fournir quelques
           explications ?
                         
          Il sort un paquet de cigarettes de sa poche. Mado répond en fumant
          une cigarette plantée dans un long fume-cigarette.
                         
                          MME MADO
           Les explications, Monsieur Fernand, y en a deux :
           récession et manque de main d'oeuvre. Ce n'est pas que la
           clientèle boude, c'est qu'elle a l'esprit ailleurs. Le
           furtif, par exemple, a complètement disparu.
                         
          Freddy se relève lentement et rejoint son siège à côté de Mado. Il
          se masse le menton et a l'air un peu sonné.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Le furtif ?
                         
                          MME MADO
           Le client qui vient en voisin... Bonjour mesdemoiselles, au
           revoir madame. Au lieu de descendre maintenant après dîner,
           il reste devant sa télé, pour voir si par hasard il ne
           serait pas un peu l'homme du vingtième siècle.
                         
          (NOTE : « L'homme du Vingtième Siècle » était un jeu télévisé,
          très célèbre à l'époque du film, puisque diffusé sur la seule et
          unique chaîne de télévision qui existait alors. Il avait débuté en
          1961 et s'est terminé en 1964.)
                         
          Fernand allume une cigarette, et l'écoute patiemment.
                         
                          MME MADO
           Et l'affectueux du dimanche... disparu aussi. Pourquoi ?
           Pouvez-vous me le dire ?
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Encore la télé ?
                          MME MADO
           L'auto, Monsieur Fernand ! L'auto !
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Ah !...
                         
          Folace taille tranquillement son crayon.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Mais dites moi, vous parliez de pénurie de main d'oeuvre
           tout à l'heure...
                         
                          MME MADO
           Alors là, Monsieur Fernand, c'est un désastre ! Une bonne
           pensionnaire, ça devient plus rare qu'une femme de ménage.
           Ces dames s'exportent, le mirage africain nous fait un tort
           terrible. Et si ça continue, elles iront à Tombouctou à la
           nage.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Bien, je vous remercie, Madame Mado, on recausera de tout
           ça...
          A côté de Mado, Freddy a l'air prêt à s'endormir sur sa chaise.
          Mado se lève et s'éloigne.
                         
          Fernand referme le dossier de Mado. Il prend un autre dossier, et
          regarde Folace.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Qui est-ce, le mec du jus de pomme ?
                         
          Folace, de la pointe de son crayon, lui indique Théo.
                         
          Freddy est maintenant écroulé sur la table.
                         
                          THÉO
           Ce doit être de moi dont vous voulez parler !
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Dis moi, dans ta branche, ça va pas très fort non plus,
           hein ! Pourtant du pastis vrai ou faux, on en boit encore ?
                         
          Théo ricane et prend un autre cigare dans la boîte posée à côté de
          lui.
                         
                          THÉO
           Moins qu'avant... La jeunesse française boit des eaux
           pétillantes, et les anciens combattants, des eaux de
           régime.
                         
          Fernand regarde Folace, qui sourit.
                         
                          THÉO
           Puis surtout il y a le whisky.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Et alors ?
                         
                          THÉO
           C'est le drame ça, le whisky...
                         
          PÉNICHE - ANTICHAMBRE DE LA SALLE DE JEU - INTÉRIEUR NUIT
                         
          Pascal et Bastien se sont installés, assis côte à côte, dans
          l'antichambre de la salle de jeu. Pascal a toujours un pistolet à
          la main, et surveille ce qu'il se passe dans la salle, par la
          porte ouverte. Bastien regarde le pistolet de Pascal et émet un
          petit sifflement.
                         
                          BASTIEN
           Dis donc, je le connais pas, celui-là. Il est nouveau ?
                         
                          PASCAL
           C'est le petit dernier de chez Beretta. Je te le conseille
           pour le combat de près, et puis pour les coups à travers la
           poche, ou le métro ou l'autobus.
                         
           THÉO (voix off)
           Le whisky...
                         
                          PASCAL
           Mais note, hein ? Faut en avoir l'usage, sans ça, au prix
           actuel, on l'amortit pas.
                         
                          BASTIEN
           Le prix s'oublie, la qualité reste, c'est pas l'arme de
           tout le monde, ça ! T'as eu ça par qui ?
                         
                          PASCAL
           Par l'oncle Antonio.
                         
                          BASTIEN
           Le frère de Berthe ?
                         
                          PASCAL
           Oui.
                         
          Bastien semble songeur. Pascal se penche pour suivre ce qui se
          passe dans la salle de jeu.
                         
          PÉNICHE - SALLE DE JEU - INTÉRIEUR NUIT
                         
                          THÉO
           Tout ça pour vous faire comprendre, Monsieur Fernand, que
           le pastis perd de l'adhérent chaque jour. Le client devient
           dur à suivre.
                         
          Mado apporte une théière et une tasse sur la table. Freddy dort
          toujours sur le tapis de jeu.
                         
          Fernand a l'air un peu fatigué par la longue tirade de Théo sur le
          whisky. Il repose lourdement sa tête sur sa main.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Oh tu sais, c'est un petit peu dans tous les domaines
           pareil, moi si je te parlais motoculture...
                         
          Il s'arrête net, et referme le dossier de Théo.
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Ouais enfin !
                         
          Mado donne une tasse de thé à Fernand.
                         
                          MME MADO
           J'espère qu'il est encore chaud.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Merci.
                         
          Fernand écrase sa cigarette pour boire son thé.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Bien... et maintenant à nous...
                         
          Il regarde Raoul, qui se tient debout derrière Folace, la
          cigarette au bec. A côté de lui, Tomate a pris la place laissé
          vacante par Bastien. Paul s'est assis à côté de Tomate.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Dans votre secteur, pas de problème, le jeu a jamais aussi
           bien marché.
                         
                          RAOUL VOLFONI
           Que tu dis !
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Ce qui vous chagrine, c'est la comptabilité. Vous êtes des
           hommes d'action, je vous ai compris, et je vous ai arrangé
           votre coup.
                         
                          RAOUL VOLFONI
           T'arranges, t'arranges, et si on était pas d'accord ?
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Tu vas voir que c'est pas possible, j'ai adopté le système
           le plus simple.
                         
          Il prend le document que lui tend Folace.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Tiens, regarde ! On prend les chiffres de l'année dernière,
           et on les reporte.
                         
          Paul tend la main vers la roulette pour jouer avec. Raoul lui
          donne une claque sur le bras.
                         
                          RAOUL VOLFONI
           Arrête, toi !
                         
          Tomate, toujours sa pipe au bec, regarde Fernand.
                         
                          TOMATE
           L'année dernière, on a battu des records !
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Et bien, ben vous les égalerez cette année ! Vous avez
           l'air en pleine forme, là ? Gais, entreprenants,
           dynamiques...
          Il boit son thé.
                         
                          RAOUL VOLFONI
           Et en plus, il nous charrie, c'est complet.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Pascal !
                         
          Pascal entre dans la salle.
                         
                          PASCAL
           Oui, Monsieur Fernand.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Tu passeras à l'encaissement chez ces messieurs sous
           huitaine.
                         
          Raoul se tourne vers Pascal.
                         
                          RAOUL VOLFONI
           C'est ça, puis si on paye pas, tu nous butes ?
          Pascal hausse les épaules.
                         
                          PASCAL
           Hé, monsieur Raoul...
                         
          Fernand repose sa tasse.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Bien, messieurs, il ne me reste plus qu'à vous remercier de
           votre attention...
                         
          Il remet les documents dans les dossiers, qu'il donne à Folace. Il
          regarde tout le monde et se lève.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Madame...
                         
          Il s'incline légèrement devant Mado. Folace range les dossiers
          dans sa sacoche. Fernand récupère son manteau et passe devant
          Raoul, suivi de Folace, qui remet son chapeau en place sur sa
          tête. Tomate fait tranquillement une réussite.
                         
                          RAOUL VOLFONI
           Bastien ! Accompagne ces messieurs !
                         
          Pascal, suivi de Fernand et de Folace quittent la pièce. Bastien
          sort derrière eux, et referme la porte derrière lui.
                         
          Mado, tout en fumant son long fume-cigarette, regarde Raoul d'un
          air narquois.
                         
                          MME MADO
           Toi, Raoul Volfoni, on peut dire que tu en es un ?
                         
                          RAOUL VOLFONI
           Un quoi ?
                          MME MADO
           Un vrai chef.
                         
          Raoul ne semble pas apprécier l'insulte sous-jacente dans les
          propos de Mado. Il la foudroie du regard.
                         
                          RAOUL VOLFONI
           Mais y connaît pas Raoul, ce mec ? Y va avoir un réveil
           pénible. J'ai voulu être diplomate à cause de vous tous,
           éviter que le sang coule, mais maintenant c'est fini. Je
           vais le travailler en férocité, le faire marcher à coup de
           lattes ! A ma pogne, je veux le voir ! Et je vous promets
           qu'il demandera pardon et au garde à vous...
                         
          On frappe à la porte. Raoul se précipite, à grandes enjambées vers
          la porte, qu'il ouvre d'un geste vif. Il prend le poing de Fernand
          en pleine figure, et va s'écrouler sur le mur d'en face.
                         
          Fernand, dans l'encadrement de la porte, se masse légèrement la
          main. Pascal, derrière lui, porte son manteau.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           J'avais oublié : les dix pour cent d'amende... pour le
           retard.
                         
          Il jette un regard froid dans la pièce, puis se dirige rapidement
          vers Pascal, qui lui donne son manteau. Ils s'éloignent tous les
          deux.
                         
          Raoul est assis par terre, appuyé sur le mur.
                         
                          RAOUL VOLFONI
           Il a osé me frapper. Il se rend pas compte.
                         
          Théo tourne vaguement la tête vers lui, et se remet tranquillement
          à téter son cigare, pendant que Raoul se masse le menton.
                         
          MANOIR DU MEXICAIN - VESTIBULE - INTÉRIEUR NUIT
                         
          Jean ouvre la porte d'entrée. Fernand entre, suivi de Folace. On
          entend de la musique classique en fond sonore. Folace ôte son
          chapeau et aborde Jean en souriant.
                         
                          MAITRE FOLACE
           Cette petite fête m'a rajeuni de vingt ans. Monsieur Naudin
           a quelque peu bousculé Monsieur Volfoni senior.
                         
          Jean a pris la sacoche de Folace, puis il prend les manteaux des
          deux hommes.
                         
                          JEAN
           Mes compliments, monsieur.
                         
          Fernand tend le doigt vers l'endroit d'où provient la musique.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Qu'est ce que c'est encore que ça ?
                         
          Jean sourit et écarte les bras en signe d'impuissance.
                          JEAN
           Ohhh !...
                         
          MANOIR DU MEXICAIN - PETIT SALON - INTÉRIEUR NUIT
                         
          Fernand entre dans la pièce, qui baigne dans une semi-pénombre. La
          musique devient plus présente. En constatant ce qu'il se passe
          dans la pièce, Fernand se met les mains sur les hanches.
                         
          On voit le dos du canapé, qui a été tiré devant la cheminée, où
          flambe un feu de bois. Au moment où Fernand allume la lumière,
          Patricia et Antoine se relèvent du canapé, sur lequel ils étaient
          allongés. Antoine semble agacé par l'intrusion de Fernand.
                         
                          ANTOINE DELAFOY
           Oh non, au moment où la petite flûte allait répondre au
           cor, vous êtes odieux !
                         
                          PATRICIA
           C'est vrai, Tonton, ces choses-là ne se font pas.

           Ah, Patricia, je t'en prie, hein ?
                         
          A côté de la cheminée, un électrophone est posée sur une table de
          marbre. Un disque est en train de tourner dessus.
                         
                          PATRICIA
           Qu'est ce qui vous arrive, mon oncle ? Vous avez été
           contrarié dans vos affaires ?
                         
          Fernand se dirige vers l'électrophone, et relève le bras du
          tourne-disque.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Oh, à peine.
                         
          Fernand se tourne vers Antoine, les mains croisées derrière le
          dos. On sent sa colère contenue. Il regarde furtivement les pieds
          du jeune homme.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Si ça ne vous fait rien, Monsieur Delafoy, j'aimerais bien
           avoir une petite explication. Mais remettez d'abord vos
           chaussures, vous êtes ridicule.
                         
                          ANTOINE DELAFOY
           Qu'est ce que vous voulez que je vous explique, cher
           monsieur ?
                         
          Patricia allume une cigarette sur l'une des bougies allumées.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Tout ça, lumière tamisée, musique douce, et vos godasses
           sur les fauteuils, Louis XVI en plus !
                         
                          ANTOINE DELAFOY
           La confusion peut encore s'expliquer, mais les termes sont
           inadéquats.
          Antoine va récupérer ses chaussures posées sur un petit
          fauteuil... de style Louis XV !
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Ah, parce que c'est peut être pas du Louis XVI ?
                         
                          ANTOINE DELAFOY
           Euh non ! C'est du Louis XV. Remarquez, vous n'êtes pas
           tombé loin, mais surtout les sonates de Corelli ne sont pas
           de la musique douce.
                         
          Il s'assoit sur le fauteuil pour remettre ses chaussures.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Oui, ben pour moi, c'en est. Et je suis chez moi !
                         
          Il a haussé le ton sur la dernière phrase.
                         
          Antoine pointe le doigt vers lui.
                         
                          ANTOINE DELAFOY
           Ah, j'aime ça, la thèse est osée, mais comme toutes les
           thèses, parfaitement défendable.
                         
          Il se lève de son fauteuil, et s'avance vers Fernand, semblant
          tout à fait à son aise, malgré la situation.
                         
                          ANTOINE DELAFOY
           Nous allons donc, si vous le voulez bien, discuter de la
           musique par rapport au local, de l'élixir et du flacon, du
           contenu et du contenant.
                         
          Il termine sa phrase en bafouillant un peu, car Fernand vient de
          lui jeter un regard on ne peut moins aimable. Fernand se masse le
          visage, pour tacher de rester calme, et se dirige vers Patricia.
          Il plaque ses deux mains sur la cheminée.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Patricia, mon petit... je ne voudrais pas te paraître vieux
           jeu, ni encore moins grossier. L'homme de la pampa, parfois
           rude, reste toujours courtois, mais la vérité m'oblige à te
           le dire : ton Antoine commence à me les briser menu !
                         
                          ANTOINE DELAFOY
           Si nous parlions de moi pendant que vous dînerez ?
                         
          Fernand ne le regarde même pas et s'adresse à Patricia.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Bon, toi, tu vas monter dans ta chambre !
                         
          Il lui arrache sa cigarette des mains et la pousse vers la porte.
                         
                          PATRICIA
           Bonne nuit, Antoine.
                         
          Fernand éjecte Patricia dans le vestibule, dont la porte est
          restée ouverte. Patricia ne demande pas son reste et s'éloigne en
          courant. Fernand revient vers Antoine d'un pas décidé.
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Et quant à vous, brillant jeune homme...
                         
          Il l'attrape par le bras et le pousse vers la sortie. Antoine a
          juste le temps de ramasser son veston sur un fauteuil.
                         
                          ANTOINE DELAFOY
           Ne vous donnez pas la peine, je connais le chemin...
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Justement, faudrait voir à l'oublier, hein !
                         
          MANOIR DU MEXICAIN - VESTIBULE - INTÉRIEUR NUIT
                         
                          ANTOINE DELAFOY
           Ce n'est pas du tout gentil, Oncle Fernand.
                         
          Il est maintenant devant la porte d'entrée, que Fernand ouvre pour
          lui.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Monsieur Fernand, s'il vous plaît. Aller hop !
          Fernand le pousse dehors, mais Antoine résiste.
                         
                          ANTOINE DELAFOY
           Soit, les manières y gagneront ce que l'affection y perdra.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Et bien, c'est ça. Pensez donc à moi.
                         
          Il claque la porte, se retourne et s'arrête net, levant les yeux
          vers l'escalier.
                         
          Patricia a observé la scène, debout sur la quatrième ou cinquième
          marche de l'escalier.
                         
                          PATRICIA
           Vous m'avez terriblement déçue, vous n'avez pas été gentil
           avec Antoine.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Oui, et bien, j'ai fait ce qu'aurait fait ton père, figure-
           toi. Il a jamais pu supporter les voyous, là.
                         
                          PATRICIA
           Antoine, un voyou ? Antoine est un grand compositeur, il a
           du génie.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Et bien, les génies se baladent pas pieds nus, figure-toi !
           Hein ?
                         
                          PATRICIA
           Et Sagan ?
                         
          Fernand ne sait visiblement quoi répondre à cette dernière
          réplique. Peut-être d'ailleurs qu'il ne sait pas qui est Françoise
          Sagan.
          Patricia le regarde en ricanant, et se remet en marche dans
          l'escalier, après lui avoir tiré la langue.
                         
          Fondu enchaîné.
                         
          MANOIR DU MEXICAIN - SALLE A MANGER - INTÉRIEUR JOUR
                         
          Un peu plus tard.
                         
          Fernand, en chemise, et la cravate un peu dénouée, est en train de
          manger une cuisse de poulet, qu'il tient dans sa main. En fond
          sonore, et assez fort, on entend la musique qu'écoutaient Antoine
          et Patricia. La pochette du disque est appuyé sur la corbeille qui
          contient la bouteille de vin. Sur cette pochette, on peut lire
          « Corelli ». Fernand lève des yeux légèrement inquiet vers la
          porte-fenêtre.
                         
          Derrière le rideau, on peut apercevoir deux silhouettes qui
          bougent.
                         
          Fernand plisse les yeux, en essayant de comprendre ce qui se
          passe.
          La porte-fenêtre s'ouvre, et Pascal entre dans la pièce.
                         
                          PASCAL
           Bonsoir !
                         
          Il est suivi par Bastien, qui fait un sourire et un petit signe de
          tête à Fernand. Puis il referme la fenêtre, et tire le rideau.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Qu'est-ce qui vous prend ? Vous êtes louf, non ? Qu'est-ce
           que c'est que ces façons d'arriver en pleine nuit par le
           jardin ?
                         
                          PASCAL
           On ne voulait pas sonner à cette heure-là, réveiller toute
           la maison. Si la demoiselle se posait des questions. A cet
           âge-là, on imagine.
                         
                          BASTIEN
           Et puis, on avait à vous parler.
                         
          Fernand dévisage Bastien.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Vous, je vous ai déjà vu quelque part...
                         
                          BASTIEN
           Tout à l'heure, chez les Volfoni. J'étais de l'autre côté.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Bon, ben asseyez-vous, je suis en train de becter.
                         
          Il glisse la pochette du disque entre son dos et le dossier de la
          chaise.
                         
                          PASCAL
           Alors là, on est vraiment confus !
          Les deux hommes prennent chacun une chaise et les installent
          autour de la table devant Fernand. Bastien s'assoit, mais Pascal
          reste debout.
                         
                          PASCAL
           Voilà, si on est venu à deux, y a une raison ! Bastien,
           c'est le fils de la soeur de mon père, comme qui dirait un
           cousin direct... Vous saisissez la complication, Monsieur
           Fernand.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Non, pas encore !
                         
          Pascal s'assoit.
                         
                          BASTIEN
           Ah, forcément, t'as pas donné à Monsieur Fernand mes
                          RÉFÉRENCES
                         
          Il se lève et prend un air solennel.
                          BASTIEN
           Première gâchette chez Volfoni, cinq ans de labeur, de nuit
           comme de jour, et sans un accroc.
                         
          Pascal, de la main, rassoit Bastien sur sa chaise.
                         
                          PASCAL
           Vous la voyez ce coup-là, l'embrouille ? Dans le monde des
           caves, on appelle ça un cas de conscience, nous on dit : un
           point d'honneur. Entre vous et les Volfoni, il va faire
           vilain temps. En supposant que ça tourne à l'orage, Bastien
           et moi, on est sûr de se retrouver face à face, flingue en
           pogne, avec l'honnêteté qui commande de tirer. Ah non, un
           truc à décimer une famille.
                         
          Ils hochent la tête tous les deux.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Ouais, je vois...
                         
          Il prend une bouteille de champagne dans un seau.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Vous voulez boire un coup ?
                         
                          BASTIEN
           Non, non, merci, jamais entre les repas.
                         
                          PASCAL
           Moi non plus, chez nous c'est la règle : santé, sobriété.
                         
                          BASTIEN
           On en a trop vu qui se sont gâté la main aux alcools.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Je peux rien vous reprocher, les histoires de famille, ça,
           c'est comme une croyance, ça force le respect. Bon, alors,
           qu'est ce que vous proposez ?
                          PASCAL
           Bastien a donné sa démission à Monsieur Raoul.
                         
          Fernand boit le verre de champagne qu'il vient de se servir.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           La tienne va suivre ?
                         
                          PASCAL
           Je peux pas faire moins, Monsieur Fernand, faut comprendre.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Je comprends.
                         
          Fernand reste pensif, et on suit sa pensée en voix off.
                         
           MONSIEUR FERNAND (voix off)
           Ouais, quand la protection de l'enfance coïncide avec la
           crise du personnel, faut plus comprendre, faut prier !
                         
          Fondu au noir.
          MANOIR DU MEXICAIN - PETIT SALON - INTÉRIEUR JOUR
                         
          Fernand, en costume gris, est en train de lire une dissertation
          rédigée par Patricia, assis dans un confortable fauteuil.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           « Et si la vieille définition n'avait pas tant servie à
           propos de Racine et de Corneille, nous dirions que Bossuet
           a peint Dieu tel qu'il devrait être et que Pascal l'a peint
           tel qu'il est »... Et ben, dis donc.
                         
          Il retourne la copie, et regarde la note.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Comment ? Ils t'ont donné que seize sur vingt ?
                         
          Il se lève.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Ben, permet moi de te dire qu'ils y vont un peu fort, hein,
           parce que moi, là, je t'aurais donné plus.
                         
                          PATRICIA
           Vous êtes très gentil, mon oncle...
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Non, Patricia, mon enfant, mercredi dernier, quand je suis
           arrivé, nous dérivions et le navire faisait eau de toute
           part...
                         
          En parlant, Fernand s'est approché d'une glace accroché au mur, et
          dans laquelle on voit Jean entrer dans la pièce.
                         
                          JEAN
           Un Monsieur, au téléphone, un appel de Montauban.
           L'interlocuteur me semble... comment dirais-je ?... un peu
           rustique, le genre agricole.
          Fernand sort de la pièce.
                         
          MANOIR DU MEXICAIN - UN AUTRE SALON - INTÉRIEUR JOUR
                         
          Fernand prend le combiné téléphonique et le porte à son oreille.
          Un grand panneau vitré, inséré dans le mur, sépare le petit salon
          du salon où se trouve le téléphone, ce qui permet de voir
          Patricia, qui écoute avec attention ce que dit son « oncle
          Fernand ».
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Allo oui ?... Oui, c'est moi... Ça va, ça va... Alors ?...
           Hein ?... Oui... Oui... Oui, ben, si je suis pas rentré
           vendredi, c'est que j'ai pas pu... Et ben, je ne sais pas,
           moi... huit jours, peut être quinze...
                         
          MANOIR DU MEXICAIN - PETIT SALON - INTÉRIEUR JOUR
                         
          Patricia suit toujours la conversation téléphonique de Fernand,
          pendant que Jean lit la dissertation de la jeune fille.
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Et ben, y a qu'à faire le nécessaire... Enfin, c'est quand
           même formidable, qu'on dirait qu'à chaque fois que je
           m'absente, c'est toujours pareil, faut toujours qu'y ait
           des histoires... et ben, démerdez vous...
                         
          Il raccroche d'un geste rageur, et s'éloigne du téléphone.
                         
                          JEAN
           « Et Pascal l'a peint tel qu'il est »... Eh ben, moi,
           j'aurais donné à mademoiselle vingt sur vingt, et en cotant
           vache.
                         
          Patricia lui fait un beau sourire.
                         
                          PATRICIA
           Vous êtes gentil.
                         
          MANOIR DU MEXICAIN - SALON - INTÉRIEUR JOUR
                         
          Folace et Fernand discutent. Folace semble un peu énervé.
                         
                          MAITRE FOLACE
           Vous savez combien il reste au compte courant ? Soixante
           milles, six briques...
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Ben qu'est ce que ça veut dire ? Y aurait du coulage ?
                         
                          MAITRE FOLACE
           Du coulage, oh, c'est bien plus simple... Y a que l'argent
           qui devait rentrer sous huitaine, n'est toujours pas
           rentré.
                         
          Le téléphone sonne. Folace fait le tour de la vitrine
          napoléonienne pour aller répondre.
                         
                          MAITRE FOLACE
           Y a que l'éducation de la princesse, cheval, musique,
           peinture, etc... atteint un budget « Élyséen ». Et y a que
           vos dépenses somptuaires ont presque des allures
           africaines.
                         
          Il décroche le téléphone.
                         
                          MAITRE FOLACE
           Allô oui ?... Oui... oui... Il est là. Une seconde.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Qui est-ce ?
                         
                          MAITRE FOLACE
           Justement... Raoul Volfoni.
                         
          Il tend le combiné à Fernand.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Ah, tout de même !...
                         
          Fernand sourit en mettant le combiné à son oreille. Folace
          l'écoute en prenant une cigarette dans un paquet dans sa poche.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Allô ?... alors on a enfin compris... on casque !
                         
          PÉNICHE - BUREAU - INTÉRIEUR NUIT
                         
          Raoul, assis sur le bureau, en costume rayé, est en train de
          parler au téléphone.
                         
                          RAOUL VOLFONI
           Oh ben, tu fais de l'obsession, t'es la proie des idées
           fixes. Je te téléphonais seulement pour t'avertir qu'à la
           distillerie, y sont en plein baccara, tu devrais t'en
           occuper, c'est ton rôle, grand chef.
                         
          Paul, assis derrière le bureau, écoute la conversation grâce à
          l'écouteur de courtoisie du téléphone.
                         
           MONSIEUR FERNAND (voix off au téléphone)
           Mais de quoi tu t'occupes ?
                         
                          RAOUL VOLFONI
           Tu vois comme t'es injuste, on cherche à t'obliger, t'es
           encore pas satisfait.
                         
          DISTILLERIE - PREMIER ÉTAGE - INTÉRIEUR JOUR
                         
          Tomate, Théo, son ami et Freddy sont installés dans une sorte de
          salon aménagé au premier étage de la distillerie, avec des meubles
          anciens un peu disparates et mal assortis. Tomate, Théo et Freddy
          sont assis dans des fauteuils, et l'ami de Théo sur les marches de
          l'escalier. Freddy est en train de lire un roman.
                         
                          TOMATE
           Tu crois que Raoul sera tombé dans le piège ?
                         
                          THÉO
           Il n'aura pas résisté à la joie d'annoncer une mauvaise
           nouvelle à l'autre imbécile.
                         
                          TOMATE
           C'est étonnant que le butor n'ait pas déjà téléphoné.
                         
                          THÉO
           Y a des impulsifs qui téléphonent, y en a d'autres qui se
           déplacent...
                         
          Bruit de klaxon insistant. L'ami de Théo sursaute. Théo, lui,
          reste calme.
                         
                          THÉO
           ... et voilà !
                         
          Il se lève.
                         
                          TOMATE
           Et c'est Volfoni qui portera le chapeau.
                         
                          THÉO
           T'es rassuré ?
                         
                          TOMATE
           Ouais.
                         
                          THÉO
           En voilà un qui est pratiquement sorti du bagne.
                         
          Il récupère un pistolet, l'arme, puis le glisse dans la poche
          intérieure de sa veste.
                         
                          THÉO
           Maintenant, ce n'est plus qu'une affaire de patience. Dans
           un mois, les Volfoni...
                         
          Il fait, avec son pouce, le geste que les empereurs romains
          faisaient pour signifier la mise à mort d'un gladiateur.
                         
                          THÉO
           ... et les affaires du Mexicain, ça deviendra Théo, Tomate
           et Cie.
                         
          Il claque des doigts. Son ami s'approche. Théo ramasse un cendrier
          sur une table.
                         
                          THÉO
           Planque ça, des mégots à la pommade rose, l'homme de Cro-
           Magnon pourrait trouver ça bizarre.
                         
          Nouvel appel de klaxon, encore plus insistant que le premier. Théo
          allume sa cigarette sur une bougie.
                         
                          THÉO
           Voilà, voilà, on arrive.
                         
          Il regarde Tomate.
                         
                          THÉO
           Allez, dans cinq minutes... vous filez.
                         
          Théo sort du « salon ». Le reste du premier étage est totalement
          désert, bien que ce soit un local très vaste, sans aucune cloison.
          Théo le traverse d'un pas rapide.
                         
          Nouvel appel de klaxon.
                         
          Théo descend un petit escalier qui mène au rez-de-chaussée.
                         
          DISTILLERIE - REZ DE CHAUSSÉE - INTÉRIEUR JOUR
                         
          Fernand, en costume gris, venant de l'extérieur, entre dans une
          sorte de hangar dans lequel sont empilés, dans un savant désordre,
          des centaines de bouteilles vides.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Alors ça vient, oui ?
                         
          Une voix vient du haut de l'escalier. Fernand lève la tête.
                         
           THÉO (voix off)
           Voilà, j'arrive...
                         
          Il arrive en bas de l'escalier et regarde Fernand avec surprise.
                         
                          THÉO
           Vous, Monsieur Fernand ?
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Ben quoi ? Ça a l'air de t'épater ?
                         
                          THÉO
           Raoul Volfoni est ridicule ! Je lui avais demandé de
           m'envoyer un chauffeur, pas de vous déranger.
                         
          Fernand regarde, avec intérêt, le bric-à-brac qui l'entoure.
          Trônant au milieu des bouteilles vides, empilées sur des étagères,
          ou rangées dans des casiers, est installé un imposant alambique en
          métal poli.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Bon, de toutes façons, maintenant, je suis là. Dis donc...
           entre parenthèses, c'est pas commode à trouver ton coin,
           là, ça fait une plombe que je tourne autour !
                         
                          THÉO
           La police tourne autour depuis dix ans, elle a jamais
           trouvé. C'est pour ça que je regretterais cet endroit.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Et pourquoi tu dis ça ?
                         
                          THÉO
           Par euh... désenchantement. Vous n'êtes jamais en proie au
           vague à l'âme, Monsieur Fernand ?
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Ma foi, j'en abuse pas, non.
                          THÉO
           Vous n'avez peut-être pas les mêmes raisons. Vous avez
           gagné la guerre... vous.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Bon, d'accord, j'ai gagné la guerre, mais si je me suis
           dérangé exprès, c'est pas pour défiler, hein ? Alors, où
           est-ce que tu veux en venir ? Qu'est ce qui se passe ?
                         
                          THÉO
           Et bien, voilà ce qui s'est passé.
                         
          Il désigne quelque chose de la pointe de son cigare. Fernand
          regarde dans la direction qu'il indique.
                         
                          THÉO
           Un chargement tout prêt. Six millions de pastis. Un client

          Ils sortent du bâtiment.

           Notre dernier chauffeur est parti hier pour le Sahara, dans
           le pétrole, à cause des primes, des zones et des assurances
           sociales... le goût de lucre, l'esprit nouveau.
                         
          Fernand inspecte le camion chargé de casiers à bouteille.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Un chauffeur, ça se remplace, non ?
                         
                          THÉO
           Monsieur Fernand, le transport clandestin ne réclame pas
           seulement des compétences, mais de l'honnêteté.
                         
          Il rejoint Fernand près du camion.

           Contrairement aux affaires régulières, on paie comptant...

                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Ben moi, je vois qu'une solution ! Tu prends le bout de

          Fernand réfléchit.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Bon... les papiers du bahut sont en règle au moins, oui ?

           Tout est en ordre ! Mais Monsieur Fernand, vous prétendez
           pas...
                         
          Fernand ouvre la porte et monte au volant du camion.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Quand y a six briques en jeu, je prétends n'importe quoi.
           J'ai conduit des tracteurs, des batteuses, et toi qui
           parlais de guerre, j'ai même conduit un char Patton.

          Fernand semble un peu gêné.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Oui... bon ben dis donc, moi j'aimerais bien savoir où je
           livre, parce que Fontainebleau, ben, c'est grand !

          Une route déserte dans la nuit. Le camion de Fernand approche,
          tout phare allumé.
                         
          On entend la voix de Théo, qui termine ses explications.
                         
           THÉO (voix off)
           Il y aura une Cadillac noire, arrêtée à l'embranchement de
           Melun.

          Fernand conduit, cigarette à la main.
                         
          ROUTE DE CAMPAGNE - EXTÉRIEUR NUIT
                         
          Théo et Tomate sont assis au bord de la route. Théo se réchauffe
          en buvant du café à partir d'un thermos. A côté de Tomate, une
          mitrailleuse est posée sur son socle de support. Tomate allume son
          briquet pour consulter sa montre.
                         
                          TOMATE
           Il devrait être passé. Tu vois pas qu'il soit tombé sur un
           barrage, ce cave ! Ce serait beau !
                         
                          THÉO
           Il tient pas la moyenne, c'est tout. Avec les prétentieux,
           c'est toujours pareil...
                         
          Il passe son café à Tomate et remonte le col de sa veste.
                         
                          THÉO
           « Moi je, moi je ». Sur le terrain, plus personne.
                         
          Plus loin, le camion roule toujours sur la route. Il passe, sans
          que Fernand ne s'en rende compte, devant une moto, planquée au
          bord de la route, tous feux éteints, avec l'ami de Théo assis
          dessus. Juste après le passage du camion, la moto allume son
          phare, et l'ami de Théo s'élance à la poursuite du camion.
                         
          La moto roule derrière le camion. Le conducteur ne porte pas de
          casque. Il rattrape le camion, puis le double.
                         
          La moto est maintenant devant le camion. Elle arrive en vue d'un
          bosquet d'arbres dans lequel Freddy est planqué. L'ami de Théo
          fait des appels de phare.
                         
          Freddy allume une puissante lampe torche, et fait, lui aussi, des
          appels de lumière.
                         
          Tomate, dans sa planque, reçoit les appels lumineux.
                         
                          TOMATE
           J'ai l'impression qu'on annonce Monsieur Dugommier.

           Je crois qu'il va le regretter, son char Patton.
                         
          Tomate et Théo s'allongent derrière leur mitrailleuse.
                         
          Freddy attend que la moto soit passée, puis il jette des clous à
          quatre pointes sur la route.

          Fernand essaie de redresser le camion qui, avec les quatre pneus
          crevés, n'est plus dirigeable.
          Le camion fonce dans un panneau publicitaire vantant l'apéritif
          « Martini » !
                         
          ROUTE DE CAMPAGNE - EXTÉRIEUR NUIT
                         
          Le camion vient de s'arrêter brutalement sur le panneau
          publicitaire, qu'il a défoncé.
                         
          Dans leur planque, Théo actionne la mitrailleuse, pendant que
          Tomate guide le ruban de balles dans l'arme.
                         
          Des impacts de balle troue la paroi du camion.

          Fernand se couche sur la banquette.
                         
          Le pare-brise et toutes les vitres du camion éclatent, mais
          restent en place, s'étoilant en petites particules, selon le
          principe du verre Sécurit.
                         
          ROUTE DE CAMPAGNE - EXTÉRIEUR NUIT
          Dans leur planque, Théo a arrêté de tirer et regarde dans la
          direction du camion.
                         
                          TOMATE
           Mais qu'est ce que t'attends, allume-le !
                         
          Théo se remet à tirer.
                         
          Sous le tir de la mitrailleuse, le chargement du camion finit par
          s'enflammer.
                         
          CAMION - INTÉRIEUR NUIT
                         
          Les flammes arrivent dans la cabine. Fernand se redresse.
                         
          ROUTE DE CAMPAGNE - EXTÉRIEUR NUIT
                         
          Théo continue à tirer. Tomate, debout derrière lui, le tire en
                         ARRIÈRE
                         
                          TOMATE
           Ça va, filons. Ça va, ça va, ça va, ça va !
                         
          Théo est atteint d'une telle frénésie que Tomate a du mal à le
          détacher de la mitrailleuse. Ils regardent tous deux dans la
          direction du camion.
                         
          Le camion est totalement en flammes.
                         
          CAMION - INTÉRIEUR NUIT
                         
          Le costume de Fernand est déchiré au coude. Fernand arrache le
          coussin de l'un des sièges du camion et le projette dans le pare-
          brise. Le verre éclaté de ce dernier se détache vers l'extérieur
          du camion, ouvrant ainsi une sortie possible pour Fernand, qui se
          dégage de la cabine du camion.
          ROUTE DE CAMPAGNE - EXTÉRIEUR NUIT
                         
          Fernand est allongé dans les feuilles mortes de la forêt. Il rampe
          pour s'éloigner du camion sans être repéré par ses adversaires.

          PÉNICHE - BUREAU - INTÉRIEUR NUIT
                         
          Paul est assis derrière le bureau, lunettes sur le nez. Raoul est
          debout devant lui, et fume un cigare.
                         
                          RAOUL VOLFONI
           Petit frère, crois-moi, le monde moderne va vers la
           centralisation !
                         
                          PAUL VOLFONI
           Et Tomate, qu'est ce que t'en fais ?
                         
                          RAOUL VOLFONI
           Ben, s'il faut virer Tomate, on le virera.
          On frappe à la porte. Raoul traverse la pièce pour ouvrir.
                         
                          RAOUL VOLFONI
           Moi, je connais qu'une loi, celle du plus fort.
                         
          Il ouvre la porte, et prend le poing de Fernand dans la figure. Il
          recule en titubant jusqu'au mur, devant lequel il s'écroule.
                         
          Paul se penche légèrement pour regarder son frère.
                         
          Fernand entre dans la pièce, le cheveu en bataille, et le coude du
          costume toujours déchiré. On comprend qu'il est venu directement
          du lieu de l'accident à la péniche. Il claque la porte et tourne
          le verrou. Quand il se retourne, on constate que sa veste est
          déchirée aussi dans le dos, et même brûlée.
                         
          Paul relève la tête et sourit à Fernand.
                         
                          PAUL VOLFONI
           C'est une manie, qu'est ce qui te prends ?
                         
          Fernand ignore Raoul toujours assis par terre contre le mur et se
          dirige vers le bureau. Il prend une grosse sacoche de cuir posée
          sur le bureau et la retourne, vidant tout ce qu'elle contenait sur
          les papiers de Paul, qui se recule légèrement et enlève ses
          lunettes. Puis il contourne le bureau vers le coffre-fort, qui est
          grand ouvert. Il s'accroupit et commence à remplir la sacoche de
          liasses de billets de banque.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Vous êtes sur la pente fatale, les gars ! Vous vous
           endettez, trois briques de camion plus six briques de
           pastis.
                         
                          PAUL VOLFONI
           On peut savoir de quoi tu causes ?
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Une autre fois ! Hein ?
                         
                          PAUL VOLFONI
           Bon !
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Ce soir, je suis pas d'humeur à bavarder, figure-toi.
                         
                          PAUL VOLFONI
           Bien !
                         
          Il pose la sacoche sur le bureau pour la fermer.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Tout m'irrite !
                         
                          PAUL VOLFONI
           Bon bon !
                         
          Il traverse la pièce en jetant un rapide regard à Raoul, qui se
          relève lentement. Il sort et claque la porte derrière lui. Raoul
          se touche le menton.
          On frappe à la porte. Raoul se dirige vers la porte. Il a déjà la
          main sur la poignée, lorsqu'il se tourne vers son frère, et lui
                         CHUCHOTE :
                         
                          RAOUL VOLFONI
           T'es toujours de cinquante pour cent dans l'affaire ?
                         
                          PAUL VOLFONI
           Ben... bien sûr !
                         
          Raoul fait deux pas dans la pièce et désigne la porte du pouce.
                         
                          RAOUL VOLFONI
           Alors va ouvrir !
                         
          Fondu au noir.
                         
          MANOIR DU MEXICAIN - EXTÉRIEUR NUIT
                         
          De nombreuses voitures sont garées devant l'entrée du manoir. On
          entend de une musique assez puissante qui provient de l'intérieur
          de la maison, mais cette fois-ci, il ne s'agit plus de musique
          classique, mais de musique plus moderne, de musique de danse.
          Toutes les fenêtres du rez-de-chaussée sont illuminées.
                         
          La 404 de Fernand se gare à côté d'une petite voiture anglaise
          décapotable et décapotée. Fernand sort de sa voiture, et le
          propriétaire de la décapotable, un jeune homme élégamment habillé,
          fait le tour de la sienne. Il fixe la housse, qui protège la
          capote lorsqu'elle est rangée derrière le siège arrière, comme
          c'est le cas actuellement. Fernand fait quelques pas, et s'arrête,
          visiblement mécontent de la musique de danse qu'il entend dans le
          manoir. Le jeune homme le regarde, intrigué. Puis il fait quelques
          pas vers lui, en fumant sa cigarette d'un air distingué.
                         
           LE JEUNE HOMME
           Convocation : neuf heures !
          Fernand se retourne.
                         
           LE JEUNE HOMME
           J'ai l'impression, mon cher, que nous ne sommes pas en
           avance.
                         
          Fernand revient vers sa voiture, dont il ouvre le coffre.
                         
           LE JEUNE HOMME
           Vous êtes un ami de Pat ou un copain d'Antoine ?
                         
          Fernand prend la sacoche dans le coffre, qu'il referme. Il lance
          un rapide regard au jeune homme, et se dirige vers le manoir.
                         
           LE JEUNE HOMME
           Je me demande s'il la saute ?
                         
          Fernand se retourne vers le jeune homme.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Si qui saute qui ?
           LE JEUNE HOMME
           Ben... Antoine... Patricia...
                         
          Fernand soupire, pose la sacoche sur le coffre de sa voiture, puis
          flanque une raclée au jeune homme. On ne le voit pas actuellement
          frapper le jeune homme, mais on en entend les bruits
          caractéristiques. Fernand récupère sa sacoche et se dirige vers le
          manoir.
                         
          Le jeune homme est étalé dans sa voiture, une jambe sur le pare-
          brise, et l'autre jambe par-dessus la portière. Il est
          complètement sonné. Les essuie-glace balaient inutilement le pare-
          brise.
                         
          MANOIR DU MEXICAIN - VESTIBULE - INTÉRIEUR NUIT
                         
          Plan rapproché sur la porte d'entrée. La musique est encore plus
          puissante. On voit Fernand à travers les vitres de la porte. Il
          frappe très fort sur la porte. Un type, qui était adossé au mur
          près de la porte, tourne la tête vers lui, et ouvre la porte.
                         
          Fernand entre et regarde autour de lui, d'un air à la fois surpris
          et mécontent. Une fille se trémousse en rythme devant lui. Fernand
          referme la porte. D'autres invités, assis alentour, marque le
          rythme de la musique. D'autres danseurs apparaissent dans le
          champ.
                         
          Plan en plongée du haut de l'escalier. Le vestibule est plein de
          jeunes gens en train de danser. D'autres, debout dans l'escalier,
          marquent le rythme. Fernand, près de la porte, contemple cette
          scène sans bouger. Jean traverse le vestibule, un plateau à la
          main.
                         
          Retour sur un plan moyen de Fernand, qui semble de plus en plus
          mécontent. Il aperçoit Jean et l'appelle.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Jean ?
                         
                          JEAN
           Une seconde, monsieur.
                         
          Jean entre dans un salon, son plateau à la main.
                         
          Fernand traverse le vestibule.
                         
          MANOIR DU MEXICAIN - UN SALON - INTÉRIEUR NUIT
                         
          Antoine et Patricia sont en train de se bécoter. Antoine relève la
          tête et aperçoit Fernand.
                         
                          ANTOINE DELAFOY
           Le cercle de famille s'agrandit.
                         
          Patricia regarde dans la direction de Fernand, avec des yeux un
          peu effrayés. Elle pousse Antoine vers un coin plus discret.
                         
          Fernand traverse le salon vers l'endroit où Jean est en train de
          servir les invités. Il bute dans un jeune homme qui est dans son
          chemin.
                         
           UNE JEUNE FILLE LÉGÈREMENT ÉMÉCHÉE
           Encore un peu, Jean, s'il te plaît.
                         
                          JEAN
           Tu picoles trop toi, tu vas être ronde.
                         
           UNE JEUNE FILLE LÉGÈREMENT ÉMÉCHÉE
           Vas donc m'en chercher une autre bouteille, s'il te plaît.
                         
                          JEAN
           Mais oui.
                         
          La jeune fille s'éloigne. Fernand se rapproche de Jean. Un jeune
          homme, qui vient, lui aussi d'être servi, s'éloigne de Jean, qui
          sourit béatement.
                         
           LE JEUNE HOMME
           Tchiao.
                         
          En voyant Fernand, le sourire de Jean s'efface.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Jean ? Où est Patricia ?
                         
          Jean fait un petit signe d'impuissance.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Et maître Folace ?
                         
                          JEAN
           À la cuisine... il aide, lui.
                         
          Jean a dit les derniers mots sur un ton de léger reproche. Fernand
          le regarde de façon peu aimable, puis traverse le salon, en
          essayant d'éviter les danseurs, et en cherchant visiblement
          Patricia.
          Dans un coin discret, Antoine et Patricia observent la scène. Ils
          se parlent en chuchotant.
                         
                          ANTOINE DELAFOY
           Continuer de me cacher, c'est très désagréable.
                         
          Ils regardent tous les deux dans la direction de Fernand.
                         
          Fernand continue à zigzaguer entre les invités, tenant toujours sa
          sacoche à la main.
                         
           PATRICIA (voix off)
           Oncle Fernand ?
                         
          Fernand se retourne. Patricia vient vers lui. Fernand semble un
          peu en colère.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Ah te voilà, toi ! Et c'est ça que t'appelles une petite
           dînette au coin du feu, hein, dis ? Alors tu vas
           m'expliquer un petit peu maintenant, hein ?
          Elle l'entraîne dans un coin plus calme que la piste de danse.
          Elle regarde la manche déchirée de son veston.
                         
                          PATRICIA
           D'où viens-tu ?
                         
          Fernand regarde dans la direction d'un groupe, que l'on ne voit
          pas, mais qui, à l'expression affichée sur le visage de Fernand,
          sont visiblement dans une position assez intime. D'une main
          autoritaire, Patricia leur fait signe de dégager. Deux filles et
          un garçon sortent de la pièce.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           De... de chez des amis.
                         
                          PATRICIA
           Ah ! Des anciens paras ? Vous avez évoqué le bon vieux
           temps, cooptation, close combat, vous avez joué au lance-
           flamme...
                         
          Fernand pose brutalement sa sacoche sur la table, prend une
          bouteille de whisky et se sert un verre.
                         
          Un invité lui tend une petite bouteille d'eau gazeuse.
                         
                          L'INVITÉ
           Sec ou à l'eau ?
                         
          On sent que Fernand est sur le point de perdre encore son sang-
          froid. Il arrache la bouteille des mains de l'invité. Patricia
          fait à l'invité un signe discret de dégager. Celui-ci sort
          calmement, en regardant Fernand d'un oeil peu aimable.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Chez soi, ça fait plaisir, hein ?
                         
                          PATRICIA
           Oh ! Je t'ai demandé la permission d'inviter des amis,
           t'étais d'accord. Tu sais qu'ils sont tous d'excellentes
           familles ? Celui qui vient de t'offrir du scotch, tu sais
           qui c'est ? Jacques Le Tellier, le fils du contre-amiral.
                         
          Fernand boit son verre à grandes gorgées.
                         
                          PATRICIA
           Écoute, tu tiens toujours à ce que je passe mon bacho,
           alors soit logique !
                         
          Fernand récupère sa sacoche, et va pour s'éloigner, mais Patricia
          l'arrête.
                         
                          PATRICIA
           Oui, le bacho sans relations, c'est la charrue sans les
           boeufs, le tenon sans la mortaise, une nièce sans son petit
           oncle ! En fait, c'est rien. Avoue que tu n'avais jamais
           pensé à ça, hein ?
                         
          Fernand a écouté tout le petit discours de Patricia, débité sur un
          ton un peu enjôleur, avec une impatience qu'il a du mal à
          contenir.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           C'est fini, oui ?
                         
          Fernand va pour sortir, Patricia le retient de nouveau.
                         
                          PATRICIA
           Entre nous, à quoi penses-tu en général ?
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           À Montauban... on ne devrait jamais quitter Montauban !
                         
          Il dégage la main de Patricia de son épaule, et sort à grandes
          enjambées. Patricia le regarde partir en haussant les épaules.
                         
          MANOIR DU MEXICAIN - CUISINE - INTÉRIEUR NUIT
                         
          Folace est seul dans la cuisine, en costume gris, assis devant une
          table encombrée de bouteilles vides de champagne, de seau à glace,
          et surtout de tout ce qu'il faut pour confectionner des sandwiches
          et des canapés. D'ailleurs Folace beurre un canapé. La porte
          s'ouvre, Fernand entre et referme la porte derrière lui. Folace se
          tourne vers lui, et lui parle sur un ton très badin.
                         
                          MAITRE FOLACE
           Charmante soirée, n'est ce pas ? Vous savez combien ça va
           nous coûter ? Deux milles francs... nouveaux !
                         
          Fernand s'avance lentement vers la table, l'air sévère, pendant
          que Folace continue à beurrer ses canapés.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Y en a qui gaspillent, et y en a d'autres qui collectent...
                         
          Du bras, il dégage, sans ménagement, un espace libre sur la table.
          Il y dépose lourdement la sacoche, qu'il ouvre. Des billets
          débordent de la sacoche et tombent sur la table.
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Qu'est ce que vous dites de ça ? Hein ?
                         
          Folace sourit. Jean entre dans la cuisine. Fernand met la main sur
          la sacoche. Jean referme la porte, et pose son plateau sur un plan
          de travail derrière Folace.
                         
                          JEAN
           Faudrait encore des sandwichs à la purée d'anchois, ils
           partent bien ceux-là.
                         
          Il se retourne et voit la sacoche.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Les voilà, vos encaissements en retard... et encore avec
           une avance en plus.
                         
          Folace regarde la manche déchirée de Fernand.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Les Volfoni ont essayé de me flinguer, oui maître.
                          MAITRE FOLACE
           Ce n'est pourtant pas leur genre.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Et ben ça prouve qu'ils ont changé de genre. Voilà.
                         
          Jean fait le tour de la table et ouvre une porte du buffet.
                         
          Gros plan sur une boîte à biscuits. La main de Jean plonge dans la
          boîte, et en sort un pistolet, que Jean arme.
                         
          Il met le pistolet dans la poche intérieure de sa veste avec un
          petit sourire.
                         
                          JEAN
           Quand ça change, ça change, faut jamais se laisser
           démonter.
                         
                          MAITRE FOLACE
           Vous croyez qu'ils oseraient venir ici ?
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Les cons, ça ose tout ! C'est même à ça qu'on les
           reconnaît.
                         
          Bruit de sonnette insistant.

          MANOIR DU MEXICAIN - VESTIBULE - INTÉRIEUR NUIT
                         
          Plusieurs couples sont en train de danser dans le vestibule. A
          travers la vitre de la porte, on voit les visages des frères
          Volfoni. Ils continuent à sonner, mais personne, parmi les
          danseurs, ne semble les entendre. Finalement, l'une des danseuses
          se rend compte de leur présence et ouvre la porte. Raoul entre
          suivi de Paul, qui referme la porte d'un coup de pied. Ils
          regardent autour d'eux, un peu surpris.
                         
                          PAUL VOLFONI
           T'es sûr que tu t'es pas gouré de crèche.
                         
          Raoul lui répond d'un ton irrité.
                         
                          RAOUL VOLFONI
           Je me goure jamais, en rien.
                         
          Il avance à travers la foule des danseurs, suivi de son frère. Ils
          passent dans un salon.
                         
          MANOIR DU MEXICAIN - UN SALON - INTÉRIEUR NUIT
                         
          Raoul dévisage les danseurs, cherchant une tête connue. Des
          bouteilles sont posées sur un meuble. Une jeune fille se tourne
          vers eux, un verre dans chaque main.
                         
           LA JEUNE FILLE
           Scotch ou jus de fruit ?
          Paul va pour prendre le verre qu'on lui tend, mais Raoul, les
          mains enfoncées dans les poches, foudroie la fille du regard.
                         
                          RAOUL VOLFONI
           C'est rien !
                         
          La fille s'éloigne avec ses deux verres, sans demander son reste.
          Raoul la regarde partir.
                         
                          RAOUL VOLFONI
           Si c'est notre pognon qu'ils sont en train d'arroser, les
           petits comiques, ça va saigner !...
                         
          Il avise Jean au milieu des invités.
                         
                          RAOUL VOLFONI
           Dites donc, mon brave.
                         
          Jean s'avance vers eux, l'air grave.
                         
                          JEAN
           Monsieur ?
                         
                          RAOUL VOLFONI
           Il est là, votre patron ?
                         
                          JEAN
           Qui demandez-vous ?
                         
                          PAUL VOLFONI
           Monsieur Fernand Naudin.
                         
                          RAOUL VOLFONI
           Monsieur Fernand... Fernand l'emmerdeur, Fernand le
           malhonnête, c'est comme ça que je l'appelle, moi.
                         
                          JEAN
           Si ces messieurs veulent bien suivre...
          Jean s'éloigne à travers la foule des invités.
                         
                          RAOUL VOLFONI
           Et comment.
                         
          Il fait quelques pas derrière Jean, puis se retourne vers son
          frère.
                         
                          RAOUL VOLFONI
           Alors, tu viens dis !
                         
          MANOIR DU MEXICAIN - VESTIBULE - INTÉRIEUR NUIT
                         
          Jean, suivi de Raoul, puis de Paul, entre par une porte située
          derrière l'escalier. Il s'arrête devant la porte de la cuisine.
                         
                          JEAN
           Si vous voulez vous donner la peine d'entrer.
                         
          De la main, il leur montre le chemin. Raoul entre, suivi de Paul,
          sous le regard froid et sarcastique de Jean.
          MANOIR DU MEXICAIN - CUISINE - INTÉRIEUR NUIT
                         
          Folace est toujours assis à table, en train de beurrer des
          canapés. Sur la table, la sacoche, débordante de billets de
          banque, est toujours grande ouverte. Fernand est debout, en
          chemise, en train de s'essuyer les mains avec un torchon.
                         
          Raoul entre le premier, une main enfoncée dans l'une des poches de
          sa veste.
                         
                          RAOUL VOLFONI
           Bougez pas ! Les mains sur la table. Je vous préviens qu'on
           a la puissance de feu d'un croiseur et des flingues de
           concours.
                         
          Jean entre derrière eux, pistolet à la main. Il referme la porte
          de la cuisine.
                         
                          JEAN
           Si ces messieurs veulent bien me les confier...
                         
                          RAOUL VOLFONI
           Quoi ?
                         
          Patricia entrent en trombe dans la cuisine, un plateau à la main.
          Sans s'en rendre compte, elle écrase Jean entre la porte et le
          mur.
                         
                          PATRICIA
           Ah mes enfants, nous sommes en panne de sandwiches.
                         
          Elle sourit aux frères Volfoni, et pose le plateau dans l'évier
          devant Fernand.
                         
                          PATRICIA
           Tu sais, mon oncle, si tes amis veulent danser...
          Elle ramasse une assiette de canapés posée devant Folace et
          ressort. Jean, pistolet toujours pointé vers les Volfoni, claque
          la porte derrière elle.
                         
                          JEAN
           Allons vite, messieurs, quelqu'un pourrait venir, on
           pourrait se méprendre, et on jaserait. Nous venons déjà de
           frôler l'incident.
                         
          Fernand continue à s'essuyer les mains tranquillement.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Tu sais ce que je devrais faire, hmm ?... rien que pour le
           principe ?
                         
          Il jette son torchon. Folace se lève et récupère le pistolet de
          Raoul dans sa poche. Jean, planté derrière les Volfoni, les tient
          toujours en joue. Machinalement, Raoul se caresse le menton.
                         
                          RAOUL VOLFONI
           Tu trouves pas que c'est un peu rapproché ?
          Folace tâte le haut de la veste de Raoul, pour s'assurer qu'il n'a
          pas d'autre arme. Paul lui donne le pistolet qu'il tient à la
          main. Folace lui tâte le haut de la veste.
                         
                          PAUL VOLFONI
           Je te disais que cette démarche ne s'imposait pas. Au fond
           maintenant, les diplomates prendraient plutôt le pas sur
           les hommes d'action. L'époque serait aux tables rondes et à
           la détente. Hein ? Qu'est-ce t'en penses ?
                         
          Fernand les regarde longuement.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Je dis pas non.
                         
          Folace, les armes des Volfoni à la main, sourit.
                         
          Fernand s'assoit, et prend un couteau et une tranche de pain.
                         
                          RAOUL VOLFONI
           Mais dis donc, on est quand même pas venu pour beurrer des
           sandwiches ?
                         
          Fernand ne lui répond pas, et commence à beurrer la tranche de
          pain.
                         
                          PAUL VOLFONI
           Pourquoi pas ? Au contraire, les tâches ménagères ne sont
           pas sans noblesse...
                         
          Il s'assoit sur une chaise, les yeux rivés sur la sacoche
          débordante de billets de banque. Raoul reste debout, le regard
          sévère. Folace dépose les pistolets des Volfoni dans le tiroir de
          la table, puis se rassoit à sa place... devant le tiroir ! Jean
          est toujours debout près de la porte, arme au poing.
                         
                          PAUL VOLFONI
           ... surtout lorsqu'elles constituent le premier pas vers
           des négociations fructueuses. Hein ?...
                         
          Folace tend deux assiettes à Paul, une de rillettes, et une autre
          avec des tranches de pain de mie.
                         
                          PAUL VOLFONI
           Merci.
                         
          Jean regarde Fernand, puis remet son arme dans la poche intérieure
          de sa veste. Raoul lui jette un regard en coin. Jean sort de la
          cuisine. Raoul affiche un sourire un peu crispé et agite une boîte
          de bonbons, probablement des Cachou. Fernand tend la main, et
          Raoul lui dépose un bonbon dans la main. Comme il est penché sur
          la table, son regard ne peut quitter la sacoche de billets. Il
          plonge son autre main à l'intérieur, tout en continuant à agiter
          sa boîte de bonbons, sans se rendre compte que Fernand a retiré sa
          main.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Maître Folace...
                         
          Raoul se redresse, et arrête d'agiter sa boîte.
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           ... vous avez oublié de planquer les motifs de fâcherie.
                         
          Folace referme vivement la sacoche. Raoul sourit niaisement.
          Folace prend la sacoche et la dépose sous la table. Paul suit la
          sacoche du regard. Il reste néanmoins quelques billets sur la
          table.
                         
                          PAUL VOLFONI
           Oh, Monsieur Fernand...
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Tu connais la vie, Monsieur Paul...
                         
          Raoul s'assoit entre Fernand et Folace. Il remet la boîte de
          bonbons dans sa poche. Fernand et Folace se remettent à beurrer
          des tranches de pain de mie.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Mais pour en revenir au travail manuel, là, ce que vous
           disiez est finement observé. Et puis, ça reste une base.
                         
                          RAOUL VOLFONI
           Ça, c'est bien vrai, hein. Si on bricolait plus souvent, on
           aurait moins la tête aux bêtises.
                         
          Folace lui tend un couteau et une tranche de pain. Raoul commence
          à beurrer la tartine.
                         
                          RAOUL VOLFONI
           Ouais !...
                         
          On entend la porte de la cuisine qui s'ouvre.
                         
           LA JEUNE FILLE ÉMÉCHÉE (voix off)
           Jean !
          Fernand, Raoul et Folace se retournent.
                         
          Une jeune fille, visiblement éméchée, vient d'ouvrir la porte de
          la cuisine. C'est apparemment la même jeune fille, qui, quelques
          temps auparavant, réclamait déjà de l'alcool à Jean.
                         
           LA JEUNE FILLE ÉMÉCHÉE
           Ben, où il est, Jean ?
                         
          Paul, absorbé par son travail de « tartinage », n'a même pas
          relevé la tête.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Qu'est ce que vous lui voulez ?
                         
          Elle se penche sur la table en bousculant Paul.
                         
           LA JEUNE FILLE ÉMÉCHÉE
           Y a plus de glace et y a plus de scotch !
                         
          Fernand essaie de rester calme.
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Maître Folace, donnez-lui des jus de fruit, allez...
                         
                          UNE INVITEE
           Pas de jus de fruit, du scotch. Vos jus de fruit vous
           pouvez vous les...
                         
          Folace essaie de repousser la fille qui avance vers Fernand.
                         
                          MAITRE FOLACE
           Allons, mademoiselle !
                         
          Il réussit à la repousser, et prend un air très sérieux, presque
          sentencieux.
                         
                          MAITRE FOLACE
           L'oncle de Patricia vous dit qu'il n'y a plus de scotch, un
           point c'est tout.
                         
           LA JEUNE FILLE ÉMÉCHÉE
           Vous n'avez qu'à en acheter, avec ça.
                         
          Elle ramasse une poignée de billets, qui trainent encore sur la
          table.
                         
          Folace lui saisit fermement le poignet. En la voyant toucher à
          l'argent, il a instantanément changé. De calme et pondéré, il est
          devenu quasiment hystérique.
                         
                          MAITRE FOLACE
           Touche pas au grisbi, salope !
                         
          Il la regarde sauvagement, les dents serrés, les lèvres
          tremblantes et les yeux agités de tics.
                         
          Raoul et Fernand regardent la fille d'un air sombre, presque
          menaçant.
          La fille, soudain effrayée, sort en titubant de la pièce et claque
          la porte derrière elle.
                         
                          PAUL VOLFONI
           De l'alcool à cet âge-là !
                         
          Il soupire.
                         
          Fernand semble un peu énervé.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Ah non, mais c'est un scandale, hein ?
                         
                          RAOUL VOLFONI
           Ben... Nous par contre, on est des adultes... on pourrait
           peut-être s'en faire un petit ? Hein ?...
                         
          Il continue à beurrer sa tranche de pain, et regarde Fernand avec
          un petit sourire. Fernand semble calmé.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Ça, le fait est. Maître Folace ?
          Du regard, il désigne les cadavres de bouteille sur la table.
                         
          Folace se lève.
                         
                          MAITRE FOLACE
           Seulement, le tout venant a été piraté par les mômes.
           Qu'est ce qu'on fait, on se risque sur le bizarre ?
                         
          Il se penche, ouvre une porte du buffet, et en sort une bouteille
          pleine, qui contient un bon litre d'alcool. Elle ressemble à une
          petite bonbonne, avec un bouchon à vis et une petite poignée en
          verre près du goulot. Sur l'étiquette, sont dessinées trois cartes
          à jouer, avec trois rois. Au-dessus, en lettres gothiques, est
          écrit : « The Three Kings » (Les Trois Rois), et en-dessous, aussi
          en lettre gothiques, est écrit : « Scotch Whisky ».
                         
                          MAITRE FOLACE
           Ça va rajeunir personne.
                         
          Raoul regarde la bouteille en souriant.
                         
                          RAOUL VOLFONI
           Ben, nous voilà sauvés.
                         
          Folace s'assoit et commence à dévisser le bouchon de la bouteille.
                         
                          MAITRE FOLACE
           Sauvés, faut voir !
                         
          Jean entre dans la cuisine, un plateau vide à la main. Il referme
          la porte et pose son plateau sur le buffet. Il s'avance vers la
          table et regarde Folace remplir un verre.
                         
                          JEAN
           Tiens, vous avez sorti le vitriol ?
                         
          Folace tend le verre à Fernand.
                          PAUL VOLFONI
           Pourquoi vous dites ça ?
                         
                          MAITRE FOLACE
           Hé !...
                         
          Il ricane et lui tend un verre. Paul le prend et le regarde.
                         
                          PAUL VOLFONI
           Il a pourtant un air honnête.
                         
          Jean pose d'autres verres sur la table et sourit à Paul.
                         
          Fernand inspecte le contenu de son verre.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Sans être franchement malhonnête, au premier abord, comme
           ça, il... a l'air assez curieux.
                         
          Folace donne un verre à Raoul et en remplit un autre pour Jean.
                          MAITRE FOLACE
           Il date du Mexicain, du temps des grandes heures, seulement
           on a dû arrêter la fabrication, y a des clients qui
           devenaient aveugles. Alors ça faisait des histoires.
                         
          Folace remplit un autre verre pour lui-même.
                         
                          RAOUL VOLFONI
           Allez !
                         
          Il trinque avec Fernand, puis avec Folace, qui trinque aussi avec
          Fernand. Jean trinque avec Paul, et Fernand lève son verre vers
          Jean et Paul.
                         
          Raoul approche son verre de ses lèvres.
                         
          Les autres le regardent avec expectative.
                         
          Raoul finit par boire une gorgée.
                         
          Les autres le regardent avec encore plus d'attention.
                         
          Raoul baisse son verre. Il a la voix un peu rauque.
                         
                          RAOUL VOLFONI
           Ah ! Faut reconnaître...
                         
          Il a un haut-le-coeur.
                         
                          RAOUL VOLFONI
           ... c'est du brutal !
                         
          Paul, lui, a carrément les larmes aux yeux.
                         
          (NOTE - Pour la petite histoire, lors du tournage de la scène, les
          copains de Jean Lefebvre, qui jouait le rôle de Paul Volfoni, lui
          avaient fait une blague. Alors que l'accessoiriste avait mis de
          l'eau colorée dans les verres, ses copains, non seulement, lui
          avaient vraiment mis de l'alcool dans son verre à lui, mais avait
          en plus rajouté du poivre ! Ses larmes sont donc bien réelles ! -
          Cette anecdote est d'ailleurs racontée par Jean Lefebvre lui-même
          dans l'un des bonus du DVD du film.)
                         
                          PAUL VOLFONI
           Vous avez raison, il est curieux, hein ?
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           J'ai connu une polonaise qu'en prenait au petit déjeuner.
                         
          Il boit une gorgée à son tour. Et c'est avec, lui aussi, une voix
          un peu rauque, qu'il dit :
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Faut quand même admettre, c'est plutôt une boisson d'homme.
                         
          Paul s'essuie les yeux avec son mouchoir.
                         
          Raoul finit son verre, Paul aussi. Fernand se racle la gorge avant
          de finir le sien.
          Folace finit son verre, claque la langue, enlève ses lunettes et
          tombe la veste. Jean finit son verre, le pose sur la table, prend
          la bouteille et commence à resservir tout le monde.
                         
          Raoul boit une gorgée et se penche vers Fernand.
                         
                          RAOUL VOLFONI
           Tu sais pas ce qu'il me rappelle ?
                         
          Fernand secoue la tête en signe de dénégation.
                         
                          RAOUL VOLFONI
           Cette espèce de drôlerie qu'on buvait dans une petite taule
           de Biên Hoa, pas tellement loin de Saïgon. Les volets
           rouges et la taulière, une blonde komac. Comment qu'elle
           s'appelait, Nom de Dieu ?
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Lulu la Nantaise.
                         
                          RAOUL VOLFONI
           T'as connue ?
                         
          Fernand hausse les yeux au ciel.
                         
          Paul sent le contenu de son verre.
                         
                          PAUL VOLFONI
           Je lui trouve un goût de pomme.
                         
                          MAITRE FOLACE
           Y en a.
                         
          Raoul fait toujours ses confidences à Fernand.
                         
                          RAOUL VOLFONI
           Et bien, c'est devant chez elle que Lucien le Cheval s'est
           fait dessouder.
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Et par qui ? Hein ?
                         
          Raoul réfléchit, mais ne trouve pas la réponse.
                         
                          RAOUL VOLFONI
           Ben voilà que j'ai plus ma tête.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Par Teddy de Montréal, un fondu qui travaillait qu'à la
           dynamite.
                         
          Fernand prend la bouteille pour se resservir. Il sert d'abord
          Raoul.
                         
                          RAOUL VOLFONI
           Toute une époque !
                         
          Fernand hoche la tête.
                         
          MANOIR DU MEXICAIN - SALON - INTÉRIEUR NUIT
          C'est maintenant le temps des « slows » avec une musique plus
          douce. Derrière la vitrine « napoléonienne », un couple est en
          train de danser.
                         
          Patricia entre dans la pièce avec une assiette à la main. Elle se
          dirige vers Antoine, qui semble un peu rêveur.
                         
                          PATRICIA
           Tu boudes ?
                         
          Antoine répond d'une voix douce, presque en chuchotant
                         
                          ANTOINE DELAFOY
           Bouder moi, tu plaisantes... N'empêche que je commence à en
           avoir assez, moi, des amours clandestines. S'embrasser par
           téléphone... même deux fois par jour, c'est bien mignon,
           mais je suis un homme, moi, tu comprends ? Tout ça à cause
           de ton oncle. Écoute, c'est vraiment trop bête, on dirait
           que vous avez tous peur de lui. Mais je vais aller lui
           parler, moi.
                         
                          PATRICIA
           Tu vas lui parler de quoi ?
                         
          Antoine embrasse tendrement Patricia sur la bouche.
                         
                          ANTOINE DELAFOY
           Je vais lui parler de notre mariage, de toi, de moi, de
           nous.
                         
                          PATRICIA
           Répète un peu ce que tu viens de dire !
                         
          Antoine lui dépose un petit bécot sur les lèvres.
                         
                          ANTOINE DELAFOY
           De toi, de moi.
                          PATRICIA
           Oh non, juste le premier mot. C'était le meilleur.

          Fernand vide le fond de la bouteille dans le verre de Jean. Tout
          le monde est maintenant en chemise, sauf Paul et Jean. Folace
          parle d'une voix visiblement très embuée par l'alcool.
                         
                          MAITRE FOLACE
           D'accord, d'accord, je dis pas qu'à la fin de sa vie, Jo le
           Trembleur, il avait pas un peu baissé. Mais n'empêche que,
           pendant les années terribles, sous l'occup', il butait à
           tout va. Il a quand même décimé toute une division de
           panzers. Ah !
                         
                          RAOUL VOLFONI
           Il était dans les chars ?
                         
                          MAITRE FOLACE
           Non, dans la limonade...
          Il frappe sur l'épaule de Raoul.
                         
                          MAITRE FOLACE
           Sois à ce qu'on te dit !
                         
          Raoul se met à pleurnicher.
                         
                          RAOUL VOLFONI
           Mais j'ai plus ma tête...
                         
                          MAITRE FOLACE
           Il avait son secret, le Jo.
                         
          Il essaie de remettre ses lunettes, mais n'y arrive pas et se
          plante les branches dans les yeux. D'un seul coup, Raoul
          écarquille les yeux. Il se lève lentement, très raide.
                         
                          RAOUL VOLFONI
           C'est où ?
                         
          Jean se lève avec difficulté de sa chaise.
                         
                          JEAN
           A droite, au fond du couloir.
                         
          Raoul sort précipitamment de la cuisine et referme la porte
          derrière lui. Folace a fini par arriver à remettre ses lunettes.
          Jean se rassoit.
                         
                          MAITRE FOLACE
           Et... Et... Et... cinquante kilos de patates, un sac de
           sciure de bois, il te sortait vingt-cinq litres de trois
           étoiles à l'alambic. Un vrai magicien, le Jo.
                         
          Il frappe violemment de la main sur la table et hausse le ton.
                         
                          MAITRE FOLACE
           Et c'est pour ça que je permets d'intimer l'ordre à
           certains salisseurs de mémoire qu'ils feraient mieux de
           fermer leur claque-merde ! Ah !
                         
          Fernand se racle la gorge.
                         
          Folace essaie, avec beaucoup de difficulté, d'introduire une
          cigarette dans son fume-cigarette. Paul le regarde, les yeux dans
          le vague.
                         
                          PAUL VOLFONI
           Vous avez beau dire, y a pas seulement que de la pomme, y a
           autre chose, ce serait pas des fois de la betterave ?
           Hein ?
                         
          Fernand dodeline de la tête.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Si, y en a aussi.
                         
          Paul sourit.
          MANOIR DU MEXICAIN - SALON - INTÉRIEUR NUIT
                         
          Debout et appuyé des deux mains sur la table, Raoul, toujours bien
          éméché, fait les yeux doux à Patricia.
                         
                          RAOUL VOLFONI
           On vous apprend quoi, à l'école, mon petit chat ? Les
           jolies filles en savent toujours trop. Vous savez comment
           je le vois, votre avenir ? Vous voulez le savoir ?
                         
          Raoul lâche la table, mais a du mal à tenir debout. Il fait
          quelques pas vers Patricia, qui s'écarte en riant.
                         
                          PATRICIA
           Non, non, non, non, non, non...
                         
          Il se raccroche à la table en affichant un sourire niais.
                         
                          RAOUL VOLFONI
           Ben, je vais vous le dire quand même...
                         
          Patricia l'écoute, bouche ouverte, ayant du mal à retenir son
          hilarité.
                         
                          RAOUL VOLFONI
           Je vois une carrière internationale, des voyages, ouais,
           l'Égypte par exemple, c'est pas commun ça, l'Égypte ? Et
           puis, ce qui a de bien c'est que, là-bas, l'artiste est
           toujours gâtée.
                         
          Patricia met la main devant sa bouche pour masquer son fou-rire.
          Elle regarde vers Antoine, qui vient d'entrer dans la pièce.
                         
           ANTOINE DELAFOY (voix off)
           Patricia ?...
                         
          En voyant entrer un « rival », Raoul affiche maintenant un petit
          air pincé, avec les yeux outrageusement plissés.
          Antoine, lui, contrairement à Patricia, ne semble pas trouver la
          scène très drôle, et c'est d'une voix sèche qu'il s'adresse à
          Raoul.
                         
                          ANTOINE DELAFOY
           Monsieur désire un... renseignement ?
                         
          Patricia lui répond sur un ton badin.
                         
                          PATRICIA
           Non, monsieur me proposait une tournée en Égypte.
                         
                          ANTOINE DELAFOY
           Hein ?
                         
          Raoul se sent soudain un peu décontenancé devant l'allure
          autoritaire d'Antoine.
                         
                          RAOUL VOLFONI
           Non, je disais l'Égypte... comme ça ! J'aurais aussi bien
           pu dire... le Liban.
                          ANTOINE DELAFOY
           Je vois, Monsieur dirige sans doute une agence de voyage ?
                         
                          PATRICIA
           Mais non, voyons, chéri, Monsieur fait la traite des
           blanches, mais tu sais que c'est courant. Allez, viens !
                         
          Antoine semble soudain très en colère, et Patricia l'entraine hors
          de la pièce.
                         
          Raoul soupire d'un air désabusé. Il frappe des mains l'une contre
          l'autre.
                         
          MANOIR DU MEXICAIN - CUISINE - INTÉRIEUR NUIT
                         
          Folace ronfle, affalé sur la table. Devant lui, la bouteille vide
          de whisky frelaté. Une main pose une autre bouteille, légèrement
          entamée, du même whisky frelaté à côté de la première.
                         
          Fernand attrape un morceau de pain de mie, dans une assiette, et
          le regarde avec des yeux vagues.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Je reprendrais bien quelque chose de consistant, moi !
                         
          Il mord dans le morceau de pain.
                         
          En face de lui, Paul mâchouille, lui aussi, un morceau de pain.
          Assis à côté de Fernand, Jean est, lui aussi, en train de manger.
          Raoul entre dans la cuisine, d'un pas titubant, referme la porte,
          et s'approche de la table. Sa présence réveille Folace.
                         
                          RAOUL VOLFONI
           Dis donc... elle est maquée à un jaloux, ta nièce ? Hein ?
           Je lui faisais un brin de causette, le genre réservé, tu me
           connais, mousse et pampre, voilà tout d'un coup qu'un petit
           cave est venu me chercher, les gros mots et tout !
          Fernand se lève lentement. Il a, comme Raoul, du mal à tenir
          debout.
                         
          Raoul est soudain un peu effrayé par le regard menaçant de
          Fernand, qu'il pense lui être adressé.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Quoi ? Monsieur Antoine !
                         
          Fernand fait le tour de la table, un sourire narquois aux lèvres.
          Folace se lève et le suit.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Il s'agit pas de lui faire franchir les portes, il faut
           peut-être le faire passer à travers.
                         
          Il ouvre brusquement la porte de la cuisine, et sort, suivi par
          Folace.
                         
          Raoul regarde Jean d'un air interrogateur.
          Jean termine tranquillement son verre
                         
                          JEAN
           Je serais pas étonné qu'on ferme !

          Fernand attrape Antoine par le bras et le pousse vers le
          vestibule.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Dehors tout le monde ! Allez les petites filles, au dodo !
           Dehors !...
                         
          Antoine se dirige vers le vestibule, suivi par Fernand et Folace.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Et les familles françaises, ça se respecte, monsieur. Les
           foyers c'est pas des putes, hein !
                         
                          ANTOINE DELAFOY
           Une seule excuse, monsieur, à cet excès de familiarité,
           c'est l'excès de boisson.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Oh ! Mais...
                         
          Il se tourne vers Folace.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Qui qu'a bu ? Hein ?
                         
                          MAITRE FOLACE
           Oh ! Du jus de pommes.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Le tact, moi, monsieur Antoine et à toute la bande... Allez
           hop.
          Il pousse Antoine à travers le vestibule, sous les regards médusés
          des autres invités. Folace revient vers l'intérieur de la pièce.
                         
                          MAITRE FOLACE
           Allez, allez dehors, on ferme.

          Fernand pousse Antoine à travers tout le vestibule jusqu'à la
          porte d'entrée, que Jean vient obligeamment d'ouvrir.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Allez, allez, allez, allez...
                         
          Il le pousse dehors. Les autres invités, choqués, commentent
          l'évènement, mais, avec le bruit et la musique, on ne comprend pas
          leurs paroles.

          Folace pousse tous les occupants du salon vers le vestibule.
                          MAITRE FOLACE
           Allez, allez, allez, allez, allez...

          Folace continue à pousser les invités vers la porte d'entrée.
                         
                          MAITRE FOLACE
           La sortie c'est par là. Allez oust.
                         
          Un invité essaie de résister à la poussée de Folace en
          s'accrochant à un meuble.
                         
                          MAITRE FOLACE
           On retire sa main de là. Allez, allez.

          Raoul, l'oeil égrillard, pousse les jeunes gens vers la sortie, et
          en profite pour tripoter les filles au passage. Plusieurs filles
          crient.
                         
           MAITRE FOLACE (voix off)
           Barrez-vous, je vous dis. Barrez-vous.

          Devant la porte d'entrée, Fernand et Folace pousse les invités
          dehors.
                         
          Au fond du vestibule, derrière l'escalier, Paul pousse les
          retardataires.
                         
                          PAUL VOLFONI
           Allez au lit, au lit tout ça.
                         
          Devant la porte d'entrée, Raoul s'est joint à Fernand et Folace
          pour pousser les invités dehors. Ils ne se rendent pas compte que,
          pris par leur élan, ils poussent aussi Paul dehors. Fernand et
          Jean referment la porte sur le dernier invité. Fernand, Raoul et
          Folace éclatent de rire. Jean les regarde, l'oeil vague, mais sans
          rire. A travers la vitre de la porte, on aperçoit le visage de
          Paul. Il ouvre lentement la porte. En le voyant, les trois hommes
          redoublent de rire. Fernand est même obligé de s'asseoir. Mais
          Jean, lui, ne rit toujours pas. Il fait signe à Fernand de
          regarder vers l'escalier.
                         
          Fernand s'arrête de rire et regarde vers l'escalier. Raoul et
          Folace, debout à côté de lui, s'arrêtent aussi de rire, et
          regardent vers l'escalier.
                         
          A mi-chemin de la première volée de marches, Patricia les regarde
          avec une grande tristesse dans le regard.
                         
          Fernand se lève et regarde vers l'escalier. Il titube un peu et se
          masse le visage. Il regarde Jean, puis s'avance vers l'escalier.
                         
          Folace et Raoul regardent Patricia, visiblement mal à leur aise.
          Raoul a trouvé un verre à moitié plein, qu'il tient à la main.
          Fernand, les mains derrière le dos, se tourne vers ses amis, puis
          continue à avancer vers l'escalier.
                         
          Patricia est maintenant en larmes. Elle se retourne et finit de
          monter l'escalier quatre à quatre.
                         
          Fernand se tourne vers Raoul et Folace.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND

          Folace se met à ricaner d'un rire d'ivrogne, qui devient un fou-
          rire. Les autres le regardent.
                         
          Fondu au noir.

          Fernand est allongé sur le ventre, en pyjama. Folace, lui aussi en
          pyjama, le secoue.
                         
                          MAITRE FOLACE
           Hé... Hé oh !... Oh ! Réveillez-vous ! Réveillez-vous !
                         
          Fernand se redresse lentement sur son lit, mais il perd
          l'équilibre et retombe à plat ventre, presque en dehors du lit.
          Folace l'aide à se relever. Fernand regarde Folace avec des petits
          yeux, et la bouche visiblement pâteuse.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Mais qu'est ce que vous faîtes là, vous ?
                         
                          MAITRE FOLACE
           J'ai le regret de vous faire savoir que Mademoiselle
           Patricia ne s'est pas rendue à son cours ce matin.
                         
          Fernand se masse le visage.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Quoi ?
                         
          Folace se penche sur lui et hausse le ton.
                         
                          MAITRE FOLACE
           Patricia... n'est pas allée aux cours ce matin.
           L'institution vient de téléphoner.
                         
          Fernand se lève du lit... avec une certaine difficulté.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Bien, je vous garantis qu'elle va y aller, à son cours.
           Elle va même y aller tout de suite, hein !
                         
          Il finit de se lever et enfile sa robe de chambre, aidé par
          Folace.

          Fernand traverse le palier, suivi par Folace, qui continue à
          l'aider à mettre sa robe de chambre. Jean, toujours aussi
          imperturbable dans sa veste blanche, les regarde passer. Fernand
          et Folace entrent dans la chambre de Patricia.

          Il finit par s'asseoir sur le lit.

                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Quel est le rapport ?

           Suzanne « Beau Sourire » a été élevée à Bagneux sur la
           zone. Et, à seize ans, elle était sujet vedette chez Madame
           Reine. Alors je vous répète, je vois pas le rapport.

           non ? Sa fille recherchée par les perdreaux. Ah, y a
           vraiment des jours où vous déconnez ferme, hein ? Jean !
                         
          Jean entre dans la chambre.
                         
                          JEAN

          Fernand se tourne vers Folace, l'air ahuri.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND

          Il se met à marcher de long en large dans la pièce.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Bon dieu, c'est pas vrai, non mais c'est pas vrai.

           ses valoches et vous, vous trouvez ça naturel, vous ?

           Ah, on peut dire que je suis comblé.
                         
          Il noue la ceinture de sa robe de chambre.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Merci Messieurs, merci ! Ah oui !
                         
          Jean sourit à Folace, et sort un petit papier de la poche
          pectorale de sa veste.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Qu'est-ce que c'est que ça ?
          Jean a ouvert le papier sur lequel est écrit : « POR 89 89 » et
          en-dessous : « 5532 NA 75 ».
                         
          (NOTE - Jusqu'en 1963, année de la sortie du film, à Paris, les
          indicatifs téléphoniques n'étaient, non pas des chiffres, mais des
          lettres correspondant aux trois premières lettres du nom du
          central auquel ils étaient rattachés. POR correspond donc à Port-
          Royal. Quant à ce qui est écrit sous ce numéro de téléphone, il
          s'agit du numéro d'immatriculation du taxi, tel que les
          immatriculations étaient en vigueur jusqu'en octobre 2009. Les
          deux derniers chiffres, 75, signifient que le taxi est immatriculé
                         À PARIS)
                         
                          JEAN
           C'est le numéro du radio-taxi qu'elle a pris.
                         
          Folace sourit. Jean se tourne vers lui, et lui dit, sur un ton un
                         PEU SEC :
                         
                          JEAN
           Yes sir !
           (Traduction : Oui, monsieur !)
                         
          Le sourire de Folace s'efface de son visage. Jean, lui, sourit
          béatement.

          A travers le pare-brise, on voit le chauffeur du taxi, et assis
          derrière lui, Fernand, portant un costume sombre. Il pointe du

                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Vous êtes sûr que c'est là ?
                         
           CHAUFFEUR DU TAXI
           Un peu, j'ai coltiné les bagages à la troisième baraque.
                         
          Du doigt, il désigne l'immeuble.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Non mais, elle est folle ?
                         
          Il ouvre la porte et sort du taxi.
                         
           CHAUFFEUR DU TAXI
           C'est ce qu'on a toujours tendance à croire chaque fois
           qu'elles nous font la malle.

          Plan pris de l'intérieur du taxi, comme si la caméra était posé
          sur le siège passager avant.
          Fernand se penche par la vitre ouverte du chauffeur.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Attendez-moi, j'en ai pour cinq minutes.
                         
           CHAUFFEUR DU TAXI
           Ah, j'aimerais mieux que vous appeliez un collègue.
                         
          PARIS - UNE PETITE RUE - INTÉRIEUR JOUR
                         
          Plan rapproché du chauffeur, vu par sa vitre ouverte.
                         
           CHAUFFEUR DU TAXI
           Si la petite dame me voit, j'aurais le vilain rôle.
           Comprenez... cafarder, c'est pas beau.
                         
          Il jette un oeil sur le compteur.
                         
           CHAUFFEUR DU TAXI
           Six cinquante... Et puis nous, dans le métier, les
           ruptures, les retrouvailles, toutes les fluctuations de la
           fesse, on préfère pas s'en mêler.
          Fernand sort une liasse de billets, et en extrait un qu'il donne
          au chauffeur, qui le met dans la poche pectorale de sa veste.
                         
           CHAUFFEUR DU TAXI
           Moi j'ai un collègue comme ça, transporteur de cocus, y
           s'est retrouvé criblé en plein jour, rue Godeau, par une
           maladroite.
                         
          Fernand tapote nerveusement sur le rebord de la vitre baissée. Le
          chauffeur sort de la monnaie de sa poche et tend une pièce à
          Fernand.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Oui, bon ben, ça va, ça va !
                         
           CHAUFFEUR DU TAXI
           Voilà, monsieur, merci bien...
                         
          Fernand lui met une grosse poignée de pièces dans la main, et
          s'éloigne.
                         
           CHAUFFEUR DU TAXI
           Merci... Hé !...
                         
          Fernand qui avait commencé à remonter la ruelle, se retourne vers
          le taxi.
                         
          Le chauffeur lui adresse un gentil sourire.
                         
           CHAUFFEUR DU TAXI
           Soyez quand même pas trop dur...
                         
          IMMEUBLE D'ANTOINE - PALIER - INTÉRIEUR JOUR
                         
          Gros plan sur la porte de l'appartement d'Antoine Delafoy. Un
          porte-carte est vissé sur la porte, porte-carte dans lequel est
          glissé une carte de visite, sur laquelle est inscrit : « Antoine
          Delafoy », et en-dessous : « Compositeur ».
                         
          On entend deux coups frappés sur la porte, puis le gros plan se
          déplace de la carte de visite vers la poignée de la porte. La main
          de Fernand tourne la poignée et la porte s'ouvre. On voit la
          silhouette de Fernand entrer dans l'appartement.
                         
          APPARTEMENT D'ANTOINE - COULOIR - INTÉRIEUR JOUR
                         
          Bruit de percussions « musicales ».
                         
          Fernand entre dans le couloir d'entrée de l'appartement, qui est
          situé sous les toits de l'immeuble. La partie haute du mur, côté
          toit, est inclinée. Et les fenêtres sont des lucarnes. Fernand
          referme la porte derrière lui. Il avance dans le couloir, se
          dirigeant vers le son des percussions.
                         
          APPARTEMENT D'ANTOINE - SÉJOUR - INTÉRIEUR JOUR
                         
          La salle de séjour de l'appartement est une grande pièce, sur les
          murs desquels sont accrochés plusieurs instruments de musique
          conventionnels. Du plafond pendent des cordes sur lesquelles sont
          accrochés des tubes de verre. Dans un angle, un grand canapé de
          forme arrondie. Plusieurs fauteuils sont disséminés dans la pièce
                         
          Devant Fernand, une structure métallique supporte divers
          instruments de percussions, certains reconnaissables, comme une
          cymbale, d'autres inventés par le « compositeur », par exemple des
          pièces métalliques qui tournent sur un axe vertical.
                         
          Travelling le long de la structure métallique. Des balles de ping-
          pong tombent sur la cymbale, sur laquelle elles rebondissent. A
          côté de la cymbale, un bocal de verre contient d'autres balles de
          ping-pong, puis on découvre divers récipients de chimiste, puis
          des robinets. Les deux derniers robinets semblent un peu antiques.
          Ces robinets laissent tous couler des filets d'eau, d'importance
          variable d'un robinet à l'autre. Des micros sur pied sont posés
          devant la structure métallique. Le travelling se termine sur
          Antoine assis devant une table installée devant une grande baie
          vitrée. Sur cette table, sont posés trois magnétophones. Des
          ventilateurs et une girouette tournent à côté d'Antoine. De l'eau
          glou-gloute dans un bocal.
                         
          Antoine, sentant une présence, se retourne, et découvre Fernand,
          debout, les poings sur les hanches.
                         
                          ANTOINE DELAFOY
           Ah Nom de Dieu de Nom de Dieu, mais où faut-il s'expatrier,
           mon Dieu, pour avoir la paix ? Au Groenland, à la Terre de
           Feu ? J'allais toucher l'anti-accord absolu, vous
           entendez ?... Absolu. La musique des sphères... Mais
           qu'est-ce que j'essaie de vous faire comprendre, homme-
           singe !
                         
          Le discours d'Antoine a été débité sur un ton assez passionné, qui
          ne semble pas impressionner Fernand. Surtout, il ne semble pas
          beaucoup apprécier les robinets.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Vous permettez ?
          Il tourne la manette d'un robinet pour l'arrêter. Antoine pose sa
          main sur la sienne.
                         
                          ANTOINE DELAFOY
           Ah non !
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Monsieur Delafoy, quand vous en aurez terminé avec vos
           instruments de ménage...
                         
          Il ferme tous les robinets un par un.
                         
                          ANTOINE DELAFOY
           Oh, j'attendais ça...
                         
          La voix un peu stridente d'Antoine semble indisposer Fernand, qui
          ressent encore les effets de sa cuite de la veille.
                         
                          ANTOINE DELAFOY
           ... mes instruments de ménage ? L'ironie du primate,
           l'humour Louis-Philippard, le sarcasme Prudhommesque.
          Il se déplace de long en large dans la pièce.
                         
                          ANTOINE DELAFOY
           Monsieur Naudin, vous faites sans doute autorité en matière
           de Bulldozer, tracteur et Caterpillar, mais vos opinions
           sur la musique moderne et sur l'art en général, je vous
           conseille de ne les utiliser qu'en suppositoires. Voilà !
           Et encore, pour enfant. J'ajouterais qu'ayant dormi à la
           porte de chez vous, je comprends mal...
                         
          Il s'avance vers sa table de travail et arrête ses magnétophones.
          Fernand se masse les yeux. Les balles de ping-pong, elles,
          continuent de rebondir sur la cymbale.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Où est Patricia ?
                         
                          ANTOINE DELAFOY
           Je comprends mal, disais-je, votre présence chez moi !
                         
          Fernand, très énervé maintenant, hausse la voix.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Où est Patricia ?
                         
           PATRICIA (voix off)
           Ici, mon oncle...
                         
          Patricia vient d'apparaître à la porte de la cuisine, portant un
          petit tablier de soubrette sur sa robe. Fernand s'avance vers
          elle.
                         
                          PATRICIA
           Bonjour !
                         
          On entend toujours, en fond sonore, la musique « moderne »
          d'Antoine.
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Mais enfin... Comment Patricia, mais... qu'est-ce que tu
           fais là ? Qu'est ce que ça veut dire, tout ça ?
                         
          Patricia, de la main, lui désigne l'intérieur de la cuisine.
                         
                          PATRICIA
           Tu vois, je civette, je bain-marise, je ragougnasse. Bref,
           je donne à Antoine tout apaisement dans l'avenir. Logique
           non ? Il doit passer sa vie avec moi.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Passer sa vie ?
                         
          Patricia s'avance vers Fernand.
                         
                          PATRICIA
           Naturellement, tu restes déjeuner avec nous ? Chéri !
                         
                          ANTOINE DELAFOY
           Oui ?
                          PATRICIA
           Tu devrais descendre chez l'Italien, je crois que nous
           allons manquer de vin.
                         
                          ANTOINE DELAFOY
           Oncle Fernand préfère le Bordeaux ou le Bourgogne ?
                         
          Fernand se masse les tempes, et Antoine préfère ne pas insister.
                         
                          ANTOINE DELAFOY
           Hein ?... Ben, on prendra les deux.
                         
          Il s'éloigne pour se préparer à sortir. Fernand continue à se
          masser les tempes. Patricia s'en aperçoit et le regarde avec
          inquiétude.
                         
                          PATRICIA
           Ça ne va pas, qu'est-ce que tu as ?
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Rien... Je deviens louf, c'est tout !
                         
           PATRICIA (voix off)
           Oh, mon civet qui brûle !
                         
          APPARTEMENT D'ANTOINE - CUISINE - INTÉRIEUR JOUR
                         
          Dans la cuisine, Patricia soulève le couvercle d'une cocotte,
          souffle dans la cocotte et touille sa cuisine avec une cuiller en
          bois. Par la porte ouverte, on aperçoit Fernand, toujours debout
          au milieu du séjour.
                         
                          PATRICIA
           Tu peux venir, tu sais.
                         
          Elle tourne la tête vers Fernand, qui s'avance lentement vers
          elle.
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Écoute Patricia... Qu'est ce qui t'a pris de partir comme
           ça ? Hein ? Tu nous a fais faire un mauvais sang du diable,
           quoi !
                         
          Patricia lui met sa cuiller en bois dans la bouche.
                         
                          PATRICIA
           Qu'est ce qui t'a pris de mettre Antoine à la porte ?
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Tu veux mon avis ?
                         
                          PATRICIA
           C'est bien pour ça que je te le fais goûter.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Et bien, il manque du sel.
                         
          Fernand s'énerve un peu.
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Non, mais c'est pas de ça qu'il s'agit, c'est de mon avis
           sur ton Antoine.
                         
                          PATRICIA
           Mon Antoine, tu ne crois pas si bien dire...
                         
          Elle ouvre le freezer de son réfrigérateur
                         
                          PATRICIA
           ... il m'épouse.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Non, non, non, Patricia, attention, ne nous emballons pas,
           hein ! D'abord est-ce que tu l'aimes ? Ben... Est-ce que tu
           l'aimes assez pour l'épouser ?
                         
          Elle a sorti un bac à glaçons du réfrigérateur et le referme.
                         
                          PATRICIA
           Oh, presque trop, c'est du gâchis. Ça méritait une liaison
           malheureuse, tragique, quelque chose d'Espagnol, même de
           Russe.
                         
          Elle démoule les glaçons dans un petit seau en verre.
                         
                          PATRICIA
           Allez, viens donc boire un petit Scotch, va, ça te fera
           oublier ceux d'hier.
                         
          Elle s'approche de Fernand.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Hier, j'ai rien bu. Alors, pas ça !
                         
          Il joint le geste à la parole en mettant l'ongle de son pouce sur
          ses incisives supérieures.
          Elle sort de la cuisine.

          Patricia s'approche de la table sur laquelle sont disposés les
          apéritifs.
                         
                          PATRICIA
           Alors, pourquoi tu déambulais toute la nuit ? Tu as même
           fait couler deux bains.
                         
          Fernand entre lentement dans la salle de séjour. Il semble un peu
          mal à son aise.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Les nerfs !...
                         
          Il passe derrière elle en se frottant un peu nerveusement les
          mains.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Dis moi, tu comptes rentrer pas trop tard.
          Il s'assoit dans un fauteuil.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Oui, il faudrait pas que la future belle-famille aille
           s'imaginer que... que nous menons une vie de bohème, quand
           même.
                         
          Patricia donne un verre à Fernand.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Parce que ton Antoine, il est bien gentil avec ses airs...
           là... Mais tu vas voir qu'il va nous faire surgir une
           famille, comme tout le monde.
                         
          Fondu enchaîné.
                         
          Un peu plus tard.
                         
          Antoine marche de long en large dans la pièce, circulant entre les
          nombreux objets de verre qui pendent du plafond. Derrière lui,
          Patricia débarrasse la table.
                         
                          ANTOINE DELAFOY
           Bref, seul rescapé d'une famille ébranlée par les guerres
           coloniales, les divorces et les accidents de la route,
           papa, Adolphe Amédée Delafoy dit « Le Président », un
           personnage... Il collectionne les pendules et les
           contraventions, les déceptions sentimentales et les
           décorations. Il les a toutes sauf la médaille de sauvetage,
           la plus belle selon lui, mais la plus difficile à décrocher
           quand on est pas breton.
                         
          Fernand l'écoute, affalé dans un fauteuil, en chemise et un cigare
          au bec. Du pied, il fait sonner l'un des objets de percussion en
          verre qui pendent du plafond.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Un homme curieux, dîtes-donc !
                         
                          ANTOINE DELAFOY
           Un père... Adolphe-Amédée témoigne en matière d'art de
           perversion assez voisine des vôtres, défenseur de Puvis de
           Chavannes et de Reynaldo Hahn...
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Connais pas.
                         
                          ANTOINE DELAFOY
           Lui, si ! A part ça, ce qu'il est convenu d'appeler un
           grand honnête homme. Porté sur la morale et les soubrettes,
           la religion et les jetons de présence... Vous connaissez sa
           dernière ? Il vient de se faire bombarder vice-président du
           Fond Monétaire International.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Oh ?
                         
          Fernand semble soudain très intéressé. Il se met à téter son
          cigare d'un air pensif. Derrière lui, Patricia, toujours occupé à
          débarrasser la table, le regarde avec attention.
                         
                          PATRICIA
           A quoi penses-tu ?
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Fond Monétaire...
                         
          Il fait un clin d'oeil à Patricia.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           ... pas bête, ça, tu sais !
                         
          MANOIR DU MEXICAIN - EXTÉRIEUR JOUR
                         
          Dans le parc du manoir, Théo est debout près d'un petit kiosque en
          bois.
                         
          Un peu plus loin, son ami, caché par un arbre, observe le manoir,
          et plus particulièrement la chambre de Fernand.
                         
          MANOIR DU MEXICAIN - CHAMBRE DE FERNAND - INTÉRIEUR JOUR
                         
          Jean ouvre les rideaux et laisse entrer la lumière dans la pièce.
          Puis il tourne la poignée de la fenêtre.
                         
           JEAN, MAÎTRE FOLACE ET PATRICIA (voix off)
           Happy birthday to you, happy birthday to you...
                         
          Fernand, allongé en pyjama dans son lit, ouvre les yeux, et
          regarde ce qui se passe au pied de son lit.
                         
          Debout devant le pied du lit, Folace, en robe de chambre sombre,
          tient un petit paquet à la main. A côté de lui, Patricia, déjà
          habillée d'une robe claire, avec un collier de perles autour du
          cou, tient un paquet plus grand derrière son dos. Jean revient de
          la fenêtre, qu'il vient d'ouvrir, et se positionne à côté de
          Patricia. Lui aussi est déjà habillé en veste blanche, et tient un
          petit paquet à la main. Ils chantent tous trois, avec beaucoup de
          conviction... mais un peu faux !
                         
           JEAN, MAÎTRE FOLACE ET PATRICIA
           ... happy birthday, Fernand... happy birthday to you !
                         
          Patricia s'approche du lit.
                         
                          PATRICIA
           Bon anniversaire, mon Oncle !
                         
          Elle l'embrasse sur les deux joues et pose son paquet sur le lit.
                         
          Maître tend son petit paquet vers le lit avec un grand sourire.
                         
                          MAITRE FOLACE
           Joyeux anniversaire, mon cher.
                         
          Quelqu'un, que l'on ne voit pas (peut-être Patricia) lui prend le
          paquet des mains.
                         
          Fernand ouvre le paquet et en sort un stylo.
          Jean, à son tour, offre son cadeau à Fernand.
                         
                          JEAN
           Good health and happiness, Sir !... Santé et prospérité,
           Sir !
           (Traduction exacte : Bonne santé et bonheur, monsieur)
                         
          Gros plan sur le cadeau de Jean : une pipe. Fernand la retourne
          dans sa main.
                         
          Il la porte à sa bouche, et aspire un peu pour vérifier le tirage.
          Il sourit.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           C'est vraiment trop gentil.
                         
          Patricia ramasse un autre paquet, posé sur la table à côté du
          plateau du petit-déjeuner.
                         
                          PATRICIA
           On m'a apporté celui-là tout à l'heure.
                         
          Elle s'approche du lit, tout en lisant ce qui est écrit sur le
          paquet.
                         
                          PATRICIA
           Expéditeur : Volfoni frères.
                         
          Fernand tourne vers lui le paquet, que Patricia tient toujours
          dans ses mains. A son tour, il lit ce qui est écrit sur le paquet.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           On a beau avoir fait la paix, ça fait quand même quelque
           chose.
                         
          Il regarde Folace, dont on ne voit pas le visage, mais qui doit
          sembler dubitatif, car Fernand ajoute :
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Oh si... Je dois dire que le geste est délicat.
                         
          Patricia porte le paquet à son oreille.
                         
                          PATRICIA
           C'est sûrement une pendule, écoute !
                         
          On entend un tic-tac provenant du paquet.
                         
          Patricia met le paquet contre l'oreille de Fernand. D'un seul
          coup, le visage de Fernand s'assombrit. Il arrache le paquet des
          mains de Patricia, puis il se redresse vivement sur son lit, et
          lance le paquet sur la pelouse par la fenêtre ouverte.
                         
          Par la fenêtre, on voit le paquet qui explose sur la pelouse,
          envoyant valdinguer les chaises de jardin, dont certaines se
          cassent en plusieurs morceaux.
                         
          MANOIR DU MEXICAIN - EXTÉRIEUR JOUR
          L'ami de Fernand s'éloigne de sa cachette, revenant vers Théo.
          Derrière lui, près du manoir, on voit la fumée de l'explosion qui
          se dissipe lentement.

          PÉNICHE - BUREAU - INTÉRIEUR JOUR
                         
          Plan rapproché sur le verrou de la porte, qui est ouvert. On
          frappe, puis on ouvre la porte. Fernand est debout dans
          l'encadrement, le visage menaçant. Derrière lui, on voit le bar de
          la salle de jeu, et devant le bar, un homme qui nettoie le tapis
          de jeu. Fernand chante, les dents serrées.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Happy birthday to you...
                         
          Raoul regarde Fernand d'un oeil surpris et interrogateur.
                         
           MONSIEUR FERNAND (voix off)
           ... Happy birthday to you...
                         
          Retour sur Fernand qui continue à chanter.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           ... Happy birthday to you-ou-ou, Happy birthday to you...
                         
          Le poing de Fernand se détend, et frappe Raoul.
                         
          Raoul part à reculons en titubant, et s'écroule contre le mur d'en
          face.
                         
          Paul, assis au bureau, ferme précipitamment le coffre-fort. Puis
          il regarde son frère assis par terre. Il se lève, et marche
          lentement vers lui. Il regarde par la porte, qui est restée
          ouverte, la ferme rapidement et tourne le verrou. Il revient
          ensuite vers son frère, toujours assis par terre contre le mur.
                          PAUL VOLFONI
           Il est parti.
                         
          Raoul ouvre les yeux et regarde son frère.
                         
                          RAOUL VOLFONI
           Non mais, t'a déjà vu ça ? En pleine paix, il chante, et
           puis crac ! un bourre-pif ! Mais il est complètement fou,
           ce mec.
                         
          Il se lève. Paul se précipite pour l'aider.
                         
                          RAOUL VOLFONI
           Mais moi, les dingues, je les soigne.
                         
          Il se dirige vers un secrétaire, suivi par Paul, qui le soutient.
          Il relève la porte du secrétaire, et la coulisse dans la partie
          supérieur du meuble pour la maintenir ouverte.
                         
                          RAOUL VOLFONI
           Je vais lui faire une ordonnance... et une sévère...
          Il s'assoit sur une chaise, et du secrétaire, il sort un paquet de
          bâtons de dynamite liés ensembles. Sur les bâtons de dynamite, est
          fixé une grenade.
                         
                          RAOUL VOLFONI
           Je vais lui montrer qui c'est Raoul.
                         
          Il prend un tournevis dans le secrétaire.
                         
                          RAOUL VOLFONI
           Aux quatre coins de Paris qu'on va le retrouver, éparpillé
           par petits bouts, façon puzzle.
                         
          Il visse plusieurs vis sur la bombe.
                         
                          RAOUL VOLFONI
           Moi, quand on m'en fait trop, je « correctionne » plus, je
           dynamite, je disperse, je ventile.
                         
          Il jette le tournevis à l'intérieur du secrétaire. Il prend deux
          fils électrique qui sortent de la bombe pour les relier ensemble.
          Une étincelle jaillit. Raoul se recule précipitamment dans les
          bras de son frère
                         
          MANOIR DU MEXICAIN - CHAMBRE DE FERNAND - INTÉRIEUR NUIT
                         
          Gros plan sur la porte de l'armoire, que la main de Fernand est en
          train d'ouvrir. Les mains de Fernand fouille dans une pile de
          linge, et en sortent un revolver.
                         
          Fernand est en robe de chambre sombre. Il referme lentement la
          porte de son armoire, et, tout aussi lentement, se dirige vers la
          porte ouverte de sa chambre, le revolver en main. Avant de sortir,
          il s'arrête et écoute longuement. Il met le revolver dans la poche
          de sa robe de chambre, puis sort de la pièce.
                         
          MANOIR DU MEXICAIN - EXTÉRIEUR NUIT
          Façade arrière de la maison. Une petite terrasse étroite court le
          long de la façade. L'éclairage extérieur s'allume.
                         
          Fernand sort lentement par une porte-fenêtre, puis il marche le
          long de la terrasse. Au bout de la terrasse, un petit escalier de
          quelques marches descend vers le parc.
                         
          MANOIR DU MEXICAIN - GARAGE - INTÉRIEUR NUIT
                         
          Par la baie vitrée du garage, on voit Fernand qui marche le long
          de la terrasse.
                         
          Devant la baie vitrée, une étagère encombrée d'objets aussi divers
          qu'hétéroclites, comme on en trouve dans ce genre de local
          (bouteilles de produits d'entretien, outils, etc.)
                         
          Paul, en pardessus, et casquette sur la tête, est caché dans un
          coin sombre. Par la baie vitrée, on voit Fernand rentrer dans la
          maison et fermer la porte-fenêtre. La lumière extérieure du manoir
          s'éteint. Paul se tourne vers son frère. Il soupire, puis
                         CHUCHOTE :
                          PAUL VOLFONI
           On n'aurait pas dû venir.
                         
                          RAOUL VOLFONI
           Ta gueule !...
                         
          Derrière Paul, dans la pénombre, Raoul prépare son matériel. Il
          prend une grosse lampe électrique, la pose sur une table et
          l'allume. Il chuchote :
                         
                          RAOUL VOLFONI
           Assure-toi qu'il s'est recouché !...
                         
          Paul hausse les sourcils, et se dirige vers la porte d'accès
          piétons du garage, qu'il ouvre pour sortir.
                         
          Le capot de la 404 de Fernand est ouvert, et Raoul, penché sur le
          moteur, a sorti sa bombe d'une sacoche en cuir. Il pose la sacoche
          par terre et commence à positionner la bombe dans le moteur. On
          entend un chat qui miaule. Raoul se méprend sur le bruit et pense
          que c'est son frère qui revient.
                         
                          RAOUL VOLFONI
           Alors, y dort, le gros con ? Ben y dormira encore mieux
           quand il aura pris ça dans la gueule !
                         
          Le chat continue à miauler. Appuyé sur les étagères, Fernand
          écoute Raoul tout en se tapotant nerveusement le bras.
                         
           RAOUL VOLFONI (voix off)
           Il entendra chanter les anges, le gugus de Montauban. Je
           vais le renvoyer tout droit à la maison mère, au terminus
           des prétentieux...
                         
          CLINIQUE DUGOINEAU - CHAMBRE DE RAOUL - INTÉRIEUR JOUR
                         
          Raoul est allongé, en pyjama, sur un lit d'hôpital. Il a un
          pansement sur le nez, une mèche dans une narine, et un coquard sur
          l'oeil. Il maintient en place un linge humide sur son front. Il
          sent une présence dans la pièce et tourne la tête.
                         
                          RAOUL VOLFONI
           Fumier va !
                         
          Paul, en costume gris, est debout près de la fenêtre, un petit
          paquet de gâteaux de pâtissier à la main. Il semble un peu mal à
          son aise.
                         
                          PAUL VOLFONI
           Ben...
                         
          Il sourit niaisement.
                         
          MANOIR DU MEXICAIN - SALON - INTÉRIEUR JOUR
                         
          Gros plan sur un journal. En titre de première page : « Énigme
          dans l'affaire du camion incendié ». Et en dessous : « Parmi les
          bouteilles de pastis clandestin, transportées par les fraudeurs,
          certaines contenaient de l'essence » Et en-dessous, une photo du
          camion en train de flamber. A côté de la photo, on voit une partie
          d'un autre titre : « Ben Bella, maître absolu en Algérie », titre
          qui rappelle l'époque au cours de laquelle se déroule le film.
                         
           MONSIEUR FERNAND (lisant le journal en voix off)
           « Énigme dans l'affaire du camion incendié. Parmi les
           bouteilles de pastis clandestin transportées par les
           fraudeurs, certaines contenaient de l'essence ».
                         
          Fernand, en robe de chambre de couleur claire, une cigarette à la
          main, est assis derrière un bureau. Il replie le journal, et le
          pose sur le bureau.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Évidemment, ça brûle mieux.
                         
          Pascal est assis, en face de lui, sur le bord du bureau, et
          Bastien est debout à côté de Pascal.
                         
                          PASCAL
           Oui, mais... Monsieur Fernand, ce que vous avez fait aux
           Volfoni, c'est pas bien !
                         
                          BASTIEN
           C'est surtout pas juste !
                         
          Fernand croise les bras.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Elle est bien belle, celle-là ! Comment ? Ils me flinguent
           à vue, ils me butent Henri...
                         
                          PASCAL
           Justement pas !
                         
          Il fait signe à Bastien de s'expliquer.
                         
                          BASTIEN
           Euh...
          Il ne trouve visiblement pas ses mots, et se tourne vers Pascal.
                         
                          BASTIEN
           Ah ! Tiens, explique, toi !
                         
                          PASCAL
           Monsieur Fernand... Si les Volfoni vous avaient seringué,
           vous et Henri, qui aurait été aux commandes, hein ?
                         
          D'un doigt autoritaire, il désigne Bastien.
                         
                          BASTIEN
           Moi, première gâchette !
                         
          Fernand semble songeur.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Et c'était pas toi !...
                         
          Il pose les mains à plat sur le bureau.
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Dites-donc...
                         
          Il se lève et contourne le bureau.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Théo, l'ami Fritz là, question mentalité, quelle cote vous
           lui donnez ?
                         
                          PASCAL
           Ben, c'est pas du blanc-bleu.
                         
          Fernand marche de long en large dans la pièce.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Ça vous ennuierait de faire une petite commission pour
           moi ?
                         
                          PASCAL
           Nous, si les Volfoni sont plus dans le tourbillon !
                         
                          BASTIEN
           Présenté comme ça, la chose peut nous séduire !
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Et ben alors, vous pourriez peut être passer voir Théo à sa
           campagne. Il a sans doute besoin de parler... de causer...
           et à vous qu'il connaît bien, il se confierait peut
           être ?... Hmm ?...
                         
          Fernand est revenu derrière le bureau, sur lequel il récupère sa
          grande tasse de café.
                         
                          PASCAL
           Je ne vois pas de raisons pour qu'il nous fasse des
           cachotteries.
                         
                          BASTIEN
           Je vois pas non plus...
                         
                          PASCAL
           Ou alors, ce serait vraiment le goût de taquiner !

          UNE CABINE TÉLÉPHONIQUE - INTÉRIEUR JOUR
                         
          Pascal et Bastien sont, tous les deux, dans une cabine
          téléphonique, devant un « Taxiphone » à l'ancienne, fonctionnant
          avec des jetons. C'est Pascal qui tient le combiné.
                         
                          PASCAL
           Alors voilà, Monsieur Fernand, on est passé à la
           distillerie. Théo était pas là, on est tombé sur Tomate...
           curieux non ?
                         
           MONSIEUR FERNAND (voix off dans le téléphone)
           Qu'est ce qu'il faisait là ?
                         
                          PASCAL
           Mais détendez-vous, Monsieur Fernand, il nous l'a dit ce
           qu'il faisait là.
                         
          Pascal et Bastien éclatent de rire.

          DISTILLERIE - REZ DE CHAUSSÉE - INTÉRIEUR JOUR
                         
          Devant le gros alambic industriel, entouré de vapeur, Tomate est
          allongé par terre.
                         
           THÉO (voix off)
           Pauvre Tomate ! Je le voyais pas s'en aller si vite.
                         
          Théo et son ami sont debout au milieu des étagères de bouteilles
          vides. Ils regardent le cadavre de Tomate.
                         
           L'AMI DE THÉO
           Comme ça, on aura pas à le faire, puisque c'est par lui
           qu'on devait clôturer.
                         
          Théo saisit brutalement son ami par le col de sa veste et le
          secoue.
                         
                          THÉO
           C'est tout ce que t'as trouvé ? Tu comprends que si Tomate
           est descendu, c'est que l'autre branque a compris et que ça
           sera bientôt notre tour.
                         
          Il repousse violemment son ami, qui percute une étagère à
          bouteilles. Les bouteilles tombent et éclatent par terre.
                         
          Théo réfléchit un peu et dit, d'une voix plus calme :
                         
                          THÉO
           Seulement maintenant, on a le droit pour nous.
           L'AMI DE THÉO
           Le droit ?
                         
          Théo sourit.
                         
                          THÉO
           Légitime défense. Avec moi, ça ne pardonne pas.

          Folace est debout derrière une porte fenêtre. Il regarde dans le
          parc.
                         
                          MAITRE FOLACE
           Mon cher, nous avons de la visite !
                         
          Fernand, debout derrière lui, sort de la pièce. Folace lève le
          pistolet, qu'il tenait à la main, et tire dans le parc.
                         
          Dans le parc, Freddy, qui était visé par Folace, court se cacher.
          Il tient aussi un pistolet à la main.
                         
          Il rejoint Théo, caché derrière un arbre.
                         
                          FREDDY
           Comme effet de surprise, c'est réussi ! Voilà qu'on se fait
           flinguer...
                         
          Deux coups de feu retentissent. Freddy s'accroupit. Théo lève son
          arme, un pistolet avec un canon très long. Il tire en direction du
          manoir.
                         
          Folace est caché derrière une fenêtre, en train de visser un
          silencieux sur son pistolet. La balle, tirée par Théo, troue l'un
          des carreaux de la fenêtre.
                         
          Dans le parc, Théo tire de nouveau.
                         
          Folace, derrière la fenêtre, tire en direction du parc. Son
          pistolet, maintenant muni d'un silencieux, fait le « plop »
          caractéristique des silencieux.
                         
          Caché derrière un arbre, Théo ajuste son tire en reposant le canon
          de son arme sur son avant-bras.
                         
          Folace se cache derrière la fenêtre pour éviter la balle de Théo.

          Une statue sur un socle vole en éclats.
                         
          La statue était posé sur un coffre-fort.
                         
          Jean est accroupi devant le coffre-fort, dont il tourne les
          boutons de combinaison.
                         
          A côté de lui, Fernand brosse, de la main, les débris de plâtre
          sur son veston.
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Je te demande pas si tu sais les ouvrir !
                         
          Jean ouvre le coffre. On y voit des liasses de billets de banque
          sur l'étagère supérieure, mais aussi, sur l'étagère centrale, deux
          pistolets. Jean en tend un à Fernand.
                         
                          JEAN
           Je ne demande pas à Monsieur si Monsieur sait s'en servir !
                         
          Pendant que Fernand arme son pistolet, Jean en sort un autre du
          coffre.
                         
          MANOIR DU MEXICAIN - PARC - EXTÉRIEUR JOUR
                         
          Toutes les armes, sauf celle de Théo, étant munies de silencieux,
          elles font toutes le « plop » caractéristique.
                         
          Toujours derrière sa fenêtre, Folace tire dans le parc.
                         
          Jean entr'ouvre la porte d'entrée, et inspecte le parc.
          Folace, derrière sa fenêtre, tire à nouveau.
                         
          Jean tire depuis la porte d'entrée.
                         
          Caché derrière un arbre, à côté du petit kiosque en bois, Théo
          tire en direction du manoir
                         
          Caché derrière le kiosque, l'ami de Théo tire lui aussi.
                         
          Caché derrière un buisson, Freddy tire deux fois.
                         
          Théo, derrière son arbre, tire à nouveau. Il se retourne, et
          semble très surpris par ce qu'il voit. Il cache son arme derrière
          son dos.
                         
          Marchand calmement dans une allée du parc, canne à la main, Amédée
          Delafoy, le père d'Antoine, se dirige vers le manoir.
                         
          Théo l'observe derrière son arbre.
                         
          Amédée le voit, et lève son chapeau pour le saluer. Il est très
          élégamment vêtu en sombre, avec noeud papillon.
                         
          Théo s'incline vers Amédée en souriant.
                         
          Amédée remet son chapeau et reprend sa marche.
                         
          Théo hausse les épaules, ne comprenant visiblement pas qui peut
          être cet étrange personnage.
                         
          Amédée arrive près du manoir.
                         
          Jean, derrière une fenêtre, le regarde avec surprise.
                         
                          JEAN
           Monsieur attendait quelqu'un ?
          Derrière une autre fenêtre, Fernand regarde aussi Amédée avec
          surprise.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Non...
                         
          Derrière une autre fenêtre, au carreau brisé, Folace aussi observe
          l'arrivant.
                         
                          MAITRE FOLACE
           D'après Monsieur, serait-ce une feinte de l'ennemi ?
                         
          Amédée monte l'escalier qui mène au perron du manoir. Arrivé à la
          porte d'entrée, il appuie sur le bouton de la sonnette.

          porte-parapluie. Jean y dépose deux pistolets.
                         
          Jean va vers la porte d'entrée, qu'il ouvre. Il pousse Amédée vers
          l'intérieur du manoir, puis claque la porte. Amédée donne sa canne
          à Jean, et commence à enlever son manteau..
                         
                          AMÉDÉE DELAFOY
           Voulez-vous m'annoncer auprès de Monsieur Fernand Naudin,
           je vous prie.
                         
                          JEAN
           De la part de qui ?...
                         
          Jean, comprenant que Amédée doit être sourd, hausse la voix.
                         
                          JEAN
           De la part de qui, monsieur ?
                         
          Amédée donne son manteau à Jean.
                         
                          AMÉDÉE DELAFOY
           Quoi, qu'est ce qu'il y a mon ami ? Articulez !
                         
          C'est presque en hurlant que Jean lui demande :
                         
                          JEAN
           De la part de qui, monsieur ?
                         
          Amédée enlève ses gants.
                         
                          AMÉDÉE DELAFOY
           Ah !... De la part du président Delafoy, le père d'Antoine
           Delafoy.
                         
          Il donne son chapeau à Jean, qui sort rapidement du vestibule.
          Amédée, les gants à la main, reste là à contempler le décor, qui
          semble lui plaire.

          Jean entre dans la pièce, portant toujours le manteau, le chapeau
          et la canne d'Amédée. Il entend un coup de feu, et se dirige vers
          la fenêtre.

          Freddy court dans le parc, jusqu'à un piédestal portant une
          vasque, et derrière lequel il se cache.
                         
          MANOIR DU MEXICAIN - SALON - INTÉRIEUR JOUR
                         
          Jean fait un signe de tête vers le vestibule.
                         
                          JEAN
           Le président Delafoy !
                         
          Puis il regarde de nouveau par la fenêtre. Derrière lui, Amédée
          entre dans la pièce.
                         
                          AMÉDÉE DELAFOY
           Puisqu'on ne m'annonce pas, je le fais moi-même...
                         
          Il s'avance dans la pièce, la main tendue. Les coups de feu, qu'il
          n'entend visiblement pas, continuent à retentir.
                          AMÉDÉE DELAFOY
           Président Delafoy...
                         
          Fernand saisit Amédée à bras le corps et l'entraîne dans un coin
          de la pièce. Jean sort de la pièce. Un vase, posé sur une commode,
          éclate sous l'impact d'une balle.
                         
          Fernand et Amédée sont maintenant dans un coin de la pièce près de
          la fenêtre. Fernand tape amicalement sur le bras d'Amédée.
                         
                          AMÉDÉE DELAFOY
           Moi aussi, je suis... je suis absolument ravi de faire
           votre connaissance...
                         
          Fernand le pousse à travers la pièce en lui baissant la tête. Des
          balles traversent le carreau de la fenêtre devant laquelle ils
          viennent de passer.
                         
          Ils arrivent dans un autre coin de la pièce. Fernand éclate d'un
          rire un peu forcé.
                         
                          AMÉDÉE DELAFOY
           Je vois que vous êtes habitué à mener les choses rondement.
           Ce n'est pas pour me déplaire d'ailleurs, j'aime l'action,
           l'initiative. Quand j'étais jeune, je jouais au hockey sur
           gazon...
                         
          Alors qu'Amédée n'entend aucun des coups de feu qui retentissent
          autour de lui, il entend sonner une horloge !
                         
                          AMÉDÉE DELAFOY
           Ohhh !... Grand Dieu...
                         
          Il s'approche de l'horloge ancienne, posée sur le marbre d'un
          meuble. Il l'examine et la caresse, pendant que, derrière lui,
          Jean est entré dans la pièce et tire par la fenêtre.
                          AMÉDÉE DELAFOY
           Fin XVIII°, de Ferdinand Berthoud.
                         
          Fernand s'approche doucement de lui. On entend les « plop » du
          pistolet de Jean.
                         
                          AMÉDÉE DELAFOY
           A moins que ma future belle-fille n'y tienne vraiment, je
           l'échangerais bien contre autre chose. Ohhh !...
                         
          Fernand le prend par les épaules pour l'éloigner de la zone
          dangereuse.
                         
                          AMÉDÉE DELAFOY
           Hein ?...
                         
          Ils arrivent dans un autre coin de la pièce, plus éloigné de la
          fenêtre, d'où retentissent toujours les coups de feu.
                         
                          AMÉDÉE DELAFOY
           Oui... oui, pardonnez-moi, j'anticipe.
          Dans la glace située à côté d'eux, on voit Folace, qui, à son
          tour, tire par la fenêtre. Amédée, lui, a remis ses gants pour
          faire sa demande officielle.
                         
                          AMÉDÉE DELAFOY
           Et bien, Monsieur, j'ai l'honneur de vous demander la main
           de votre nièce Patricia pour mon fils Antoine...
                         
          Il s'incline profondément. Dans la glace, on voit Folace qui fait
          signe à Fernand de se cacher. Fernand fait « oui » de la tête.
          Amédée, qui relève la tête à ce moment-là, prend ce signe comme un
          acquiescement à sa requête.
                         
                          AMÉDÉE DELAFOY
           Ah !... Ce oui est un cri du coeur, je n'en attendais pas
           moins.
                         
          Il prend Fernand dans ses bras. Ils s'éloignent tous les deux,
          serrés l'un contre l'autre, donnant presque l'impression qu'ils
          sont en train de danser ensemble !
                         
          Ils ont atteint un coin apparemment un peu plus tranquille. Amédée
          semble d'humeur joyeuse et Fernand lui sourit.
                         
                          AMÉDÉE DELAFOY
           Hé !... Hé !... Et bien voilà !...

          Debout près d'une fenêtre, Folace est en train de tirer dans le
          parc.
                         
          Jean en fait autant à partir de la porte d'entrée entr'ouverte.
                         
          Théo tire, caché derrière son arbre.
                         
          Son ami tire aussi, caché derrière le kiosque.
          Freddy tire aussi, caché dans un buisson. Il s'aperçoit qu'il n'a
          plus de munition et s'accroupit derrière le buisson pour recharger
          son arme.

          Amédée contemple les meubles et objets anciens qui l'entourent.
                         
                          AMÉDÉE DELAFOY
           Cette maison est un ravissement.
                         
          Il s'approche d'une haute plante verte en pot.
                         
                          AMÉDÉE DELAFOY
           Ah... cette verdure, ce calme.
                         
          Il se dirige vers un porte ouverte et s'incline.

          Folace, debout près d'une fenêtre, cache son arme sous sa veste,
          et s'incline pour répondre au salut d'Amédée.

          Amédée admire les objets napoléoniens dans la vitrine de la pièce
          voisine. Fernand ferme la porte pour permettre à Folace de
          reprendre son « activité ».

          Freddy tire, caché derrière le piédestal.

          Théo tire depuis le kiosque.

          Jean, caché derrière le radiateur, tire avec deux pistolets vers
          la porte d'entrée, qui est restée ouverte. Un tableau,
          représentant un homme portant une fraise, lui tombe presque sur la
          tête.

          l'oreille.
                         
                          AMÉDÉE DELAFOY
           Il me semble avoir entendu...
                         
          Fernand bafouille un peu.

           Oui, c'est... c'est le jardinier qui... tue les taupes !...

          Jean apparaît à la porte.
                         
                          JEAN
           Monsieur ?...

           s'il vous plaît ?
                         
                          JEAN
           Je vais essayer de lui faire comprendre, Monsieur.
                         
          Jean ressort.
                         
          Amédée regarde quelque chose situé juste derrière Fernand.
                         
                          AMÉDÉE DELAFOY
           Dîtes moi que c'est un héritage, un cadeau, un objet de
           famille, mais ne me dites pas que vous l'avez trouvée à
           Paris, vous me tueriez !
                         
          Fernand, qui n'a pas vu la direction du regard d'Amédée, affiche
          un air un peu ahuri.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Quoi ?
                         
                          AMÉDÉE DELAFOY
           Ça !...
                         
          Il montre un étrange vase monté sur un trépied.
                         
          Une balle heurte le plafond et fait tomber une partie du plâtre de
          la moulure.
                         
          Amédée reçoit une pluie de plâtre sur la tête.
                          AMÉDÉE DELAFOY
           Ouh !
                         
          Amédée regarde, avec surprise, son costume sombre couvert de
          plâtre.
                         
                          AMÉDÉE DELAFOY
           Oh ! Mais qu'est-ce que c'est ?
                         
          Fernand et lui lèvent tous les deux les yeux vers le plafond.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Des termites.

           Hein ?
                         
          Fernand lui parle, d'une voix forte, directement dans l'oreille,
          tout en lui brossant la veste de la main.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Des termites ! Ça bouffe tout, les termites ! L'ennui de
           ces vieilles demeures où nous avons joué enfants.
                         
          D'autres balles heurtent le plafond.
                         
          Fernand et Amédée se trouvent couverts par un déluge de plâtre.
                         
                          AMÉDÉE DELAFOY
           Ouh !
                         
          Fernand lève les yeux vers le plafond, puis les baisse et regarde
          Amédée avec un sourire un peu crispé.

          kiosque.
                         
          Pascal et Bastien escalade l'escalier du perron d'un pas souple et
          rapide. Ils sonnent à la porte.
                         
          Théo contourne le kiosque en courant. Il se cache derrière Freddy.
                         
                          FREDDY
           Les horribles !
                         
          Il se tourne vers Théo.
                         
                          FREDDY
           Séparément, ils sont déjà pas drôles, je suis pas pressé de
           connaître leur numéro de siamois.
                         
          Théo ricane.
                         
          Son ami est toujours caché derrière un arbre, le pistolet à la
          main.
                         
          Théo siffle dans ses doigts.
                         
          Bastien et Pascal, qui sont toujours devant la porte du manoir,
          entendent le sifflet de Théo, et glissent immédiatement la main à
          l'intérieur de leurs vestes.
                         
          L'ami de Théo court vers le kiosque.
                         
          Pascal et Bastien regardent dans la direction d'où venaient le
          sifflet, et retirent lentement leurs mains de l'intérieur de leurs
          vestes. Ils réajustent ensemble leurs cravates, et entrent dans le
          manoir.
                         
          Théo regarde Freddy.
                          THÉO
           Il faut bien admettre qu'exceptionnellement, Dieu n'est pas
           avec nous ! Mais il ne sera pas dit que nous avons sorti le
           matériel pour rien...

          Il y est écrit : « Clinique Dugoineau ».
                         
          Raoul et Paul sortent de la clinique, manteau sur le bras.
                         
          Une Citroën DS s'approche d'eux. A l'arrière, par la vitre
          ouverte, Théo tire sur eux à la mitraillette. La voiture
          s'éloigne.

           THÉO (voix off venant du siège arrière)
           Je te dis pas que c'est pas injuste...
                         
          Freddy tourne, en souriant, la tête vers l'arrière du véhicule,
          puis reporte son regard vers la route. L'ami de Théo, assis sur le
          siège passager avant, garde la tête tournée vers l'arrière.
                         
          Théo s'est enfoncé dans son siège. Il semble satisfait de ce qu'il
          vient de faire.
                         
                          THÉO

          Raoul et Paul sont allongés sur deux lits voisins, couverts de
          bandages. Raoul a une jambe plâtrée, maintenu en position élevée
          par une poulie fixée au plafond. Paul, lui, a une sorte de tente
          au-dessus du corps, pour éviter tout frottement avec les draps.

          Paul, un thermomètre dans la bouche fait un signe d'impuissance.
          Il retire le thermomètre et s'essuie le nez. Puis il remet le
          thermomètre dans sa bouche.

          MANOIR DU MEXICAIN - SALON - INTÉRIEUR JOUR
                         
          Fernand est en grand habit de cérémonie, prêt à assumer son rôle
          de « père de la mariée ». Il porte un col cassé, un gilet gris et
          une cravate lavallière gris clair avec une perle piquée dedans. Le
          tailleur tourne autour de lui.
                         
                          LE TAILLEUR
           Ah parfait, absolument parfait, et pourtant, une jaquette
           c'est difficile à porter !
          Il réajuste la veste sur les épaules de Fernand.
                         
                          LE TAILLEUR
           Et Monsieur la porte à ravir. Monsieur a une morphologie de
           diplomate.
                         
          Le tailleur continue à ajuster la veste sur Fernand, qui semble un
          peu agacé par tous ces tripotages.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Très bien, très bien... soyez assez gentil de m'envoyer
           votre facture le plus vite possible, parce que moi, je
           repars en province après-demain... hein ?
                         
          Il sort du salon, suivi par le tailleur, qui lui brosse la veste
          de la main.
                         
          MANOIR DU MEXICAIN - UN AUTRE SALON - INTÉRIEUR JOUR
                         
          Antoine, aussi élégant que Fernand, avec en plus un oeillet à la
          boutonnière et une paire de gants à la main, prend la pose à côté
          de Patricia, portant une superbe robe de mariée. Devant eux, un
          petit garçon et une petite fille, eux aussi habillés pour la
          circonstance.
                         
          Le photographe introduit une nouvelle plaque dans un appareil à
          soufflet posé sur un trépied.
                         
                          LE PHOTOGRAPHE
           S'il vous plait... Ne bougeons plus !
                         
          Un flash de lumière jaillit. Le photographe met une autre plaque
          dans son appareil.
                         
                          LE PHOTOGRAPHE
           C'est fini.
          Patricia relève sa robe et se précipite vers Fernand, qui vient
          d'entrer dans la pièce.
                         
                          PATRICIA
           Mon oncle, c'est merveilleux...
                         
          Fernand, toujours en habit, est en train de regarder Jean qui
          dispose les cadeaux sur une table.
                         
                          PATRICIA
           ... je n'aurais jamais pensé que nous avions autant d'amis.
                         
          Elle l'embrasse. Fernand sourit.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Et nous en avons encore beaucoup plus que tu ne le penses !
                         
          Le photographe vient chercher Patricia.
                         
                          LE PHOTOGRAPHE
           Mademoiselle... S'il vous plait.
          Le photographe entraîne Patricia pour d'autres photos d'elle
          seule, et Antoine rejoint Fernand.
                         
                          ANTOINE DELAFOY
           Vous avez l'air exceptionnellement détendu, Oncle Fernand,
           heureux de vivre !
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Ah oui, ça, vous pouvez le dire. Et puis, maintenant que ma
           mission de tuteur est terminée, et croyez moi...
                         
          Il secoue la main pour expliquer sa pensée, puis il entraîne
          Antoine à marcher de long en large dans la pièce. Dans le fond de
          la pièce, on voit Patricia avec les deux enfants, et derrière
          Antoine, le photographe qui la cadre.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Et puis... quant aux diverses affaires constituant la dot
           de notre petite Patricia, votre cher papa a accepté de les
           prendre en charge.
                         
          Fernand hésite un peu avant de poursuivre. On le sent sur un sujet
          plutôt épineux.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Elles sont sans doute un petit peu... particulières, mais
           enfin... avec un vice-président du fond monétaire à leurs
           têtes, et ben moi, je pense que tout ira bien !
                         
                          ANTOINE DELAFOY
           Oui, surtout avec papa, il ne comprend rien au passé, rien
           au présent, rien à l'avenir, enfin, rien à la France, rien
           à l'Europe, enfin rien à rien. Mais il comprendrait
           l'incompréhensible... dés qu'il s'agit d'argent.
                         
          Ils rient tous deux de cette boutade.
                         
          Folace, en chemise, la veste à la main, entre dans la pièce, l'air
          soucieux, puis ressort.
                         
          Jean est en train d'examiner les cadeaux de mariage à la loupe.
          Fernand se penche sur lui. Puis il lui donne un coup d'épaule.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           C'est pas du toc,non ?
                         
                          JEAN
           Monsieur Fernand... du vieux Paris.
                         
          Il semble rassuré par cet avis d'un « expert » !
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Ah !...
                         
          On entend la voix de Pascal qui chuchote :
                         
           PASCAL (voix off)
           Monsieur Fernand...
                         
          Jean et Fernand relève la tête.
          Pascal vient d'apparaître derrière la porte de la pièce. Il fait
          signe à Fernand de venir, tout en chuchotant :
                         
                          PASCAL
           Monsieur Fernand.
                         
          Folace, toujours en chemise, apparaît derrière lui. Il pousse
          Pascal hors de la pièce.
                         
          Jean et Fernand se regardent. Fernand se dirige vers la porte.
                         
          Il sort après un dernier regard à Jean.

          Fernand sort du salon, et referme la porte derrière lui. Il
          regarde Folace et Pascal, qui ont le regard soucieux.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Qu'est-ce qu'y a ?...
                         
                          MAITRE FOLACE
           Y a du nouveau : Théo est réapparu, il est à la distillerie
           avec tout son petit monde.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Quoi ?
                         
                          PASCAL
           Ils démontent le matériel. On dirait qu'ils vont se faire
           la malle.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Et t'es là ?
                         
          Il se dirige vers la porte du salon, qu'il ouvre.
          MANOIR DU MEXICAIN - UN SALON - INTÉRIEUR JOUR
                         
          Fernand passe la tête derrière la porte.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Jean ?
                         
          Il lui fait signe de venir.
                         
          Jean a, lui aussi, le regard soucieux. Il se dirige vers la porte.

                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Ah bravo !
                         
                          PASCAL
           Mais Bastien monte la garde.
                         
          Fernand lui fait signe de baisser la voix.
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Chhht !...
                         
          Il jette un rapide regard vers le salon.
                         
                          PASCAL
           On aurait pu les flinguer sans douleur...
                         
          Jean les rejoint.
                         
                          PASCAL
           ... mais on a pensé que Théo vous revenait de droit. On a
           déjà vu des patrons se vexer.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Bon ben... Jean ! Dîtes à mademoiselle que j'ai une course
           urgente à faire et que... et que je rejoindrai le... le
           cortège à l'église... Voilà ! Hein ! Voilà !
                         
                          JEAN
           Pour ce genre de courses, je conseille à Monsieur, si
           Monsieur me permet, de ne pas partir la musette vide.
                         
          Pascal s'énerve un peu.
                         
                          PASCAL
           Oh dis donc, tu m'as déjà vu pas emporter ce qu'il faut, où
           il faut et quand il faut ?
                         
                          JEAN
           Oh excusez-moi, Monsieur Pascal, mais des jours comme
           aujourd'hui, on a plus sa tête.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Bon, bon, bon, bon...
                         
                          MAITRE FOLACE
           On y va, allez !...
                         
          Il se dirige vers la porte d'entrée, mais Fernand le retient.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Non, non, non, non. Vous !... vous, à l'église ! Hein ?
           Là !
                         
          Il repousse Folace vers le centre de la pièce, prend ses gants et
          met son haut-de-forme gris sur sa tête. Il ouvre la porte et sort,
          suivi de Pascal. Il claque la porte derrière lui. Folace les
          regarde partir, visiblement très déçu de ne pas participer à cette
          « petite fête » ! Il hausse les épaules.

           Ils sont là, j'en ai déjà repéré trois ! Y en a peut-être
           d'autres ?
                         
          Le coffre de la 404 de Fernand est ouvert, et Pascal, un pied sur
          le pare-choc, est en train de préparer les armes. Fernand enlève
                         SA VESTE
                         
                          PASCAL
           Qu'est ce qu'on fait, monsieur Fernand ? On attend qu'ils
           sortent ? On fait un fermé ou un rabat ?
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           J'ai pas le temps d'attendre, moi, je suis de cérémonie à
           dix heures !
                         
          Il dépose délicatement sa veste sur le siège arrière de la
          voiture, et commence à déboutonner son gilet.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Allez, allons y. Allez.
                         
                          PASCAL
           Bon !
                         
          Il prend un pistolet et se dirige vers les bâtiments. Derrière
          lui, Fernand enlève son gilet, le brosse et le pose sur la
          banquette arrière.

          Dans la partie du premier étage transformée en « salon », Théo
          étudie des papiers étalés sur un secrétaire, Freddy d'autres
          papiers sur une table. L'ami de Théo entre en courant.
                         
           L'AMI DE THÉO
           Ils arrivent, ils arrivent !
                         
          Théo lui fait signe d'y aller. Puis il fait le même signe à
          Freddy, qui prend un fusil posé sur la table. Théo remplit une
          sacoche de papiers, la ferme, la met sous son bras, prend une
          mitraillette sur un fauteuil et sort du « salon ». Il court vers
          l'escalier, qu'il descend rapidement.

          Fernand, qui a toujours son chapeau haut-de-forme sur la tête,
          choisit une arme dans le coffre de la voiture.
                         
           PASCAL (voix off)
           Qu'est ce que je vois là ?
                         
          Bastien a une mitraillette, d'un modèle assez ancien, à la main,
          ce qui n'a pas l'air de plaire à Pascal, qui pointe le doigt sur
          l'arme.
                         
                          PASCAL
           Ça ?
                         
                          BASTIEN
           Hé !... Je l'avais pris en cas qu'il aurait fallu tirer en
           rafale, des fois qu'ils seraient tous sortis d'un coup,
           tatatatata... Hop !
                         
          Il fait mine de mitrailler un groupe de personnes. Pascal lui
          tapote sur la nuque
                         
                          PASCAL
           C'est marrant que t'aies gardé ce côté maquisard...
                         
          Fernand vient de se choisir une arme. Il se tourne vers ses deux
          complices. Il a toujours son chapeau sur la tête.
                         
           PASCAL (voix off)
           ... t'es pas en âge d'arrêter tes momeries ?
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Bon alors, c'est fini, oui ? Puisque je vous dis que je
           suis pressé ! Hein !
                         
          Il va pour s'éloigner, mais il s'aperçoit - enfin ! - qu'il a
          toujours son chapeau sur la tête. Il l'enlève et le pose dans le
          coffre de la voiture.

          L'ami de Théo se faufile entre les casiers à bouteilles, l'arme au
          poing et l'oeil aux aguets. Un coup de feu retentit et une
          bouteille vole en éclats. L'ami de Théo se cache sous une voûte.
          D'autres coups de feu cassent d'autres bouteilles.
                         
          L'ami de Théo se cache dans un couloir voûté.
                         
          Bastien se faufile entre les rangées de bouteilles vides, la
          mitraillette à la main.
                         
          Dans le couloir voûté, l'ami de Théo continue à progresser avec
          précaution.
                         
          Bastien montre, du doigt, à ses complices, où se trouve l'ami de
          Théo.
                         
          L'ami de Théo est accroupi dans le couloir voûté. Il se cache dans
          un coin.
                         
          Caché dans un recoin, Bastien passe la tête dans le couloir voûté.
                         IL CHUCHOTE :
                         
                          BASTIEN
           Pascal ! Hé !
                         
          La tête de Pascal apparaît par une autre ouverture dans le
          couloir. Il tire.
                         
          L'ami de Théo se cache derrière un casier à bouteilles.
                         
          Pascal regarde où il vient de tirer.
                         
          Il a percé un jerrycan d'essence, juste au-dessus de la tête de
          l'ami de Théo. L'essence jaillit par les deux trous percés par les
          impacts de balle.
          Pascal fait signe à Bastien.
                         
          Bastien lance sa cigarette allumée vers l'ami de Théo, puis il se
          cache rapidement.
                         
          Des gerbes de flammes apparaissent dans le couloir, juste à
          l'endroit où était caché l'ami de Théo.

          Freddy, positionné dans une galerie située au-dessus de la cour,
          tire au fusil par les fenêtres de la galerie, alternativement d'un
          côté puis de l'autre de la galerie. Lorsqu'une balle lui siffle
          aux oreilles, il sort de la galerie, et se met à courir. D'un seul
          coup, il s'arrête net.
                         
          Fernand vient d'apparaitre en haut d'un escalier.
                         
          Freddy lance son fusil en direction de Fernand.
                         
          Fernand se penche pour éviter le projectile.
                         
          Freddy se précipite sur Fernand. Les deux hommes commencent à se
          battre. Freddy donne un violent coup de poing à Fernand, qui
          titube un peu. Freddy attrape Fernand par la chemise, qui se
          déchire dans le dos, puis il essaie de lui enfoncer les doigts
          dans les yeux. Fernand envoie un violent coup de poing dans la
          figure de Freddy, qui titube et s'écroule sur une cloison de
          planches ajourées, qui cède sous son poids. Il tombe, et se relève
          immédiatement, mais Fernand l'attrape, et lui colle un autre coup
          de poing. Freddy titube le long de la galerie, et finit par faire
          voler en éclats la cloison située à l'autre extrémité de la
          galerie. Il tombe par terre.
                         
          Fernand se précipite à sa poursuite dans la galerie, mais
          lorsqu'il arrive dans la pièce où Freddy est tombé, celui-ci
          l'accueille d'un coup de poing. Fernand titube un peu. Freddy va
          pour lui mettre un autre coup de poing, mais Fernand est plus
          rapide, et lui assène un coup de poing très puissant, qui envoie
          Freddy valdinguer contre une cloison de brique qui bouche une
          ancienne ouverture dans le mur de la bâtisse. La cloison cède sous
          le poids de Freddy.

          On voit la cloison qui explose au premier étage, Freddy qui passe
          à travers, puis qui tombe en contrebas. Fernand se penche par
          l'ouverture béante.
                         
          Plus loin, Théo court le long d'une rampe, couvrant sa fuite de
          coups de mitraillette. Il tient toujours sa sacoche sous le bras.
          Il saute de la rampe et se cache derrière un mur. Il pose sa
          sacoche par terre et ramasse une brique. Il lance la brique loin
          de lui.
                         
          Bastien tire à la mitraillette dans la direction de la chute de la
          brique.
                         
          Théo, qui a ramassé sa sacoche, profite de la diversion pour se
          précipiter vers sa DS.
          Pascal apparaît à côté de la rampe et tire au pistolet.
                         
          La DS démarre en trombe.
                         
          Bastien tire à la mitraillette sur la DS, mais la rate.
                         
          Fernand descend le long de la rampe, et saute pour rejoindre
          Pascal. Il semble prêt à courir après Théo, mais Pascal l'arrête.
          Il vient de sortir sa montre-gousset de sa poche, et il la montre
          à Fernand.
                         
                          PASCAL
           Patron !
                         
          Fernand regarde la montre.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Oh ! Merde !
                         
          Fernand jette un dernier coup d'oeil vers la DS qui s'éloigne, puis
          commence à brosser son pantalon avec la main. Dans son dos, Pascal
          essaie de camoufler la déchirure de la chemise avec les bretelles.
          Bastien s'approche d'eux.
                         
                          PASCAL
           Avec la jaquette, ça ira.
                         
          Bastien réajuste la cravate de Fernand, qui les regarde tous les
          deux.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           Ça va ?
                         
          Pascal, de la main, fait signe que tout est parfait.
                         
          EGLISE - EXTÉRIEUR JOUR
          Sur le perron de l'église, les deux petits enfants, qui avaient
          pris des photos avec Patricia, sont assis sur une marche, et
          rigolent entre eux.
                         
          Antoine est appuyé sur une balustrade et sourit à Patricia, qui
          lui rend son sourire.
                         
          Folace, entouré des frères Volfoni, regarde sa montre.
                         
          Plan d'ensemble du parvis de l'église. Tous les invités discutent
          en attendant patiemment l'oncle de la mariée.
                         
          Jean, pour la première fois sans sa veste blanche, mais en costume
          gris, scrute l'horizon, et semble satisfait.
                         
          La 404 de Fernand arrive devant l'église.
                         
          Jean se détache d'Amédée Delafoy, avec qui il était en grande
          conversation, et se dirige vers la voiture.
                         
          Folace et les Volfoni regardent la voiture. Les cloches sonnent.
          Les trois hommes se dirigent vers l'église.
          Fernand, de nouveau déguisé en « père de la mariée » descend du
          siège passager avant de la voiture. Pascal est au volant, et
          Bastien à l'arrière. Il met son chapeau et rejoint Jean, qui
          venait à sa rencontre. Il lui tape sur l'épaule.
                         
                          MONSIEUR FERNAND
           J'ai eu chaud.
                         
          Sur le chemin de l'église, Fernand croise « le Monocle »,
          autrement dit l'acteur Paul Meurisse, héros d'une célèbre trilogie
          de Georges Lautner, le réalisateur du présent film. Meurisse
          ajuste son monocle et s'incline devant Fernand. Puis il le salue
          et s'éloigne.
                         
          Fernand porte la main à son chapeau pour lui rendre son salut. Il
          se tourne vers Jean, qui, comme lui, semble ne pas comprendre. Les
          deux hommes se dirigent vers l'église.
                         
          La 404 de Fernand, avec Pascal au volant, s'éloigne du parvis de
          l'église.

          Deux enfants de choeur entrent dans l'église, suivi d'un prêtre,
          puis de Paticia, qui tient le bras de Fernand. Derrière, les deux
          enfants portent la traîne de la robe de Patricia. Derrière eux,
          tous les invités de la noce, avec en tête, Antoine, qui donne le
          bras à une dame de sa famille.
                         
          Le cortège remonte la nef de l'église.
                         
          Dans le cortège, derrière Amédée Delafoy, viennent Folace à côté
          de Jean, et derrière eux, les frères Volfoni.
                         
          Les deux mariés s'agenouillent sur les prie-dieu qui leurs sont
          réservés.

          La DS de Théo arrive devant l'église et s'arrête.
                         
          A l'intérieur de la DS, Théo s'installe sur le siège passager
          avant, et prend sa mitraillette en main. Il ouvre la boîte à
          gants, et prend un chargeur neuf qu'il met dans l'arme. Il
          enclenche la première balle dans la chambre de tir.

          Gros plan sur le visage de Patricia, perdue dans ses pensées. Une
          cantatrice commence à chanter un « Gloria ».
                         
          Au premier rang de l'église, agenouillés sur leurs prie-dieu, de
          gauche à droite, Fernand, Folace, Jean, Raoul et Paul. D'un seul
          coup retentit une explosion. Les cinq hommes sursautent. Toute
          l'assemblée des invités de la noce se tourne vers la porte de
          l'église restée ouverte.
          Par cette porte ouverte, on voit Pascal et Bastien courir vers
          l'église. Une deuxième explosion retentit. On aperçoit de la fumée
          près du trottoir du parvis de l'église. En entrant dans l'église,
          les deux hommes ralentissent le pas. Pascal met une pochette
          blanche dans sa poche pectorale, puis il prend de l'eau bénite
          dans la vasque fixée sur le mur de l'église. Il touche la main de
          Bastien pour lui donner de l'eau bénite. Les deux hommes font le
          signe de la croix, puis ils restent respectueusement debout au
          fond de l'église.
                         
          Les cinq « tontons flingueurs » reprennent une contenance sur
          leurs prie-dieu.

          Devant le parvis de l'église, la voiture de Théo est enveloppée de
          flammes. Elle finit de brûler lentement après l'explosion qui l'a
          détruite... avec Théo à l'intérieur !
                         
          La caméra remonte vers le clocher de l'église, où les cloches
          sonnent à toute volée. On entend la sirène des pompiers.
                         
          Le générique de fin commence à défiler en lettres blanche sur le
          clocher de l'église, devant lequel monte la fumée noire de la
          voiture en flammes.

               FADE IN:

               EXT. TWO-LANE HIGHWAY - SUNRISE

               A dishevelled WOMAN in a business suit (27) runs down a lonely 
               highway in Texas hill country, moving desperately through 
               the thick morning fog. She's carrying a VHS cassette. The 
               sounds of her breathing and SHOES HITTING the PAVEMENT ECHO 
               into the mist.

               She runs, and runs.

               She slows, out-of-strength, looks up and down the highway.

               Both in front and behind, it leads straight into the mist, a 
               tunnel of fog. She stumbles on, a final effort.

               She runs. Sees something. Stops cold.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               INT. OFFICE OF "DEATHWATCH AUSTIN" - SUNRISE

               A clock on the wall: 6:11.

               Beneath the clock a simple banner reads "DeathWatch Austin."

                                     YOUNG MAN (O.S.)
                         It's probably been about seven 
                         minutes...

               The office is small, cheaply furnished. One wall is filled 
               with neat rows of 8x10's of death row inmates.

               About 30 percent have red crosses over their faces.

               Five people wait in tense silence. A SKINNY COLLEGE GUY with 
               a mullet and pinch of Skoal in his mouth looks at a computer 
               screen. A co-ed cuddles a Styrofoam cup of coffee, sobs 
               quietly. A matronly woman sits quietly at a desk holding a 
               phone to one ear.

               The clock's minute hand changes from :11 to :12.

               CONSTANCE HARRAWAY (36), bookish, sits beside DAVID GALE 
               (31). He wears a blue Yale sweatshirt. They both stare at 
               nothing. She bites her lip.

                                     COLLEGE GUY
                         Okay. Okay. We've got pronouncement. 
                         6:12. Roughly eight minutes.
                              (a beat as he records 
                              the time)
                         Number 36 this year for the Great 
                         State of Texas.

               They all exchange looks: they've lost. David stands.

                                     CONSTANCE
                         David, don't start throwing things.

               A PHONE RINGS. David controls himself.

                                     DAVID
                         I'm going home. Let's do the press 
                         fax tomorrow.

               Another PHONE RINGS. Constance stands.

                                     CONSTANCE
                         Go. I'll do it.

               He nods to her, exits.

               She walks to the photo wall. With a red magic marker she 
               marks a cross over the photo of a Hispanic male.

               The wall clock reads 6:13.

               EXT. PARKING LOT IN FRONT OF OFFICE - SUNRISE

               The office is in a largely abandoned mini-mall. It's going 
               to be a clear summer day. David hurries through the empty 
               parking lot to Volvo station wagon.

               As the car exits the lot, we see the Austin skyline with the 
               capitol building in the distance.

               INT. DAVID'S CAR - SUNRISE

               David drinks from a travel cup as he drives, windows down.

               EXT. INTERSECTION - SUNRISE

               David stops at a red light beside a squad car with one cop 
               inside. The cop gives him a cursory glance.

               INT. DAVID'S CAR - SUNRISE

               He stares at the cop. The cop looks neutrally ahead; behind 
               him the buckle of his seat belt shoulder strap catches the 
               reflection of the rising sun.

               BACK TO DAVID

               He stares, then:

                                     DAVID
                         Hey!

               The cop ignores him.

                                     DAVID
                         Yo! Officer!

               The cop looks over; his face says he expects a confrontation. 
               David points to the seat belt buckle.

                                     DAVID
                         Your seatbelt.

               The cop nods, weary, embarrassed. He reaches back for the 
               belt. David takes a sip and drives on.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               Court TV reporter, Roberts, stands in front of the Supreme

               PULL BACK TO REVEAL WE ARE IN:

               INT. NEWS MAGAZINE OFFICE - DAY

               KRUGER (47) watches with a leg up on her messy desk, eating 
               low-fat tortilla chips and massaging a knee with an electric 
               massager. A name plate on her desk reads "Barbara D. Kruger, 
               Crime and Courts Editor." News magazine covers are on the 
               walls. Kruger is black, short, overweight, wears an old 
               jogging suit and new oversized athletic shoes. She has half-
               frame granny glasses on a cord around her neck.

                                     ROBERTS (V.O.)
                         Gale had sought a review of his 1993 
                         conviction for the rape and murder 
                         of University of Texas colleague, 
                         Constance Harraway.

               Kruger reaches for a phone, hits four numbers, takes a chip.

               BACK ON ROBERTS

                         Defense lawyers had hoped to argue 
                         that Gale's former activism against 
                         capital punishment unduly 
                         prejudiced...

               She waits impatiently, munching, swallowing.

                                     ROBERTS (V.O.)
                         ...the Texas judicial system. Citing 
                         'discriminating purpose' --

                              (into the phone)
                         Hey, they're not gonna stay Gale. 
                         It's on Court TV right now, listen.

               She holds the phone out in the direction of the TV, uses the 
               opportunity to eat another chip.

               ON TV

               We see old footage of David on a TV talk show.

                                     ROBERTS (V.O.)

                         So, what's it gonna be? Belyeu said 
                         to call after the decision... No, 
                         they said only Bitsey.

                                     ROBERTS (V.O.)

                         It means only Bitsey. Bill, I don't

                         black woman.

               Bitsey Bloom (The runner from the opening) enters. She wears, 
               as always, a tailored suit.

                                     KRUGER
                              (into the phone)
                         ...What we need is to put her on a 
                         plane to Houston.

                         Gale's going down.

               Kruger shushes her with a we-know-already gesture.

                                     KRUGER
                              (into the phone)
                         Why do you always get lordosis around 
                         legal? She's here.

               She puts him on SPEAKER, and reaches for a chip.

                                     BITSEY
                              (to the phone)
                         Hi. What's lordosis?

                         Female ape's posture when preparing 
                         for intercourse. Hello, Bitsey.

               Bitsey shoots Kruger a look, mouths "you're sick."

                                     BILL (V.O.)
                         Look, kids, setting aside the cost 
                         issue, though half-a-million dollars 
                         for three two hour interviews is not 
                         only illegal it's obscen--

                                     KRUGER
                         Market value. Guy's never talked.

                                     BILL (V.O.)
                         That aside, I, we are still 
                         uncomfortable with the arrangement.

                                     BITSEY
                         Meaning?

                                     BILL (V.O.)
                         Meaning you've just spent a very 
                         public seven days in jail for a very 
                         public contempt of court citation.

                                     BITSEY
                         Protecting sources, even kiddie porn 
                         scumbags, is magazine policy.

                                     BILL (V.O.)
                         And I, we continue to appreciate 
                         your decision. We're just concerned. 
                         A rapist slash murderer, five days 
                         before he's executed, demands a 
                         reporter known for protecting sexual 
                         deviants. A reporter who is also a 
                         very attractive woman --

               Bitsey and Kruger moan in unison.

                                     KRUGER
                         This is disparate treatment.

                                     BITSEY
                         I could go if I were an ugly blabby 
                         guy?

                                     BILL (V.O.)
                         There's an agenda issue here which 
                         would be diffused with an older 
                         male...

                                     KRUGER
                         I hear lawyers gleefully saying the 
                         words Bloom vs. News Magazine Inc.

                                     BITSEY
                         'Well, Your Honor, I started to notice 
                         that my assignments were evaluated

                                     KRUGER
                         You've gotta let her go now.

                                     BILL (V.O.)
                         That's not quite what I meant.

                                     KRUGER
                         He's gotta let you go.

                         'Certain references were made -- '

                              (interrupting)
                         All right. All right. Enough. The 
                         intern is with you at all times?

               Bitsey vehemently shakes her head "no" to this idea.

                                     KRUGER
                         Yes. I, we are hanging up. 'Bye.

               Kruger hangs up the phone before he can respond.

                                     BITSEY
                         I'm not baby-sitting.

               Kruger reaches for a chip.

               INT. RENTAL CAR - NIGHT

               ZACK (boyish, 24) sits in the passenger seat, smoking and 
               looking at a case file in his lap. He holds the cigarette 
               just outside the slightly open window. Zack has a bohemian 
               grunge thing going -- long hair, ultra-hip glasses. As Bitsey 
               drives, she keeps looking down at the dash's instrument panel. 
               We hear strained patience in her voice.

                                     BITSEY
                         Gale was seen leaving the house.

               EXT. INTERSTATE 45 - NIGHT

               The car's lights move past a sign: "Huntsville 27 Miles."

                                     BITSEY (V.O.)
                         His sperm was inside her.

               INT. RENTAL CAR - NIGHT

                                     BITSEY
                         His prints were all over the kitchen, 
                         including one on the bag.

               Zack has a police photo: a woman naked on a kitchen floor, 
               hands handcuffed behind her. Over her head is an opaque white 
               plastic bag, sealed around the neck with duct tape.

                                     ZACK
                         Half-a-thumb print.

                                     BITSEY
                         Okay, half-a-thumb print.

                                     ZACK
                         Could have touched it before it was 
                         a murder weapon.

                                     BITSEY
                         Do you fondle your friends' garbage 
                         bags?

                                     ZACK
                         Yeah, I get very touchy around 
                         household plastics. 'Hello, everybody -- 
                         ooooh, Tupperware.' Chill. I'm just 
                         saying the bag could have been out 
                         on the counter or something.

               She looks at him a beat.

                                     BITSEY
                         Hey, Zack?

                                     ZACK
                         Yeah.

                                     BITSEY
                         He did it.

                                     ZACK
                         But the murder's way too fucking 
                         clumsy. And this guy's a major 
                         intellectual. Top of his Yale class, 
                         a Rhodes gig, tenured at 27, two 
                         books. He's an academic stud.

                                     BITSEY
                         And, empirically speaking, a 
                         psychotic.

               Zack picks up another file photo: Christmas shot of the Gale 
               family: David (31), his wife (Sharon, beautiful, 29), and 
               son (Chase, 6).

                                     ZACK
                         Look at his wife, she's a regular 
                         Grace Kelly. Old money svelte. Father 
                         was Ambassador to Spain --

                                     BITSEY
                              (looking at the car's 
                              instrument panel)
                         Shit! The light's on again.

               CLOSEUP - OVERHEAT LIGHT

               is on.

               BACK TO SCENE

                                     ZACK
                         Ignore it. It's a rental.

                                     BITSEY
                         Thanks, Zack. Do you smell anything?

                                     ZACK
                         No. Besides the guy's a flaming 
                         liberal.

               Bitsey keeps looking down at the light.

                                     BITSEY
                         A person's politics has nothing to 
                         do with their propensity to commit 
                         crime.
                              (beat)
                         Aren't we supposed to smell it if 
                         it's overheating?

                                     ZACK
                         Wrong, seventy-three percent of all 
                         serial killers vote republican.

                                     BITSEY
                         Throw the cigarette out so we can 
                         smell.

               Zack reaches for the car ashtray.

                                     BITSEY
                         No! You'll stink up the car. Throw 
                         it out!

                                     ZACK
                         I'm not gonna fucking pollute.

                                     BITSEY
                         Zack!

               Zack pinches the cherry off, lets it drop out the window.

               He shows her the filter, animatedly puts in the ash tray.

               She gives him a look. They ride a beat in silence.

               Bitsey sniffs.

                                     BITSEY
                         We better pull off. Shit, this is so 
                         irritating.

                                     ZACK
                         How far to Huntsville?

                                     BITSEY
                         Look.

               She points to an approaching rest area exit sign. They share 
               a glance, then a laugh. Zack affects an evil, maniacal cackle.

                                     ZACK
                              ('Hard Copy' 
                              announcer's voice)
                         'NEWS Magazine reporters Bitsy Bloom 
                         and Zack Stemmons entered the rest 
                         area with car trouble...

               EXT. REST AREA EXIT - NIGHT

               The car exits for the rest area.

                                     ZACK (V.O.)
                         Little did they know their troubles 
                         were just beginning.

               Zack mimics the OPENING MUSIC to "Dark Shadows."

               EXT. REST AREA - NIGHT

               Well lit and empty. The rental car is parked with the hood 
               up. They stand looking at the radiator.

                                     BITSEY
                         Is it hot?

               He puts his hand on it.

                                     ZACK
                         Oww! Jesus, yes. Isn't it always?

               Bitsey shrugs.

                                     ZACK
                         So what do I do?

                                     BITSEY
                         I don't know, something male.

               Zack animatedly adjusts his balls, spits.

                                     ZACK
                         Now what?

               Bitsey's not paying attention. She's watching headlights 
               coming toward them.

                                     BITSEY
                         Company.

                                     ZACK
                         I hope whoever it is never saw 
                         Deliverance.

               A late model pickup pulls up behind them. They shade their 
               eyes from its headlights. The lights go off. An OLDER COWBOY 
               (mid-60's, Stetson, lizard skin boots) steps out.

                                     OLDER COWBOY
                         You folks need some help?

                                     BITSEY
                         Actually yes.

               EXT. HUNTSVILLE MOTEL SIX - NIGHT

               The motel lies adjacent to Interstate 45 and a Kettle 
               restaurant. The rental car pulls up to the reception building.

               EXT. HUNTSVILLE MOTEL SIX - NEXT DAY

               The rental car is parked in front. The morning is overcast, 
               it's sprinkling. Bitsey emerges from one of the rooms on the 
               second floor carrying an umbrella.

               INT. KETTLE RESTAURANT - DAY

               Bitsey enters and sees Zack in a booth, smoking and reading. 
               The hyper-smiley TEENAGE HOSTESS approaches her.

                                     HOSTESS
                         How are you this morning?

               Bitsey ignores her, takes a menu without comment. She goes 
               and sits across from Zack; he's reading Dialogical Exhaustion 
               by David Gale.

                                     BITSEY
                         Little early, isn't it?

                                     ZACK
                         The non-smoking section's over there.

                                     BITSEY
                         I meant the book.

                                     ZACK
                         Oh.

               Bitsey opens the menu; he puts the book down.

                                     BITSEY
                         What time is it?

                                     ZACK
                         9:15. The waitress says the Ellis 
                         Unit is about fifteen minutes out of 
                         town, so we've got like five and 
                         half hours. I --

                                     BITSEY
                         Never eat where the menus have 
                         pictures of the food.

                                     ZACK
                         I was thinking we should drive to 
                         Austin, check out the crime scene. 
                         Could be some story stuff for us.

                                     BITSEY
                              (without looking up)
                         First, this isn't a story. It's an 
                         interview. We come, I listen, you 
                         watch, we go home. Second, there is 
                         no 'us' in the assignment.

                                     ZACK
                         Okay, what do I watch you do for the 
                         next five hours?

                                     BITSEY
                              (closing the menu)
                         Drive around looking for decent 
                         restaurant.

                                     ZACK
                         You know, your reputation as Siberian-
                         Female-Dog-Person doesn't do you 
                         justice.

               She's unsure how to interpret his comment. He smiles.

                                     BITSEY
                         My reputation got us invited here. I 
                         play by the rules. It's called 
                         objectivity.

               They stare at each other. Zack picks up his book, starts to 
               read, affects a shiver.

               EXT. ELLIS UNIT DRIVE GUARDHOUSE - DAY

               Drizzle. The prison and adjacent parking lot can be seen a 
               few hundred yards down the road. In front of the guardhouse 
               is a sign: "TDC Ellis Unit. All visitors must report."

               SUPERIMPOSE: "DAY ONE"

               The rental car ENTERS the FRAME, brakes briefly for the empty 
               guardhouse, and moves on toward the prison.

               EXT. ELLIS UNIT PARKING LOT - DAY

               Bitsey and Zack get out of their car. She has an umbrella.

                                     ZACK
                         So where do we report?

               Three razor wire fences surround the prison. Guard towers 
               rise at the corners. Outside the fence sits a small building 
               with a sign: "REPORT HERE."

               Bitsey makes a there-you-have-it face. They move toward the 
               building.

               Someone hawks. They look over. Within the fence, a skinny 
               Hispanic inmate (50's) spits. He's hunched in the rain thirty 
               yards away. He watches them neutrally.

               CAMERA TRACKS Bitsey and Zack as they walk nervously past a 
               series of kennel-like pens that run along a long building. 
               Inmates watch them pass: A smoking, tattooed white male (30's) 
               stands by his door. A muscular black man (30's) with a Muslim 
               skullcap speaks quietly to the forty-something redneck beside 
               him. A paunchy Hispanic (20's) with a shaved head sits back 
               against the building, making clicking sounds. A skinny white 
               guy with his shirt off tosses a tennis ball against the 
               building. At the closest end of the last pen, a gang-banger 
               (20's) watches as he stands with his fingers clutching the 
               chain-link above his head. Rain runs down his face.

               INT. ELLIS RECEPTION OFFICE

               As Bitsey and Zack enter, a clean-cut man in his forties is 
               on the phone (DUKE GROVER). He waves them in and holds up a 
               wait-just-a-second finger.

                                     GROVER
                         Well, I don't rightly know one 
                         fraternity from another. But if we 
                         catch any those boys out here again, 
                         we're gonna Arrest and Prosecute... 
                         You do that, Susan... Bye now.

               The office has cheap wood paneling and a tired shag carpet. 
               A portrait of GOVERNOR HARDIN (female, mid-50's) is on the 
               wall, a large aerial photograph of the prison on the other. 
               At a desk sits a WOMAN WITH TEXAS HAIR (40's).

               Grover hangs up.

                                     GROVER
                              (to the Woman)
                         Thank you, Margie.
                              (turning to Bitsey 
                              and Zack)
                         Correspondents Bloom and Stevens I 
                         presume.

                                     BITSEY
                         Yes, hello.

               They shake hands.

                                     ZACK
                         Stemmons.

                                     GROVER
                         Stemmons. Sorry, won't happen again. 
                         I'm Duke Grover, T.D.C. community 
                         relations.

               Grover's demeanor suggests a successful Little League coach, 
               his suit suggests J.C. Penny. He speaks quickly.

                                     MARGIE (WOMAN)
                         He's usually real good with names.

                                     GROVER
                              (to Bitsey)
                         And these days I always like to ask, 
                         now do you prefer Miss, Mrs. or Ms.?

                                     BITSEY
                         Bitsey.

                                     GROVER
                         Bitsey it is. Margie, I'm stealin' 
                         your umbrella.

                                     MARGIE
                         Okey dokey.

               EXT. ELLIS UNIT ENTRANCE

               Bitsey and Grover walk beneath their umbrellas toward the 
               Unit gate -- Grover walks as fast as he talks. Zack follows, 
               turns his collar up.

                                     GROVER
                         Bitsey, you ever been in a prison?

                                     BITSEY
                         Yes.

               Zack smiles to himself.

                                     GROVER
                         On death row?

                                     BITSEY
                         No.

                                     GROVER
                         Well, we house 422 inmates here. 
                         Average stay with us is nine years. 
                         Some get commuted, move on, most get 
                         killed. It'll put you off your supper, 
                         but then it's supposed to.

               The unit fence gate parts as they enter. The older gate guard 
               nods as they pass.

                                     GROVER
                              (to the guard)
                         Afternoon, Earl.
                              (back to her)
                         We've got three concerns here: safety, 
                         safety and safety. The visitation 
                         area is entirely secure -- we just 
                         ask you don't touch the glass. Windex 
                         gets expensive.

               They come to the door of the entrance area.

                                     GROVER
                         Rules say seven days prior to 
                         execution inmates must be interviewed 
                         in a cage.

               The DOOR BUZZES, Grover opens it.

               INT. ELLIS ENTRANCE LOBBY - DAY

               The lobby has institutional chairs and few vending machines. 
               To one side is a guard's counter and a walk through metal 
               detector. They enter and make their way toward the counter.

                                     GROVER
                         This changes for no man. You're not 
                         carryin' a weapon are you?

                                     BITSEY
                         No.

                                     GROVER
                         Mr. Stemmons, you packin'?

                                     ZACK
                         No, sir.

               They arrive at the counter. Behind it are two GUARDS, one 
               male, one female.

                                     GROVER
                              (to the guards)
                         Clarence. Karla. New York guests for 
                         Mr. Gale.

                                     CLARENCE (GUARD)
                         May I see your purse, ma'am.

                                     GROVER
                              (to Bitsey, indicating 
                              the metal detector)
                         Go on and walk through.

               Grover keeps talking as he walks around the detector and 
               waits for her.

                                     GROVER
                         Now, should any kinda of 
                         unpleasantness occur in the visitation 
                         area, we ask that you stay put. Come 
                         on through, Mr. Stemmons. And please 
                         follow the instructions of these 
                         fine correctional officers should 
                         they see fit to give you any.

                                     CLARENCE
                              (handing her the purse)
                         Here you go, ma'am.

               He leads them down the hall.

                                     GROVER
                         Anythin' you say can be overheard.

               And any discussion of criminal activity on your part is 
               admissible. Not plannin' a jailbreak are you, Bitsey?

               INT. ELLIS VISITATION AREA - DAY

               The door guard gets up from his small table and opens the 
               door for them.

                                     GROVER
                         Here we are.

               The visitation hall has the linoleum-and-fluorescent feel of 
               an empty school cafeteria. It is seamlessly intersected by 
               curved wall of sheer glass. Across the hall a guard's booth 
               is built into the concrete wall; the two guards inside look 
               like they are in a sound booth.

               Every fifteen feet, the glass has small sound holes. On the 
               visitors' side, chairs (with lap desks) cluster at each 
               section. Just getting up from a chair in the hall's center 
               is a big man wearing an expensive suit and black cowboy boots. 
               This is David's lawyer, BENJAMIN BELYEU (late 30's).

               On the prisoner's side of the glass, a row of ten chairs 
               trace the outline of its curve. Above each chair a microphone 
               hangs from the ceiling. The center chair is in a stainless 
               steel cage. Inside sits David Gale.

                                     GROVER
                              (calling out to Belyeu)
                         All yours, Mr. Belyeu.
                              (to Bitsey and Zack)
                         You folks have safe visit now.

                                     BITSEY
                         Thank you.

               He exits as Bitsey and Zack make their way toward Belyeu and 
               David; it's a walk of about twenty-five feet.

               Belyeu's voice is a thick combination of Cajun and Harvard 
               Yard.

                                     BELYEU
                         Miss Bloom?

                                     BITSEY
                         Yes.

               Belyeu speaks as slowly as Grover did quickly. David stands 
               up politely in his cage -- he's too tall and has to hunch.

                                     BELYEU
                         Did that P.R. man validate your 
                         parkin'?

                                     BITSEY
                         He said the gift shop could do it.

               Belyeu laughs, smiles pure Old New Orleans charm.

                                     BELYEU
                              (to David)
                         She's a smart one.

               Belyeu takes a few steps toward them, extends his hand.

                                     BELYEU
                         Benjamin Belyeu, Mr. Gale's attorney.

                                     BITSEY
                         This is Zack.

                                     BELYEU
                         Pleasure.
                              (turning)
                         And this is the man of the hour.

               They move toward David. A SPEAKER-SYSTEM LOUDLY (really 
               loudly) interrupts:

                                     GUARD (V.O.)
                         Sit down, Gale.

               All wince. David sits, smiles, a bit embarrassed.

                                     DAVID
                         Hello.

                                     BITSEY
                         Hello.

                                     ZACK
                         Hi.

                                     BELYEU
                         Now, why can't they turn that thing 
                         down?

                                     DAVID
                              (to the microphone 
                              above him)
                         My lawyer respectfully suggests you 
                         adjust the speaker-system volume.

               A beat. They all look over at the guard's booth. One of the 
               guards makes a get-on-with-your-business gesture.

                                     DAVID
                         They're practicing being cruel and 
                         unusual.

                                     BELYEU
                         Mrs. Bloom, I'm sure you're a bitin' 
                         at the bit.

               Belyeu collects papers from the chair he was using and starts 
               to stuff them into his antique carpetbag.

                                     BELYEU
                         Now, it is our understanding that 
                         you are to have three two-hour 
                         sessions. Today, tomorrow and 
                         Thursday, all at three in the P.M. 
                         I'm sorry we can't afford you more 
                         time, but contrary to popular rumor 
                         we have not yet begun to fight. 
                         Furthermore, it's our understanding 
                         that you will do this with no 
                         recording equipment of any kind.
                              (to David)
                         You have my Gregg book?

                                     DAVID
                         I need it for Billy's appeal.

                                     BELYEU
                              (to Bitsey)
                         My client's got a ten pound bass on 
                         the line and he's worried about 
                         baitin' his neighbor's hook.
                              (takes out his planner)
                         Now, I have some papers for which I 
                         need your Jo Ann Hancock.
                              (handing her a business 
                              card)
                         Come by my Austin office at your 
                         earliest convenience. Thursday 
                         mornin', say.

               Bitsey's confused. Belyeu just smiles at her, then looks up 
               at the microphone. She understands, nods.

                                     BELYEU
                         Fine, till Thursday then.

               Belyeu picks up his bag. He and Zack start the hike to the 
               door. Belyeu turns, walks backwards.

                                     BELYEU
                         Good luck, Miss Bloom.
                              (to David)
                         I'll come by later. We can play a 
                         game of hangman, take up smokin'.

               David waves "get lost." Belyeu turns.

                                     BELYEU
                         Bye, ya' all.

               They watch him walk away. Bitsey turns to David. He's looking 
               at the floor, caught in a thought.

                                     BITSEY
                         So...

                                     DAVID
                         Sorry. Have a seat.

               She does so. David smiles at her, he has a beautiful smile, 
               sincere, charming, vaguely devilish.

                                     BITSEY
                         He's a character.

                                     DAVID
                         Yeah, known Benny most my life. Met 
                         the summer after 4th grade, spent 
                         the day burning ants with his dad's 
                         magnifying glass. We called it playing 
                         'Execution.'

               David looks at her a beat, lets the irony of this sit in the 
               air. Uncomfortable, Bitsey starts to look in her purse.

                                     DAVID
                         Since I grew up in foster homes, 
                         he's become the only family I have.

                                     BITSEY
                         Where's your ex-wife?

               Bitsey takes a pad out of her purse, looks for a pen.

                                     DAVID
                         We agreed minimal contact would be 
                         easier. Please don't mention her, or 
                         my son.

                                     BITSEY
                         All right. Anything else, just clearly 
                         say, 'off the record.' I'll take it 
                         to my grave. But then you know that 
                         about me. Otherwise I wouldn't be 
                         here.

               David smiles, nods.

                                     BITSEY
                              (referring to the pen)
                         Is this recording equipment?

               He shrugs.

                                     DAVID
                         How should we start?

                                     BITSEY
                         I'd say you're a man with a story to 
                         tell, Mr. Gale. You chose the 
                         magazine, the format. You chose me.

               She sits with pen on paper, poised for dictation.

                                     BITSEY
                         Go.

               David looks at her a long beat, then gives her the smile.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               SEXY FEMALE GRAD STUDENT (over-dressed in a mini-skirt and 
               heels) moves hurriedly through the University of Texas (U.T.) 
               campus.

               E) FROM BEHIND TWO GRADUATE STUDENTS

               attending class in an U.T. lecture hall -- they are laughing 
               as David entertains from a mike at the podium.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               INT. U.T. LECTURE HALL - DAY

               Thirty animated students (circa 1992) are listening to David 
               lecture. He's younger (31), vibrant -- looks like a grad 
               student himself. On the white board behind him are phrases: 
               "Lucan," "objet petit a," "Fantasy Theory."

                                     DAVID
                         Think. What do you fantasize about? 
                         World peace?
                              (as no one responds)
                         Thought so.
                              (light laughter)
                         Money-Fame-Ferrari?
                              (as some guys applaud 
                              loudly; others then 
                              boo them)
                         A Pulitzer? Nobel? M.T.V. Music Award?
                              (applause)
                         A genius hunk -- ostensibly bad but 
                         secretly simmering with noble 
                         passions, and willing to sleep on 
                         the wet spot?

               As women applaud...

                                     LARGE WOMAN
                              (yells)
                         I'll take two!

               Laughter.

                                     DAVID
                         A Victoria's Secret model -- just 
                         slumming between law school and 
                         running her family's Vastly Endowed 
                         Foundation for Tragically Sad-Eyed 
                         Children?

               The crowd laughs, David changes tone.

                                     DAVID
                         Okay, good, you see Lucan's point. 
                         Fantasies must be unrealistic. The 
                         minute you get something, you don't, 
                         you can't, want it anymore. To exist, 
                         desire needs absent objects. So desire 
                         supports itself with crazy 
                         fantasies...

               The over-dressed Sexy Grad Student enters loudly from a side 
               door, out-of-breath and discombobulated. The crowd laughs at 
               the timing. David pauses.

                                     STUDENT
                         Sorry.

               He animatedly gestures to the seats, waits a beat as she 
               moves towards them.

                                     DAVID
                         This is what Pascal means when he 
                         says the only time we're truly happy 
                         is when day-dreaming about future 
                         happiness.

               The Sexy Student sits, adjusts herself.

                                     DAVID
                         Or why we say, 'The hunt is sweeter 
                         than the kill' or 'Be careful what 
                         you wish for.'

               A guy behind the Sexy Student taps her on the shoulder, she 
               turns and he hands her letter from the registrar's office. 
               It's from a girl friend two rows back. The girlfriend mouths, 
               "It came today?"

                                     DAVID (O.S.)
                         Not because you'll get it, but because 
                         you're doomed not to want it if you 
                         do. Think about it next time you're 
                         at a wedding.

               Laughter. The Sexy Student turns back around, throws the 
               letter in a book.

               INT. U.T. HALLWAY - DAY

               Students pour out of the double doors leading from David's 
               class. The hall is crowded. Standing waiting for him against 
               the wall is Constance (glasses, granola clothes).

               She's looking at a document, holds a file.

               INT. U.T. LECTURE HALL - DAY

               The students are leaving. David is quickly erasing the white-
               board. The Sexy Student approaches him (her name is Berlin).

                                     BERLIN (SEXY STUDENT)
                         Sorry about being late. There was, 
                         you know, a thing.

                                     DAVID
                         There usually is, Berlin.

                                     BERLIN
                         Look, I know I'm not doing well.

               He turns, nods, takes his books and papers from the podium.

                                     BERLIN
                         And to torture a cliche, I'd do 
                         anything to pass.

               He looks at her a beat, starts to walk toward the door.

                                     BERLIN
                         Anything, Professor Gale.

               He stops, turns.

                                     DAVID
                         Anything, huh?

                                     BERLIN
                              (suggestively)
                         Anything.

                                     DAVID
                              (the smile)
                         Anything?

               She affects a solicitous shyness -- then goes all sex.

                                     BERLIN
                         Any thing.

               He checks the room, then comes over to her, close.

                                     DAVID
                         Tell you what, I'll give you good 
                         grade, a really good grade, if you 
                         will...
                              (leans down to her 
                              ear, whispers 
                              sensually)
                         ...study.

               He smiles, turns, walks away. As she watches, anger builds.

               INT. U.T. HALLWAY - DAY

               David comes out the room. Constance sees him, hurries to 
               him. She's excited, and speaks now -- as always -- with 
               absolute authority. They talk as they walk down the crowded 
               hall.

                                     CONSTANCE
                         David!

                                     DAVID
                         Hey.

                                     CONSTANCE
                         The T.A. finished transcribing the 
                         Governor's radio and TV comments. 
                         Listen: 'I hate killing, that's why 
                         I'm willing to kill to stop it.' The 
                         woman breathes in soundbites.

               She hands him a copy.

                                     DAVID
                              (pretends to read a 
                              quote)
                         'Yes, Virginia, the people of this 
                         State have overwhelmingly affirmed 
                         the reality of Santa.'

                                     CONSTANCE
                         You might can use some of her pre-
                         centrist stuff.

                                     DAVID
                         Tell me again why you aren't doing 
                         the debate.

                                     CONSTANCE
                         Telegenics. You have a cuter butt.

                                     DAVID
                         I hadn't noticed.

                                     CONSTANCE
                         I know.

                                     DAVID
                         That's not what I meant.

               EXT. U.T. CAMPUS - DAY

               David and Constance exit the building into the sun.

                                     CONSTANCE
                         She's gonna do the whole mother thing. 
                         She empathizes with you completely, 
                         but experience has given her the 
                         courage to take the tougher road, ta-
                         da, ta-da. Keep it rational. And 
                         flirt politely.

                                     DAVID
                         'Governor, you bat a lovely lash for 
                         a woman who executed thirty eight 
                         last year.'

               They've come to a sidewalk junction, stop.

                                     CONSTANCE
                         And watch your ego. Don't come across 
                         as one of those I-hate-authority-

                         New Yorker types.

                                     DAVID
                         Anything else?

                                     CONSTANCE
                         Yeah, don't fall into one of your 
                         brooding silences. Oh, I'm getting 
                         new federal stats from Amnesty 
                         tonight.

                                     DAVID
                         I'm going to Greer's party. Fax them 
                         to Sharon's number at the house.

               She looks at him sternly over the top of her glasses.

                                     CONSTANCE
                         If you have a hang-over tomorrow --

                                     DAVID
                              (hangs up, walking 
                              away)
                         Apropos playing Mother.

                                     CONSTANCE
                              (calling after him)
                         Ten o'clock!
                              (beat)
                         Bright-eyed and bushy tailed!

               EXT. GALE HOME - ESTABLISHING - NIGHT

               The house is an immaculately restored two-story Victorian, 
               far better than what a university professor can afford.

               The grounds are perfect. David's Volvo is in the driveway, 
               his wife's new Laredo beside it. On the street out front 
               sits a new VW Beetle.

               INT. KID'S ROOM - NIGHT

               David's son -- CHASE -- sits in bed holding a stuffed sheep 
               in the air. David turns off the light in the adjacent 
               bathroom, comes in holding his son's jeans and shoes. David 
               wears a t-shirt which says "Evil-Doer & Curious Person." The 
               room is over-decorated with boy stuff.

                                     DAVID
                         Did you mark your calendar?

                                     CHASE
                              (looking up at it)
                         Yep.

               INSERT - KID'S CALENDAR

               hangs above the bed, opened to the month of March. It has a 
               felt-tipped pen hanging from a piece of string taped to it. 
               Ten frowny faces cover ten consecutive days, then there are 
               three empty days before a large smiley face awaits on the 
               fourth. The frowny faces are in a kid's hand, the smiley 
               face in an adult's.

               BACK TO SCENE

                                     CHASE
                              (counting on his 
                              fingers)
                         Only... three more Spain days.

               David puts the jeans and shoes away.

                                     DAVID
                         Only three. That's great, huh?

               David comes and sits beside his son. Points to an African 
               statue (a man holding a spear) on the bedside table.

                                     DAVID
                         What's he doing in here?

                                     CHASE
                         Mommy said I could. Just till she 
                         gets back.
                              (touching the spear)
                         That's a special-duper monster laser 
                         knife.

                                     DAVID
                         Where's your laser gun?

               Chase reaches under the sheets, searches, finally pulls out 
               a laser pointer.

                                     CHASE
                         Here.

               He "shoots" some toys in the corner with the red laser dot.

                                     CHASE
                         Tussshh, tusssshh, tussshh. I never 
                         shoot them in the eyes, Daddy.

                                     DAVID
                         That's 'cause you're a special-duper-
                         super-quadruper boy. Who's now going 
                         to sleep.

               He tucks his son in.

                                     DAVID
                         Who loves you?

               Chase giggles, points at his dad, then pokes his nose.

                                     DAVID
                         Ooooh.
                              (kissing him)
                         Good night, son.

                                     CHASE
                              (holding up his stuffed 
                              sheep)
                         Do Cloud Dog.

                                     DAVID
                              (kissing the sheep)
                         Good night, Cloud Dog.

               INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

               Obsessively cool, full of designer furniture and rough 
               fabrics. The art is mostly contemporary and conspicuously 
               lit -- a Damien Hirst piece sits in one corner. A few African 
               antiquities are scattered throughout.

               A BABYSITTER sits on the couch reading a school textbook, 
               holding lip gloss and absentmindedly applying it as she reads. 
               David passes on his way to the door.

                                     DAVID
                         Back before midnight.

                                     BABYSITTER
                         It's cool, Mr. Gale.
                              (calling after him)
                         Don't do anything I wouldn't.

                                     DAVID (O.S.)
                         Rest assured.

               He exits. When she hears the DOOR CLOSE, the Babysitter 
               reaches for the TV remote.

               INT. DUPLEX - LIVING AREA - NIGHT

               The duplex is upscale, two-story with a vaulted ceiling.

               Scattered about are forty party-goers, mostly grad students. 
               Some spill out onto the back patio and around the pool. 
               Everyone has a t-shirt with a philosophic idea ("Yawnic," 
               "Mad, Bad and Dangerous to Know," "[Philosophic t-shirt]".) 
               LEONARD COHEN MUSIC PLAYS.

               FROM FRONT DOOR

               GREER (late 20s, Persian, "Host" t-shirt) escorts David into 
               the living room.

                                     GREER
                         The guy's the Immanuel Kant of the 
                         N.F.L. Consistent, accurate, 
                         effective, and boring, boring, boring.

               Greer leaves him at the sofa where an OLDER PROFESSOR (60s, 
               homemade t-shirt -- "Pre-Socratic" -- over his shirt and 
               tie) stands speaking with ROSS (late 40s, "Homosexualist" t-
               shirt).

                                     DAVID
                         Meinen Herren.

                                     ROSS
                              (has an Oxford accent)
                         Hello, David.

                                     OLDER PROFESSOR
                         Professor Gale. Where's your better 
                         half?

                                     DAVID
                         Spain.

                                     OLDER PROFESSOR
                         Again?
                              (a beat)
                         Well, I was just off for air.

               He moves to the patio. They watch him go.

                                     DAVID
                              (under his breath)
                         Looks like Sharon's affair is an 
                         open secret.

                                     ROSS
                              (under his breath)
                         Hermeneutical bias: the only fun 
                         truths are the ones someone's trying 
                         to hide.
                              (normal tone)
                         Have a seat.

               They sit on the sofa.

                                     ROSS
                         Listen, Berlin's here -- and livid. 
                         Probations suspended her. She received 
                         the letter today, took the opportunity 
                         to throw a fit in my office. You 
                         should --

                                     BERLIN (O.S.)
                         Talking about me?

               She's standing behind them. David tilts his head back.

                                     DAVID
                         Yep.

               She's tipsy, brings her face down between their heads.

                                     BERLIN
                              (to David)
                         He tell you I said when you were 
                         circumcised they threw away the wrong 
                         part.

                                     DAVID
                         He mentioned it.

               An uncomfortable beat. She reaches over and takes Ross's 
               drink from his hand, drinks the rest, puts it back.

                                     DAVID
                         It's called schmuck.

                                     BERLIN
                         What?

                                     DAVID
                         The part of the foreskin that gets 
                         thrown away. I think it's called 
                         schmuck.

                                     BERLIN
                         Aren't we so fucking clever.

                                     ROSS
                              (standing, escaping)
                         I suppose I should get us another. 
                         David?

                                     DAVID
                         Black Bush.

               Ross walks to the bar. Berlin comes around and sits in his 
               seat. Her mid-drift T-shirt reads "Sex is Power."

                                     BERLIN
                         You were a jerk this afternoon.

               A beat. She's turned facing him, he looks forward.

                                     DAVID
                         For what it's worth, I didn't know 
                         about the suspension.

                                     BERLIN
                         Is that supposed to be an apology?

                                     DAVID
                         More like a conciliation.

               ON FOOD AND DRINKS TABLE

               Ross has two gin-and-tonics and is finishing pouring David's 
               Black Bush. He moves away. The table is neatly laid with 
               snacks and bottles. The flower arrangement is perfect.

               SAME SCENE - LATER

               The table is now in mid-party chaos. Food spilled, bottles 
               empty, the flowers in disarray. "I'M TOO SEXY" PLAYS LOUDLY 
               in the background. Berlin takes a bottle of Red Label from 
               the table.

               CAMERA TRACKS her THROUGH the living room, where a few people 
               now dance, and out onto the patio.

               A crowd well on their way to being drunk gathers by the pool. 
               They surround two patio chairs which face each other, one 
               with David, the other with Ross. The men are playing an Irish 
               drinking game -- the crowd has chosen favorites.

                                     ROSS
                              (slurring a bit)
                         All right.
                              (clears his throat)
                         As the poets have mournfully sung, 
                         Death takes the innocent young, The 
                         screamingly funny, The rolling in 
                         money, And those who are very well 
                         hung.

               Laughter, a few animated moans. David raises his glass to 
               Ross and downs a whiskey. Someone starts to chant: "Gale! 
               Gale! Gale!"

                                     DAVID
                              (feeling good but 
                              very much in control)
                         There once was a lesbian from Canjuom, 
                         Who took a young man to her room, 
                         And they argued all night, As to who 
                         had the right, To do what, how, and 
                         to whom.

               Laughter. Two women holding each other boo. Ross drinks.

                                     BERLIN
                         One more. C'mon, one more.

                                     DAVID
                         Enough. That's enough.

               The crowd wants more. Someone makes chicken sounds.

                                     ROSS
                         Do you bow to the Queen?

               David looks at him, contemplates, then smiles. He holds his 
               glass out for a refill. The crowd applauds.

               FULL SHOT OF PATIO

               The crowd is chanting: "Ross! Ross! Ross!"

               SAME SCENE - LATER

               The crowd has dispersed. A couple of small groups converse. 
               Someone is being thrown into the pool. TECHNO MUSIC PLAYS. 
               Inside the duplex a few dancers are still going at it.

               INT. BATHROOM

               David is washing his face. As he dries, the TECHNO MUSIC 
               downstairs gets BRIEFLY LOUDER. He looks from beneath the 
               towel into the mirror. Berlin has entered the bathroom.

                                     DAVID
                         I'm done.

               She locks the door, leans back against it. She's flushed.

               He folds the towel.

                                     BERLIN
                         I'm not a student anymore.

                                     DAVID
                         Don't think I want to know what that 
                         means.

               David lays the towel down, leans back against the sink --
               they face each other on opposite sides of the bathroom.

                                     BERLIN
                         There once was woman named Berlin, 
                         Who liked a bit now and again. Not 
                         now and again, But Now! And Again! 
                         And Again! And Again! And Again!

               He laughs.

                                     BERLIN
                         Cute, huh?

                                     DAVID
                         Cute.

                                     BERLIN
                         I have a secret. But I have to come 
                         over there to tell you.

               He makes an I'm-not-so-sure face. She moves playfully toward 
               him.

                                     BERLIN
                         Here I come.

               She comes up to him, leans into him as she puts her mouthclose 
               to his ear. He keeps his hands back on the sink counter.

                                     BERLIN
                              (whispering)
                         I wasn't after the grade.

               She stands with her body against him, looks into his eyes.

                                     DAVID
                         Berlin, this, this is not...

               She puts her fingers over his mouth, keeps them there.

                                     BERLIN
                         Ssshhhh.

               With her free hand she takes one of his, rubs it against her 
               face and lips as she speaks.

                                     BERLIN
                         We'll just talk, analyze, contemplate. 
                         Or... you can put your mouth on my 
                         body.

               She moves his hand down, brushing it against her breast and 
               to her groin. She brings her mouth toward her fingers -- 
               which are still against his lips.

                                     BERLIN
                              (softly, vulnerably)
                         Don't reject me. Please.

               With her eyes open, she kisses the back of her own fingers, 
               runs her tongue between them, opens them to reach his mouth.

               INT. HALLWAY

               A Hispanic woman (T-shirt: "DerriDa-Da") bee-bops to the 
               bathroom door. Tries the handle, then dances away.

               INT. LIVING ROOM

               About eight dancers dance to the TECHNO MUSIC -- its pace 
               increasing. A couple them are really into it.

               INT. BATHROOM

               Berlin and David are against the sink, kissing in full 
               passion. The MUSIC from downstairs seems LOUDER. Her T shirt 
               is off. Panting, he turns her against the sink.

               Pulls her skirt up, reaches for her panties.

                                     BERLIN
                         Rip them.

                                     DAVID
                         What?

                                     BERLIN
                         Rip them off.

               He does so.

               INT. KITCHEN

               Ross sits at the kitchen table, holding his throbbing head 
               against the POUNDING MUSIC. Greer sets a cup of coffee in 
               front of him, sits across. A long beat. They seem like parents 
               waiting out a teenager's party.

               INT. BATHROOM

               Berlin is back against the sink, undoing David's fly as he 
               takes his T-shirt off. The MUSIC from downstairs seems even 
               LOUDER. His pants and underwear fall. He starts to penetrate 
               her.

                                     BERLIN
                         No. From behind.

               She turns, faces the mirror. He positions himself behind, 
               enters her.

                                     BERLIN
                         Yes.

               He moves against her.

                                     BERLIN
                         Do it hard.

               He looks at her in the mirror, then continues. She watches 
               him.

               ON PATIO

               A guy sits alone at the far end of the pool on a lounger.

               The dancers can be seen in the living room behind him.

               INT. BATHROOM

               David thrusts against Berlin, her thighs pound against the 
               edge of the sink. The MUSIC is as LOUD as it is downstairs.

                                     BERLIN
                         Harder.

               He looks at her in the mirror, unsure.

                                     BERLIN
                         Harder.

               He thrusts harder.

                                     BERLIN
                         Yes.

               They continue in rhythm. She reaches back and pulls him into 
               her.

                                     BERLIN
                         Bite me. Bite my shoulder.

               She watches him do so in the mirror.

               INT. LIVING ROOM

               The dancers dance -- the TECHNO PACE has INCREASED even more. 
               One dancer is a blur.

               INT. BATHROOM

               Berlin is pulling David into her. They approach a climax.

               She scratches him on the small of the back. Blood trickles.

               INT. LIVING ROOM

               The MUSIC and dancers are in pure FRENZY. Suddenly, the MUSIC 
               STOPS. Greer stands by the STEREO, his hand coming back from 
               the power button. He gestures "that's-all-folks."

               INT. BATHROOM

               David and Berlin stand still and apart, breathing heavily 
               into the reality-inducing silence. He looks at her in the 
               mirror, a look of shame. She gives him an odd smile.

                                                              SMASH CUT TO:

               BLACK

               FADE IN:

               INT. CONSTANCE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

               Constance wakes with a jolt, sweating. She gets up and goes 
               into her bathroom.

               INT. BATHROOM - NIGHT

               She turns on the light, moves to the sink, opens the medicine 
               cabinet. It's stacked with prescription medicines. Suddenly, 
               she turns to the toilette, vomits.

                                                                   FADE TO:

               BLACK.

               FADE IN:

               INT. BARNES & NOBLE COFFEE HOUSE - DAY

               David and Constance sit by a window, the U.T. campus in the 
               b.g. David's distracted, wearing a suit and a long face. 
               She's wearing the closest thing she has to business attire. 
               She has stacks of paper spread in front of her.

                                     CONSTANCE
                         Okay, let's say we find an innocent 
                         on death row. Wouldn't matter. 
                         Corrections would let him go. Governor 
                         Harding would go on TV, say, 'Thanks 
                         to the good people at DeathWatch, 
                         the system works.' Yeah, if they 
                         executed an innocent, and we had 
                         absolute, undeniable, in-your-face 
                         proof, we could demand abolition. 
                         Just like happened in England. Are 
                         you okay?

                                     DAVID
                              (coming out of it)
                         Sorry. Yeah.

               He makes an effort, plays the "good listener."

                                     CONSTANCE
                         But it hasn't happened, not since 
                         '76. And won't happen.

               David nods.

                                     CONSTANCE
                         Dead men can't make a case.

                                     DAVID
                         And 'Almost Martyrs' don't count.

                                     CONSTANCE
                         Just keep it rational. The death 
                         penalty is expensive and ineffective. 
                         No one wants to see a murderer as a 
                         victim.

                                     DAVID
                         Um-hum.

                                     CONSTANCE
                         And stop that.

                                     DAVID
                         What?

                                     CONSTANCE
                         Active listening. I hate active 
                         listeners. Makes me feel like I'm 
                         with a Dale Carnegie grad who cares 
                         more about appearing to listen than 
                         actually listening. Did you bring 
                         the Amnesty fax?

                                     DAVID
                         I can listen and appear to listen at 
                         the same time. Yeah, no. Damn, I 
                         left it home.

                                     CONSTANCE
                         I have a copy.

               She looks through her papers, finds the copy in the stack 
               beneath her coffee cup. She starts to hand it to him. He is 
               looking out the window, caught in a thought.

                                     CONSTANCE
                         You want to tell me what's up.

                                     DAVID
                         Nothing. Everything. Something 
                         profoundly stupid happened last night.

                                     CONSTANCE
                              (teasing)
                         I hope you used a condom.

               A beat. His reaction tells her the jest hit home.

                                     CONSTANCE
                         Jesus Christ, David. Was she one of 
                         yours?

               A longer beat. He holds her eyes.

                                     DAVID
                         It was Berlin.

               She's stunned, then genuinely angry.

                                     CONSTANCE
                         Oh, that's great, great. I can hear 
                         the grapevine now. They suspended 
                         her so Gale could dick her with a 
                         clear conscience.

               He looks at his coffee, which he hasn't touched.

                                     CONSTANCE
                         A power differential equals coercion. 
                         Great. You are so weak.

                                     DAVID
                         Constance, you're not my wife. Thank 
                         God.

                                     CONSTANCE
                         I know you can tell yourself it's a 
                         position I aspire to, but believe 
                         me, I would rather...

               She trails off. They stare at each other a beat. Then, she 
               starts to collect the papers.

                                     DAVID
                         I didn't mean --

                                     CONSTANCE
                         Let's go.

               As she collects, she winces, grabs her side.

                                     DAVID
                         Are you okay?

                                     CONSTANCE
                         Yes, let's just go.

               INT. TELEVISION STUDIO - CONTROL BOOTH - DAY

               Two people sit in front of monitors displaying various angles 
               on sound stage. The main monitor is playing the end of the 
               show's signation.

                                     ASSISTANT DIRECTOR
                         In three, two...

               ON SOUND STAGE

               A camera operator cues the host (50s, male, bow tie). The 
               host is flanked by David and Governor Hardin.

               The set has an upscale regional television look. The Governor 
               has the rare ability to look comfortable while David fidgets.

                                     HOST
                              (to camera)
                         Welcome back to 'Batter's Box.' 
                         Tonight we continue our very special 
                         four-part series with the Governor 
                         Hardin. Arguing capital punishment 
                         with her is DeathWatch coordinator, 
                         Professor David Gale. Governor, you're 
                         up.

                                     GOVERNOR HARDIN
                         Alan, let me say somethin' I always 
                         say.

               Constance stands behind the cameras. She motions to David -- 
               something about the papers in front of him.

                                     GOVERNOR HARDIN
                         And I'm gonna keep on sayin.' And 
                         that is I hate killin.' That's why 
                         my administration is willing to kill 
                         to stop it.

                                     DAVID
                         So you don't subscribe to the idea 
                         that 'a good state is one that 
                         protects its most despised members'?

                                     GOVERNOR HARDIN
                         It's a nice liberal idea, but like 
                         most nice liberal ideas, naive.

                                     DAVID
                         It's a quote from you, Governor, 
                         from your first state attorney 
                         campaign.

               Constance is biting her lip, breaks into a smile. The Governor 
               is unsure how to react, then laughs. The host chuckles with 
               her.

                                     GOVERNOR HARDIN
                         You've got me, Professor. But let 
                         me, in my defense, give you a quote. 
                         Winston Churchill: 'If you're not a 
                         liberal at twenty, you've got no 
                         heart, if you're still a liberal at 
                         thirty, you've got no brain.'

               The host's laughter is overdone. David smiles. Constance 
               bites her lip.

                                     DAVID
                         So, basically you feel, to choose 
                         another quote, 'society must be 
                         cleansed of elements which represent 
                         its own death.'

               The Governor makes an animated thinking face.

                                     GOVERNOR HARDIN
                         Well, yes. I would have to agree.
                              (chuckles again)
                         Did I say that, too?

                                     DAVID
                         No, ma'am. That was Hitler.

               Constance makes a "Yes!" gesture with her hands. The Governor 
               is surprised into silence. The host laughs and, noting her 
               reaction, trails off. David becomes more confident, his tone 
               more sincere.

                                     DAVID
                         Governor, can't we examine the 
                         possibility that capital punishment 
                         isn't working. That murderers aren't 
                         deterred by the law because they 
                         have about as much forethought as 
                         lemmings. That it's expensive, 
                         inequably administered, that...

               David cuts his eyes briefly to Constance.

                                     DAVID
                         ...that we may even be killing 
                         innocents.

               Constance rolls her eyes. The Governor is ready for this.

                                     GOVERNOR HARDIN
                         All righty, Mr. Gale, I'll play your 
                         game. Name one. Name one innocent 
                         man Texas has put to death in my 
                         tenure. One.

               A beat. David doesn't respond.

                                     GOVERNOR HARDIN
                         Name one in the last twenty years. 
                         In any state in this country.

               A long, miserable beat.

                                     HOST
                         Well, Mr. Gale?

                                     DAVID
                         Dead men can't make a case.

                                     GOVERNOR HARDIN
                         Well, as my daddy used to say: If 
                         you can't find a problem, there 
                         probably isn't one.

               Constance shakes her head in irritation.

               BACKSTAGE - LATER

               The show is over. David and the Governor are shaking hands. 
               Constance stands nearby.

                                     GOVERNOR HARDIN
                         Well, you certainly had me on that 
                         Hitler quote.

                                     DAVID
                         Thank you, Governor.

                                     GOVERNOR HARDIN
                         These debates are awfully good for 
                         the state, don't you think?

                                     DAVID
                         Of course.

                                     GOVERNOR HARDIN
                         Well, I've got to buzz.

               She moves toward her handlers.

                                     GOVERNOR HARDIN
                         You folks keep up the good work. We 
                         need that opposition.

               Constance's and David's polite smiles follow her.

               EXT. TELEVISION STATION - DAY

               Constance and David argue as they walk the sidewalk to the 
               parking lot.

                                     CONSTANCE
                         Your exact words were, 'Just tell me 
                         when my ego gets in the way of the 
                         work.' Now I'm telling you: Your 
                         ego's in the way of work.

                                     DAVID
                              (indicating the station)
                         Look, I wanted you to do this anyway.

                                     CONSTANCE
                         You put up precisely two seconds of 
                         protest at the thought of a televised 
                         debate.

                                     DAVID
                         What's that supposed to mean?

                                     CONSTANCE
                         It means DeathWatch suffers because 
                         you're so anxious to finger authority, 
                         to publicly prove that David Gale is 
                         so much fucking smarter than the 
                         powers that be. Learn to work without 
                         an audience. Try squeezing money 
                         from the donor list. Have you ever 
                         licked one single mail-out envelope?

               They come to the end of the sidewalk, where two SUITS are 
               standing -- one Hispanic, one white (30s).

                                     MAN #2 (SUIT)
                         Mr. Gale?

                                     DAVID
                         Look, guys, there's not much more to 
                         say --

                                     MAN #2
                         Rameriz, Austin police. This is 
                         Officer Haslinger.

               The officers show their Ids. Constance takes one to examine 
               it more closely.

                                     DAVID
                         What, arguing with the Governor is a 
                         crime?

               The officers exchange a look.

                                     MAN #3 (SUIT)
                         No, sir, rape is.

               Constance and David look at each other, stunned.

               OVERHEAD SHOT

               CAMERA QUICKLY CRANES UP and ROTATES.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               WHITE.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               INT. ELLIS VISITATION AREA - OVERHEAD SHOT - DAY

               CAMERA CRANES DOWN and ROTATES, ENDING UPRIGHT BY Bitsey as 
               she listens to David.

                                     GUARD (V.O.)
                              (over the loudspeaker)
                         Gale, time's up.

               The speaker, loud as ever, startles Bitsey. David nods over 
               to the guard's booth.

                                     DAVID
                         Berlin had my bite marks, bruises, 
                         ripped clothing. My skin was beneath 
                         her nails. It didn't look like 
                         anything but rape. Two days later 
                         she called the D.A., said she wouldn't 
                         testify, too drunk to be sure, etc. 
                         On the plane home, Sharon read about 
                         her husband's rape case being dropped.

                                     BITSEY
                         Why'd she do it?

               A guard approaches. David stands up and moves to the back of 
               his cage, puts his hands behind him and out the slot in the 
               back to be handcuffed.

                                     DAVID
                              (shrugs)
                         Finger authority, show she was smarter 
                         than the powers that be.

                                     BITSEY
                         Do you know where I can find her?

                                     DAVID
                         First year in here I received a card 
                         postmarked San Francisco. It wasn't 
                         signed, but I suspect it was from 
                         her -- the front had the text 'Sex 
                         is Power.'

               Cuffed, David stands aside for the cage door to be opened.

                                     BITSEY
                         Anything written on it?

                                     DAVID
                         Yeah. It said, 'I'm sorrier than you 
                         can know.'
                              (exiting the cage)
                         See you tomorrow, Ms. Bloom.

               EXT. MOTEL SIX PARKING LOT - NIGHT

               Bitsey and Zack are walking from the Kettle to their rooms. 
               Zack is lighting a cigarette. The rain's stopped, but the 
               lot is wet.

                                     BITSEY
                         Try phone records, a net search.

                                     ZACK
                         Fucking better than watching you 
                         work.

               They walk a beat in silence.

                                     ZACK
                         You think he's telling the truth?

                                     BITSEY
                         Don't ask me that. I don't know. 
                         There is no truth, only perspectives.

                                     ZACK
                         Can't say that. If you say 'there is 
                         no truth,' you're claiming it's true 
                         that there is no truth -- it's a 
                         logical contradiction.

                                     BITSEY
                         Working on our philosophy merit badge, 
                         Zack?

                                     ZACK
                         I, on the other hand, think Gale's 
                         telling the truth.

               They come to the stairs and start up.

                                     BITSEY
                         This you know telepathically?

                                     ZACK
                         It's just my perspective.

               In a dark corner of the parking lot sits the pickup from the 
               rest area. The older cowboy watches Bitsey and Zack climb 
               the stairs. On his STEREO, PUCCINI plays. Once they are in 
               their rooms, he TURNS UP the opera, closes his eyes, feels 
               the music.

               INT. RENTAL CAR - DAY

               The car moves through an older Austin suburb with wood framed 
               houses (circa 1950) in varying states of repair.

               It's an overcast day. Zack drives, slowly, searching.

               Bitsey has the passenger seat fully reclined, lies with her 
               eyes closed.

               SUPERIMPOSE: DAY TWO.

                                     ZACK
                         Thirty-three o what?

                                     BITSEY
                         Seven.
                              (then)
                         'Check out the crime scene in Austin.' 
                         You made it sound so close. Shit, 
                         two and half hours and that damn lig --

                                     ZACK
                         Bitsey.

               She looks up. Zack is pointing at house 3307, which needs 
               paint and a lawn mower. In front of the house is a homemade 
               sign which reads, "David Gale Death House and Museum" See 
               where it happened!" Beneath are the opening hours (12-8); 
               someone has marked them out and scribbled "ring bell."

               They share a look.

               EXT. PORCH OF HOUSE 3307 - DAY

               Bitsey rings the bell. Zack stomps out a cigarette, points 
               out a worn "Block Home" sign in the window, raises his 
               eyebrows. As Bitsey straightens her skirt, the door is opened 
               by a GOTH GIRL, probably not quite eighteen.

               She has jet-black hair, nose piercings, tattoos, a Nine Inch 
               Nails T-shirt. METAL MUSIC comes from within.

               The Goth Girl just looks at them. After an uncomfortable 
               silence, Bitsey extends her hand.

                                     BITSEY
                         Hi. I'm Bitsey Bloom and this is 
                         Zack Stemmons. We --

                                     GOTH GIRL
                         You want the tour?

               Her voice is slacker monotone.

                                     BITSEY
                         Uh, yes.

                                     GOTH GIRL
                         There's a twenty-dollar mandatory 
                         donation, apiece. But you get a re-
                         enactment photo packet. It's got 
                         five pictures.

                                     BITSEY
                         Okay.

               A beat.

                                     GOTH GIRL
                         I gotta collect first.

                                     BITSEY
                         Oh, sure.

               Bitsey reaches in her bag.

               INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY

               They enter. The room is dark, messy, with an old couch and 
               TV/VCR. A kitchen is adjacent. The walls are full of Goth 
               bric-a-brac: London Batcave poster, one from Burton's 
               Frankenweenie, a couple of fan-zine pictures of Siouxsie and 
               the Banshees. In one corner is a very expensive STEREO, from 
               which THE CURE plays. In another, a dead plant. The Goth 
               Girl turns the MUSIC DOWN.

               A table near the door has numbered photos beneath a torn and 
               curling sheet of plastic. Small packets of snapshots sit on 
               the table along with a few hand-labelled videos and a book 
               of clippings. There's also a guest book.

                                     GOTH GIRL
                         You gotta sign the book. Doesn't 
                         have to be your real name, though.

               Bitsey signs in.

                                     GOTH GIRL
                         First page says you're here to do 
                         research on violent crime. The state 
                         requires it for nonprofit shit.

               Zack signs in.

                                     GOTH GIRL
                         Take a re-enactment photo packet.

               Bitsey does so. As does Zack.

                                     GOTH GIRL
                         If you guys could share one, it would 
                         be really cool. The butt wipes where 
                         I do prints kinda jerk my chain.

               Zack puts his back. Bitsey is looking at a photo: the Goth 
               Girl in her panties and bra laying on the floor with plastic 
               wrap over her head. She's handcuffed and wearing a platinum 
               blonde wig. The pose is half-corpse, half-pinup.

                                     GOTH GIRL
                         That's me. My boyfriend took it. We 
                         also did a video. It's fifty bucks 
                         'cause you can see my tits. There's 
                         a version without tits, that's thirty-
                         five.

               Zack looks at a video, hand-labelled: "Constance Harraway 
               Murder (with breasts)! Copyright 1997! Svengali Productions!"

                                     BITSEY
                         Do many people take the tour?

                                     GOTH GIRL
                         Not so much anymore. We thought this 
                         would be like a busy week -- Gale 
                         gettin' the prune juice and all. 
                         Prune juice is what death row dudes 
                         call the poison, 'cause it gives you 
                         the shits. Most jerks just take a 
                         photo from the street. They shot a 
                         'Real Crimes' episode here, but the 
                         owner didn't give us dick.

                                     ZACK
                         You don't mind living here?

                                     GOTH GIRL
                         I'm cool with ghouls. Beats livin' 
                         with my dickwad parents. It starts 
                         over here.

               She takes them to the coffee table. Among her own things, a 
               dusty Johnny Walker Black Label bottle sits beside a tumbler 
               (an index card with the #1 leans against it). The area has 
               been outlined on the table with white shoe polish.

                                     GOTH GIRL
                         She let him crash here sometimes. He 
                         was like constantly wasted. Drank 
                         Black Label religiously.

               Bitsey and Zack exchange a look. The Goth Girl moves into 
               the kitchen. It's cluttered and dirty except in the various 
               areas which at one point had been outlined and indexed -- 
               the cards are all dirty. A sliding glass door leads onto the 
               patio. The backyard hasn't been mowed in years; roughly twenty 
               pots with dead plants lying around.

               By the door, three small taped Xs are on the floor, outlined 
               and indexed (#2).

                                     GOTH GIRL
                         This is where the tripod was. My 
                         boyfriend borrowed the one we usually 
                         show folks. They never found a camera, 
                         photos, or videos or anything. Gale 
                         must have buried them. These serial 
                         killer dudes take photos to whack 
                         off to later.

                                     ZACK
                         He's not exactly a serial killer.

                                     GOTH GIRL
                         Whatever.

               She moves to the sink. On the linoleum, the position of 
               Constance's body has been chalk-lined (#3). In this area are 
               a pair of handcuffs (#4). Not far off is a roll of packing 
               tape (#5). A pair of latex kitchen gloves are crumpled on 
               the sink counter (#6).

                                     GOTH GIRL
                         She was like totally naked right 
                         here. The meter man saw her through 
                         the door. Gale handcuffed her, taped 
                         her mouth, then taped a bag over her 
                         head so she couldn't breathe. My 
                         boyfriend says that's probably when 
                         he fucked her. Your muscles tense up 
                         when you die -- the sex is better.
                              (pointing)
                         He used those housewife gloves so he 
                         wouldn't leave prints. They found 
                         sticky stuff from the tape on them.

               Zack picks up the gloves.

                                     GOTH GIRL
                         We ask folks not to touch the exhibit.

                                     ZACK
                         Right.

               He puts them back.

                                     GOTH GIRL
                         The totally sick part was where they 
                         found the key --

                                     BITSEY
                         We know, you can save that.

                                     ZACK
                         What? Where was it?

                                     GOTH GIRL
                         It was in her stomach, dude. He made 
                         her swallow it before he bagged her.

               A beat. Zack's shocked.

                                     GOTH GIRL
                         That's pretty much the highlight.

               Got questions?

               INT. RENTAL CAR - DAY

               Bitsey drives. They are on the two-lane highway to Huntsville. 
               Zack smokes out the window.

                                     BITSEY
                         It was in the case file.

                                     ZACK
                         Fuck, in her stomach? That's colder 
                         than Wisconsin.

                                     BITSEY
                              (looking in the 
                              rearview mirror)
                         Zack, open your vanity.

                                     ZACK
                         What?

                                     BITSEY
                         The vanity mirror, pull it down.

               He does so.

                                     BITSEY
                         See that truck behind us?

                                     ZACK
                         Yeah.

                                     BITSEY
                         Isn't that the cowboy from the rest 
                         area?

               They look in their respective mirrors. Some distance behind 
               them is the older cowboy in his pickup.

                                     ZACK
                         Same truck.

                                     BITSEY
                         Weird coincidence, huh?

                                     ZACK
                              (turning)
                         Coincidences are always weird, that's 
                         why they're coincidences.

               INT. ELLIS VISITATION AREA - DAY

               Bitsey sits in front of David. He's less animated than the 
               day before, drained. He rubs his wrists. They are speaking 
               in hushed tones.

               A beat.

                                     DAVID
                         Off-the-record?

                                     BITSEY
                         Alright, we're off.

                                     DAVID
                         Constance was murdered with what's 
                         called the Securitat Method. You're 
                         hand-cuffed, forced to swallow the 
                         key, taped at the mouth, a bag's 
                         sealed over your head and you're 
                         left to suffocate. The Securitat did 
                         this to Romanians who wouldn't inform 
                         or confess. Sometimes the bag was 
                         ripped off at the last second, you 
                         got a second chance. If not, you die 
                         knowing the 'key' to your freedom 
                         was inside you the whole time. A 
                         cheap-but-effective metonym. Problem 
                         is I mentioned the method in an early 
                         article. The prosecution never knew.

                                     BITSEY
                         You're telling me someone's framing 
                         you?

                                     DAVID
                         It's more than that.

                                     DAVID
                         There was a tripod.

                                     BITSEY
                         Right, facing her body. Are we on?

                                     DAVID
                              (nods agreement)
                         Not a single print was found on it. 
                         Someone brought it, wiped it, left 
                         it. Why? It's as if they wanted me 
                         to know that somewhere there's a 
                         record of what really happened that 
                         afternoon. As if they wanted me to 
                         die knowing the key to my freedom 
                         was... out there.

                                     BITSEY
                         Maybe you're being paranoid?

                                     DAVID
                         Ms. Bloom. I'm an anti-death row 
                         activist on death row. Doesn't that 
                         strike you as odd?

               A beat. She nods.

                                     BITSEY
                         Any ideas who 'they' are?

                                     DAVID
                         No.

               A beat.

                                     DAVID
                         But I have someone on it, someone 
                         I'm hoping will one day find an 
                         answer.

                                     BITSEY
                         Belyeu's hired a detective?

               He shakes his head.

                                     DAVID
                         A journalist.

               It takes Bitsey a second to understand. David smiles.

                                     DAVID
                              (mimicking Belyeu)
                         'She's a smart one.'

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               INT. U.T HALLWAY - LONG SHOT - DAY

               ACCELERATED ROTATING ZOOM IN.

               David and Constance stand by the double doors. He's 
               concentrated; she's biting her lip. They're looking onto a 
               large parking lot.

               The lot is practically empty except for Sharon and Chase, 
               who stand near their Jeep. It's packed with various household 
               items, things not entrusted to movers.

                                     CONSTANCE
                         I'll drop by your office after.

               He nods and goes out.

               EXT. U.T. PARKING LOT - DAY

               As David approaches them, Chase runs to them -- still carrying 
               Cloud Dog. He jumps on his dad.

                                     CHASE
                         Wear me like a fur, Daddy! Wear me 
                         like a fur!

               As he walks, David drapes the boy sideways over his shoulders 
               (like a fur). Chase squeals with pleasure.

                                     DAVID
                         Who's your hero?

               Chase bonks him on the nose. David sets Chase down when he 
               reaches his WIFE. He kiss him goodbye as the boy struggles 
               to move on to something else. A long beat as David and his 
               wife stand uncomfortably.

                                     DAVID
                         Call me when you get to Boston?

                                     SHARON (WIFE)
                         Yeah.

               A beat.

                                     DAVID
                         I wish you --

                                     SHARON
                         Don't.

               She turns and walks to the Jeep. The door's open.

                                     SHARON
                         Chase, get in, Sweetie.

               Chase climbs in, sits in the driver's seat.

                                     CHASE
                              (turning to his dad)
                         See ya later, Alli-gator.

                                     DAVID
                         After awhile, Crocodile.

                                     CHASE
                         Take it easy, Japa-ne-se.

                                     DAVID
                         Okey-dokey, Artichokey.

                                     SHARON
                              (to Chase)
                         Scoot.

               Chase scoots over to the passenger seat. Sharon gets in the 
               driver's seat.

                                     SHARON
                         I sent you an e-mail.

                                     DAVID
                         Okay?

                                     SHARON
                         Just read it.

               She closes the door. Suddenly, Chase opens the passenger 
               side door, runs around the Jeep carrying Cloud Dog. He runs 
               to his dad, hugs him one last time.

                                     SHARON
                              (cracking her window)
                         Come on, Chase.

               Chase starts to go back, turns and hands David his Cloud Dog 
               without comment. He then quickly runs back around the Jeep 
               and gets in.

               David watches them drive away. Chase's hand waves out the 
               window until they are out of the parking lot.

               INSERT - COMPUTER SCREEN

               with an e-mail message: "David, I want a divorce. I'm sorry 
               to say it so plainly, but that's how I feel it. I don't need 
               time to think, this whole 'rape' thing has only forced..."

               INT. DAVID'S U.T. OFFICE - DAY

               David sits in front of his computer, staring into space.

               The office is institutional, cramped. Books line the walls, 
               fill the desk.

               There's a framed poster (Warhol-style) of Socrates. He reaches 
               into his desk for a bottle of Black Bush and fills his glass. 
               There's a KNOCK on the door. Constance enters.

                                     CONSTANCE
                         You could at least hide the bottle.

               David closes the e-mail. She collapses in the chair opposite 
               his desk, exhausted.

                                     DAVID
                         Well?

                                     CONSTANCE
                         Officially, you're on sabbatical. 
                         Unofficially, they want you to look 
                         for another position. It was four to 
                         two.

               A beat as he absorbs the information.

                                     DAVID
                         How did Ross vote?

                                     CONSTANCE
                         You're not supp... Against you.

               David nods.

                                     DAVID
                         And you?

                                     CONSTANCE
                         Against my politics.

               David mouths a "thank you."

               EXT. GALE HOUSE - DAY

               A Century 21 real estate agent is putting a "For Sale" sign 
               in the front yard.

               INT. UPSCALE RESTAURANT - DAY

               David is having lunch with an IVY LEAGUE-LOOKING MALE in his 
               fifties. Only water and bread are on the table.

                                     DAVID
                         So, I wanted to get your feedback on 
                         the idea.

               The Ivy Leaguer vigorously butters his bread.

                                     IVY LEAGUER
                         Look, Professor Gale, I could sit 
                         here, as I'm sure others have, and 
                         plead departmental cutbacks. Claim 
                         you need more publications, or I 
                         need a minority, whatever. All bull-
                         geschichte. Your record's brilliant. 
                         You're an original voice worth -- in 
                         the scarcity-defines-value capitalist 
                         system under which we toil -- your 
                         weight in gold. Hell, it's not even 
                         the alcohol. It'd be nice to have 
                         faculty whose crutch wasn't Prozac. 
                         But, to speak plainly, if I hire 
                         you, in the eyes of the regents, 
                         alumni and every freshman with an 
                         ear for gossip, I'd be hiring a 
                         rapist.

               He takes a bite of bread.

                                     IVY LEAGUER
                         You're not politically correct, Dr. 
                         Gale. Welcome to the club.

               EXT./INT. DAVID'S APARTMENT - DAY

               David stands on the balcony of a sparsely-furnished 420-a-
               month apartment. Books are stacked everywhere. An Interstate 
               runs nearby. He holds a phone, looks down in the pool area.

               DAVID'S POV

               A horribly-tanned man in his seventies (wearing a Speedo) 
               attempts to do Tai Chi.

                                     CHASE (V.O.)
                              (on his mom's answering 
                              machine)
                         We aren't home. Please, tell us a 
                         message.

                              b.g.)
                         At the beep.

                         At the peep.

               ON DAVID

               David lets the PHONE BEEP, just stares down at the man, saying 
               nothing.

               EXT. APARTMENT COMPLEX PARKING LOT - DAY

               As David gets out of his Volvo, a SORORITY PLEDGE (funny 
               clothes, Greek letters on her cheek) quickly approaches.

               She takes his picture with a Polaroid camera.

               She runs to a waiting convertible, where two other girls 
               sit.

                                     SORORITY PLEDGE
                         I got it! I got it!

               She jumps in the car and they speed away.

               INT. HIGH-RISE OFFICE - DAY

               The office is Philip Stark chic with large window walls --

               Austin stretches into the distance. David sits on a sofa 
               across from an exceedingly ATTRACTIVE WOMAN (early 40s).

                                     ATTRACTIVE WOMAN
                         What exactly attracts you to the 
                         bond market?

               He's staring into space.

                                     ATTRACTIVE WOMAN
                         Mr. Gale?

               He looks at her. She forces a strained smile.

               INT. DAVID'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

               Dark. David lies on the floor, his head propped against a 
               wall. He's in his underwear and drinking from a Black Bush 
               bottle. The phone's beside his ear and Chase's MESSAGE on 
               his wife's MACHINE TWEAKS out of the receiver speaker. After 
               the BEEP, David hangs up, gets a DIAL TONE, and punches re-
               dial. The MESSAGE STARTS again.

               After the BEEP, he hangs up, gets a DIAL TONE, and punches 
               re-dial.

               INT. SMALL OFFICE - DAY

               David is in the office of an overdressed YUPPIE BLACK MAN 
               (early 20s). David is doing his active listening thing.

                                     YUPPIE MAN
                              (over-articulating)
                         Now, Mr. Gale, I want you to tell me 
                         three personal qualities you have 
                         that would make you a successful 
                         Radio Shack manager.

               EXT. GOLF COURSE - DAY

               David and Belyeu approach a ball fifty feet from the green.

                                     BELYEU
                         Because divorce proceedings do not 
                         require her presence in the country. 
                         For a custody hearin', yeah, she'll 
                         have to return.

               David chooses a club.

                                     BELYEU
                         But without successful completion of 
                         an alcohol treatment program, you'll 
                         be lucky to get the odd Thanksgivin'.

               David walks to the ball.

                                     DAVID
                         So my chances of getting partial 
                         custody aren't good?

                                     BELYEU
                         Roughly the same as you sinkin' that 
                         from here.

               David looks at him, then concentrates on the ball -- suddenly 
               it has meaning. He swings. The ball lands in a water trap.

               INT. PICTURESQUE MOUNTAIN ROAD - DAY

               David's Volvo winds up the road, enters through a gate. A 
               sign beside the gate: "The Go lightly: A Recovery Clinic."

                                                                   FADE TO:

               BLACK.

               FADE IN:

               EXT. CONSTANCE'S HOUSE (3307) - DAY

               It's a beautiful day. The house looks much different than in 
               the Goth Girl's care -- flower bed, well-manicured lawn, 
               fresh paint. The "Block Home" sign is in the window. David's 
               Volvo pulls up in front.

               INT./EXT. CONSTANCE'S FRONT HALLWAY - DAY

               Constance opens the door for David. He's wearing a short 
               sleeved Radio Shack shirt and tie. She's taken aback.

               Looks at him a beat, bites her lip, suppresses a laugh.

                                     CONSTANCE
                         I'm sorry.

               He plays hurt, then they both burst out laughing.

               LONG SHOT - CONSTANCE AND DAVID

               She hugs him as they laugh on the porch.

               INT. CONSTANCE'S LIVING ROOM - DAY

               The living room is now Laura Ashley cozy. The sliding door 
               is open so the room's sunny, breezy. Constance leads David 
               in. She looks tired but is animated, a bit too much so. Her 
               hair is different.

                                     CONSTANCE
                         You look good.

                                     DAVID
                         I feel... washed.

               She smiles at him maternally, touches his face. They hug 
               again.

                                     CONSTANCE
                              (lightly, in his arms)
                         I need you. DeathWatch needs you, 
                         now more than ever.

                                     DAVID
                         Nothing like I need you, both. You're 
                         all I have.

                                     CONSTANCE
                         Look.

               She moves from him, takes a photo from a case file on her 
               kitchen table.

                                     CONSTANCE
                         Jo Ann Johnson's been re-scheduled.

               BACK ON SCENE

                                     CONSTANCE
                         I've got a call with Hawkins tonight, 
                         and if national will commit emergency 
                         funds...

               She lifts a small plant, moves to the porch.

                                     DAVID
                         Jo Ann will be commuted and you'll 
                         only prove the system works.

               He notices she has bruises on her arms.

                                     CONSTANCE
                         But I'll save a life.

                                     DAVID
                              (referring to the 
                              bruises)
                         Where'd you get those?

                                     CONSTANCE
                         Spring cleaning.

               EXT. CONSTANCE'S PORCH

                                     CONSTANCE
                         She went up at 18, she's 26 now.

               She sets the plant down among others. At the very back of 
               the yard, the Older Cowboy spades in a vegetable garden.

                                     DAVID
                              (calling to the Cowboy)
                         Hey! She ever not make you work when 
                         you come by?

                                     OLDER COWBOY
                              (raising his spade in 
                              greeting)
                         Mornin', David.

                                     DAVID
                              (turning to Constance)
                         What's her story?

                                     CONSTANCE
                         I really want us to get behind this 
                         one. She's articul --

                                     DAVID
                         Constance, who did she kill?

               Constance looks at him a beat, sighs.

                                     CONSTANCE
                         A cop.

                                     DAVID
                         She admit to it?

               Contance sheepishly nods.

                                     DAVID
                         You're a crazy woman. Not your medium 
                         grade thinks-she's-Teddy Roosevelt's-
                         bathrobe, but stark-raving-loose-
                         screws-in-the-belfry insane.

                                     CONSTANCE
                         You're mixing metaphors.

                                     DAVID
                         A real danger to flora and fauna.

                                     CONSTANCE
                         Are we gonna do this?

                                     DAVID
                              (the smile)
                         And how.

               He kisses her on the forehead -- he's surprised.

                                     DAVID
                         You're burning up.

               EXT. STARBUCKS - NIGHT

               David exits the store carrying four large coffees in a cup-
               container, tries to sip one without spilling the others. 
               He's still wearing the Radio Shack shirt, seems happier.

               In the parking lot, a hip high schooler jumps out of his 
               Camero and moves toward the store. As David comes in front 
               of the car, he sees his former baby-sitter sitting in the 
               passenger seat. Their eyes meet. He smiles. She smiles back, 
               waves. As he passes, he hears the girl hit the car's automatic 
               DOOR-LOCK BUTTON.

               INT. OFFICE OF DEATHWATCH (AUSTIN) - NIGHT

               David enters carrying the coffee. The matron sits on a desk 
               licking envelopes. The college guy is on the floor beneath a 
               desk rewiring a computer terminal.

                                     COLLEGE GUY
                              (calling from beneath 
                              a desk)
                         Howdy, Mr. Gale.

                                     DAVID
                         Hello, folks.

               David goes to the Matron, gives her cup and three Sweet & 
               Lows.

                                     MATRON
                         Hello. My, this is service. Thank 
                         you.

                                     DAVID
                         Gladly.

               He takes one of the unsealed envelopes from her stack, then 
               puts a cup beside the legs of the College Guy.

                                     DAVID
                         Latte on your left, partner.

               David makes his way to the back office. The College Guy gives 
               the Matron a look -- they're surprised, pleased.

               INT. BACK OFFICE - DAY

               Constance sits at a spartan desk. Nothing is on the walls, 
               though a window opens onto the alley behind. She's talking 
               on the SPEAKER PHONE with the DeathWatch national director -- 
               a social gathering is going on behind him.

                                     DIRECTOR (V.O.)
                         ...and see what kind of resources 
                         the religious groups can deliver.

               David comes through the door. She waves him in.

                                     CONSTANCE
                         I'm sure we can get some pulpit time, 
                         maybe cable.

               He sets her coffee in front of her. Then sits across from 
               her.

                                     DIRECTOR (V.O.)
                         Cable's good. Listen, I need to run. 
                         For now, I agree the first press 
                         release should focus on the woman's 
                         youth.

               David holds up the envelope for Constance to see, then 
               animatedly licks and seals it. He then, literally, pats 
               himself on the back.

                                     DIRECTOR (V.O.)
                         I'll have the Washington people look 
                         into counsel competency, though I'm 
                         almost sure she's exhausted this 
                         issue on appeal.

               She smiles at him, shakes her head.

                                     CONSTANCE
                              (to the phone)
                         John, David's going to --

                                     DIRECTOR (V.O.)
                         Oh, I almost forgot. He's not around, 
                         is he?

               Constance hesitates, looks at David. He shakes his head no.

                                     CONSTANCE
                         No.

                                     DIRECTOR (V.O.)
                         Good, keep it that way. His 
                         relationship to DeathWatch is over, 
                         terminated. Last thing we need is 
                         this rape thing coming back to bite 
                         our butts.

               Constance is not sure how to react. David just stares at 
               her.

                                     DIRECTOR (V.O.)
                         These guys don't stay on the wagon 
                         for very long.

               David stands up and leaves the room, quickly. His coffee 
               spills. Constance can only watch.

                                     DIRECTOR (V.O.)
                         I'm serious, Constance. Ban him from 
                         the premises. I realize you two...

               EXT. DEATHWATCH OFFICE (AUSTIN) - NIGHT

               Constance comes anxiously out the front door.

               CONSTANCE'S POV

               David's Volvo pulls out of the parking lot.

               BACK TO SCENE

               She stands watching it drive away, breathing heavily. She 
               winces, grabs her stomach, vomits on the sidewalk.

               EXT. AUSTIN STREET - NIGHT

               The Volvo is parked on a seedy Southside street. David stands 
               at a phone booth and dials a long-distance number and a 
               calling code. He waits, impatiently, looks across the street: 
               There's a liquor store.

               CLOSEUP - RECEIVER

               at his ear, Chase's MESSAGE BEGINS.

               BACK ON DAVID

               He speaks into the PHONE after the BEEP.

                                     DAVID
                         Sharon, pick up. For once just pick 
                         up the goddamn phone! If you keep 
                         him in Spain, I'll... I'm begging 
                         you. He's my son! Please! Please.... 
                         Please.

               David starts to put the receiver back, then suddenly starts 
               smashing it against the phone's body; he smashes it long 
               after there is anything left to destroy, long after his hand 
               bleeds.

               EXT. CONSTANCE'S HOUSE (3307) - NEXT DAY

               Constance walks with car keys and a large stack of mail toward 
               her front porch. She looks like she hasn't slept in weeks. 
               David is sitting on the porch beneath the Block Home sign, 
               holding Cloud Dog. He wears the Yale sweatshirt, the Radio 
               Shack shirt is wrapped around his injured hand. He's sloppy 
               drunk.

                                     DAVID
                         We're seeking refuse, refuge, uge.

                                     CONSTANCE
                         Come on, come inside.

               She opens the door as he stands.

                                     DAVID
                         We fell off our wagon.

               INT. CONSTANCE'S LIVING ROOM - DAY

               David enters rambling, stands leaning against the back of 
               the couch, holding the sheep.

                                     DAVID
                         Know why Saint Jude is the patron 
                         saint of lost causes? 'Cause his 
                         real name was Judas. There were two 
                         Judases, Judai, the saint guy and 
                         the bad Judas who ratted on Jesus, 
                         and tried to kiss him. Medievalers 
                         wouldn't pray to good Judas for fear 
                         of getting bad Judas on the line by 
                         mistake. Ergo, they only gave him 
                         business when really desperate. That's 
                         why. Then they changed his name.

               She's not in the room.

                                     DAVID
                         Constance?

               He looks back toward the entry hall. A small flyer lightly 
               blows along the floor into the living room.

                                     DAVID
                         Your mail's blowing.

               He looks in the entry hall.

               ENTRY HALL

               Constance lies unconscious on the floor near the open door. 
               The mail is scattered about her.

               INT. HOSPITAL WAITING ROOM - DAY

               David sleeps in a chair, on the floor beside him is a stack 
               of vending-machine coffee cups. A typical hospital INTERCOM 
               can be heard throughout the scene.

               A female DOCTOR (mid-30s) sits beside him, lightly shakes 
               his shoulder. He wakes, groggy.

                                     DOCTOR
                         How we doing?

                                     DAVID
                         Fine. How's Constance?

                                     DOCTOR
                         Sleeping.

               A beat as he collects himself, sits up.

                                     DOCTOR
                         Mr. Gale, a leukemia patient's 
                         condition is highly susceptible to 
                         external stress. While we don't want 
                         to totally restrict Constance's life --

                                     DAVID
                         What?

                                     DOCTOR
                         Constance's illness requires a degree 
                         of regularity.

                                     DAVID
                         Constance has leukemia?

                                     DOCTOR
                         Acute. She was diagnosed last fall.

               A beat as the situation clarifies for both of them. David is 
               stunned, the doctor embarrassed.

                                     DOCTOR
                         Have I created a problem?

                                     DAVID
                         No, no.

               They sit in silence. The hospital intercom seems to say:

                                     GUARD (V.O.)
                         Gale, time's up.

               CLOSEUP - DAVID

               CAMERA SLOWLY ROTATES.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               WHITE.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               INT. ELLIS VISITATION AREA - CLOSEUP - BITSEY - DAY

               CAMERA SLOWLY ROTATES. Bitsey stares at David, engrossed.

                                     DAVID
                         When I asked why she hadn't told me, 
                         she muttered, 'too busy.' I guess 
                         she figured as long as death was 
                         chasing her, she could help others 
                         escape.

               He stands, goes to the back of the cage to be handcuffed.

                                     DAVID
                         Constance left the world better than 
                         she found it.
                              (beat)
                         It's a small, difficult thing.

               EXT. ELLIS UNIT PARKING LOT - DAY

               The rental car sits in a corner of the mostly empty lot, as 
               far as possible from the razor-wire fence and exercise pens.

               INT. RENTAL CAR - DAY

               Zack waits in the driver's seat, smoking. He looks nervously 
               through the windshield toward the pens. Bitsey raps on the 
               window, startling him.

                                     ZACK
                         Fuck.

               Zack unlocks the door, throws his cigarette out. Bitsey opens 
               the door and gets in.

                                     ZACK
                         Hey.

                                     BITSEY
                              (waving her hand at 
                              the smoke)
                         For God's sake, Zack.

                                     ZACK
                         You're not a happy camper.

                                     BITSEY
                         It's not a happy place.

               He STARTS the CAR.

                                     ZACK
                         Talked to the Austin prosecutor. 
                         Belyeu's a yokel. Prosecutor says he 
                         fucked up the penalty phase, says 
                         Gale probably would have gotten life 
                         on mitigating factors. Gale stuck 
                         with him, though, all through appeals, 
                         despite major pro bono offers.

                                     BITSEY
                         What else?

                                     ZACK
                         Notta on Berlin, we pick up the money 
                         in Houston tonight, overheat light 
                         came on twice, and you're about to 
                         get a surprise.

                                     BITSEY
                         I don't want a surprise.

                                     ZACK
                              (pointing ahead)
                         Too late.

               EXT. ELLIS UNIT DRIVE GUARDHOUSE - DAY

               The guardhouse is now occupied. The crossing guard is down. 
               Across the drive sits a Texas Highway Patrol car.

               All along the drive's left side, protest vehicles are parked 
               in the grass. They stretch out to the two-lane highway, where 
               another Highway patrol car is stationed.

               The drive's right side is also marked off, though the only 
               vehicle on this side is a Houston TV news truck. Six people 
               in ponchos discuss something in the middle of the drive.

               The rental car ENTERS the FRAME.

               INT. RENTAL CAR

               Bitsey and Zack approach the guardhouse.

                                     ZACK
                         This is mostly an Oklahoma caravan. 
                         I got stuck behind them on the way 
                         in.

               The guardhouse attendant looks in, waves them through as the 
               crossing guard lifts.

                                     ZACK
                         Execution's not for another 36 hours. 
                         It's gonna be a zoo. There's the 
                         P.R. guy.

               Standing among the six people in ponchos is Duke Grover.

               They pass him in SLOW MOTION. He sees them, smiles, makes a 
               "Hello" shooting-gesture.

                                     BITSEY
                         What a life, waiting around for 
                         someone to die.

                                     ZACK
                         Fuck, look.

               The next-to-last vehicle on the left is the Older Cowboy's 
               pickup. He sits inside talking with another man. The Older 
               Cowboy sees them, touches his hat as they pass.

                                     BITSEY
                         This is a little too coincidental.

               EXT. TWO-LANE HIGHWAY - DAY

               The rental car passes a farmhouse.

               INT. RENTAL CAR

               Bitsey and Zack are headed to Huntsville.

                                     ZACK
                         'Cause I couldn't see the license 
                         plate.

                                     BITSEY
                         Forget it. What time is it?

                                     ZACK
                         6:05. Why don't you have a watch?

                                     BITSEY
                         It's a long story.

               EXT. TWO-LANE HIGHWAY - DAY

               The rental car passes a black teenager hitchhiking in front 
               of an abandoned vegetable stand.

               EXT. MOTEL SIX GANGWAY - DAY

               Bitsey and Zack make their way to their rooms. Zack's is 
               first.

                                     BITSEY
                         Give me an hour.

               INT. ZACK'S MOTEL SIX ROOM - DAY

               Zack unlocks his door, enters. The room's a mess, papers 
               everywhere. He walks toward a portable computer sitting on 
               the room desk.

                                     BITSEY
                         Zack!

               Zack runs from the room.

               EXT. MOTEL SIX GANGWAY - DAY

               Zack runs towards Bitsey. She stands outside her room.

                                     ZACK
                         What!?

                                     BITSEY
                         It's open.

                                     ZACK
                         So? Maybe the maid forgot.

                                     BITSEY
                              (pointing)
                         Look!

               As he comes to her door, he sees what she's indicating:

               Between the door and its frame, someone has stuck a roll of 
               duct tape.

               INT. BITSEY'S MOTEL SIX ROOM - DAY

               Bitsey pushes the door open, looks in and around. She sees 
               something, enters. Zack enters behind her, sees what she 
               sees.

                                     ZACK
                         I'll check the bathroom.

               He goes. She approaches the middle of the room.

               The room, in contrast to Zack's, is perfectly neat. It has 
               two twin beds. The nightstand has been moved to the center. 
               On it is a lamp, turned on. Suspended just above the lamp, a 
               VHS cartridge hangs from the ceiling by fishing line.

               BITSEY'S BATHROOM

               Zack checks behind the shower curtain.

                                     ZACK
                         Clear in here! Don't touch it!

               BACK IN BEDROOM

               As Zack enters, he sees Bitsey holding the VHS Cassette.

                                     ZACK
                         Fuck, Bitsey, there could have been 
                         prints.

                                     BITSEY
                         Look.

               She holds up the cassette. It has a label typed from an old 
               typewriter: "For Bitsey Bloom."

               EXT. MOTEL SIX RECEPTION - DUSK

               Zack runs out the front door carrying a VCR, the cables drag 
               the ground behind him. He runs toward the rooms.

               INT. BITSEY'S MOTEL ROOM - DUSK

               Bitsey unlocks the door, lets Zack in.

                                     ZACK
                         She says no one asked for you. And 
                         all the room keys are different.

               He goes to the TV.

                                     ZACK
                         Just she and her husband have masters.

                                     BITSEY
                         What did you tell her?

                                     ZACK
                         That you have a jealous boyfriend.

               He starts to hook up the VCR.

                                     BITSEY
                         Thanks. How about the V.C.R.?

                                     ZACK
                         She didn't ask. I think she assumed 
                         it had something to do with why he 
                         was jealous. I still say we should 
                         do this in my room -- this one's a 
                         fucking crime scene.

                                     BITSEY
                         Whoever got in here -- without a key 
                         in broad daylight -- was probably 
                         smart enough not to leave prints. I 
                         have the remote.

               He turns ON the TV.

                                     ZACK
                         Maybe they could look for D.N.A. Try 
                         three.

                                     BITSEY
                              (hitting the remote)
                         They don't look for D.N.A. when 
                         someone breaks in to deliver, Zack. 
                         Here.

               She hands him the tape. He starts to put it in, hesitates, 
               looks back at her.

                                     ZACK
                         You sure you want to see what's on 
                         here?

                                     BITSEY
                         No. Start it.

               He puts it in, pushes play. She sits on the bed. He sits 
               beside her. They watch the black leader appear.

                                     BITSEY
                         I hope this isn't what I think it 
                         is.

               CLOSEUP - TV

               An image flickers in. It's a woman lying nude on the kitchen 
               floor of house 3307, facing away from the camera.

               An opaque white kitchen bag is over her head, sealed at the 
               neck with duct tape. Her hands are handcuffed behind her. 
               She appears dead.

                                     BITSEY (O.S.)
                         God, no.

                                     ZACK (O.S.)
                         Fuck. Is it her?

                                     BITSEY (O.S.)
                         Turn it up.

               BACK TO SCENE

               They stare at the screen, she bites a thumbnail. He turns 
               the sound up.

               INT. HOUSE 3307 - KITCHEN - DAY (ON TV)

               Hi-8 video: The woman does not move. The kitchen is cleaner 
               than we've seen it, but otherwise unchanged.

               Kitchen gloves can be seen -- laid upside down and inside 
               out -- on the dish rack beside the sink. Near the body on 
               the floor is a roll of duct tape. In the lower right corner 
               of the screen is part of what looks like a towel.

               The audio is full of ATMOSPHERIC HUM. A REFRIGERATOR 
               contributes. BIRDS can barely be heard in the distance, so 
               can what sounds like a LAWN MOWER.

               Suddenly, the woman makes a muffled sound, seems to come to 
               life. Her wrists start to pull against the handcuffs, then 
               jerk at them. She panics. He legs flail, kick against the 
               counter. She screams, muffled, frantic. She rolls onto her 
               stomach, her whole body fights against the cuffs. She 
               desperately rubs her face along the linoleum trying to rip 
               the plastic. Soon, her energy wanes, she jerks less. Her 
               covered face now points toward the camera. Her head seems to 
               rock, a sleepy nod. Her body goes slack. Black.

               EXT. MOTEL SIX GANGWAY - DUSK

               Bitsey stands at the railing, looking out at the interstate 
               and a thunderstorm gathering on the horizon.

               After a few seconds, Zack comes up beside her.

                                     ZACK
                         Belyeu says to bring the tape first 
                         thing tomorrow. Also said you were 
                         right about not calling the police.

               A beat, she keeps looking straight on.

                                     ZACK
                         Are you gonna be okay?

               Bitsey takes a deep breath, turns to him, holds his eyes.

               She shakes her head no. Her lips start to tremble. He puts 
               his arms around her as she starts to cry.

               INT. KETTLE RESTAURANT - NIGHT

               Bitsey and Zack sit at a booth having coffee. Zack smokes. 
               The VHS cassette is also between them, as is a small stack 
               of crumpled tissues. The thunderstorm can be heard in the 
               distance. The waitress is refilling their cups, and they 
               wait until she leaves. Hushed tones.

                                     ZACK
                         Let's say Gale's right. Some sick-
                         fuck-Agatha Christie-wannabe set him 
                         up, arranged like the perfect murder. 
                         Why send a magazine journalist proof 
                         a few hours before he's won? Doesn't 
                         make sense.

                                     BITSEY
                         No, it's perfect. He knows News 
                         Magazine won't give the scoop to the 
                         dailies or nightly news, not after 
                         having paid for it. Probably guessed 
                         we wouldn't call the cops. And, most 
                         importantly, knows I'll tell Gale 
                         tomorrow.

                                     ZACK
                         Why does he give a shit?

                                     BITSEY
                         Zack, what if Harraway's murder was 
                         just a means to getting Gale. I mean 
                         sending him through hell, a sick cat 
                         and mouse game. You kill the one 
                         person he has left. Make sure he 
                         sits six years on death row for the 
                         murder -- a place he's made a public 
                         career of loathing. And then just 
                         let him die, die knowing everyone 
                         will remember him with disgust. You 
                         destroy his loved ones, his life's 
                         work, his memory -- and you make him 
                         watch.

                                     ZACK
                         That's a lot of hate. You're talking 
                         beyond sadism.

               Bitsey gestures to the tape, makes a need-I-say-more face.

                                     ZACK
                         Then why release it?

                                     BITSEY
                         If the mouse dies the game's over. 
                         Maybe the cat's enjoying himself. 
                         Or...

                                     ZACK
                         Or?

                                     BITSEY
                              (picks up the tape)
                         Imagine walking to the chamber knowing 
                         this exists.

                                     ZACK
                         The 'cat' is a fucking psychopath.

                                     BITSEY
                         Yeah, but smart.

               EXT. MOTEL SIX - NIGHT

               The storm batters the motel. We see Bitsey's dark front 
               window. Lightning. A figure stands looking out. More 
               lightning. It's Bitsey, intently watching the night.

               INT. RENTAL CAR - DAY

               SUPERIMPOSE: DAY THREE

               On the back seat is an aluminum suitcase. Zack sits beside 
               it looking out the back window. Bitsey drives.

               It's still raining, hard. They're on the two-lane highway to 
               Austin.

                                     ZACK
                         Why do they call it check-book 
                         journalism if we always pay cash?

               CLOSE ON DASH

               The over-heat light is on.

               BACK TO SCENE

                                     ZACK
                         Woa, woa. Sadist at six o'clock!

                                     BITSEY
                         Is it the truck?

               ZACK'S POV

               The cowboy's truck can be seen through the tire mist fifty 
               yards behind them.

                                     ZACK
                         Yep, and doing a lousy job of hiding.

               Bitsey watches in the rearview mirror. Zack out the back 
               window.

                                     ZACK
                         He must think we're idiots. You think 
                         he's our fucked-up feline?

               Bitsey doesn't respond, just watches in the mirror, then:

                                     BITSEY
                         Is he gaining?

                                     ZACK
                         No. Just sitting back there.

                                     BITSEY
                         Can you see the license?

                                     ZACK
                         Too much mist. What the fuck does 
                         this guy want?

               INT. LAW OFFICE OF BENJAMIN BELYEU - DAY

               The office has a view of the rain-soaked capital.

               Expensively decorated. Dark woods and deep carpets --

               Belyeu's practice is clearly thriving. A sharp-looking CLERK 
               sits at a corner table counting money from the aluminum 
               suitcase. Bitsey sits on a huge sofa. Belyeu stands just 
               outside his door.

                                     BELYEU (O.S.)
                         Fine. Oh, and bring in Miss Bloom's 
                         original when that's done.
                              (entering, to Bitsey)
                         Don't blame you for not watching 
                         that twice.

               He goes to his desk and starts sifting through papers.

                                     BITSEY
                         I couldn't sleep afterwards.

                                     BELYEU
                         I understand. I generally tell folks 
                         I'm no more afraid of the grim reaper 
                         than I am of a Presbyterian on 
                         Mother's Day. But watching your 
                         tape... well. I had to keep tellin' 
                         myself 'that's not Constance' just 
                         to get through.
                              (a beat)
                         Unfortunately, others may argue the 
                         same.

                                     BITSEY
                         Yeah, but it's her kitchen, in her 
                         house.

                                     BELYEU
                         Currently home to Weirdos 
                         Incorporated. Arguably, that tape 
                         could have been made by anybody with 
                         twenty dollars and a tolerance for 
                         vulgarity.

                                     BITSEY
                         But it will at least get us a 
                         postponement?

                                     BELYEU
                         I hope so, Miss Bloom, I certainly 
                         hope so. But you've got to remember 
                         that there's a machine a runnin'. 
                         And come six o'clock tomorrow mornin' 
                         that machine wants to be fed.

               The Clerk puts the last of the money back into the suitcase.

                                     CLERK
                         All here, Mr. Belyeu.

                                     BELYEU
                              (to the Clerk)
                         Thank you, Joshua.
                              (to Bitsey)
                         To add to our troubles, your own 
                         credibility may come into question.

               The Clerk exits.

                                     BITSEY
                         Why?

                                     BELYEU
                         You've been fraternizin' with the 
                         condemned. In the court's eyes, he's 
                         the most likely candidate to have 
                         put you onto the tape. He's a 
                         persuasive man, you're a out-of-state 
                         woman -- it don't look good on paper.

                                     BITSEY
                         But someone put it in my hotel room.

                                     BELYEU
                         A fact for which we have no evidence.

               A very professional-looking assistant enters, hands Bitsey 
               her video.

                                     BELYEU
                         Thank you, Bobbi.

                                     BITSEY
                         Thanks.

                                     BELYEU
                              (standing)
                         Well, let's not start readin' Kafka 
                         just yet. Could we find a sympathetic 
                         judge. I'll file within the hour. 
                         You headin' back over to Ellis?

                                     BITSEY
                              (standing)
                         Yeah.

                                     BELYEU
                         Fine. I'll call over at the motel 
                         later and give you an update.

               INT. OFFICE HALLWAY - DAY

               Bitsey comes out of two huge oak doors, walks past a gold 
               "Belyeu and Crane" sign. She turns a corner.

               At the end of another short hall, she comes to the elevator, 
               pushes the call button. As she waits, she looks out an 
               adjacent window at the capital in the rain. She remembers 
               something, looks down -- she has her purse but no umbrella.

                                     BITSEY
                         Shit.

               She heads back toward Belyeu's office.

               As she turns the corner, she sees the older cowboy enter the 
               Belyeu and Crane office.

               EXT. AUSTIN OFFICE BUILDING - DAY

               Bitsey hurries umbrella-less through the rain to the rental 
               car parked in the loading zone.

               INT. RENTAL CAR - DAY

               Bitsey opens the door. Zack's in the passenger seat. She 
               doesn't bother to sit.

                                     BITSEY
                         Did you see the cowboy go in?

                                     ZACK
                         He went in Belyeu's building?

                                     BITSEY
                         Into his office. Just saw him.

                                     ZACK
                         Fuck!

                                     BITSEY
                         Follow him. Find out who he is, where 
                         he lives -- what he --

                                     ZACK
                         How are you gonna get to Ellis?

                                     BITSEY
                         A taxi.

               Zack makes a face.

               EXT. ELLIS UNIT DRIVE - DAY

               A taxi makes its way through the hundreds of protesters and 
               press that now gather along the drive.

               INT. ELLIS VISITATION AREA - DAY

               Bitsey, wet and hugging herself, paces in front of David.

               She's upset.

                                     DAVID
                         Okay, okay. Calm down. You have to 
                         sit.

               Over the loudspeaker:

                                     GUARD (V.O.)
                         Visitors need to stay seated.

               She sits.

                                     DAVID
                              (to the microphone 
                              above)
                         Sorry.
                              (to Bitsey)
                         Look at me. He's not your man. His 
                         name is Dusty Wright, DeathWatch 
                         Director before Constance. He's a 
                         'bullhorner,' a zealot who thinks a 
                         good demonstration has to end in a 
                         riot and arrests. 'Almost martyrs 
                         don't mean shit.' They fired him. 
                         Constance kept him in the 
                         organization, and he loved her for 
                         it. The man adored her.

                                     BITSEY
                         Then why was he following us? Why 
                         was he at Belyeu and Crane?

                                     DAVID
                         He and Benny used to work A.C.L.U. 
                         cases together, until Dusty punched 
                         a clansman in a federal court. Benny 
                         sometimes still gives him work, 
                         probably had him follow you.

                                     BITSEY
                         Why?

               A beat. David looks up at the microphone.

                                     DAVID
                         To make sure you honored your 
                         agreement, one for which there's no 
                         contract.

                                     BITSEY
                         He would've said something.

                                     DAVID
                         He's a lawyer, Ms. Bloom.

                                     BITSEY
                         Maybe Dusty was jealous because you 
                         were seeing Constance.

                                     DAVID
                         I wasn't 'seeing' Constance.

                                     BITSEY
                         She died... she had your sperm --

                                     DAVID
                         It's more complicated than that.

               EXT. ALLEY - MED. SHOT - DAVID - SUNRISE (ROTATING CAMERA)

               David sits in a lawn chair beside his Volvo. The tailgate's 
               down, serving as a makeshift table for a coffee thermos and 
               whiskey bottle. David stares off down the alley, clearly in 
               pain. He holds a child's drawing.

               INSERT - DRAWING

               Has Gaudi's church and a matador in background. Prominent in 
               the foreground are three labeled figures: Sharon ("Mommy"), 
               Chase ("Me") and a dark-haired man ("Papa Jorge"). Jorge is 
               dressed in a tux, Sharon seems to wear a bridal gown.

               INT. DEATHWATCH AUSTIN OFFICE - SUNRISE (6:09)

               The atmosphere is tense. Dusty Wright sits on a deskholding 
               a red Magic Marker, the matron sits behind it.

               They look at the college guy, who closely watches a computer 
               screen.

               In the center of the room, a middle-aged priest sits and 
               quietly prays while holding the hands of an overweight woman, 
               she murmurs quiet affirmations.

               Finally, the college guy looks up at Dusty, nods. The room's 
               occupants all exchange glances.

               Dusty walks to the photo wall, marks a cross through the 
               photo of Jo Ann Johnson, then walks to the back office.

               INT. BACK OFFICE - SUNRISE

               Constance, wrapped in an afghan, sleeps on a futon. She's 
               shockingly anemic.

               Dusty kneels beside her, watches her sleep. After a beat, 
               she wakes with a slight jolt -- like someone whose been 
               fighting to stay awake. She looks at him, then sees the marker 
               in his hand. She looks away.

                                     CONSTANCE
                         All I can feel is envy.

               Dusty stands, goes to the alley window.

               DUSTY'S POV

               David's Volvo is parked just outside the window. David sits 
               in a lawn chair behind it. David looks awful.

               EXT. ALLEY - SUNRISE

               In the window, Dusty holds up the marker. David nods.

               EXT. HOUSE 3307 - CONSTANCE'S BACK YARD - DUSK

               David sits on the porch holding a drink, a bottle of Black 
               Bush in the chair beside him. He's staring at nothing.

               Constance comes out the open sliding glass door, wearing a 
               turtleneck sweater and wrapped in her afghan. She goes to 
               the chair beside him, picks up the bottle and sits. They 
               silently survey the yard, the sunset. She hugs the bottle, 
               he sips his drink.

                                     CONSTANCE
                         Remember those Kubler-Ross stages, 
                         the ones the dying go through?

                                     DAVID
                         Denial, anger, bargaining, depression, 
                         and acceptance. Where are you?

                                     CONSTANCE
                         Denial.

                                     DAVID
                         Denial's my personal favorite.

                                     CONSTANCE
                         The whole idea of there being a 
                         process makes me tired. I'm not up 
                         to the job of Dying Person. Marveling 
                         at blades of grass. Lecturing 
                         strangers to relish every moment.

                                     DAVID
                         Mending bridges.

                                     CONSTANCE
                         Mending bridges. Confessing regrets. 
                         Uuuggh.

                                     DAVID
                         No regrets?

                                     CONSTANCE
                         Nope.

               A beat.

                                     CONSTANCE
                         Take that back. I wish I had a child.

                                     DAVID
                         Me, too.

                                     CONSTANCE
                         I'm sorry, David.

               She reaches over and puts her hand on his arm.

                                     CONSTANCE
                         I guess I just wish I would have 
                         risked more.

               She has the bottle in her other hand, looks at it, takes a 
               swig.

                                     CONSTANCE
                              (making a face, 
                              swallowing hard)
                         Uumm, also not enough sex. Should 
                         have had more sex.

               She puts the bottle down beside her chair.

                                     DAVID
                         How much... how many lovers have you 
                         had?

                                     CONSTANCE
                         Including college?

                                     DAVID
                         Including college.

               Her hand (on his arm) holds up four fingers.

                                     DAVID
                         Well, it's... not every... yeah, you 
                         should have had more sex.

               She laughs, coughs. He laughs. Their laughter trails off 
               into the yard. He takes her hand in his.

                                     CONSTANCE
                         You work hard not to be seen as a 
                         sex object. Before long, you're not 
                         seen at all.

                                     DAVID
                         I see you.

               They are holding hands in the air, their elbows on the chairs' 
               armrests.

                                     DAVID
                         Want to make it five? Finish the 
                         hand?

                                     CONSTANCE
                         A pity lay. No thanks.

               A beat. They watch their fingers lightly play with one 
               another.

                                     DAVID
                         It wouldn't be pity.

               They turn, their eyes meet, hold.

               INT. CONSTANCE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

               Constance and David are in bed making love. He's on top, one 
               hand supports her head, the other strokes her face.

               They tenderly kiss. He starts moving, gently.

                                     DAVID
                         Are you okay?

                                     CONSTANCE
                         Don't worry.

               He kisses her neck.

                                     CONSTANCE
                         It's good.

               Moves up to her ear.

                                     CONSTANCE
                         Talk to me. Let me hear your voice.

                                     DAVID
                              (in her ear)
                         I'm here. Happy. I'm very happy.

               He kisses her mouth, moves against her in delicate rhythm.

               Her moans take on a teary edge. Their voices, breathless 
               whispers, meld into one another.

                                     CONSTANCE
                         Hold me tight.

                                     DAVID
                         I'm here.

                                     CONSTANCE
                         Tight... I'm scared.

                                     DAVID
                         It's okay.

               She's begun to cry.

                                     DAVID
                         Okay.

               He stops moving, kisses her tears.

                                     CONSTANCE
                         Don't stop. Stay in me. Please stay 
                         in me.

               He moves again, slowly.

                                     DAVID
                         Shhh. I'm staying.

                                     CONSTANCE
                         I need to feel you inside.

                                     DAVID
                         It's okay. I'm inside. I'm not pulling 
                         out.

                                     CONSTANCE
                         I'm so tired.

                                     DAVID
                         I know, I know.

                                     CONSTANCE
                         Tired of being afraid.

                                     DAVID
                         Shhh.

                                     CONSTANCE
                         Help me.

                                     DAVID
                         I'm here. It's okay.

                                     CONSTANCE
                         Help me. Please. Make it stop.

                                     DAVID
                         Shhh. I'm here. I'm here.

               EXT. CONSTANCE'S HOUSE (3307) - NIGHT

               The house is dark. A light in one of the rooms comes on.

               INT. CONSTANCE'S BEDROOM - DAY

               She's awake as David enters. He opens the curtains, sets a 
               glass of water beside bottles on the nightstand. He crawls 
               on top of the covers, spoons her, nuzzles the back of her 
               head.

                                     CONSTANCE
                         How do you feel about last night?

                                     DAVID
                         Rescued. You?

                                     CONSTANCE
                         Like I have a reason to get out of 
                         bed. Ironic, huh?

               EXT. CONVENIENCE STORE PARKING LOT - DAY

               David goes to the pay phone against the building.

               INT. CONSTANCE'S BATHROOM - DAY

               Constance stands in a bathrobe beside her shower. Turns the 
               water on. She's caught in a thought, bites her lip.

               She turns the water off.

               EXT. APARTMENT POOL AREA - DAY

               David sits in a lounger speaking to someone on his right.

               He's sober.

                                     DAVID
                         Let's say they move back from Spain, 
                         that I somehow got my one weekend a 
                         month. Would it matter? By high 
                         school, I'd be his weak spot, the 
                         focus of locker room jabs, embarrassed 
                         pride. In college there'd be late-
                         night angst: 'What if I turn out 
                         like the old man?' Holidays would be 
                         forced smiles and unscheduled exits. 
                         I mean, what girl comes home with 
                         you if there's talk that Pops is a 
                         rapist?

               A beat.

                                     DAVID
                         I can't stand the idea of being his 
                         model of failure. Without him, I 
                         drink. To cover the hole. To prove 
                         to myself he's better off without 
                         me.

               CAMERA PULLS BACK to reveal Dusty Wright sitting in the 
               lounger beside him.

               INT. CONSTANCE'S KITCHEN - DAY

               Constance, still in her robe, puts an armful of sheets in 
               the washing machine. She feels faint.

               EXT. FORMER GALE HOUSE - BACK YARD - DAY

               David sits in a swing set, rocks slowly. He's simply looking 
               at the house. A yuppie woman opens the back door.

                                     DAVID
                              (standing)
                         Sorry, just leaving.

               INT. CONSTANCE'S LIVING ROOM - DAY

               Constance is quickly sorting through a box of memorabilia, a 
               photo catches her attention.

               INSERT - PHOTO

               Constance on vacation in a Caribbean resort. She sits alone 
               at a dinner table, looks to camera, seems surprised to be 
               photographed.

               BACK ON SCENE

               As Constance contemplates the photo, she hears the DOORBELL 
               ring.

               EXT. LAWN - FROM ABOVE - DAY

               We see David lying in the grass of recently-cut lawn.

               INT. DAVID'S VOLVO - DUSK

               David in the car in a mall parking lot, staring at nothing. 
               On the seat beside him is Cloud Dog and a half empty Black 
               Bush bottle.

               INT. DAVID'S VOLVO - NIGHT

               David's asleep, using Cloud Dog as a pillow. The bottle is 
               empty.

               A light flashes in on him, waking him. There's a KNOCK on 
               the window -- it's the police. He's blinded by the flashlight.

               POLICEMAN

               ROTATING CAMERA. The policeman holds the light.

                                     POLICEMAN (V.O.)
                              (a loudspeaker voice)
                         Gale, time's up.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               WHITE.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               INT. ELLIS VISITATION AREA - BITSEY AND DAVID - DAY

               ROTATING CAMERA. Bitsey's agitated. David's drained.

                                     BITSEY
                         But there has to be someone. Someone 
                         with a motive, who knew you both. 
                         Someone who visited that morning.

                                     DAVID
                         If I could answer... we wouldn't be 
                         having this conversation. It's why I 
                         need you, why I chose you. You have 
                         my story, now...
                              (mimicking her delivery)
                         'Go.'

                                     BITSEY
                         There's not enough time.

               The guard approaches.

                                     DAVID
                         You'll find time.

                                     BITSEY
                         You know that's not what I meant. 
                         You should have done this earlier.

                                     DAVID
                         You're not here to save me. You're 
                         here to save my son's memory of his 
                         father -- that's all I want.

               A beat.

                                     BITSEY
                         You're going to let them kill you.

               David moves to the back of the cage to be handcuffed.

                                     DAVID
                         We live to stop death. Eating, 
                         inventing, loving, praying, fighting, 
                         killing -- choose a verb. All to 
                         stall this evil, Job's 'king of 
                         terrors.' But what do we really know 
                         about it? Nobody comes back. There's 
                         a point, when your mind out-lives 
                         its obsessions, when your habits 
                         survive your dreams, when your 
                         losses... You wonder, maybe death is 
                         a gift. All I know is that by this 
                         time tomorrow, I'll be better off. 
                         What I don't know is why.
                              (exits the cage)
                         Goodbye, Bitsey.

               The guard escorts him away. When he's out of earshot:

                                     BITSEY
                              (softly)
                         Goodbye, David.

               EXT. ELLIS UNIT DRIVE GUARDHOUSE - DAY

               A guard hangs up a phone and leans out the door.

                                     GUARD
                         Car's on its way. Wanna wait in here?

               Bitsey stands in the rain. Behind her, hundreds of protesters 
               flank the drive.

                                     BITSEY
                         No thanks.

               She turns and walks toward the highway.

               The parade tape has been replaced with crowd barriers.

               The drive's left side now overflows with abolitionists:

               They cluster beneath tarps, some sing hymns, others paint 
               signs ("Don't kill with my taxes!", "Mark 6:10," "Murder 
               doesn't Stop Murder!"). Beneath one umbrella stands a large 
               black woman holding a candle -- she watches Bitsey.

               The right side is a media circus. Various pro-death penalty 
               activists also cluster here. They too have prepared signs: 
               "Rape and Suffocate Him!", "Thank Jesus for Justice," "'Let's 
               Do it'." A blackboard keeps a countdown: "13 hours."

               At the end of the drive, on the left, Bitsey sees a sign 
               leaning against a camper: "Save David Gale." It catches rain; 
               its letters run.

               INT. KETTLE RESTAURANT - NIGHT

               The restaurant's crowded. A Church of Christ couple (50s) 
               eat without comment. The man's T-shirt reads, "It's Simple: 
               You Kill, You Get Killed."

               In the booth beside them sit Bitsey and Zack, their dinners 
               largely untouched. Bitsey watches three sleazy JOURNALISTS 
               at a table not far from theirs.

                                     JOURNALIST #1
                         I got it. I got it. You could have 
                         corporate sponsors. Volkswagen for 
                         Bundy, Home Depot for Gacy. And 'The 
                         David Gale Execution, brought to you 
                         by...'

                                     JOURNALIST #2
                         '...Hefty.'

               They find this hilarious. Bitsey looks away.

                                     BITSEY
                         What time is it?

                                     ZACK
                              (checking his watch)
                         Nine hours, 52 minutes.

               A beat.

               EXT. MOTEL SIX PARKING LOT - NIGHT

               Pouring rain. As Bitsey and Zack hurry toward their rooms, 
               they see Belyeu getting out of his Cadillac. He carries 
               Bitsey's umbrella and opens his own.

                                     BITSEY
                         Belyeu!

               He turns, comes toward them. Bitsey holds a newspaper over 
               her head, Zack slouches.

                                     BITSEY
                         Did you have Dusty Wright follow us?

                                     BELYEU
                         I employ Mr. Wright from time to 
                         time.

                                     BITSEY
                         You could have said something.

                                     BELYEU
                              (opening her umbrella)
                         That would have defeated the purpose. 
                         Apologies if I caused you unnecessary 
                         anxiety, but I'm paid to be 
                         suspicious.
                              (handing it to her)
                         Thought I'd return this.

                                     ZACK
                         Any word on the writ?

                                     BELYEU
                         Denied. Tape went to a federal judge 
                         two hours ago. Your videographer 
                         friend made contact?

                                     BITSEY
                         No.

                                     BELYEU
                         What you got was definitely a snippet. 
                         Could be he has more previews 
                         scheduled. Best stick close to your 
                         room.

                                     BITSEY
                         How's David?

                                     BELYEU
                         Holdin' up. I'm headed back over.

                                     BITSEY
                         Tell him I'll take care of it, about 
                         his son, I mean.

                                     BELYEU
                         Will do. We'll talk later?

               She nods.

                                     BELYEU
                         Watch yourselves.

               They turn from one another. Bitsey turns back.

                                     BITSEY
                              (calling after him)
                         Mr. Belyeu.

               He turns.

                                     BITSEY
                         Were Dusty and Constance close?

                                     BELYEU
                         Thick as thieves.

               Bitsey nods.

               INT. BITSEY'S MOTEL SIX ROOM - NIGHT

               Dark. Bitsey and Zack sit on either side of the room's table 
               looking out the window. Rain shadows run down their faces. 
               The room phone is on the table, as is Zack's watch: 10:17.

               EXT. MOTEL SIX AND KETTLE - LONG SHOT - FROM ACROSS

               INTERSTATE - NIGHT

               The rain's lightened up. The motel's full. Lights are on in 
               ten of the motel rooms. The Kettle's lights go off, one after 
               another.

               INT. BITSEY'S MOTEL SIX ROOM - NIGHT

               Zack sleeps at the end of one bed, fully dressed. Bitsey, 
               lost in agitated thought, neatly packs a suit into her 
               perfectly arranged suitcase. She stops, thinks. She goes to 
               her purse and takes out the VHS cassette, a pen and a note 
               pad. Hesitating a beat, she puts the tape in the VCR. She 
               turns on the TV and waits for an image.

               EXT. MOTEL SIX - NIGHT

               Rain. All the rooms except Bitsey's are dark. From within 
               comes a TV glow.

               INT. BITSEY'S MOTEL SIX ROOM - INSERT - BITSEY'S

               NOTEPAD - NIGHT

               She's sketched a flow-chart of the tape with major elements 
               timed out.

               BITSEY

               has her shoes off, sits on the floor with her back against a 
               bed. She's still watching the tape, tired, exasperated.

               Finally, she turns the TV OFF, rubs her eyes. She stands, 
               looks at the radio alarm clock on the nightstand: 11:33.

               INT. BATHROOM - NIGHT

               Bitsey brushes her teeth. Looks down and sees a towel on the 
               floor. Picks it up, starts to hang it on the towel rack, 
               stops, looks at herself in the mirror. A beat. An idea hits 
               her, first as something odd, then as a freight train. She 
               spits, hurries into the bedroom.

               INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

                                     BITSEY
                              (putting on her shoes)
                         Zack! Wake up! Get up!

               He starts to pull himself awake.

                                     BITSEY
                         Did you throw the towel on the floor?

                                     ZACK
                         What?

                                     BITSEY
                         The towel on my bathroom floor. Did 
                         you put it there?

                                     ZACK
                         Yeah, I guess. It's a hotel room. 
                         What --

                                     BITSEY
                         Do you do that at home?

                                     ZACK
                         No. Fuck, Bitsey. I'm sorry, it's 
                         not like it's --

                                     BITSEY
                         Get up.

               She disconnects the VCR.

                                     ZACK
                              (sitting up)
                         What the fuck's wrong with you?

                                     BITSEY
                         Grab the T.V. I want to check 
                         something.

                                     ZACK
                         What?

                                     BITSEY
                         We're taking a tour.

                                     ZACK
                         Where?

               She has the VCR. Grabs her purse on the way to the door.

                                     BITSEY
                         Austin. Get the T.V.

               She opens the door, exits.

               INT. HOUSE 3307 ENTRY HALL - NIGHT

               The DOORBELL RINGS over BAUHAUS MUSIC. The Goth Girl, wearing 
               only the Nine Inch Nails T-shirt, opens the door.

               Bitsey barrages past carrying the VCR, Zack follows with the 
               TV.

                                     BITSEY
                         Wanna make a hundred bucks?

                                     GOTH GIRL
                         What do I gotta do?

               INT. HOUSE 3307 LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

               Bitsey, Zack and the Goth girl enter.

                                     BITSEY
                         We're going over the crime scene.

               Bitsey checks the kitchen. The tripod's back. The other 
               exhibit pieces haven't changed.

                                     BITSEY
                         And for the next hour I want you to 
                         do exactly what I say when I say to 
                         do it. If I say suck Zack's dick, 
                         all I want to hear from you is 'May 
                         I swallow.'

                                     GOTH GIRL
                         You want me to suck his dick?

                                     ZACK
                         It's just a patriarchal figure of 
                         speech.

                                     BITSEY
                         Is your boyfriend here?

                                     GOTH GIRL
                         He ain't exactly my boyfriend anymore.

                                     BITSEY
                         Well is his video camera here?

                                     GOTH GIRL
                         Yeah.

                                     BITSEY
                         Get it.

               She starts to leave, turns back.

                                     GOTH GIRL
                         I gotta collect first.

               Bitsey, moaning, reaches for her purse.

               CLOSEUP - STEREO CLOCK

               reads 1:48. Zack's hand ENTERS the FRAME, turns the MUSIC 
               DOWN.

               SAME SCENE - MINUTES LATER

               Video: The Goth Girl's messy kitchen. Camera zooms in to a 
               perspective similar to that on the Constance tape. The exhibit 
               pieces (kitchen gloves, handcuffs, tape roll) are more-or-
               less where they were before. The Goth Girl enters the frame, 
               she's removing pizza boxes and laundry from the counter.

                                     ZACK (O.S.)
                         Move those index cards, too.

               She picks up the index cards.

               Zack looks up from a video camera's eye piece. The camera is 
               on the tripod, connected to the Goth Girl's TV. Near it, the 
               hotel TV/VCR. Bitsey cues the Constance tape to the beginning, 
               freezes the image. Zack then checks the camera angle on the 
               Goth Girl's TV. He moves the TVs so that they are side-by-
               side.

                                     BITSEY
                         Zoom in a hair.

               He does so. Bitsey compares perspectives between the left TV 
               (Goth Girl cleaning) to the right TV (Constance).

                                     BITSEY
                         Put the gloves on a dish rack.

                                     GOTH GIRL
                         I don't have one.

               Zack goes to the sink, lays three pizza boxes on the counter 
               as an ersatz dish rack -- he drapes the kitchen gloves over 
               them.

                                     BITSEY
                         Turn them inside out.

               He does so.

                                     BITSEY
                         Move the tape roll about a foot to 
                         the left. And get rid of the 
                         handcuffs.

               Zack repositions the tape. The Goth Girl picks up the 
               handcuffs.

                                     BITSEY
                         Come check this, Zack.
                              (to the Goth Girl)
                         Could you... what's your name?

                                     GOTH GIRL
                         Nico's cool.

                                     BITSEY
                         Nico, lie down on the floor, facing 
                         the counter.

               Zack comes behind the tripod and looks at the TVs. NICO sits 
               on the floor, starts to take off her T-shirt.

                                     ZACK
                         We can imagine that part.
                              (to Bitsey)
                         I'll position her.

               He goes to Nico, arranges her in the position of Constance 
               (which now bears no relation to the white outline on the 
               floor).

                                     BITSEY
                         That's fine. Just straighten her 
                         legs.

               Zack comes back behind the tripod. He and Bitsey look at the 
               two TV images -- roughly the same. The Constance tape, 
               however, shows what looks like a white towel in the lower 
               right-hand corner. Bitsey points to it.

                                     BITSEY
                         What's this?

                                     ZACK
                         Towel or something.

                                     BITSEY
                         Okay, look at this.

               She plays the tape of Constance for eight seconds.

                                     BITSEY
                         I noticed this back at the hotel. 
                         See?

               Bitsey touches the TV screen by one of Constance's feet.

               The foot moves ever so slightly. She hits pause.

                                     BITSEY
                         She moves her foot. Why?

                                     ZACK
                         Fucking good question.

                                     BITSEY
                         It's another fifteen seconds before 
                         she comes to. If she had passed out 
                         once, without fresh air she wouldn't 
                         come back. There was no head trauma, 
                         her blood tested normal --

                                     ZACK
                         Jesus, maybe she was faking, hoping 
                         he would go away.

                                     BITSEY
                         Or...

               Bitsey looks up at Nico.

                                     BITSEY
                         We've got to bag her.

                                     ZACK
                         Woa. Not a good idea.

                                     BITSEY
                         All right, I'll do it.

               SAME SCENE - MINUTES LATER

               Nico hurries from the bedroom into the kitchen. Bitsey and 
               Zack stand by the sink. A white plastic bag is now on the 
               sink counter; beside it, the roll of duct tape.

                                     NICO
                         I found it.

               Nico hands Zack the key to the handcuffs. He tests them, 
               then lays them on the counter.

                                     BITSEY
                              (to Zack)
                         Okay, I want you to wait three minutes 
                         before you take it off.

                                     ZACK
                         Bitsey, I'm not so sure about this.

                                     BITSEY
                         Three full minutes. Just stand behind 
                         the tripod. Both of you.

               Zack and Nico move behind the tripod. Bitsey puts the bag on 
               her head, rips off a long length of tape. She seals the bag 
               around her neck. She then handcuffs herself from behind, 
               with some difficulty.

               CLOSEUP - KEY

               is on the sink counter while she does this.

                                     BITSEY (O.S.)
                              (through the bag)
                         Have you started?

               BACK TO SCENE

                                     ZACK
                         Twenty-two seconds.

               Bitsey sits on the linoleum, then lies on her side.

                                     ZACK
                         Thirty seconds.

                                     NICO
                         Fuckin' wicked.

               Bitsey lies perfectly still.

                                     ZACK
                         Thirty-five... Forty... Forty-five... 
                         Fifty.

                                     NICO
                         Maybe she shouldn't...

                                     ZACK
                         Fifty-five... one minute... five... 
                         ten... one-fifteen...

               Bitsey starts to pull slightly at the cuffs.

                                     ZACK
                         Fuck. Twenty... twenty-five... 
                         thirty...

                                     NICO
                         This isn't cool.

                                     ZACK
                         ...thirty-five... Fuck... one-forty... 
                         one-forty fi...

               Bitsey panics, fights like hell against the cuffs.

                                     BITSEY
                              (through the bag)
                         Zack!

               Zack runs to her, knocking the tripod over. He rips the bag 
               open. She sucks air.

                                     ZACK
                              (ripping at the tape)
                         Jesus fucking Christ, Bitsey. You 
                         okay? What if I'd've waited?

               She tries to catch her breath. Nico releases the handcuffs.

                                     ZACK
                         No more fucking experiments, all 
                         right? Just tell me what's going on. 
                         You okay?

               Bitsey nods, holds up her hand, wants to say something.

               She takes his arm, looks at him.

                                     BITSEY
                              (still breathing 
                              heavily)
                         She... she did it herself.

               SAME SCENE - MINUTES LATER

               Zack sits on the couch holding the handcuffs and smoking.

               Nico sits on one of its armrests. Bitsey, full of adrenaline, 
               paces in front of them, thinking out loud.

                                     BITSEY
                         She used the gloves to keep 
                         fingerprints off the tape and bag. 
                         Then she put them back on the dish 
                         rack, but upside down and inside 
                         out, a housewives' habit. A murderer 
                         would have just tossed them aside -- 
                         like they were the first time we 
                         were here, like you do a towel in a 
                         hotel.

                                     ZACK
                         Maybe, all right, maybe.
                              (indicating the cuffs)
                         But why wear these?

                                     BITSEY
                         They threw me. I forgot you have to 
                         have the key to put them on. But she 
                         needed them. She knew she would 
                         instinctively try to rip the bag 
                         off, that at some point automatism 
                         would kick in.

                                     NICO
                         Fuckin' A, like when people hang 
                         themselves. At the last second they 
                         go chicken, claw at the rope and 
                         shit. The police find their own skin 
                         beneath their nails.

                                     BITSEY
                         And she swallowed the key so she 
                         couldn't get to it. She made sure 
                         there was no way out.

                                     ZACK
                         Woa, chill, chill. Why not hang 
                         yourself, or take pills. Why take 
                         your fucking clothes off? Why make 
                         it look like a murder?

               A beat. Bitsey contemplates.

                                     BITSEY
                         It's so calculated. She's handcuffed, 
                         taped at the mouth. The gloves. The 
                         damn tripod.

                                     ZACK
                         Why, Bitsey? Why fake your own murder?

                                     BITSEY
                         I don't know.

                                     ZACK
                         Motive's like a major issue here.

                                     BITSEY
                         Thanks, Zack.

                                     ZACK
                         It doesn't make sense. The woman's a 
                         bleeding-heart abolitionist. Why 
                         frame an innocent man? Why send Gale 
                         to the chair for what looks --

                                     BITSEY
                         What'd you say?

                                     ZACK
                         She had to know some innocent fuck 
                         would take the fall.

                                     BITSEY
                         Oh my God, Zack, that's it! That's 
                         why! To prove it happens. To have 
                         absolute proof that the system 
                         convicts innocents.

                                     ZACK
                         Get the fuck out of here.

                                     BITSEY
                         No, that's how she thought. She lived 
                         for DeathWatch. If she's gonna die, 
                         why not die for it? That's why the 
                         tripod was here. To record proof, 
                         undeniable proof, the tape. That's 
                         why we got an out-take.

                                     ZACK
                         A dead woman put the tape in your 
                         room?

                                     BITSEY
                         Of course not. She needed help, 
                         someone to keep it, release it. 
                         Someone she could trust, someone 
                         dedicated to the cause...

               They stare at each other a beat. The same thought:

                                     ZACK
                              (mimicking Belyeu)
                         Thick as thieves.

               INT. DUSTY WRIGHT'S CABIN - NIGHT

               Dusty looks up at a wall clock: 4:23. He sits fully dressed 
               in his living room, listening to an OPERA. He closes his 
               eyes.

               CAMERA PULLS BACK OUT of his window and into:

               EXT. WOODS BESIDE WRIGHT'S CABIN - NIGHT

               Behind a couple of trees near the woods' edge, Bitsey and 
               Zack hide watching him.

                                     ZACK
                         Hairy.

                                     BITSEY
                         Come on.

               She turns back into the woods.

               EXT. DIRT ROAD - NIGHT

               Bitsey and Zack emerge from the woods near the rental car.

               They walk and speak quickly in the light rain.

                                     BITSEY
                         ...Because of the Berlin thing, 
                         Constance knew the police would go 
                         straight to Gale. In a way, he's 
                         perfect. A high profile alcoholic 
                         whose life was shit anyway. But...

                                     ZACK
                         She was in love with him.

                                     BITSEY
                         I don't know. Something. They were 
                         close. She wouldn't want him dead.

               They come to the car, get in.

               INT. RENTAL CAR - NIGHT

               Bitsey drives.

                                     BITSEY
                         Remember this thing about Dusty being 
                         a bull-horner, going to far?

                                     ZACK
                         Why he was fired from DeathWatch, 
                         and the A.C.L.U.

                                     BITSEY
                         Right. Maybe the plan was for Dusty 
                         to release the tape after Gale's 
                         conviction, after a year or so. You 
                         know, force him to dry out, let him 
                         play the heroic victim, give him 
                         back his dignity. So, Dusty Wright's 
                         sitting on this tape, waiting, the 
                         only one who knows about it. And 
                         maybe good ole Dusty starts to think 
                         that an erroneous execution is a 
                         hell of a lot more politically useful 
                         than a last-minute save.

                                     ZACK
                         Which would only prove the system 
                         works.

                                     BITSEY
                         Yeah. Almost martyrs don't count. 
                         What's one murder to stop thousands?

                                     ZACK
                         So he'll wait, release the whole 
                         tape after the execution.

                                     BITSEY
                         Right. Somewhere he must have the 
                         original. What time is it?

               INT. WRIGHT'S CABIN - NIGHT

               The wall clock: 4:50. Dusty hears the PHONE RING over a 
               BARITONE'S ARIA. He turns the MUSIC DOWN, and picks up.

                                     DUSTY
                         Hello?

               EXT. GAS STATION - NIGHT

               The gas station is old, isolated on a country road.

               Closed, dark. By the road, a single light pole illuminates 
               the area -- its light catching the drizzle.

               Directly beneath the pole is a phone booth, where Bitsey 
               waits by the rental car.

               INT. PHONE BOOTH - NIGHT

               Zack is on the phone with the booth door open. Bitsey stands 
               just outside.

                                     ZACK
                         Let's talk about your tape... No, 
                         meet me at the station down the hill, 
                         in fifteen minutes.

               Zack hangs up before Dusty can respond. He stops out of the 
               booth and gives Bitsey a tentative look.

               INT. WRIGHT'S CABIN - NIGHT

               Dusty hangs up, thinks.

               EXT. GAS STATION - NIGHT

               Bitsey sits in the car's driver seat. Zack stands by the 
               booth.

                                     BITSEY
                         Don't move from the booth. Call the 
                         second you see the truck. Remember, 
                         let it ring just once. Then get into 
                         the woods --

                                     ZACK
                         I know. Go.

                                     BITSEY
                              (pulling away)
                         Into the woods, Zack.

                                     ZACK
                         Go!

               EXT. WRIGHT CABIN - NIGHT

               Bitsey is in the woods, watches Dusty pull away in the pickup. 
               She hurries to the front door, enters.

               INT. WRIGHT CABIN - NIGHT

               Bitsey turns on the lights and begins searching. She sees 11 
               videos on a bookshelf. Some are labeled, three aren't.

               She takes the cassettes to the TV/VCR. Puts one in (her hands 
               are wet). Nothing. She searches for the right AV channel.

               INT. PHONE BOOTH - NIGHT

               Zack anxiously waits. His eyes check the road.

               INT. WRIGHT CABIN - NIGHT

               Bitsey has a picture, but the tape is an old TV western.

               She starts to fast forward, realizes she won't be able to do 
               so with each tape, hits eject. She checks the clock: 5:04. 
               She takes another unlabeled tape. It's a home video of a 
               city council meeting.

                                     BITSEY
                              (hitting eject)
                         Shit!

               She grabs the next unlabeled tape.

               EXT. GAS STATION - NIGHT

               Zack paces in front of the booth, checks his watch.

               INT. WRIGHT CABIN - NIGHT

               Bitsey has an old "I Love Lucy" episode. Ejects, looks at 
               the label: "Lucy." She grabs another, labeled "Unforgiven." 
               The credits from Unforgiven roll on screen.

                                     BITSEY
                         Shit!

               EXT. GAS STATION - NIGHT

               Zack sees lights coming toward him. Gets into the phone booth, 
               drops two coins, dials six numbers. He hesitates to punch 
               the seventh, checks the road. The approaching lights belong 
               to a car. He quickly hangs up.

               INT. WRIGHT CABIN - NIGHT

               Bitsey is frantic. Another tape is an old Johnny Carson 
               interview with Pavarotti.

                                     BITSEY
                         Shit!

               INT. WRIGHT CABIN

               Bitsey has what looks like an office Christmas party. She 
               goes for another tape -- the last. Cheyenne Autumn comes up 
               on the screen. She hits eject.

               She gets up, unsure what to do next. She goes back to the 
               bookshelf, pulls books out to look behind them for more tapes, 
               indifferent to the mess. She goes to a filing cabinet, quickly 
               rifles it. She looks around the room, sees something.

               She goes to a large oak desk with an old typewriter on it.

               After the other drawers, she looks in the lap drawer.

               It's empty except for large padded envelope addressed to 
               "Bitsey Bloom/News Magazine/40 W. 43rd St./New York, New 
               York 10036." A beat as she stares in disbelief. She rips it 
               open, pulls out a VHS cassette and checks the label: 
               "Constance." The PHONE RINGS, startling her. She looks at 
               the phone, then at the clock: 5:14. The phone doesn't ring 
               again. A beat of absolute silence.

               Bitsey goes quickly to the VCR and puts in the tape -- hands 
               shaking. After a few seconds, Constance appears standing in 
               her kitchen by the sink, dressed in a bathrobe. She's wearing 
               the kitchen gloves and fills a glass with water.

               Constance turns from the sink:

                                     CONSTANCE (V.O.)
                              (her voice weak)
                         Ready?

               The response is silent, but she nods. A beat -- she bites 
               her lower lip. In one quick movement she takes the key from 
               the handcuffs and swallows it with the water. It goes down 
               with difficulty; she coughs, then signals she's okay. She 
               puts the glass in the sink.

               She takes the duct tape roll, rips off a long section, sticks 
               one end to the back of her gloved hand. She tears off another 
               small section, drops the roll on the floor.

               She tapes the small section over her mouth.

               She then takes the plastic bag from the counter, looks at it 
               a beat. Constance turns toward camera, mouth taped, eyes 
               watering. She nods once, and turns back. She quickly puts 
               the bag over her head. After she has smoothed the excess air 
               out with one hand, she takes the packing tape from the other. 
               She seals the bag around her neck.

               She smoothly takes off the gloves. They're inside out and 
               she snaps them so that the fingers extend. She drops them 
               upside down on the dish rack. She removes her robe -- she's 
               nude beneath -- and tosses it aside. It lands in the bottom 
               right hand corner of the screen.

               She feels for the handcuffs on the counter, takes them.

               She sits on the floor, cuffs herself. She rolls onto her 
               side, perfectly still, waiting.

               ON BITSEY

               Engrossed, trembling. The spell breaks as she comes to the 
               part of the tape she's seen before. Averting her eyes, she 
               fast-forwards past where Constance struggles to where she 
               dies. Constance lies perfectly still. A beat.

               Dusty goes to Constance, kneels and, removing a glove, checks 
               her pulse. He looks briefly up into the camera, then stands.

               He picks up her robe and comes back past the tripod. A beat. 
               We see only Constance's dead body -- then black.

               ON BITSEY

               A hand grabs her shoulder. She screams and spins around.

               It's Zack, breathing hard.

                                     ZACK

               Bitsey and Zack hurry out of the cabin and into the woods.

               The pickup is nowhere to be seen.

               As they disappear into the trees, Dusty can be seen standing 
               beneath the eave at the side of the house, watching.

               EXT. RENTAL CAR - SUNRISE

               The car moves full speed through the misty dawn. The drizzle 
               has stopped.

               Bitsey drives. The overheat light is on. Zack has her purse 
               in his lap, rips a page out of her phone book.

               She's almost in tears, yelling.

                                     BITSEY

                         Supreme Court death clerk! How far 
                         is it?

                         got 26, maybe more.

                                     BITSEY
                         I'll make it.

               EXT. INTERSTATE - IN FRONT OF MOTEL SIX - SUNRISE

               The rental car slides to a near stop on the interstate 
               shoulder. Zack jumps out, as Bitsey spins away again. He 
               runs across the frontage road toward the motel in the mist.

               EXT. HUNTSVILLE TOWN SQUARE - SUNRISE

               The rental car barrels through the empty square, ignoring 
               stop signs.

               EXT. TWO-LANE HIGHWAY - SUNRISE

               The rental car flies past a "Huntsville City Limit" sign and 
               disappears into the fog.

               INT. RENTAL CAR - SUNRISE

               The overheat light is still on. Bitsey looks down, then turns 
               on the RADIO. A COUNTRY AND WESTERN SONG is on.

               She punches scan.

                                     BITSEY
                              (to the radio)

                         time.

               EXT. HIGHWAY JUNCTION - SUNRISE

               The highway forks off to another. An arrow sign at the fork 
               reads: "TDC Ellis Unit/8 Miles."

               INT. RENTAL CAR - SUNRISE

               Bitsey smells something.

               EXT. HIGHWAY TO ELLIS UNIT - SUNRISE

               The rental car, smoke pouring from the engine, clunks to a 
               dead roll, stops. Bitsey jumps out, VHS cassette in hand.

               She doesn't close the door. Starts running.

               Bitsey runs down the middle of the two-lane highway. The 
               rental car in the b.g. recedes into the mist -- visibility 
               is no more than fifty yards. The sounds of her breathing and 
               SHOES HITTING the PAVEMENT ECHO into the mist.

               She runs, and runs.

               A car comes up quickly behind her. Its HORN BLARES. She turns, 
               starts to wave it down. The driver SITS ON his HORN, swerves 
               around her onto highway's shoulder and drives on.

               She runs. Runs past an abandoned vegetable stand. Runs past 
               a sleepy farmhouse.

               She runs, and runs.

               She slows, out of strength, looks up and down the highway.

               Both in front and behind, it leads straight into the mist, a 
               tunnel of fog. She stumbles on, a final effort.

               She runs. Sees something. Stops cold.

               Coming toward her in the distance are small flashing lights. 
               They rise on hill and then fall behind another.

               They appear again. Soon, she can make out the form of an 
               ambulance, and its highway patrol escort. The vehicles move 
               slowly toward her, without sirens, as deathly quiet as their 
               cargo. She stands to the side of the road as they approach. 
               The highway patrol vehicle and the ambulance -- marked "Texas 
               Department of Corrections" -- pass silently in SLOW MOTION. 
               She watches as they disappear back into the mist. In SLOW 
               MOTION, she screams, falls to her knees wailing, but we cannot 
               hear her. We HEAR NOTHING.

               She attempts a smile and nods, though she doesn't look away 
               from the TV. Kruger shushes the others to hear the story.

               Dusty ascends a staircase onto hallway. He walks a few steps 
               to door number six. An OLD SPANISH WOMAN passes him.

                                     DUSTY
                         Senorita Gale esta viviendo aqui?

                                     OLD WOMAN
                         Si. Si.

                                     DUSTY
                         Gracias.

               The old woman moves down the stairs. Dusty puts the aluminum 
               suitcase on the doormat. From the duty-free bag he takes out 
               David's Yale sweatshirt, lays it over the case. He RINGS the 
               DOORBELL, turns and walks back down the hall.

               He stands at the top of the stairs, waiting for someone to 
               answer before descending. Sharon (older than we've seen her) 
               opens the door, sees the case and sweatshirt. She looks 
               around, but Dusty is gone. She picks them up.

               Bitsey sits at her neurotically neat desk, looking out the 
               window. It's a sunny day in New York. For the first time, we 
               see her wearing something besides a business suit. Framed on 
               her cubicle wall is the latest News cover page: a picture of 
               David with the headline "The Executed Innocent."

               A MAIL GUY drops a Fed Ex package on her desk.

                                     MAIL GUY
                         This just came.

               It's from "Belyeu & Crane/420 Congress Ave./Austin, Texas, 
               78710." She opens it, pulls out Cloud Dog and a handwritten 
               note on Belyeu & Crane stationery.

               INSERT - NOTE

               reads: "David wanted you to have this. He said it would be 
               the key to your freedom. Regards, Benjamin Belyeu."

               INT. SHARON'S BARCELONA APARTMENT - DAY

               At the breakfast table, a Spanish yuppie male sits with a 
               newspaper in front of him. He watches Sharon open the case. 
               Inside: money, stacks and stacks of money. On top is an 
               unsigned note: "I'm sorrier than you can know."

               INT. NEWS MAGAZINE - EDITORIAL FLOOR - DAY

               Bitsey holds the stuffed sheep. puzzled.

               Looks at the note,

                                     BITSEY
                         Key to your freedom? Key to your...

               Suddenly, she understands. She squeezes the sheep, shakes 
               it, hears something. She cuts the sheep open with scissors. 
               A Hi-8 tape is in the stuffing. It's hand labeled: "Off the 
               record." She jumps up.

               TRACKING SHOT

               Bitsey hurries THROUGH the cubicles. She goes DOWN a hall 
               and INTO the "MultiMedia" room.

               INT. NEWS - MULTIMEDIA ROOM - DAY

               Bitsey locks the door, puts the tape into a Hi-8 deck.

               The tape is cued to where Dusty picks up Constance's robe 
               and walks past the tripod out of frame. We see only 
               Constance's body. We hear the sliding door to the patio open 
               behind the camera.

                                     DUSTY (V.O.)
                              (calling)
                         It's over.

               A long beat. FOOTSTEPS on the patio.

                                     DUSTY (V.O.)
                         Want me to turn this off?

                                     VOICE (V.O.)
                         No.

               David walks into frame. He goes a couple of steps toward 
               Constance's body and stops, facing her. We see him only from 
               behind. He looks at her, runs his hands over his head.

                                     DAVID (V.O.)
                         I couldn't watch.

                                     DUSTY (V.O.)
                         She preferred it that way. You were 
                         right about not tellin' her the whole 
                         plan.

                                     DAVID
                         It helped her to think her death 
                         would save me.

               A beat.

                                     DUSTY (V.O.)
                         You sure you want to do this?

                                     DAVID (V.O.)
                         Yeah. Almost martyrs don't count.

               A beat.

                                     DUSTY (V.O.)
                         Better go ahead then.

               David goes to Constance, kneels. He reaches down and with 
               his thumb gently strokes her face through the plastic. He 
               stands, turns and walks back to the camera. He reaches behind 
               the lens to turn it off. A beat. Half his face fills frame, 
               his watery eyes looking directly at us. In the other half, 
               we see Constance's body.

               Black.

     Wilson's first impression of Los Angeles was blue.  He was in
     the sky at the time, so it was a curious reversal, looking
     down rather than up at the color he had always felt was
     nature's finest.

     Swimming pools.  Hundreds of them.  Pockmarking the landscape
     like miniature lakes.  A flat landscape of straight streets
     and square blocks and sparse grass that didn't look quite
     green enough.

     As far as Wilson could remember, he had only ever seen seven
     or eight swimming pools in his entire life and they had been
     public ones.  Here everyone had their own.  Marvellous.

     There was the one at the Butlin's holiday camp where he had
     enjoyed his last legitimate employment -- as driver of a tour
     bus.  And there was the one at Crystal Palace he had gone to
     once or twice when he was younger.  He was most familiar,
     though, with the Chelsea Baths as he had lived for some time
     in a flat nearby in what he now thought of as his good years
     -- before he'd gone grey, went to prison, and found himself in
     a plane over a foreign town arriving to avenge the death of
     his daughter.










     WHOOSH!  The sound of automatic doors opening and --

     EXT. ARRIVALS TERMINAL.  L.A. AIRPORT.  AFTERNOON.

     WILSON steps out into the late sunlight and the heat of the
     day.  A slow-motion moment while he gets acclimatized.  He
     wouldn't have ever felt quite this kind of heat before.
     After such a rigorously air-conditioned interior.  Or seen
     cops wearing guns on their belts.  Or black cops, for that
     matter, with guns on their belts.  Or seen people as fat as
     Americans on their home turf.  Things someone from England
     notices immediately, whether consciously at first or not.

                                                               CUT.

     EXT. MOTEL.  EVENING.

     Wilson's not here for comfort.  Shown to a shitty room, round
     the corner of a typical 2nd-level outside walkway.  Airport
     close by.

     INT. MOTEL ROOM.  EVENING.

     He draws a curtain open across a window in one strong easy
     glide.  His moves are neat.  His expressions just as
     economical, not giving much away.  Outside the planes are
     practically on top of us. The sunset colors strange and
     chemical.

     He's only got one light bag.  Unzips, unpacks a few things.
     Change of clothes, a travel kit, and some familiar items
     (shaving foam/toothpaste/deodorant} bearing unfamiliar
     British brand names.

     Goes into the bathroom.  Turns on the shower in there.

     Comes back to sit on the bed.  Takes an envelope out of his
     jacket.

     ENVELOPE

     Turns it over to see the return address on the back.

                                                               CUT.

     INT. TAXI.  NIGHT.

     Wilson in the back.  Stares at the impenetrable name on the
     driver's posted ID. Glances at the driver.

     DRIVER glances back at his quiet passenger in the rearview
     mirror.

                                                               CUT.

     EXT. SMALL HOUSE.  NIGHT.

     Wilson walks up a cracked little path to the front door.
     Lower middle-class street.  Two cars in the driveway, one
     behind the other.  Lights on inside the house -- as he rings
     the bell.

     ED RAMA

     Answers it.  Hispanic.  Late 30's.  Chairman Mao on his T-
     shirt notwithstanding, an easygoing sort of fellow.  Not
     looking for any trouble -- anymore.  But once did, and able
     to handle himself if any shows up.  Which it has.

                         WILSON
               Edward Rama?

                         ED
               Eduardo.
                   (rolling the R)
               Rama.

                         WILSON
               You're home, then.

     He turns, waves away the taxi he's kept waiting.  While
     Eduardo Rama waits for an introduction.

                         WILSON
               My name's Wilson.

     Accent speaks for itself.  Hard, working-class.

                         ED
               Wilson?

     Knows the name.  But just now it's unexpected.  He's holding
     a hot TV dinner, hand protected by a dish towel.

                         WILSON
               You wrote to me about my daughter.

                                                               CUT.

     INT. ED'S HOUSE.  NIGHT.

     Ed takes Wilson inside.

                         ED
               I didn't expect anyone.

                         WILSON
               No reason.

                         ED
               I mean, what has it been -- six months?

                         WILSON
               Round about, yeah.

     They've entered a cauldron of family life.  TV blaring
     (SHOWBIZ TONIGHT!).  A couple of younger KIDS yelling "Mama".
     Their MOTHER shouting back at them from the kitchen (in
     Spanish) that she only has two hands.  A sullen TEENAGER
     walking by.

                         ED
               I didn't even know who I was writing to --
               just someone with the same last name.
               She never talked about any family.

                         WILSON
               It was better than a telegram.

     Ed opens a screen door to the backyard.

     EXT. ED'S BACKYARD.  NIGHT.

     They sit at an outdoor table.  Wilson with a TV dinner in
     front of him now too.  Sounds from inside MUTED.  Even this
     little house has a little pool.

                         WILSON
               Who done it, then?

                         ED
               Huh?

                         WILSON
               Snuffed her.

     Ed surprised at Wilson's directness.  Ed stands nervously.

                         ED
               Now, wait up a second, man.

     And paces back and forth.

                         ED
               I never said nothin' about nothin' like
               that.  No, no, no.  That's not what I
               wrote to you.

                         WILSON
               No, but between the lines, eh?
               Mysterious circumstances, and that.

     Ed stops pacing.

                         ED
               Look, I sent you that newspaper clipping,
               all right?  I told you what I know.  It
               was an accident.  I didn't say anything
               about anybody being "snuffed."

     Beat.

                         WILSON
               This bloke she was bunked up with.  This
               Terry what'sit.

                         ED
               Terry Valentine.

                         WILSON
               Valentine.  What's he got to say for
               himself?

                         ED
               I dunno.  What's he gonna say?  They had
               a fight that night, she drove away, she
               was upset?  I don't even know the guy.
               Don't get me wrong, Jenny and me were
               friends, but we didn't travel in the same
               social circles.  She had her life, I had
               mine.

     Makes a kind of scoffing gesture:  and you can see what my
     life is.

                         ED
               Valentine came into the restaurant where
               I work with Jenny a couple times.  He's a
               money guy.  Jenny would say, hey, here's
               my friend Eddie and he would shake my
               hand and everything, but he wouldn't even
               see me, you know what I mean.

     Wilson gazes up at the sky.  Clear night.  Stars.

                         WILSON
               How long had she been in the States?
                   (as if to himself, somewhat
                    wistful)
               Near on ten years, wasn't it?  Long
               enough to know her way about, I reckon.

     Ed leans down, palms on the tabletop, facing Wilson.

                         ED
               There was an investigation, okay?  The
               car was totalled.  Jennifer was ... Her
               neck was broken.  On impact, they said.
               So she wouldn't have ... felt the effects
               of the fire.
                   (helpless shrug)
               It happens up there.  Happens a lot.
               What more can I tell you.

     Wilson taps out a cigarette from a pack of "Silk Cut" he's
     produced from his pocket.

                         WILSON
               What more is there.

                         ED
               I'm just sayin' -- it was a steep
               hillside.  There was no moon that
               night ...

     Wilson's quiet stillness is getting to him.

                         ED
               Coulda happened to anyone, man.  I never
               knew her to be reckless.  I mean, sure,
               she would smoke a little grass, or
               something, have a few drinks.  But that's
               it, nothing more than that.

                         WILSON
               No, not my girl.  Self-control, she had.
               Point of pride.
                   (smokes)
               And people don't change, do they.

                         ED
               I dunno ... Maybe they do.

     Wilson notes the tattoos on Ed's forearms.

                         WILSON
               Going straight, are ya.

     Ed looks at him.  Sits down again.  Keeping his forearms under
     the table.

                         ED
                   (looks away)
               Boomerang.

                         WILSON
               Y'what?

                         ED
               I knew when I was droppin' that letter
               into the mail slot it was gonna come back
               and smack me in the face.
                   (looks at Wilson again)
               I did my time, okay?  My sister, her ol'
               man's up in Chino right now doin' eight
               years.

                         WILSON
                   (re the family inside)
               This ain't your lot?

                         ED
               You kiddin', man?  I don't need a wife
               and screamin' kids.  I still got my
               youth.

     And yet -- he lives here.  Wilson declines to pursue the
     matter.

                         ED
               I go to work, try to keep my life
               together, put all that shit behind me,
               man.  What d'you want from me.

                         WILSON
                   (calmly smoking)
               I only asked.

     Ed sighs.  Reaches for one of Wilson's cigarettes.

                         ED
               Couple weeks before she died, Jennifer
               asked me to drive her downtown.  Said she
               was meeting -- her boyfriend --
               Valentine.  But I think she was looking
               for him.

     FLASH CUTS:

     ED AND JENNIFER. In a car, downtown. She has the same steely
     intensity as her father. Ed looks a little worried.

                         WILSON
                   (lighting Ed's cigarette)
               What, tryin' to catch him with another
               bird?

                         ED
               That's what I thought, man.  But it was
               not a hotel or nothin' that we went to.
               It was someplace else.

                         WILSON
               Where abouts?

     FLASH CUTS:

     JENNIFER. Talking to a beefy SUPERVISOR. Or talking at him.
     Either way, he isn't happy.

     MEAT PUPPETS. Watch instead of working.

     ED. Taking all this in.

                         ED
               Bad place, man.  Bad people.  Some guys
               loading some trucks.  Some kinda deal
               goin' down.
                   (anticipating Wilson's next
                    question)
               I don't know and I don't care.  Maybe
               they're shipping fava beans to Eskimos.

                         WILSON
               Did Jenny know?

                         ED
                   (shrugs)
               Valentine wasn't even there.  If he was
               into something, if she was involved --
               who can say.
                   (stands up again)
               But I'll tell you something.  She stood
               in front of these dudes, man.  Eyeballing
               them.  Checking them out.
                   (beat)
               I felt like she was covering my ass that
               day.

     Unconsciously rubbing his arms where his tattoos are.

                         ED
               I drove her back to Valentine's house.

     FLASH CUT:

     VALENTINE. Standing in front of his house. His expression
     says: We have something to discuss.

                         ED
               He was standing outside waiting for her.
               That's the only other time I ever saw
               him.
                   (a short sad note)
               Last time I saw her.

     He meets Wilson's gaze.  As hard and pointed as a drill
     through his skull.

                                                               CUT.

     INT. ED'S CAR.  NIGHT.

     Ed drives Wilson back to his motel.  Wilson silent.  Ed still
     not quite sure who he's dealing with.  Is this really or
     merely a grieving dad?

                         ED
               What you gonna do, man?  You gonna go to
               the cops?

                         WILSON
               Nah, coppers don't do nothing, do they.

                         ED
               Those streets up in the hills, man.
               Gotta be real careful, keep your eye on
               the ball.  Two o'clock in the morning,
               it's dark, your mind is all agitated,
               you're drivin' a little too fast ...
                   (beat)
               Those curves don't kid around.

     Could be talking about the girl.  Wilson doesn't move.  But
     touch him, he'll explode.  Out the window lights are passing,
     but no landmarks.  He might as well be on the moon.

                         ED
               You should talk to Elaine.  That was her
               best friend.

                         WILSON
               She didn't write to me, did she.

                         ED
               She didn't know what to say.
                   (shrugs)
               I thought someone should say something.
               To someone.  With me it was, I don't know
               -- Jenny liked me for some reason.  I
               felt like I owed her.

                         WILSON
               Who'd Jenny get it off of -- this grass
               or whatever?

                         ED
                   (self-conscious again)
               Not me, man.  I'm no drug dealer, what
               you think.

                         WILSON
                   (re Ed's tattoos)
               I think you didn't get that lot in the
               Navy, doing your National Service.

                         ED
               I already told you, man.  Corcoran.  Know
               what that is?  State prison.

                         WILSON
               Nick's a nick, n' it?  No matter what
               state you're in.  State of remorse, most
               likely -- for gettin' caught.

                         ED
               But that's not me anymore.  That's when I
               was into the gang lifestyle.  That's not
               who I am now.  Five years in the joint --
               that's it for me, man.

     Now Wilson drops the clanger.

                         WILSON
               Just got out meself, didn't I.

     And Ed turns.  Looks at Wilson.  Fellow ex-con.

                                                               CUT.

     EXT. WILSON'S MOTEL.  NIGHT.

     Wilson out of the car, shuts the passenger door.  Ed on the
     other side, looks over the roof at him.

                         ED
               Go home, man.
                   (plane taking off in
                    background)
               Get on a plane.

     Wilson has other plans.

                         WILSON
               I'll be needing a shooter.

     Makes his fingers like a gun.  And a clicking sound.

                         ED
                   (comes quickly over)
               You're kiddin' me, right?

                         WILSON
               What do I do, then, look in the bleedin'
               Yellow Pages?

                         ED
                   (an urgent whisper)
               These are not guys you can just go run a
               number on, man.

                         WILSON
                   (looking around)
               Thought perhaps there'd be dispensing
               machines, you know.  Bung in your coins,
               come out with a .44 Magnum, fully-loaded.

     Ed throws up his hands, walks back to his driver's side door.

                         ED
               Are you a resident of California?
               You gonna fill out forms, man?  Do the
               background check?  Go through a three-day
               waiting period?

                         WILSON
               Sod that.  Gotta get back before my
               probation officer wonders where I've
               skived off to.

                         ED
               Probation?  Man, you crazy.  They
               shouldn't've let you outta your country,
               much less prison.

                         WILSON
               Travelling on a dodgy passport, n' all.

     Walks round to come face to face with Ed once more.

                         WILSON
               Which is why I thought, save some time,
               get what I need under the table, like.

     ED

     As if resigned and mulling the problem over:

                         ED
               Under the table?

                                                               CUT.

     INT. GUN SHOW.  DAY.

     Hundreds of tables.  Under bright lights.  Displaying every
     kind of firearm.  Handguns, rifles, shotguns, parts to make
     machine guns.  A weapons bazaar.

     WILSON AND ED

     Walking around.  Even a cool customer like Wilson can't help
     but be impressed by America's loving embrace of senseless
     mayhem.

     DEALERS

     Touting their wares.

     VISITORS

     Trying out pistol grips -- or pushing baby carriages.  Guys
     in fatigue jackets with toddlers on their shoulders.  Women
     in stretch pants looking for a little something in personal
     protection.

     WILSON

     Doesn't know where to look.  At the booth featuring "Classic
     Cowboy Collectibles" -- or the most OBESE COUPLE he's ever
     seen who just walked by.

                         PA SYSTEM
               Attention:  the long-range vermin-
               shooting panel is due to commence in two
               minutes in the blue room at the rear of
               the Convention Center.

     ... and other anomalous oddball ANNOUNCEMENTS in the
     background as long as we're here.

     DEMONSTRATION

     At a booth selling laser attachments.

                         BEAM SALESMAN
               BeamSight II is easily mountable on any
               shotgun, rifle, or sidearm and will
               project a small, bright red dot directly
               onto the point where your weapon is
               aimed ...

     For purposes of display, a smiling YOUNG WOMAN is the
     "target."

     WILSON

     Walking past, almost subliminally noting the Young Woman with
     the symbol of death on her.

     TABLE

     A .45 passed from a DEALER's hand to Wilson's.

                         DEALER
               Man knows what he likes.

                         ED
                   (he'll talk if Wilson won't)
               Lookin' good.

                         DEALER
                   (while Wilson checks)
               That's a high-end item.  Total
               reliability.

                         ED
               What'd you call that -- the Protector?

                         DEALER
               Yes, sir.  Won't find a better CQC on the
               market.

     Wilson's eyes glance up -- but Ed asks the question.

                         ED
               CQ what?

                         DEALER
               Close Quarters Combat.  Keep one in my
               own home.

                         WILSON
               Trouble is, I'm not at home, see.
               Fancied a bit of target shooting, y'know,
               while I'm here -- with me mate.

     Nods at Ed.

                         DEALER
               Oh really?  Where you from?

                         WILSON
               England.
                   (sighting the weapon)
               Only, we saw there was a show on, thought
               I might pick something up for a price,
               type of thing.

                         DEALER
               You came to the right place, sir.  My
               wife's second cousin is English.  Well,
               Scotch-Irish.  Can I interest you in a
               holster?

                         WILSON
               Just luck, this, really.  Never been to
               one of these before.

                         DEALER
               You're in gun country now, my friend.

                         WILSON
                   (picks up another, checks it
                    out)
               Been to the Boat Show.

                         DEALER
                   (re Wilson's new selection)
               Packs a punch, but it's compact, has
               accessible features -- makes a nice
               concealed-carry piece.

                         ED
                   (playing the reluctant buyer)
               He don't have a concealed weapons permit.

                         WILSON
               Don't have time for a lot of paperwork,
               y'know.  Just popped over on a quick
               visit.

                         DEALER
               I can take care of the paperwork.

                         WILSON
               Yeah?

                         DEALER
               No problem.  If you don't have a problem
               with me reporting this gun stolen.

     A look of understanding between them.

                         WILSON
               No.  Not at all.
                   (to Ed)
               Do we?

                         ED
               Not me, man.

                         WILSON
               I mean, it's already a steal, n'it -- what
               you said -- four hundred for this one?

                         DEALERS
               Well, I'll have to add another two
               hundred on top of that.

                         WILSON
               Oh, aye?

                         DEALER
                   (another look)
               ... for the paperwork.

                                                               CUT.

     INT. ED'S CAR.  DAY.

     Ed drives.  Nervous at Wilson handling his new gun purchase
     beside him.

                         WILSON
               Violation of my parole, this.
                   (a perfect pause)
               -- Goin' abroad.

     Ed shakes his head at Wilson's sense of humor.

                         ED
               You hadda show up on a weekend.  This
               weekend.  Wouldn't've even been a gun
               show ... for another month.

                         WILSON
               Fucking out of order, that.  Shouldn't be
               allowed.

     As he puts away a box of ammo.

                         ED
               Now what.  You gonna take your new
               arsenal, go visit Terry Valentine, just
               like that?  Boom bam boom.

                         WILSON
               It's only insurance.  Can't be too
               careful.  This Terry Valentine, he's
               probably a wonderful fella.  They were
               together how long?

                         ED
               Five years, I think.  Long time.

                         WILSON
               Well, there you are.  Jen must've liked
               him.

     Doesn't make Ed feel any better.  Nor does the way Wilson
     seems now to be studying Ed's driving techniques.  Paying
     attention to the way traffic lights and left-turn lanes and
     cars without clutches work over here.

                         ED
                   (remembering)
               Jenny told me she met him at the beach.
               Got blinded by his smile.
                   (beat)
               You believe that shit?  Son of a bitch
               never smiled at me.  Buried her at a
               "private" service.  Private for who.
               Him?

                         WILSON
                   (confused)
               Hang about.  I thought you said he come
               into the restaurant where you worked with
               Jenny.

                         ED
               He came in with Jenny to the restaurant
               where I work.  That's not where they met.

                         WILSON
               And that's where you met Jenny.

                         ED
               No, no -- Jenny used to work as a
               waitress.  Before she met him.  But
               that's not where she met me.  Not in my
               restaurant.

                         WILSON
               How'd the two of you hook up, then?

                         ED
               Oh, Jenny was in my acting class.

                                                               CUT.

     INT. RENTAL CAR.  DAY.

     Wilson at the wheel himself.  Getting the hang of L.A.
     Driving downtown.  Along one of the major boulevards.

     Glances at a street sign as he goes by.  Picks up the map
     book on the seat beside him to check his route.

     EXT. BOULEVARD.  DAY.

     Wilson makes a sudden lane change to avoid getting fed in the
     wrong direction.  Gets HONKED by another driver.

     EXT. A STREET DOWNTOWN.  DAY.

     Wilson cruises past a particular building.  We don't have to
     really clearly see it just yet (we saw it in the flash cuts) --
     more important we see him seeing it.  Casing it with the eyes
     of a professional.  Sniffing it out; the instinct of a
     predator after prey.

     INT. CAR.  DAY.

     Parks it.  Produces the little leather travel kit we saw him
     unpack at his motel.  Unzips it.  Under the usual assortment
     of clippers, razors, etc., is a hidden layer -- storing still
     more personalized items:  a set of select slim
     lockpicking/cutting tools.

     EXT. SIDE STREET.  DAY.

     Wilson locks the car.  Walks away.  STAY with him.

     AROUND THE CORNER

     He walks down the block.  A nice long walk.  What we get out
     of it besides a sense of Wilson -- cool cat; ambling along;
     loner; sun beating down; not bothered; his shadow doubling
     him -- is this:

     The building approaching.  The one he has his eye on.  The
     target.  It's across the street.  A kind of flat windowless
     warehouse with adjoining loading yard.  Loading yard
     surrounded by a chain-link fence -- topped with barbed wire.

     The actual geography of where he left his car in relation to
     this building.  Safely around the corner.  And how he might
     practically get back to it, either this same way or via a
     more circuitous route round another block.

     The sense you get in downtown L.A. on a lazy Saturday
     afternoon that you're in a ghost town.  Particularly in this
     shabby kind of industrial section.

     EXT. THE BUILDING.

     Wilson crosses over to it now.  From sunny to shade.

     Walks past the chain-link fence.  The padlocked gate, big
     enough to accommodate the (couple of) trucks parked within
     the compound.

     Walks past the closed security door which would appear to be
     the building's main entrance.

     Round the next corner -- SEES there's a steel back door as
     well.

     Comes around this block again.  Looking surreptitiously around
     now.  Streets here utterly deserted.  Not even a passing car.
     Crappy residential building on an opposite corner, SPANISH
     MUSIC blaring from one of the open windows, but not with a
     direct view on the loading yard fence on this side.  Wilson
     nearing it now -- taking something out of his pocket.  One of
     the mysterious metallic tools from his travel kit.  Snaps his
     wrist, unfolding the tool with a CRACK.  Wire cutters.

     He doesn't go for the gate, the padlock, like we might have
     thought.  He suddenly drops to one knee, in shadow where the
     fence meets the adjoining building.  SNAP, SNAP, SNAP, SNAP,
     SNAP -- so quick, with great dexterity, though his face
     grimaces with the strength he has to exert with each
     application of pressure -- he cuts just as many links as he
     knows he needs to push in a little flap of fence and roll
     under.  Whole thing accomplished in seconds.

     LOADING YARD

     Walks fast to the cover of the trucks.  Passes.  Looks
     around.  Cement loading docks and bays.  Shuttered doors.  He
     jumps up to one, puts his ear to the metal.  Listens awhile.

     WILSON

     Scans the wall for any sign of an alarm box or anything.
     Then cocks an ear upwards... CAMERA CRANING UP to show us
     what he hears:  an air-conditioning unit HUMMING away.  Which
     means someone must be inside.

     Wilson looks back at his entry options.  Not the loading
     doors -- but a conventional door at one end, with a
     conventional lock his eye zeroes in on.  Gets out his tools,
     going over.

     INT. WAREHOUSE HALLWAY.

     A SCRATCHING at the door.  It opens.  He's in.

     Waits.  Cautious.  Nothing.  He starts along the hallway.

     INT. WAREHOUSE.

     A SUPERVISOR (the one from the flash cuts) does a double take
     as Wilson passes.

                         SUPERVISOR
               Hey!

     Wilson stops and turns.  Says nothing.

                         SUPERVISOR
               How'd you get in here.

                         WILSON
               Walked.

                         SUPERVISOR
               You walked.
                   (coming over)
               What the hell are you doing here.

                         WILSON
               Looking for a bloke named Valentine.
               Know him?

     MEAT PUPPETS (who we saw before as well) who work here
     gathering.  The Supervisor and the Meat Puppets exchange
     glances.

                         SUPERVISOR
               He's expecting you?

                         WILSON
                   (beat)
               I doubt it.

     The Supervisor moves toward Wilson.

                         SUPERVISOR
               So why would he want to see you.

                         WILSON
               I have a message for him.  About Jennifer
               Wilson.

                         SUPERVISOR
               Jennifer Wilson.

     More looks are exchanged.

                         WILSON
               You know her?

                         SUPERVISOR
               Yeah.  I know her, all right.  She came
               down here once, stirred up a shitstorm.
               We lost a full day's work, took me weeks
               to get back on schedule.  If she hadn't
               a' been Terry's woman I would've broke
               her jaw.  'Course, she's nobody's problem
               now.

     Wilson stares at him.

                         WILSON
               Is Valentine here?

                         SUPERVISOR
               What do you think?

     Wilson looks at the Meat Puppets, the loading area.

                         WILSON
               Where is he, then?

                         SUPERVISOR
               Listen, get the fuck out of here before
               you get hurt.  Who the fuck do you think
               you are, waltzing in here, asking
               questions?

     Wilson just looks at him.

                         SUPERVISOR
               Do you hear me, asshole?

     The Supervisor shoves him.  The Meat Puppets move a little in
     anticipation.  Wilson isn't giving any indication that he's
     going to leave.

                         SUPERVISOR
               Jesus, you really want your ass kicked,
               don't you?

     He pushes Wilson again, hard.

                         SUPERVISOR
               Go on, get outta here.

     He pushes Wilson again.  Still, Wilson won't leave.

                         SUPERVISOR
               Fuckin' nut.  Go on.

     This time he tries to slap Wilson.  Wilson blocks the
     Supervisor's hand and then punches him, hard.  The Supervisor
     stumbles back and falls to the floor.

     THE MEAT PUPPETS

     Move to Wilson.  He tries to fend them off, but there are too
     many.  They beat him.  When they find that he's armed, they
     beat him harder.

                                                               CUT.

     EXT. BUILDING.  DAY.

     Wilson is taken outside and dumped.  After a moment, he gets
     to his feet.  Dusting himself.  Reaches for ANOTHER GUN tucked
     in his lower back.  He re-enters the building.

     A beat.  We hear several SHOTS.

     Seconds later, one of the Meat Puppets comes stumbling out of
     the door, terrified.  He runs past us, fast.

     A moment later, Wilson emerges, gun in hand.

                         WILSON
               You tell him.  You tell him I'm coming!!

                                                               CUT.

     INT./EXT. VALENTINE'S HOUSE.  DUSK.

     A series of images that prove Valentine (whoever he is) has
     taste, wealth, and influence, stretching back a good three
     decades at least.

     Walking through some of these shots is a young beauty in a
     bathing suit named ADHARA.  She advances slowly, not entirely
     sure of herself, and stops to look at things just like we do.
     At one point she looks to see a BEEFY GUY (GORDON) sitting at
     the kitchen counter, flipping through a magazine.  He looks
     her up and down, more from reflex than anything.

     She continues on.  Eventually she emerges through sliding
     glass doors and on to a patio.

     HER POV

     A figure by the pool, talking on the phone.  His back to us.
     The pool is spectacular, mosaic tile bottomed.

     ADHARA

     Approaches, then sits beside him.  His voice is soothing, but
     with the tiniest hint of exasperation that comes with being
     slightly ahead of everyone.

                         VALENTINE
                   (into phone)
               Not before.  Not before.  Think about it.
               What does it mean?  What -- no, I'm not.
               Think.  Yes.  See?  You figured it out
               all by yourself.  I know.  Are we done?
               Okay.

     He hangs up, stands, still doesn't turn.

                         VALENTINE
               Adhara.  I told your father, if you're
               looking for a name, you can't go wrong
               with a constellation.

                         ADHARA
               I used to hate it.  Now I like it.

                         VALENTINE
               Could be worse, he could've named you
               Reticulum.

     He turns and we see him for the first time.

     VALENTINE

     Polished.  Handsome.  Charismatic.  Especially when he's
     smiling like he is now.  He leans over and kisses her.

                         VALENTINE
               Is there anything in the world that you
               want or need?

                         ADHARA
               I want to know why you need that scary
               guy in your house.

                         VALENTINE
               Gordon?  He's been with me for years.
               He's not as tough as he looks.

                         ADHARA
               Then what good is he?

                         VALENTINE
               Is it possible that you're too young to
               be acquainted with the idea of loyalty?

                         ADHARA
               Is that a problem?

                         VALENTINE
               Not for you, clearly.

                         ADHARA
               I'm loyal to things that make me happy.

                         VALENTINE
               Am I a thing?

                         ADHARA
               Well, you're certainly not a person.

                         VALENTINE
               I'm not.

                         ADHARA
               No.  You're not specific enough to be a
               person.  You're more like a vibe.

                         VALENTINE
               I'm so glad we're having this chat.

                         ADHARA
               It's not a knock.

                         VALENTINE
               It's not a compliment.

                         ADHARA
               It's an observation.  Like:  I'm hungry.
               When are we eating?

                         VALENTINE
               As soon as you get dressed.

                         ADHARA
               What kind of food?

                         VALENTINE
               Anything but Japanese.

                         ADHARA
               Why?

                         VALENTINE
               I'm not into finger foods.  Too fussy.

                         ADHARA
               Like you.

                         VALENTINE
               I don't like do-it-yourself cuisine.
               Buffets.  Salad bars.

                         ADHARA
               You demand to be served.  A fork
               fetishist.

                         VALENTINE
               It's just fuel to me.  I'm not there for
               distractions.

                         ADHARA
               For some, eating is a sensual experience.
               The sensual experience.

                         VALENTINE
               That's what Gordon's always saying.

                         ADHARA
               Oh, god.

     His cell phone rings.

                         VALENTINE
                   (into phone)
               Yes.

     He listens, then looks up at his balcony, where a MAN (AVERY)
     stands holding a phone, obviously talking to Valentine.

                         VALENTINE
                   (into phone)
               I'll be there as soon as I can.

     He hangs up.

                         VALENTINE (cont'd)
               We can leave as soon as you're ready.

                         ADHARA
               Okay.

     EXT. BALCONY.  EVENING.

     Valentine approaches Avery.

                         VALENTINE
               What.

                         AVERY
               There's been some trouble downtown.

                         VALENTINE
               What kind?

                         AVERY
               What the papers used to call a "gangland
               slaying."

                         VALENTINE
               Our black friends?

                         AVERY
               No, Terry.  They don't work like that.
               Jenny Wilson's father paid a little
               visit, left a message.

                         VALENTINE
               I thought he was in prison, in England.

                         AVERY
               Well, either they have a very liberal
               work-release program, or he's out,
               because he's here in L.A., looking for
               you.

     Valentine is a little ruffled.  Maybe Avery likes that.

                         VALENTINE
               What do we do?

     Beat.

                         AVERY
               We wait, and we watch.

     Valentine just looks at him.

     EXT. VALENTINE'S HOUSE.  POOLSIDE.  EVENING.

     Adhara approaches Valentine, who stands staring at the pool.

                         ADHARA
               Italian?

                         VALENTINE
               I'm sorry.

                         ADHARA
               Italian.

                         VALENTINE
               Who?

                         ADHARA
               Not who, food.  Should we get Italian.

                         VALENTINE
               Sure.

     Turns to her.

                         VALENTINE (cont'd)
               Yes.  Are you ready?

                         ADHARA
               As long as I don't have to pass Gordon
               again.  I'm never ready for that.

     He smiles, rises, and offers her his hand.

                         VALENTINE
               No.  I know another way out.

     She takes it.

                                                               CUT.

     EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING.  EVENING.

     ELAINE on her way in.  Handsome woman.  Intelligent, capable-
     looking.  Passes Wilson who's leaning somewhere smoking.

     ELAINE

     Aware as a wary woman will be of a strange man's presence
     without necessarily having looked at him.  Well aware too
     that he stayed where he was -- so she unworriedly unlocks the
     building's security gate and goes through to the inner --

     COURTYARD

     -- and closes the gate behind her, now seeing him amble up,
     arriving as it CLICKS shut between them.  He's looking at her
     a certain way.  She looks back.  And knows.

                         ELAINE
               You're Jenny's father.

     And the recognition on his part:

                         WILSON
               Had a feeling it was you.

                         ELAINE
               You look alike.

                         WILSON
                   (cigarette in hand)
               Perhaps it was the smoke.

                         ELAINE
               Not her brand.

                         WILSON
               She used to pinch 'em off me.
                   (trying to defuse Elaine's cold
                    stare)
               Funny that.  One thing she never tried to
               get me to stop.

     Elaine doesn't soften.

                         ELAINE
               Why did you come here?

                         WILSON
               Wanted to talk to you, didn't I?

                         ELAINE
               No, why did you come here?

     America.

                         WILSON
               Sort a few things out.

                         ELAINE
               Been busy, have you.

                         WILSON
               How d'you mean?

                         ELAINE
               It's been a while.

                         WILSON
               I was skint -- didn't have no money to
               get here.

                         ELAINE
               That's not what I heard.

                         WILSON
               What was that, then?

                         ELAINE
               I heard you were -- what's that adorable
               phrase? -- "at Her Majesty's pleasure."

                         WILSON
               It was the bars, then.

     Indicating his face, viewed by Elaine through the barred
     security gate that divides them.

                         ELAINE
               In any case, I don't suppose the salary
               you make sewing mailbags is really
               commensurate with international airline
               travel.

                         WILSON
               Sewing mailbags?  Me?  Never did an
               honest day's work in my life, dear.
               Wasn't about to start when I was in stir --
               not with all that leisure time on my
               hands.

                         ELAINE
               And not with all that buried loot you had
               waiting for you when you got out.  From
               the Wembley Staduim job, wasn't it?  Pink
               Floyd concert receipts.  Jenny would've
               been ... fourteen at the time?

                         WILSON
                   (trying to conceal his
                    surprise)
               Hardly buried.  Earning interest, love.
               Earning interest in an offshore account.
               Tidy little premium per annum, that.

                         ELAINE
               Well, that kind of security can't be
               bought.  Must be more comforting than a
               daughter to greet you.

     She turns to walk away.

                         WILSON
               Here, aren't you gonna let me in.

                         ELAINE
                   (without looking back)
               Try calling me again.

     INT. ELAINE'S APARTMENT.  EVENING.

     She comes in.  A modest studio apartment.  Puts her bag on
     the kitchenette countertop.  Glances at her answer machine to
     see if she has any messages.  The phone RINGS.  She sits down
     glumly on her couch, holds her head in her hands.

     EXT. ELAINE'S APARTMENT BUILDING.  EVENING.

     Wilson gives up, starts to walk away.  The gate BUZZES.

     INT. ELAINE'S APARTMENT.  EVENING.

     Elaine opens the door.  Wilson in the hall.

                         ELAINE
               I was just going to toss some vegetable
               rolls in the microwave, open a can of
               diet soda.
                   (beat)
               Want to take me out?

                                                               CUT.

     INT. RESTAURANT.  NIGHT.

     Wilson and Elaine at a table.

                         WILSON
               ... No, I went in for more improving
               pastimes.  Philosophy classes, language
               courses, European history, all that lark.
               Did you know that in Paris in the
               Eighteenth Century there were more rats
               in people's houses than there were people
               in people's houses.

                         ELAINE
               Sounds like Beverly Hills.

                         WILSON
               Here, are you always this sarky?

                         ELAINE
               Sarcastic, moi?  Maybe I'll mellow when
               my ship comes in.  It's expected any day
               now.  I'm all packed and ready to go.

                         WILSON
               Weren't you on a television series?

                         ELAINE
                   (has he seen it?)
               If it played in England somebody owes me
               money.  Who told you that -- Eddie?

                         WILSON
                   (yes)
               Said it went on for donkey's years.

                         ELAINE
               Three seasons.  They found that's the
               limit of human tolerance when it comes to
               following the adventures of a family of
               Mormons on the Chisum Trail.
                   (blinks coquettishly)
               I was wife number three -- the ingenue.

                         WILSON
               Oh, it just ended, then.

                         ELAINE
               Now who's being sarcastic?

                         WILSON
               When you've lost as many years as I have,
               love, puts things in perspective, know
               what I mean.

                         ELAINE
               I'm sorry.  I guess the rest of us have
               no excuse for wondering where the time
               went.
                   (raises her drink)
               It must've been the bars.

     Their food arrives.

                         ELAINE
               It's a kind of prison, doing a series.
               Early to bed, early to rise, no time off
               for good behavior, you grab the boodle
               for as long as it lasts.
                   (the kicker)
               Only difference is you can't get arrested
               afterwards.

     Wilson appears fascinated by the cold glasses of water on the
     table.  Ice cubes CLINKING as he holds his.  A BUSBOY
     bringing them to other people, too, just like that, without
     anyone even asking.

                         WILSON
               I can't believe Jenny told you all that.
               About me.  She was always so embarrassed.

                         ELAINE
               Not embarrassed.

                         WILSON
                   (correcting)
               Ashamed.

                         ELAINE
               Not ashamed.

     Wilson looks at her.  Okay.  What then.

                         ELAINE
               Disappointed.

                         WILSON
               She never told Eddie, though.

                         ELAINE
               She never told anyone else.
                   (making light now)
               About the convict strain -- or is it
               stain?  No, I was privileged.  I was
               someone who helped Jenny efface her past.

                         WILSON
               How'd you manage that, then.

                         ELAINE
               When I'm not honing my craft in episodic
               television I do double-duty as a voice
               coach.  Not that her accent would have
               hobbled her progress.  Not with that
               look.

                         WILSON
               Yeah, well, she started all that in
               London.

                         ELAINE
               Modelling.

                         WILSON
               Learnin' 'ow to speak proper.
                   (putting it on a bit there.
                    Then, upper crust:)
               Central School of Speech and Drama.
               It's no doddle gettin' in there, y'know.
               At seventeen.  They offered her a place
               at RADA n' all, only she'd've had to wait
               till the next session and she was always
               in hurry to get on, was Jenny.  She could
               talk posh without any training, when she
               was knee-high to a grasshopper.
                   (indicating himself)
               Show up the old man, you know.

     Elaine smiles slightly.  None of this information new to her.
     But warming to this man.

                         ELAINE
               You weren't disappointed in her, then.

                         WILSON
               In Jenny?  'Course not.  How could I be.
               'Course I wasn't.

                         ELAINE
               She was twenty-one when she came to me.
                   (looks at him)
               ... Straight from leaving you.

                         WILSON
               Footloose and fancy free.

                         ELAINE
               She was happy here.  However the two of
               you might have parted.  Don't think she
               wasn't.

     It's because Wilson thinks the opposite that he's here.
     Looks at Elaine.

                         WILSON
               That's the trouble, n' it.
                   (hard as nails again)
               She enjoyed life.

                                                               CUT.

     EXT. OCEANFRONT.  NIGHT.

     They walk along the seafront.  We HEAR the ocean but can't
     see it.

                         ELAINE
               When did you get in?

                         WILSON
               Yesterday.  Afternoon.

                         ELAINE
                   (occurs to her)
               You haven't been lurking outside my
               building all day.

                         WILSON
               No, I had -- some other matters to attend
               to, you know.  Getting a car sorted ...

                         ELAINE
               I might've been away for the weekend.

                         WILSON
               Well, I reckoned, Saturday night, if you
               were goin' out, you'd probably have to
               come home first.

                         ELAINE
               And you've seen Eddie Rama.

                         WILSON
               Yeah, saw Eddie, yeah.  Me and him are
               muckers.

     Mates.  Friends.  Makes a kind of bonding gesture.

                         ELAINE
               I should really give him a call.  He's a
               character, isn't he.  Well, not to you.
               I meant to us squares in the outside
               world.

                         WILSON
               He give me your address.

                         ELAINE
               I gave him yours.  Said, here, you want
               to write, I think this is a relative.  I
               guess I thought I was being true to
               Jenny.  Who told me she didn't have a
               father -- before proceeding of course to
               tell me why.

                         WILSON
               Well, don't suppose she did, really, most
               of her life.  On her own after her mum
               died.  Aunts and uncles for a time -- and
               then the bright lights beckoned.

                         ELAINE
               Were you still married at the time -- to
               Jenny's mother, I mean?

                         WILSON
               Nah, we split up when Jenny was six.  Her
               second husband done a runner after she
               got sick.  They give me compassionate
               leave from Parkhurst to go visit her in
               hospital.  We were always mates, me and
               Jenny's mum.  I like to think they're
               together again now.  Y'know.  Heavenly
               choir.

     Beat.

                         ELAINE
               The address Jenny gave me, that wasn't a
               prison, was it?

                         WILSON
               Nah, accommodation address.

                         ELAINE
               What's that, like a P.O. box.

                         WILSON
               Something like that, yeah.

                         ELAINE
               Where you get your bank statements.

     Wilson gives a laugh.

                         WILSON
               Well, you gotta have something permanent,
               don'tcha.  Even if it's a hole in the
               wall.  No matter which jug I might be
               transferred to, I always got someone on
               the out checks up on it for me, see.
               Anything I need to know, comes round on
               visitor's day -- word in my ear.

     Elaine pauses.

                         ELAINE
               Some word.

     Wilson leans on the wall overlooking the black ocean.  Sound
     of WAVES gently lapping the beach.

                         WILSON
               I already knew.  Knew beforehand.  When
               was it supposed to have happened? -- two
               o'clock in the morning, Eddie said.

                         ELAINE
                   (watching him)
               That's what was estimated.

                         WILSON
               Eight hours difference between here and
               London.  Would've been, what, ten in the
               morning, my time.  I was just coming out
               on the yard.  Now, I was in the habit of
               saving my newspaper till then.  Bit of
               fresh air, stretch me legs -- well,
               stretch the day out, really, that's what
               you wanna do.  And I'll tell ya:  I
               couldn't open the paper.  Could not pry
               the pages apart -- it was like they was
               glued together.  That's how weak my hands
               went.  Thought I was having heart attack,
               only I knew I wasn't.  Bloke come up to
               me, he says, Dave, he says, you've gone
               all white.  I said, fuck me, I've been in
               prison half my life, what d'ya expect.
               But he was dead on, 'cause I could feel
               the blood drain right out of me head.
               And I knew ...
                   (beat)
               Something had happened to Jen.

     They stand here a while.  Listening to the BREAKERS hit the
     shore.

                                                               CUT.

     INT. ELAINE'S APARTMENT.  NIGHT.

     They come in.

                         ELAINE
               Make yourself at home.  Steal something.

     That gets her a look.

                         ELAINE
               There's nothing I can't afford to lose.

     She goes to make coffee.  Wilson looks around.

                         ELAINE
               Do you even know who Terry Valentine is?

                         WILSON
               Well, I gathered something from the
               article what Eddie sent me.  Some sort of
               pop music producer, wasn't it.

     Maybe a smile from Elaine at the quaintness of "pop" music.

                         ELAINE
               Rock n' roll, is what we called it.  He's
               sort of a forgotten figure now, but back
               when the West Coast was the grooviest
               place on earth, Terry Valentine was where
               all the happenings happened.  More of a
               kind of promoter, I guess, whatever that
               means.  Just took that whole Southern
               California Sixties Zeitgeist and ran with
               it.  Packaged and sold it.  Made out like
               a bandit.

     FLASH CUTS:

     VALENTINE. At home. Watching as Adhara undresses, either
     deliberately for him, or just casually. She smiles as she
     notices he's looking.

                         WILSON
               What's he done lately.

     That line pregnant with meaning.  Elaine looks at him.
     Avoids answering the question actually implied there.

                         ELAINE
                   (brings a tray over)
               Lives high off the hog and waits for the
               next big thing.  Like me -- but on a
               grander scale of failure.

                         WILSON
               Now, you shouldn't run yourself down.  My
               employer, Mr. Lindgren --

                         ELAINE
               -- Your employer?

                         WILSON
               -- Mr. Lindgren.

                         ELAINE
               Who's Mr. Lindgren?

                         WILSON
               My employer.

                         ELAINE
               What line is he in.

                         WILSON
               Proprietor of a London firm.  Of
               longstanding.

                         ELAINE
               I see.

                         WILSON
               Based in London, but with international
               concerns.

                         ELAINE
               I bet.

                         WILSON
               Various enterprises, style of thing.

                         ELAINE
               I thought you said you never did an
               honest day's work in your life.

                         WILSON
               Well, not to say Mr. Lindgren is
               dishonest, exactly.

                         ELAINE
                   (she gets the picture)
               Right.

                         WILSON
               Anyhow, he's always saying to me, Dave,
               never run yourself down, son -- 'cause
               there'll always be plenty of people
               willing to do it for you.

                         ELAINE
               In what capacity are you employed by this
               Mr. Lindgren?

                         WILSON
               This and that.  Y'know.  Ways and means.

                         ELAINE
               -- When he wants someone run down, you're
               willing to do it for him.

     They sort of come together -- in mutual understanding -- and
     sit down.  Coffee steaming.

                         ELAINE
               So what's the deal.  You and Terry
               Valentine at twenty paces.  Is that what
               this is about.

                         WILSON
               Why not.

                         ELAINE
               Are you serious.

                         WILSON
               Have you ever known me not to be.

     Elaine looks away:

                         ELAINE
               You fuckin' guys and your dicks.

                         WILSON
               What'd you want me to do.  Stay at home,
               twiddlin' me thumbs.  Doing sweet F.A.
               [Fuck All].

                         ELAINE
               You don't believe it was a car accident.

                         WILSON
               What do you think.

                         ELAINE
               Terry's never going to give you
               satisfaction.  Not the type.

                         WILSON
               Depends, don' it.

                         ELAINE
               On what.  What makes you so certain.

                         WILSON
               I'll bloody well ask him.

                         ELAINE
               There's the phone.  You want his number.

     WILSON

     That look again.

                         WILSON
               I got his number.

     ELAINE

     Past caring.

                         ELAINE
               I'm not going to help you.

     She goes into a bathroom.  Shutting the door behind her.

     WILSON

     Sips coffee.  Bites into a cookie.

                                                               CUT.

     EXT. HILLSIDE.  UNDERBRUSH.  LATE AFTERNOON.

     Thickets part and we SEE Wilson scrambling up a rather steep
     hill.  Coming to a ridge where he settles down to look at
     something O.S.  His expression changes by degrees from
     curiosity to dawning realization to a kind of frustrated
     disappointment.

     INT. WILSON'S CAR (ON THE ROAD BELOW).  LATE AFTERNOON.

     Ed sits in here, RADIO on.  Wilson appears out of the brush,
     gets in.  Ed turns the radio down.

                         ED
                   (mindful of the odd car driving
                    past)
               Told you you wouldn't be able to see
               through that gate.

                         WILSON
               Gate's open.  I had a butcher's at the
               house.

                         ED
                   (alarmed)
               Who'd you butcher at the house?

                         WILSON
               Butcher's hook.  Look.
                   (doesn't anyone speak English
                    in this fucking country?)
               I don't much reckon those minders of his.

                         ED
               Huh?

                         WILSON
               He's brought in the heavy mob.

                         ED
               What?

                         WILSON
               Extra muscle.  Bodyguards.

                         ED
               Has he?

                         WILSON
               They look a right load of wallies.
               Patrolling back and forth outside the
               gate, all ponced up like the fuckin'
               Household Cavalry.
                   (ducks suddenly)
               Watch it.

     As one of the "bodyguards" runs by, only fleetingly glimpsed
     by us.

                         ED
               That was one of them?

                         WILSON
                   (sits up again)
               See what I mean?  Wearing bloomin'
               uniforms n' all.

     Off Ed's perplexed look ...

     EXT. HILLSIDE UNDERBRUSH.  LATE AFTERNOON.

     Wilson settles into position again, this time with Ed.

                         WILSON
               Look at that.

     Ed just laughs.

                         WILSON
               What's so fucking funny?

                         ED
               Those aren't guards.  They're valets.

     POV

     Now we SEE what Wilson had mistaken for Valentine's private
     army.  Half a dozen VALETS outside Valentine's hilltop home.
     Dressed in matching attire, a couple of them wielding walkie-
     talkies.

     RESUME WILSON AND ED

     Ed's still laughing.

                         WILSON
               Valets.  What d'ya mean valets.  What is
               he, then, the Earl of fucking Doncaster?

                         ED
               Valets.  They park cars.  He's having a
               party.

                                                               CUT.

     EXT. VALENTINE'S HOUSE.  LATE AFTERNOON.

     Wilson's car pulls up.  He and Ed get out.  Wilson engages in
     a mini tug-of-war with a Valet over his car key, it so rubs
     him the wrong way having to give it up.

                         WILSON
               Keep it handy, mate, all right?  We're
               not stopping long.

     He gestures, apparently getting the message across that he
     wants the car kept close by.

                         VALET
               Yes, sir.

                         WILSON
               Cheers.

     Exchanges the key for a card -- which he turns over in his
     hand and studies curiously as they head inside.

                         WILSON
               Valets, eh?  Aren't we all la-de-da.

                         ED
                   (nervous being here)
               I thought you just wanted to check out
               the house, man.

                         WILSON
               Well, that's what we're doin', n' it.

                         ED
               No one else is even here yet.

                         WILSON
               First in, first out, that's me.

     Looking over to note the multi-car GARAGE off the main house.

     INT. VALENTINE'S HOUSE.  AFTERNOON.

     Wilson and Ed are among the first to arrive.  A smattering of
     other GUESTS.  Elaborate catered cuisine.  They mosey over to
     the wet bar.

                         BARTENDER
               Gentlemen.  What can I get you.

                         WILSON
                   (suggesting Ed take first
                    crack)
               Dubonnet with a twist?  Baby sham?
               Tomato juice and Tabasco sauce?

     By now his whole dynamic with Ed is a verbal tease.

                         ED
                   (to Bartender)
               Got a Coke?

     INT. VALENTINE'S BEDROOM.  AFTERNOON.

     Valentine is checking himself in a full-length mirror.  TV on
     in background, sound low (ENTERTAINMENT WEEK!).  Not quite
     satisfied, Valentine crosses to the bathroom.

     BATHROOM

     Valentine takes one more closer look.

                         ADHARA (O.S.)
               You have the same posters.

     Valentine turns.

                         VALENTINE
               Hmm?

     ADHARA

     Is lounging in the large tub.  Staring dreamily at a couple
     of framed posters on the walls:  more 60's psychedelia.

                         ADHARA
               That you have down at your office.

     Valentine sits on the edge of the tub.  With a nostalgic air
     as he looks at her:  the embodiment of youth.

                         VALENTINE
               Different ones.

     He strokes her wet skin.  They kiss lightly.

                         ADHARA
               I like the colors.

                         VALENTINE
               We all did.

                         ADHARA
               It must've been a time.  A golden moment.

     Beat.

                         VALENTINE
               Have you ever dreamed of a place ... you
               don't really recall ever having been
               to ... a place that probably doesn't even
               exist except in your imagination ...
               somewhere far away, half-remembered when
               you wake up ... but when you were there you
               spoke the language, you knew your way
               around ...
                   (significant pause)
               That was the 60's.

     With that exit line (practiced?), he starts to go.

     Then pauses, turns again.

                         VALENTINE
               No, it wasn't.  Wasn't either.

     Comes back to her.  Faraway look in his eyes.

                         VALENTINE
               It was '66 ... early '67.
                   (comes back to now)
               That was all.

     He goes.

     INT. VALENTINE'S HOUSE.  DOWNSTAIRS HALLWAY.  AFTERNOON.

     Wilson wanders around, exploring the house.  Comes to a wall
     of photographes.  Casually scanning them as he passes slowly
     by, he's caught up short by one.

     POV

     A framed photo of JENNY, his daughter.

     WILSON

     A series of emotions play over his face.  He turns -- SEES
     Valentine coming down the stairs.  Valentine joins the party
     without noticing him.

     BY THE BUFFET TABLE

     Ed peruses the available food.  Valentine comes over to check
     it out.  Glances at Ed without recognizing him.

                         VALENTINE
               Hi.

     And goes away.  Leaving Ed more nervous than ever.

     INT. VALENTINE'S HOUSE.  UPSTAIRS HALLWAY.  AFTERNOON.

     Wilson has come up here.  Peeks into one room.  Moves along to
     another:  the master bedroom.  Opens the door gently.

     INT. MASTER BATHROOM.

     Adhara is still enjoying her bath.

     INT. MASTER BEDROOM.

     Wilson enters.  Careful.  Aware that someone's in the adjoining
     bathroom.  The soft RIPPLE of WATER from in there.  Perhaps he
     even glimpses her through the door as he boldly looks around.
     He notices a video camera on a tripod, a cord running to the
     television.  Suddenly we hear the CHIRP of a cellular phone.

     BATHROOM

     Adhara reacts.

                         ADHARA
               Shit.

     She gets out of the tub and goes for the nearest towel.
     Quickly wrapping herself, she exits.

     BEDROOM

     Adhara enters and goes for her purse.  She pulls the RINGING
     phone out and answers it.

                         ADHARA
               Hello?  Hey!  Great.  You got my message?
               Yeah.  No, Crestview Terrace, not
               Crestview Place.  Yeah, there's like three
               different ways up the hill; the quick way
               is to bear to the right.  Sure.  Okay.
               Okay.  'Bye!

     She hangs up and begins toweling her hair.  After a moment
     she stops.  Something isn't right.  She looks around the
     room, and her eyes stop on the TV.  Her brow furrows, trying
     to place the familiar image on the screen:  a girl towel-
     drying her hair by the bed.

                         ADHARA
               That's me.

     She looks over to see the video camera, which has been turned
     on and pointed toward the bed.  She's not sure if it's funny
     or creepy.

                                                               CUT.

     INT. VALENTINE'S HOUSE.  DOWNSTAIRS.  AFTERNOON.

     Valentine mingling, all smiles and movement.

     WILSON

     At the foot of the stairs.  Watches him, all stillness and
     intensity.

     VALENTINE

     Catches Wilson's eye for a nanosecond, does a subtle double
     take, then moves on.

     INT. VALENTINE'S HOUSE.  UPSTAIRS HALLWAY.  AFTERNOON.

     Adhara, dressed, looking great, exits the bedroom and heads
     for the stairwell.

     INT. VALENTINE'S HOUSE.  DOWNSTAIRS.  AFTERNOON.

     Adhara descends the stairs.

     WILSON

     Turning to SEE her as she comes down.

     ADHARA

     Makes her way across the room to Valentine.

                         ADHARA
               Hey, I thought you weren't a buffet
               person.

                         VALENTINE
               I'm a gracious host.

     WILSON

     Watching them, when --

                         GUY
               Excuse me?

     Wilson looks at him.  Reluctantly.

                         GUY
               Don't you work with Ian?

                         WILSON
               Ian?

                         GUY
               I could swear I met you with Ian at the
               EMI offices in London.

                         WILSON
               Sorry.  Wasn't me.

                         GUY
               You sure?

                         WILSON
               Unless I'm not who I think I am.

                         GUY
               That's too bad.  Ian's got a good thing
               going over there.

                         WILSON
               Yeah?

                         GUY
               Turned that place completely around.  180
               degrees.

                         WILSON
               No kidding.

                         GUY
               What I like about Ian, he believes in a
               chain of command, but not a chain of
               respect, you understand what I'm saying?

                         WILSON
               Right.  Chain of respect.  That's good,
               that.

                         GUY
               Yeah.  I really admire the guy.  Well.
               Good to meet you.

                         WILSON
               Yeah.  Cheers, mate.

     The Guy leaves.  Wilson sees that Adhara is now on the other
     side of the room, separated from Valentine.  He heads for
     her.

     VALENTINE

     Still dealing with people desperate to be the focus of his
     attention.  He notices:

     WILSON AND ADHARA

     Talking in a corner.  She seems attentive.

     VALENTINE

     In a SERIES OF CUTS, still being the gracious host, still
     keeping his eyes on:

     WILSON AND ADHARA

     Who, in a SERIES OF CUTS, continue to talk.  Finally, they
     separate, Wilson heading outside onto a deck.

     VALENTINE

     Excuses himself from a group of sycophants and goes to her.

     ADHARA

     Valentine approaches and begins talking to her, low.  After a
     few moments of conversation, they both look toward:

     WILSON

     On the deck outside.  Joining Ed, who's taken refuge out here
     with a plate of food.  What Wilson can't belleve when he SEES
     it -- is that behind Valentine's house, which is on top of a
     high hill, is nothing but desolate scrub canyon.  On the other
     side of the railing around the deck, which is surely less
     than regulation height, is a sheer drop into an abyss.

                         WILSON (cont'd)
                   (jumps back with only slightly
                    affected vertigo)
               Flipping heck.

     Ed, a little more accustomed to L.A. architecture, nods in
     agreement.

                         ED
               If you could afford a house like this you
               would buy a house like this.

     Wilson edges forward to the rail again.

                         WILSON
               What are we standing on?

                         ED
               Faith.

     They stand there looking out.  Quite a view once you get used
     to it.  Breeze.

                         ED (cont'd)
                   (nods to the hazy distance)
               You could see the sea from here if you
               could see it.

                         WILSON
               Could you?

     But now Ed gives Wilson a nudge -- SEEING that Valentine
     inside the house is making his way out here.

                         WILSON
               Why don't you go nick one of those little
               cooker what's its warming up the sausages
               cocktail and meet me in the garage.  Look
               about for a toolbox while you're at it.

     Ed considers.  His is not to reason why.

                         ED
               Okay.

     Ed moves off.  Valentine steps up, smile fully loaded.

                         VALENTINE
               Hi.  Terry Valentine.

     He extends his hand.  Wilson shakes it.

                         WILSON
               Pleasure.

                         VALENTINE
               Have we met?  There's something I can't
               quite --

                         WILSON
               EMI in London.  I work with Ian.

                         VALENTINE
               Ah.

                         WILSON
               You must know Ian.

                         VALENTINE
               I don't.

                         WILSON
               Great bloke.  Really turned things around
               there.  180 degrees.

                         VALENTINE
               I suppose that's good, unless things were
               fine the way they were.

                         WILSON
               Oh, I think a shake-up was in order.
               Definitely.  Otherwise, people get lazy,
               don't they?  Forgetful.  Start thinking
               they can get away with things.  Gotta
               shake 'em up now and again, make 'em pay
               attention.

     Wilson looks at him.  Valentine looks back.  Something about
     those eyes ...

                         EXCITED GUY
               Terry, Terry ...

     The Excited Guy appears, tugging at Valentine.

                         WILSON
               Glad I got to meet you.

                         EXCITED GUY
               Ter ... Ter ... you gotta ...

                         VALENTINE
               Thanks.  You, too.

                         WILSON
               Be seein' you.

     The Excited Guy ushers Valentine away.  Wilson watches him
     go.

                         EXCITED GUY
               Charles Grodin is here.

                                                               CUT.

     INT. VALENTINE'S GARAGE.  AFTERNOON.

     Ed, waiting.  Wilson enters.

                         WILSON
               Got it?

     Ed displays the Sterno.

                         WILSON
               Toolbox?

     Ed points to a table, where a toolbox sits.  Wilson crosses
     to it, begins going through the contents.

                         WILSON
               Put the Sterno on the ground, near the
               center of the garage.

     Ed does.  Wilson pulls a brace-and-bit from the toolbox and
     crosses to the rear of one of the cars.  Dropping to the
     ground, he bores a hole in the gas tank.  Ed raises his
     eyebrows and moves toward the door.  Wilson crosses to the
     other car and puts a hole in that gas tank as well.  Then he
     puts the brace-and-bit back in the toolbox and heads for the
     exit, Ed right behind him, giving a quick backward glance.

     THE GASOLINE

     Spills out, slowly but steadily, and slithers toward the
     garage door.

     EXT. BETWEEN VALENTINE'S HOUSE AND GARAGE.  AFTERNOON.

     Wilson and Ed walk briskly along the path.

                         WILSON
                   (gives Ed parking ticket)
               Bring the motor around.  Bang out in
               front, right?

                         ED
               You goin' back inside?

                         WILSON
               One thing I need.

     INT. VALENTINE'S HOUSE.  DOWNSTAIRS.  AFTERNOON.

     Valentine is talking to Gordon, his beefy bodyguard, and
     looking around.  He stops as he sees Wilson once again
     stepping onto the deck.  He points Wilson out to Gordon, who
     nods and heads for the deck.

     EXT. VALENTINE'S HOUSE.  AFTERNOON.

     Ed hands the ticket to a Valet.  He exchanges looks with a
     couple of the other Valets.

     INT. VALENTINE'S HOUSE.  DOWNSTAIRS.  AFTERNOON.

     Valentine is talking to Adhara, who is introducing her
     Girlfriend.  As Valentine greets her, he glances outside
     where Gordon is approaching Wilson on the deck.

     EXT. DECK.

     Wilson SEES Gordon approaching.  Gets ready to greet him.
     Removes cigarette from mouth, drops it to floor of deck,
     presses it out under his shoe.  Limbers up his shoulders in a
     subtle way.

     Gordon coming towards him.  As if to challenge Wilson's
     legitimacy as an invited guest.  Closer.  About to speak.

     But Wilson doesn't even give him a chance to do that.  In
     quick succession:  Wilson HEAD BUTTS Gordon, splintering his
     nose; KNEES him in the groin; then, using the knee for
     leverage, grabs Gordon by the lapels -- and heaves him over
     the railing!

     It happened so fast that if anyone else is nearby they
     probably didn't even notice -- or didn't readily grasp what
     they saw.

     INT. VALENTINE'S HOUSE.

     Valentine had turned his attention back to Adhara and her
     Girlfriend.  When he glances back to the deck he's a little
     concerned not to see Gordon anywhere out there anymore --
     just Wilson coming back in.

     WILSON

     Adjusting his jacket, walking back through the house.  Behind
     him, people are rushing to the railing and looking over.  A
     few yells of "Call an ambulance!" etc. are heard.

     VALENTINE

     Moves that way.

     WILSON

     Moving across the room towards the front door.  They are
     heading right toward each other.

     WILSON AND VALENTINE

     Pass each other, eyes locked, almost dream-like.  Wilson's
     eyes cold, though with the hint of a smile.  Valentine throws
     a last look back before reaching the deck.

     EXT. DECK.

     Valentine pushes through to look over the railing.

     HIS POV

     Gordon -- a crumpled, inert heap way down the hill below.

     VALENTINE

     Turns to look toward the front door.  Wilson not to be seen.
     Valentine pushes through the crowd toward the door.

     EXT. VALENTINE'S HOUSE.  AFTERNOON.

     Valentine emerges in time to see Ed and Wilson pulling away.
     Wilson looks at him, impassive, through the passenger window.

     AVERY

     Is just arriving in his car.  Valentine gestures at him.
     Suddenly we HEAR a loud, bass-heavy WHHUUUMMMPPP.

     Valentine (and a few others) turn toward the sound, which
     came from:

     THE GARAGE

     There is smoke coming from under the door.

     EXT. CANYON ROAD.  AFTERNOON.

     Wilson's car practically tobogganing back down the hill.
     BOOM!  We hear an explosion from back UP the hill.

     INT. WILSON'S CAR.

     Ed jumps -- though he's driving.  The gas pedal his most
     pressing concern.  Negotiating the dangerously winding road
     comes second.  Exhilaration mixed with panic.

                         WILSON
               Steady on.

                         ED
               You steady on, man.  What the fuck else
               did you do back there.

     EXT. ROAD.

     An especially sharp curve looms ahead.

     WILSON

     Flinches, grabs a handhold.

     CURVE

     Car makes it around on two side wheels.

     WILSON

     Gulps.

                         WILSON
               Bloody hell.

     Ed regains control.

     AVERY

     In his car, takes a different turn.

     EXT. ROAD.  CAR.

     Swerves some more curves.  Should be some sense here that a
     similar skyline route would have been taken by Wilson's
     daughter on her final drive.

     INT. WILSON'S CAR.

                         ED
               Why didn't you just kill him, you had the
               chance.

                         WILSON
               That would be too easy.

                         ED
               Too easy?

                         WILSON
               He's gotta know why.

                         ED
               You think a fuckin' guy like that ever
               will?  What more do you want, man?

     Suddenly out of nowhere -- (a side street) -- BAM! -- another
     car shoots out to cut them off, sideswiping them.

     EXT. ROAD.

     Wilson's car SKIDS into a spin from the impact.

     THE OTHER CAR

     It's Avery.  Chased them via a shortcut down the mountain.
     Now jumps out of his car, levels a shotgun at them and pumps
     off a BLAST.

     WILSON'S CAR

     BAM! -- the trunk pops open as the car rights itself.  Avery
     FIRES again, but the upended trunk is a kind of shield,
     deflecting the shot.

     INT. WILSON'S CAR.

     Despite the fact that Ed is still in the driver's seat (and
     managed rather skillfully to avoid crashing) -- Wilson acts
     like he's not there, grabs the steering wheel, jams the car
     into reverse, virtually sitting on Ed as he pounds his own
     foot onto the gas pedal -- and with his ferocious eyes
     monitoring the door-mirror, steamrolls the car backwards
     towards Avery.

     EXT. ROAD.

     Wilson reverses his car like a speeding tank:  SMASHING into
     Avery's car.  Pushing it right off the edge of the road.

     AVERY

     Falls backwards to the ground as he gets the hell out of the
     way.

     WILSON

     Jumps out of his car.  Gun drawn.  Advancing on Avery with it
     pointed.

     AVERY'S CAR

     CRASHING through underbrush down the steep bank of the
     hillside.

     WILSON'S FACE

     SOUND of the divebombing car OVER.  Another pointed echo of
     his daughter's fate.

     AVERY

     Their eyes meet momentarily.  And before Wilson can shoot,
     Avery rolls over the edge of the road himself.

     ED

     Calls frantically to Wilson from their car.

                         ED
               C'mon, man!  C'mon!

     SIRENS in the distance.

     WILSON

     That consuming rage overtaken him again for a second.  But
     the exigencies of the moment snap him out of it.

     WILSON

     Turns on a dime, goes back to the car.  Before he's halfway
     in, Ed's driving them away again.  Trunk at the back BANGING
     up and down, up and down.

     AVERY

     Pulls himself back up to the road.  Brushing himself off.
     Looking the way they went.

     He gently tosses his shotgun down into some thick brush where
     maybe he'll retrieve it later.

     EXT. VALENTINE'S HOUSE.  AFTERNOON.

     Avery returns, sweating, walking back up the road to where
     all the action is.  Party guests milling outside, waiting for
     their cars so they can leave.  A fire truck, a police car.
     SMOKE pouring out of Valentine's garage.

     Valentine finishes talking to a couple of COPS.  Walks over to
     Avery.

                         AVERY
               You should have let me do the talking.

                         VALENTINE
               Why, because you're my security
               consultant?
                   (insecure)
               This cocksucker nearly burnt my house
               down.

                         AVERY
                   (more concerned about police
                    presence)
               What did you tell them.

     Valentine blows air, runs a hand through his hair.

                         VALENTINE
               I told them a long-time employee flipped
               out.  Had a drug problem, refused
               counselling.  Set the garage on fire,
               then committed suicide.  One of my
               "guests" tried to stop him -- but how do
               you stop Gordon.

     In this context meaning how did that rangy Englishman do it.

                         VALENTINE
               I mean, Gordon must weigh a good four
               hundred pounds.

                         AVERY
               Heavier than that now.  But are there any
               drugs in that stomach to back up your
               story.

                         VALENTINE
               As it happens.  I didn't make that part
               up.

                         AVERY
               And where is this guest?  Don't they want
               to interview him.

                         VALENTINE
               I don't know everyone here.  He was so
               traumatized he split.
                   (another notion)
               Maybe he was Gordon's pusher.

     Avery stares at Valentine.  Impressed at him thinking on his
     feet.

                         VALENTINE
               Where do you think he is, Mike.

                         AVERY
                   (already turning)
               We'll find him.

                         VALENTINE
                   (stops him)
               No.  I mean.  Not even your people should
               be involved.  Right?  It's too close now.

                         AVERY
               You could use a few of my prime
               shitkickers up here.

                         VALENTINE
               You think I'm staying?

                         AVERY
               There's already gonna be talk about how
               people close to you keep falling into
               canyons.

                         VALENTINE
               Well, can we make it one more.  Nowhere
               the fuck near me.

     He's being glib, but he's being serious.  His open-handed
     gesture inquiring of Avery:  are you up to the task?

                         AVERY
               I have other resources.

     He turns to go.

     EXT. VALENTINE'S HOUSE.  CANYON.  AFTERNOON.

     The huge dead bulk of Gordon hoisted back up to the deck by a
     paramedic team.

     INT. VALENTINE'S HOUSE.

     Valentine comes back in.  In the living room beyond, Adhara
     stands anxiously, where she's been waiting for him.  Cops
     visible outside on the deck, peering over the edge.

     VALENTINE

     Heading that way.  Then stops.  Backtracks.  Something
     peripherally had caught his eye and he returns to it.  His
     wall of photographs.

     AN EMPTY FRAME

     The one that had contained the picture of Jenny.

                                                               CUT.

     INT. WILSON'S CAR.  AFTERNOON.

     Safely down the hill.  Driving away in traffic, Ed calmer
     now.

     WILSON

     Pulls the rolled-up photograph of his daughter out of his
     jacket and looks at it.

                                                               CUT.

     INT. POOL HALL.  NIGHT.

     Two characters stand, leaning, against a back wall.  Staring
     ahead, without purpose.  Halfheartedly watching a game of
     pool in progress.  Just hanging out.  Strange, threatening
     characters.  One of them is young.  Lean, hungry-looking.
     STACY is his name.  A shrewd, scheming kid.  But definitely a
     little unhinged.  Weirder is his companion.  UNCLE JOHN.  The
     title isn't one of courtesy.  He's an actual blood relative.
     Maybe 25 years older than Stacy.  But intellectually younger.
     Physically, much bigger.  The man is huge.  Nevertheless, the
     safer of the two -- until Stacy tells him otherwise.  Way
     they're standing next to each other suggests the ease they
     feel in each other's company.  Tight bond.  They're good
     buddies.

     AVERY

     Walks in.  Stops to look around.  Spots his two freaks.
     Walks toward them.

     DOORWAY

     A mysterious black man has followed Avery in.  THOMPSON is
     his name.  He hangs back and watches.

     AVERY

     Makes contact.

                         AVERY
               Stacy.

     Stacy turns to see him.  Uncle John looks vacantly.

                         STACY
                   (bored)
               Hey.

                         AVERY
               Come over here.

     That was in the way of an order.  He nods around the corner
     where it's less crowded.  Stacy stops Uncle John from
     following, and goes after Avery.

     THOMPSON

     At the bar.  Keeping his eye on them.

     AVERY

     Speaks softly.  Alone with Stacy.

                         AVERY
               How they goin', kid?

                         STACY
               Not bad.

                         AVERY
               How'd you like to kill someone for me?

                         STACY
               Okay.

     Avery gives him an envelope.

                         AVERY
               Same as last time -- the rest after.

                         STACY
                   (pockets it)
               Where do we go?

                         AVERY
               When you find the guy, you'll know.

                         STACY
               What shit is this.  I just do it.  I
               don't prepare it.

                         AVERY
               I'll point you in the right direction,
               but you'll have to take it to the end-
               zone.  He's a hit-and-run gunman -- I
               figure he's not cruising the Polo Lounge.

                         STACY
               This is un-fucking professional.

                         AVERY
               See, a successful man like me has
               limitations -- I lose touch at a street
               level.  So I have to depend on a smart
               boy like you who's closer to the nitty
               and the gritty than I am.

                         STACY
               Fuck you, Mr. whatever-your-name is.
               This is a lifestyle I embrace.

                         AVERY
               That's why I'm letting you take care of
               this.  I'm the one with appearances to
               maintain.  But who gives a shit about
               you?  Not even God.

                                                               CUT.

     INT. WILSON'S MOTEL.  NIGHT.

     Wilson on the bed.  Watching TV (ACCESS HOLLYWOOD!).  KNOCK
     at door.  He turns down the TV.  Takes a .45 from the springs
     under the bed.  Looks carefully through the peephole in the
     door.

     Opens it.  Elaine has come to visit.  Lets her in.  After
     closing the door resumes his position on the bed.

     Elaine looks around.

                         ELAINE
               I was in the neighborhood.  I come down
               here quite a bit.  Watch the planes
               taking off.
                   (re this motel)
               Study the architecture of early David
               Lynch.

     But she doesn't really have it in her to be ironic right now.
     Leans back against the door.

     Wilson remains silent.  He's done the same to Elaine now that
     he did to Ed.  Almost magically induced her to a confessional
     verge.

     Elaine, too, isn't sure she wants to be complicit in this
     revenge tragedy.  But here goes:

                         ELAINE
               Jenny was supposed to come to my place
               that night.  She called me, asked if she
               could come over.  She and Terry had been
               -- having some trouble.  Lately.  I don't
               know about what.  On this occasion, it
               reached some sort of crisis point.

                         WILSON
               She told you all about my details but not
               about his.  Lovely.

                         ELAINE
               She'd never called me like that before.
               She sounded more ... pissed off -- angry --
               than upset or afraid.  But she never
               turned up.  I called the house but only
               got the answer machine.  When they found
               her ... she'd been going the wrong way.
               Not the direction she'd have gone if
               she'd been coming to see me.  Or coming
               straight to see me.  Who knows.  Maybe she
               just wanted to drive.

     She looks at Wilson.  Shrugs.  That's it.  That's all.  Isn't
     it?

                         WILSON
                   (measured)
               How did you come to have my address?
               Found it, did you.  Among her things.

                         ELAINE
               You think Terry gave me access to her
               things?  Probably sold her clothes.

                         WILSON
                   (gently urging)
               And how did you get it?

     Elaine looks at him.

                         ELAINE
               She gave me your address.

     Wilson nods.

                         ELAINE (cont'd)
                   (starting to realize)
               Not long before ...
                   (realizing)
               She said if anything ever happened ...
                   (realizes)
               That's how you know.  That's why you're
               so sure.
                   (realization)
               Jenny's telling you.

     She's sitting on the bed now.

                                                               CUT.

     EXT. MEAN STREET.  NIGHT.

     Stacy, putting on a jacket that says "Bomb Hanoi" comes out
     of the pool hall.  Uncle John in tow.

                         UNCLE JOHN
               How much.

                         STACY
               Five thousand.

                         UNCLE JOHN
                   (impressed)
               Hey.

                         STACY
                   (taps pocket)
               I got half.

                         UNCLE JOHN
               Makin' trouble for someone?

                         STACY
               Yeah.

                         UNCLE JOHN
               Which kind?

                         STACY
               The forever kind.

     BEHIND THEM

     Thompson, the mysterious black man, watches them from the
     hall doorway.

                                                               CUT.

     EXT. WILSON'S MOTEL.  MORNING.

     Early.

     INT. WILSON'S ROOM.

     Wilson and Elaine.  Getting dressed.  She's in pantyhose.
     Fastening a bra.  He's got trousers on, reaching for a shirt.

                         WILSON
               How long've you lived here?

     Elaine sits on the bed, fastening her skirt.  Her bra strap
     cuts across her bare back.

                         ELAINE
               This town's been chewing my flesh
               since ... what we now refer to as "the
               early 70's."
                   (thinks back)
               Christ, my past became nostalgia and no
               one even asked me.

                         WILSON
               Early 70's.  I was away.
                   (tries to remember)
               Maidstone.  Possibly Brixton.

                         ELAINE
               These more highlights from the Zagat
               prison guide?

     Wilson looks at her:  she's the one who goes to bed with ex-
     cons.

                         WILSON
               You don't seem bothered.

                         ELAINE
               You don't know how I've compromised my
               standards.

                         WILSON
               Tell us about it.

                         ELAINE
               It's too involved; a lifetime of non-
               involvement.  Anywhere else I'd be an
               interesting little number, here I'm just
               SAG number forty-eight thousand and one.
                   (quickly)
               SAG meaning Screen Actor's Guild.

                         WILSON
               Oh, I was gonna say ...

                         ELAINE
               Still, there have been rewards.  It's
               sunny.  And some of the producers who
               call even have credits.

                         WILSON
               I can see the attraction.

     She glances up at him to try and see how he means that.  Is
     he looking at her or out the window?

                         ELAINE
               What did you do?  To make them take the
               early 70's away from you.

                         WILSON
               A jeweller's up the West End.  We
               tunnelled our way under the shop floor
               from the public lavatory down the road.
               Filthy work.  Trouble was, the bloody
               thing collapsed -- after we'd made the
               grab, 'n all.  Would you Adam n' Eve it.

                         ELAINE
               You mean if they'd nabbed you before you
               actually broke and entered you would only
               have been charged with making a mess.

                         WILSON
               We were lucky to be nicked.  Me and the
               lads went down there Sunday evening, we
               weren't discovered till the Monday.  Good
               job we were still breathing.

                         ELAINE
               It didn't discourage you, though.

                         WILSON
               Hey?

                         ELAINE
               From pursuing your chosen profession.

                         WILSON
               I'll tell ya something:  it made me a
               model prisoner.  Put me right off any
               escape attempts.  Tunnel my way to
               freedom after that experience?  Not
               bloody likely.

                         ELAINE
               I was inside once.  I punched a cop at a
               demo.

                         WILSON
               Did you.  What was that in aid of?

                         ELAINE
               Who remembers.

                         WILSON
               Get seven years, did you?

                         ELAINE
               Overnight.  What about just now?

                         WILSON
               Just now?
                   (playful, goes over, ready for
                    more)
               Overnight?

                         ELAINE
               You have been away.
                   (lies back, regards him
                    carefully)
               Or is all this just new to you?

                         WILSON
               It's true.  Has to be said.  I got off to
               a slow start.

                         ELAINE
               I don't believe it.

                         WILSON
               Honest.  Didn't know where to look till I
               was 21.

                         ELAINE
               Pushing the legal limit even then.

     He stands again, vaguely disappointing her.

                         WILSON
               Me mate introduced me to a woman up the
               street.  Funnily enough, she was married
               to a milkman.  Straight up.  I said,
               "Good is she?  Been around?"  He said,
               "Good?  Listen, mush, it's not that she's
               been around, it's that she's been around
               hell of a long time."

     He laughs uproariously at that.  But the point is:  he's sort
     of complimenting both Elaine and himself.  They've been
     around, had their knocks, they've lasted.  Elaine remains
     unsmiling.

     Still leaning back on her elbows on the bed, in bra, skirt,
     hose, no shoes.  She asks again the question Wilson avoided
     answering.

                         ELAINE
               Your most recent incarceration.  What was
               that for?

     And again he evades the answer she wants.

                         WILSON
               It was for nine years.
                   (buttoning his shirt)
               The last nine years.

                                                               CUT.

     EXT. PACIFIC COAST HIGHWAY.  MORNING.

     For the first time, we see the Pacific coastline.  Impressive.

     And a sleek Italian sports car.  Heading north.

     INT. SPORTS CAR.

     Valentine at the wheel.  Adhara besides him.

                         ADHARA
               I've lived in L.A. all my life, I've
               never done this drive.

                         VALENTINE
               All your life.  That happened while I
               swam the length of my pool.

     Adhara looks back over her shoulder.  Checking the road
     behind.

                         VALENTINE
               What's the matter?

                         ADHARA
               Nothing.  I guess it's hard to pass on
               this road.

                         VALENTINE
               The freeway's faster, but lacks a certain
               majesty.

                         ADHARA
               Just feels like the car behind has been
               following us the longest time.

                         VALENTINE
               I sure hope so.

     INT. THE CAR BEHIND.

     A big utility vehicle.  With Avery in the front passenger
     seat.  And three bodyguards he's brought along to protect
     Valentine.  RICK driving, TOM and LARRY in the back.

                         TOM
               All I'm sayin' is travel time shouldn't
               be the same rate.  Travel time is down
               time, right?  I mean, we're not even in
               the same car as the client.
                   (to Avery)
               You told me the job was at the house.
               When we get to it.  Well, are we shadowing
               the client right now or are we just going
               the same way?  The company I was with in
               Seattle, these distinctions were made.
               Now, I don't dispute him getting the full
               whack.
                   (he means Rick, who's older)
               Seniority and all that.  But if I'm
               getting paid the same hourly rate when
               we're at the house as I am in this car,
               that doesn't sit well with me and I feel
               obliged to say so.  'Cause in Seattle
               what you're paying now for so-called
               travel time was half what we got for
               actual clock-time with the client.  So I
               just feel we should get more when the job
               actually commences.

     After this spineless whining weak-willed sob story, Larry
     just turns to him and says:

                         LARRY
               ... I'd really like to eat your pussy.

                                                               CUT.

     EXT. ELAINE'S NEIGHBORHOOD.  DAY.

     Stacy and Uncle John sitting on a bench in a beach setting
     (though we still don't see the ocean).  Or on some grass,
     maybe, in a little park -- opposite Elaine's building.

     People-watching.  In their own unique way.  Stacy commenting
     on fellow humanity all around them.  TIME CUTS between each
     comment:

                         STACY
                   (after laughing loudly at a
                    handicapped person)
               I believe in mocking the afflicted.  Good
               for 'em.  Makes 'em stronger.

     Uncle John picks at the grass or sand.  As they kill the day.

                         STACY
                   (spotting a woman with a dog)
               Ever take a look at the women who work in
               pet stores?  Wow.

                         STACY
                   (as a fat jogger passes)
               Good luck.

                         STACY
                   (watching someone else go by)
               Jesus, are you gay enough or what.

                         STACY
                   (barely out of earshot of a
                    black woman with dyed blonde
                    hair)
               Very attractive.  Good idea.  Now I
               really want to fuck you.

                         STACY
                   (after a long time in silence,
                    just staring at someone)
               ... you can always tell the ones who'll do
               anal.

                         STACY
                   (regarding some other
                    beachgoers)
               Kinda makes you wonder why more people
               don't put a bullet through their fuckin'
               skulls, doesn't it.

                         STACY
                   (reading a newspaper)
               Looks like they just airbrushed the dick
               out of his mouth.

                         STACY
                   (leaning back on his elbows)
               Why don't they have TV shows about people
               whose daily lives you'd be interested in
               watching.  Y'know.  Like SKINNY LITTLE
               WEAKLING.  Or BIG FAT GUY.  SICK OLD MAN.
               FAMILY OF LOSERS.  Wouldn't that be good?

                         STACY
                   (sitting up)
               Two blacks and a Mexican in a car.  Who's
               driving?

                         UNCLE JOHN
               I don't know.

                         STACY
               The L.A.P.D.

                         STACY
                   (observing a "fast-walker")
               Oh yeah, keep doing that.  That's really
               healthy.

                         STACY
                   (his gaze following another
                    unfortunate)
               Can't you do something about your ass?

                         STACY
                   (his head turning after someone
                    else)
               Other people's lives scare the shit out
               of me.

                         STACY
                   (watching some guy rooting in a
                    trash bin)
               "Homeless" people.  Fuck them.  Remember
               when they were just bums?  Everyone with
               an axe to grind.  Like to grind in their
               face.  Pretty soon there'll be shit-in-
               your-pants rights groups.  Stupidity
               activists.

                         STACY
                   (glad he's who he is and not
                    who he's looking at)
               Wonder what it's like being a dumb guy in
               a dumb suit trying to cross the street.

                         STACY
                   (staring at another sad couple)
               Life sure is a minefield.

                         STACY
                   (clocking another female)
               Look at that one.  She's really been
               used.

                         STACY
                   (in a contemplative mode)
               I'd love to be famous so I could snub
               ordinary people.  Imagine, you're famous,
               you're sitting in a restaurant, some fool
               comes up to you, wants you to sign your
               name on his napkin, his wife is there, it
               would be something these poor saps would
               cherish the rest of their lives, talk
               about to their cretin friends.  Bam!  You
               tell 'em to FUCK OFF!  God, I'd love
               that.

     Suddenly Uncle John speaks.

                         UNCLE JOHN
               Is that her?  I bet that's her.

     Stacy turns.

     POV

     Across the street, Elaine comes out of her building.  (We're
     supposing this is an apartment building somewhat worth living
     in that has outdoor parking of some kind, visible from the
     street, or only street parking.)

                                                               CUT.

     EXT. SOME STREET.  DAY.

     Elaine's car on the move.  Stacy and Uncle John in a car
     following.

     INT. ELAINE'S CAR.

     Going somewhere.  Unaware of the creeps in her wake.

     INT. STACY/UNCLE JOHN'S CAR.

     An "8x10" of Elaine on their back seat.  Another picture of
     her on a page torn from a "Player's Directory."

                         UNCLE JOHN
               Maybe she doesn't even know the English
               guy.

                         STACY
                   (driving)
               Avery said she was tight with his
               daughter.

                         UNCLE JOHN
               That don't mean nothin'.

     Stacy knows better than to argue with a moron.

                         UNCLE JOHN
               She's nice lookin'.

                         STACY
               So what.

                         UNCLE JOHN
               I dunno.  I just said she's nice lookin'.

                         STACY
               And I said so what.  You think she's any
               happier?

                         UNCLE JOHN
               What d'you mean, any happier?

                         STACY
               Any happier than any other asshole in
               life.

     Pause.

                         UNCLE JOHN
               I dunno.  I never met her.

     INT. SOUND STUDIO.  DAY.

     On screen:  A BEAUTIFUL MODEL -- but speaking in ELAINE'S
     VOICE.

     ELAINE

     At a mic.  Wearing headphones.  Matching her voice to the
     model's lip movements.  Looping this commercial or whatever
     it is.

     INT. HALLWAY.

     Wilson.  Comes to a window where he can see Elaine inside in
     the sound-proofed studio.

     INT. SOUND STUDIO.  DAY.

     Wilson and Elaine talk while technicians change reels.

                         ELAINE
               -- they want Southern, I do Southern,
               they want Midwest, I do Midwest, they
               want tall, blonde, and twenty-two, I'm
               shit out of luck.
                   (pauses)
               One thing I can't do is English.
               Americans can't.  Shouldn't even try.
               And Laurence Olivier couldn't do us.

                         WILSON
               You ever been to London?

                         ELAINE
               Only in the movies.

                         WILSON
               I've 'ardly ever left it.

                         ELAINE
               Yeah, well, you're here now --
                   (re Wilson's accent)
               -- where hurricanes hardly ever happen.

                         WILSON
               I've got the hang of the driving.  Found
               this place all right.

                         ELAINE
               Stick with me, kid.  Looks big when you
               get here but you can cover it in five
               minutes.

     Beat.

                         ELAINE (cont'd)
               So, is there anybody in your family who's
               not a criminal?

                         WILSON
               Not that I recall.

                         ELAINE
               What about your grandmother?

                         WILSON
               Nah -- she was married to me grandad --
               he was as bent as a boomerang -- used to
               make knuckle-dusters down the shop.
               Crafty old sod.

                         ELAINE
               He alive to see this?

                         WILSON
                   (shakes head)
               Dropped dead in the stalls in the Odeon,
               Muswell Hill.  Watching Doris Day.

                         ELAINE
               What'd your father do?

                         WILSON
               Black market during the war.

     Elaine shakes her head.

                         ELAINE
               I guess you're just habitual.

                         WILSON
               You sound like my fucking probation
               officer.

                         ELAINE
               Won't he be looking for you about now?

                         WILSON
               Good luck to him.  He couldn't find his
               prick if he didn't wear Y-fronts.

                         ELAINE
               Minor officials bother you, don't they?

                         WILSON
               Do us a favor.  Can't even go have a
               slash without 'em saying, what're you
               going in there for?

     EXT. ELAINE'S BUILDING.  DAY.

     Elaine and Wilson enter.  Stacy not far behind.  Catches
     outside gate before it slams shut.

     INT. ELAINE'S BUILDING.  DAY.

     Wilson and Elaine turn the corner into the corridor
     approaching her apartment door.  Pause to kiss.  Walk closer.

     And Stacy appears at the other end of the hall.  Both arms
     stretched out with the .38 at the end of them.

                         STACY
               Hi, kids.

     Starts to squeeze off a shot.  As Wilson pushes Elaine to the
     floor.  As another SHOT rings out from further along the hall
     behind Stacy.  Catching him across the cheek.  Only skimming
     him.  But knocking him down.  Bullet chipping the wall.

     UNCLE JOHN

     Across from Stacy.  Freezes, his own gun in hand.

     AT THE STAIRS

     Three BLACK GUYS.  Including Thompson.  They approach.  Guns
     pointed at Stacy and Uncle John.

     WILSON

     Hand on his .45 now.  But a fourth Black Guy coming up behind
     him.  Wilson lowers the .45.

     ELAINE

     Flattened herself back against a wall.  Petrified.

     STACY

     Sits on the floor.  Holds his hurt face.  Thompson walks over
     and picks up Stacy's gun.  One of the other blacks relieves a
     reluctant Uncle John of his.

                         THOMPSON
                   (stops at Wilson)
               Come with us.

     If there's any doubt whether Wilson will -- one of the blacks
     gently puts the muzzle of a gun to Elaine's head.  Cocks the
     hammer.

     They all go off down the stairwell.  Except Stacy and Uncle
     John.

     Hit men wondering what hit them.

                                                               CUT.

     INT. ROOM.  DAY.

     Like Wilson's motel room, another version of a cell.

     A small window, high up.  Bricks and debris around the floor.
     And Wilson and Elaine.  Sitting, leaning against opposite
     stone walls.

                         ELAINE
               Tell me you wouldn't prefer a steady
               income.

     Wilson takes a cigarette pack from a pocket.  Lights himself
     one.  Then tosses the stuff over to Elaine.

                         WILSON
               I got a steady income -- I'm on the dole.

                         ELAINE
                   (lights up)
               A leech on the welfare state in addition.
               You don't miss a trick.

                         WILSON
               I fiddle it.  They got me down as an
               immigrant with five kids.

     Elaine sort of shares a laugh at that.

                         ELAINE
               Yeah ... Jenny spoke fondly of her
               imaginary siblings.

     Though real ones might have been nice.  This an unspoken
     thought between them.

                         ELAINE (cont'd)
               Do you remember the last time you saw
               her?

                         WILSON
               Last time might as well've been the
               first.  I remember all the times, don't
               I.  Watching her grow up --
                   (finding the word)
               in increments.

                         ELAINE
               She told me you were a ghost in her life.
               Daddy the friendly ghost.  Coming back to
               haunt her.

                         WILSON
               Well, she twigged by the time she was
               eight or nine that daddy wasn't in the
               Royal Marines or doing scientific
               research in the jungles of Borneo or
               playing Iago in a worldwide tour of
               OTHELLO.

                         ELAINE
               Still, you could never ... do what she
               wanted.

     Wilson shakes his head.

                         WILSON
               She used to tell me she'd turn me in.
                   (tries to laugh about it)
               Little kid.  Ten year old.  "If you're
               naughty, Dad, I'll tell on ya."  She
               didn't want me sent down again, see.
               When I was planning some job.  "I'll tell
               'em, Dad, I promise I will.  Here, look,
               I'm calling the Old Bill right now" --
               picking up the telephone.  I can see her,
               the phone in her hand.  Became a sort of
               joke between us.  Only it wasn't a joke.

                         ELAINE
               She never would have turned you in, not
               in a million years.

                         WILSON
               I know that.  But as time went on ...
               well, it wasn't a joke, was it?  She had
               a feeling about it -- about the last job
               -- how long I'd get the hook for.  Said
               she wouldn't be there this time when I
               got out.

     DOOR opens.  Thompson.  Gun in hand.

                                                               CUT.

     INT. HALLWAY.  DAY.

     Thompson leads Wilson past a row of windows.  Dockyards,
     harbor activity outside.  Toward a door with things
     stencilled on it.  One of them:  US DEPT. OF CUSTOMS.

     INT. OFFICE.

     A man named FEATHER.  Black.  Half sitting on the edge of a
     table.  Wilson is shown in.

     Wilson at the door.  Sizes Feather up at a glance.

                         WILSON
               This is where I come in.

     He walks confidently in.  Outside, through the window, an
     image of a foreign sports car being hoisted in the air by a
     crane.

     There's a chair.  Wilson sits in it.

     Feather squints a little.  Seems ready to listen to whatever
     Wilson has to say.

                         WILSON (cont'd)
               How's it going, squire, all right?  Now
               listen -- when I was in the nick --
               second time, it was -- no, third.  Third
               stretch, yeah.  There was this screw had
               it in for me.  That geezer was top of my
               list.  Two years after I was slung, I saw
               him.  He was sitting on a bench in
               Holland Park.  There was no one else
               about.  I coulda gone up behind him and
               snapped his fucking neck.  But I left it.
               Coulda nobbled him, but I didn't.  'Cos
               what I thought I wanted wasn't what I
               wanted.  What I thought I was thinking
               about was something else.  This berk on
               the bench wasn't worth my time.  See what
               I mean?  It didn't matter.  It meant sod
               all in the end.

     Feather has been listening to this, expressionless.  Now he
     raises a finger as if there's a point he wants clarified.

                         FEATHER
               There's one thing I don't understand.
                   (wants to make this clear)
               The thing I don't understand ... is every
               motherfucking thing you're saying.

                         WILSON
               Look, mush, you're the guv'nor here, I
               can see that, I'm on your manor now,
               right.  So there's no need to get out of
               your pram.  I'm Johnny-come-lately to all
               this.  Whatever the bollocks between you
               and this slag Valentine, it's got nothing
               to do with me.  I don't wanna know.

                         FEATHER
               Well, I'll tell you.  I believe this
               Valentine screwed me out of a fair sum of
               money.

                         WILSON
               I can well believe it.  I'm sure he has
               done, son.  He's about as straight as a
               dog's hind leg.

                         FEATHER
               But I can't be sure.  I don't even know
               who he is.  He's too insulated.  Too many
               layers around him.

                         WILSON
               Your guess is as good as mine, mate.  I'm
               here on another matter entirely.

                         FEATHER
                   (moves to window)
               Yeah, I guess you are.

                         WILSON
               Good job your lot showed up when they did
               or it would've been me for the high jump.

                         FEATHER
               That dude who works for Valentine.  He's
               the one sent those guys after you.  You
               know that.

                         WILSON
               Yeah.  Shouldn't wonder.  Must've done.

                         FEATHER
               So what's your beef, pal?

                         WILSON
               Nothing financial.  Strictly personal.
                   (moves to window)
               I can see how all this import-export
               malarkey might give rise to confusion
               where I'm concerned.  A foreigner,
               showing up unexpectedly, like.

                         FEATHER
                   (looks at him)
               It was you.  Downtown.

                         WILSON
                   (all innocent)
               Eh?

                         FEATHER
               Because that wasn't anything to do with
               me.  And suspicion has been cast in my
               direction.
                   (pondering)
               Didn't make any sense.  Choosing those
               shitheads over me, cutting me out of the
               deal, then screwing them over too.

                         WILSON
               No, I can reassure you on that point.
               Valentine was just as surprised by that
               turn of events as you.

                         FEATHER
               He'd already grabbed more than his
               allotted cut.  Didn't think he'd be so
               bold as to take all of it.

                         WILSON
               All of what?

                         FEATHER
               Of the deal, man.

                         WILSON
               Oh, yeah, right.  The deal.

                         FEATHER
               But if you're mad at him too and he's mad
               at you ... that must make us pals.

                         WILSON
               As you prefer, squire.  As you prefer.

                         FEATHER
                   (weary of his life)
               In which case I'll just do what I usually
               do.

                         WILSON
               And that is?

                         FEATHER
               What am I doing?

     He's standing at the window, staring out.  As if Wilson isn't
     even in the room any more.  A ship being loaded out there.
     Inspectors with clipboards.  Trucks like the ones we saw at
     that warehouse downtown.

                         WILSON
               Looking the other way.
                   (turns to go)
               Gotcha.

                                                               CUT.

     EXT. INN.  DAY.

     Along the way up the coast.

     Through a window we SEE Valentine and Adhara enjoying a
     pleasant lunch.

     The bodyguards hang out by the cars outside with fast food
     bags and drinks.

                         TOM
                   (to Rick)
               I mean, how much are you getting?  Just
               as a point of interest.  See, I didn't
               realize there was a sliding scale.

     AVERY

     At a payphone.  His idiots in the background.  Dials a
     number.

     INT. POOL HALL.  DAY.

     Stacy.  Nasty bruise on his cheek.  Takes a cue off the rack.
     Chalks up.

                         STACY
               Straight rotation, no shit, call your
               shot.

                         UNCLE JOHN
               Lemme break.

     They're playing against a couple of other creeps.

                         CREEP
               You broke last time.

                         STACY
               Let him break - he likes to break.

                         CREEP
               Fuck you.

                         STACY
               I wouldn't talk.

                         CREEP
               Huh?

                         STACY
               I saw your mother on the Strip last
               night.  She went up to three guys, said
               she'd like 'em to stick one in each,
               know what I mean?

     Creep rushes Stacy.  But doesn't get past Uncle John.  Who
     drops him with one punch.  Flooring him between two pool
     tables.  Stacy then goes over.  Supports himself with a hand
     on each table, swings his boot into the thug's face.

                         BARTENDER
                   (calls)
               Stacy.

     Stacy looks.  Bartender holds up phone.  Stacy goes over.

                         BARTENDER (cont'd)
               I can do without you inhibiting my
               business.

     Stacy just scowls, takes the phone.

                         STACY
                   (into phone)
               Yeah.

     UNCLE JOHN

     Breaks.

     STACY

     Hangs up.  Goes back to Uncle John.  Picks up his cue again.

                         STACY (cont'd)
               We've been fired.

                                                               CUT.

     EXT. VALENTINE'S HOUSE.  L.A.  DAY

     Someone we've never seen before and will never see again
     stands in Valentine's driveway.  His name is FIELDING.

     A car comes up.  Another guy, GRAMMS, sits in it.  He waits.
     Eventually Fielding walks over.

                         GRAMMS
                   (re:  the burnt garage)
               Valentine had himself a party, I hear.

                         FIELDING
                   (by rote)
               My client has already given a statement
               regarding yesterday's events.

                         GRAMMS
               A statement?  I wouldn't mind getting a
               statement.  You see, my client -- the
               United States Government -- would love to
               get a statement about a few of the deals
               going down with your client.

                         FIELDING
               Deals?  My client is involved in any
               number of deals at any given moment.
               You'd have to be more specific.

                         GRAMMS
               Your client have a deal in Long Beach?
               How about downtown?  There's some folks
               there -- oh, wait, they're all dead.  Any
               of this ring a bell?

                         FIELDING
               My client is an entrepreneur.  I am his
               lawyer, not his business manager.

                         GRAMMS
               So you wouldn't have any idea how your
               client continues to make so much fucking
               money.

                         FIELDING
               He's always been very forward-thinking.
               He invested wisely.

                         GRAMMS
               Where is he now?

                         FIELDING
               He had urgent business in the north.

     Gramms just laughs.  Just laughs and laughs.  And we leave him
     laughing.  And Fielding not.

                                                               CUT.

     INT. RESTAURANT.  KITCHEN.  DAY.

     Ed takes off an apron, heads out the door.  It's clear that

     Anglo, turns, wondering where he's going.  Over this we hear:

               I was gonna be in that Michael Mann

               We coulda used the other two-and-a-half
               grand.

                         STACY
               There's more than a measly few grand in
               this.

                         UNCLE JOHN
               There is?

                         STACY
               Something's on.

                         UNCLE JOHN
               What?

                         STACY
               I happen to know more about Mr. Whatever-
               his-name-is than he thinks I know about
               him and his operation.

                         UNCLE JOHN
               You do?

                         STACY
               You bet.

                         UNCLE JOHN
               Like what.

                         STACY
               Like he'd never hire me for real.  Not
               week-to-week.  I don't have the
               credentials.  He thinks I'm just a
               sociopath, someone he can turn to when he
               needs "plausible denial."

                         UNCLE JOHN
               Well, we blew it, didn't we?  He ain't
               wrong.

                         STACY
                   (savage mimicry)
               "He ain't wrong."  Listen, I know this
               asshole who did just go to work for him.
               Full-time.  And this dickhead's parents
               just told me he took a road trip up the
               coast.  That's the type of individual gets
               hired, someone who'll shoot his mouth off
               to his family while on the job.

                         UNCLE JOHN
               I don't get it.

                         STACY
               I don't know who that English guy is.
               Some kind of --
                   (finding the word)
               -- courier or something.  Maybe a seller.
               Maybe a buyer.  But Mr. Avery wanted him,
               those jigs wanted him -- and I betcha
               there's a briefcase somewhere.

                         UNCLE JOHN
               What's in it?

                         STACY
                   (shrugs)
               Drugs?  Cash?  Both if we're lucky.

                         UNCLE JOHN
               How we gonna get that lucky?

                         STACY
               While they're all fucking each other

                         ED
               I've been wondering something.

                         WILSON
               Again?

                         ED
               Do you have any friends, man?

                         WILSON
               Yeah, I suppose.  Call 'em that, yeah.
               Down the boozer Saturday night.  Meet
               some of the lads.

                         ELAINE
                   (a little more pointed)
               Friends and colleagues.

                         WILSON
               You can't count on very many people,
               that's the trouble.  Number of times a
               decent job's been cocked up ...

                         ELAINE
               Poor baby.

     Little back-seat sarcasm there.  Wilson looks kind of bitter.

                         WILSON
               Useless gits.  I was gonna do the Post
               Office once.

                         ED
               What post office?

                         WILSON
               The lot.  The whole British bloody Post
               Office.  I had a brilliant plan -- all
               worked out -- work of genius, it was.
               Could I get anybody interested?  No --
               they're too busy pinching orange squash
               from the milkman.  Lazy sods.  Jumble
               sale on in Watford, they'll be up at the
               crack of dawn.

                         ELAINE
               You're just on a higher plane, Wilson.

                         WILSON

     EXT. HOUSE.  BIG SUR.  DAY.

     An impressive clifftop dwelling.  Isolated on a winding road.
     On a beautiful promontory overlooking the sea.  Valentine
     RINGS the DOORBELL (actually CHIME).  It's opened by his ex-
     wife.  SUSAN.  Very well-maintained.  50-something.
     Surprised to see him.  But not overjoyed.

                         VALENTINE
               Hello there.

                         SUSAN
               What are you doing here?

                         VALENTINE
               Exercising my visitation rights.

                         SUSAN
               Since when?

                         VALENTINE
               I miss my kids.

                         SUSAN
               They're at college.  Or doesn't your
               accountant even tell you where the money
               goes anymore.

     Valentine goes inside.

     INT. HOUSE.

     He looks around.  She doesn't shut the door.

                         VALENTINE
               You've made it ... brighter.

                         SUSAN
               I don't want you here, Terry.

                         VALENTINE
               Sure you do.

     He turns to look at her.  Smiles.  Somehow it doesn't work on
     her.  One of the reasons she divorced him.  Just one.  She
     sighs.  Resigned to his presence.  Starts to close the door.

                         VALENTINE (cont'd)
               Don't shut the door -- I have people with
               me.

     Now she gets it.

                         SUSAN
               What kind of trouble are you in?

                         VALENTINE
               No trouble.

     Susan SEES Adhara get out of the sporty car parked in the
     drive and stand against it in a posture of younger chick
     defiance.

                         SUSAN
               Surely you can think of somewhere else to
               take one of your chippies for a quick
               getaway.

                         VALENTINE
               Susan.

     He actually puts his hands on her arms.  To hold her firm
     while he locks onto her eyes.  And doesn't smile.

                         VALENTINE (cont'd)
               I just need ... somewhere remote.  Away
               from L.A.  For a couple of days.
                   (now the kicker)
               I pay for this house too.

     Susan reads him.  He's not claiming ownership rights.  He's
     telling her this house, because of the connection to him, is
     a target of some kind.

                         SUSAN
               What have you done?

     The Land Cruiser pulls up outside.  Avery emerges, comes
     over, comes in.  Susan notes the bodyguards out there as well.

                         AVERY
                   (to Valentine)
               We weren't followed.
                   (to Susan)
               Susan.

     Valentine lets Susan go.  Knowing she's now speechless at
     what's turned into, as far as she's concerned, a home
     invasion.

                         VALENTINE
                   (moving, looking around)
               Where's ... what's-his-name -- Fred --

                         SUSAN
               -- You know his name is Frank.

                         VALENTINE
               Is he here?

                         SUSAN
               You know I don't live with him.

                         VALENTINE
               Go to him.  Go to his studio, or writers
               workshop or artists colony, Esselin
               retreat, nudist camp --

                         SUSAN
               Are you finished?

                         VALENTINE
               In a couple of days this whole thing --

                         SUSAN
               Who's looking for you?

                         VALENTINE
               Go now.

     Encouraging, if not in fact ushering, her towards a bedroom.

                         SUSAN
               It's been five minutes and I'm packing to
               leave again.  I can't believe this.

                         VALENTINE
               That's right, your life is Shit, and I'm
               to blame.  It's that simple.

     That does it.  Susan turns on him.

                         SUSAN
               It is that simple.  I blame you for
               everything.  Losing inhibitions and
               chicks without bras didn't have to lead
               to hardcore porno in every American
               household:  that was you.  The first on
               your block to turn on a camera in a hot
               tub and peddle it to your friends.  A
               little recreational pot didn't inevitably
               have to lead to the eventual devastation
               of the inner cities:  you made that
               happen, the first time you bought a
               bigger stash than you yourself meant to
               smoke.  It happened when you made your
               first buck hyping some so-called "event"
               that was over before it began or marketed
               some "product" whose only value was its
               instant disposability.  You were the
               first person to see there was a lot of
               money to be made selling Navajo rugs --
               you've even stolen from the fucking
               Indians!  You looked at Charlie Manson
               when all he had to show for himself was a
               guitar instead of a knife and saw another
               merry prankster, the freedom of the
               frontier.  Your pal here --
                   (Avery)
               -- He saw gated communities.  Rich people
               coming to him with their money, terrified
               of what people like you had left of this
               society.  Why invest in a marriage and
               children when you had him?  He's your
               oracle.  But you couldn't even trust in
               friendship, could you?  Still he's the
               dog you call for its dinner.  Because
               everything that might once have been fun
               or nice or sweet you had to turn mean and
               cold and sour.  That was your "genius,"
               Terry.  Haven't you read your own press?

                                                               CUT.

     EXT. MOTEL.  EVENING.

     Wilson and his friends pull in.  Get out of the car.
     Stretch.

                         ELAINE
                   (finding herself at another
                    shithole)
               What is it, you just like the reassuring
               smell of disinfectant?

     Wilson just heads for the motel office.  Elaine and Ed follow
     a little distance behind.

                         ED
               Hey, Elaine.  You even know what he's
               saying half the time?

                         ELAINE
               No, but I know what he means.

                                                               CUT.

     EXT. DECK.  BIG SUR HOUSE.  NIGHT.

     Adhara sways in a hammock.  Staring at Valentine.  Wanting to
     know what the hell is going on.

     Valentine stands smoking at the rail, looking out over the
     dark sea.  Ignoring Adhara.  Avery sits at a table.
     Bodyguards visible inside the house.

                         VALENTINE
                   (finally, to Avery)
               Do any of these guys cook?

                                                               CUT.

     EXT. MOTEL PORCH.  EVENING.

     Wilson at the car.  Elaine and Ed watching.

     Ed has gathered that something has developed between Wilson
     and Elaine.  The way she's looking at Wilson.

                         ED
               ... Reminds me of Jennifer.

                         ELAINE
                   (barely perceptible nod)
               Hard to miss.

     Ed sighs.  Awkward.

                         ED
               I thought maybe you just came for the
               ride.

                         ELAINE
               I'd rather be with him than without him.
               I don't want to be found dead in L.A.

     Wilson walks back to them.  Looking at Ed as if to say, ready
     to go?  At her as if to say ... maybe farewell.

     EXT. VALENTINE HOUSE.  NIGHT.

     Tableau.  Evening has descended.  Surfaces glisten from a
     light drizzling rain.

     INT. VALENTINE HOUSE, BEDROOM.  NIGHT.

     Adhara, dressing.  Behind her, outside, way out of focus, a
     figure slithers by.

     INT. VALENTINE HOUSE, LIVING ROOM.  NIGHT.

     Valentine and Avery sit watching TV (CELEBRITY REPORT!).  Tom
     is behind them in the kitchen, flipping through Marie Claire
     magazine.

     VALENTINE

     Turns to look through the sliding glass doors.

     HIS POV

     Beyond the deck stands Larry, his back to us, facing the
     ocean.

     EXT. VALENTINE HOUSE.  BACK YARD.  NIGHT.

     Looking toward the house, Larry in the foreground, facing us.
     He takes a bite from a cinnamon granola bar, then looks at it
     unhappily as he chews.

                         LARRY
               Fuck.

     EXT. VALENTINE HOUSE, ANOTHER ANGLE.  NIGHT.

     Looking at the house from the top of the hill.  Rick stands
     in the driveway next to Valentine's car, smoking a cigarette.

     REVERSE ANGLE

     Wilson and Ed watching him.  Wilson nods his head to the
     left, and Ed moves in that direction.  Wilson moves quietly
     off to the right.

     INT. VALENTINE HOUSE.  LIVING ROOM.  NIGHT.

     Valentine and Avery, still watching TV.

                         VALENTINE
                   (re:  the channel)
               Check the news.

     Avery starts looking around.

                         AVERY
               Where's the remote?

     Suddenly, we hear a CAR ALARM.  Tom looks up from his
     magazine.  Valentine looks to Avery, who shakes his head:
     It's nothing.

     EXT. BIG SUR HOUSE.  DRIVEWAY.  NIGHT.

     Rick turns and looks up the driveway toward the sound.  He
     puts his cigarette out.

     EXT. BIG SUR HOUSE.  BACK YARD.  NIGHT.

     Larry has turned toward the sound as well.  Through a
     partially obscured side entrance, he sees Rick walking up the
     driveway.

     EXT. BIG SUR HOUSE.  DRIVEWAY.  NIGHT.

     Rick walks away from us, toward the vehicle (the Land Cruiser
     they drove here) parked up the driveway.  We lose sight of
     him as he crosses to the driver's side.  The alarm goes off.
     We hold for several beats.  He doesn't emerge.

     INT. BIG SUR HOUSE.  LIVING ROOM.  NIGHT.

     Valentine and Avery are still looking for the remote.  Avery
     stops, his attention drawn to the fact that he hasn't heard
     anything from Larry.  He crosses to the window.

     HIS POV

     The driveway, car at the top partially visible.  No sign of
     Rick.

     AVERY

     His brow furrows.

     VALENTINE

     Notices this, looks out toward the backyard.

     HIS POV

     Same as before, except Larry isn't there.

     VALENTINE

     Moves to the sliding glass door to get a better look at the
     deck and back yard.  Still no Larry.

                         VALENTINE
               Where's Larry?

     AVERY

     Leaves the window and moves to Valentine.  Tom has joined
     them.  After a beat:

                         AVERY
               Turn all the lights out.  I'll get Adhara.

     Tom begins looking for the light switches.

                         VALENTINE
               What's happening?

     Avery is already heading for the bedroom.

                         AVERY
               Stay away from the windows.

     EXT. BIG SUR HOUSE.  BACK YARD.  NIGHT.

     Tableau.  Avery exits the kitchen and takes the surrounding
     porch to the bedroom.  Are we seeing this from someone's POV?

     INT. BIG SUR HOUSE.  BEDROOM.  NIGHT.

     Adhara, finished dressing, looking at herself in the mirror.
     The lights behind her go off.  She turns to see Avery coming
     toward her to turn off the lights by the mirror.

                         ADHARA
               Uh, you've heard of knocking?

                         AVERY
               I need you to come with me.

                         ADHARA
               Why, what --

     He takes her by the arm.  Firmly, but not roughly.

                         AVERY
               Please.

     She sees in his expression that something is up.

                         ADHARA
               Okay.

     INT. BIG SUR HOUSE.  LIVING ROOM.  NIGHT.

     Tom and Valentine have finally found the light switches, and
     the room is dark.  Valentine moves slowly to the window,
     takes a tentative peek.

     HIS POV

     The driveway.  Hard to see.  Is there something moving out by
     the shed?

                         AVERY
                   (off)
               I thought I said stay away from the
               window.

     AVERY

     Entering the kitchen with Adhara in tow.  He brings her
     around behind the counter.

                         AVERY
               Everybody in the kitchen.

     Valentine and Tom move to join Avery and Adhara.

                         AVERY
               Behind the counter.

     Everyone moves behind the large counter in the center of the
     kitchen and crouches down.  They have a wall behind them and
     all the windows in front of them.

                         ADHARA
                   (scared)
               What's going on?

     Avery and Tom have drawn their guns.

                         VALENTINE
               We think someone is here.

                         ADHARA
               We think?

                         VALENTINE
               We can't find ...
                   (what are their names?)
               ... two of our guys.

                         TOM
                   (fucking typical)
               Larry and Rick.

                         ADHARA
               Did somebody call the cops?

     Tom snorts.  Avery looks at Valentine:  Haven't you told this
     girl anything?

                         VALENTINE
               No.

                         ADHARA
               Why not?

                         VALENTINE
               Because --

                         AVERY
               Because I'm taking care of it.

                         ADHARA
               You guys are fucking nuts, I'm calling --

     She starts to stand.  Valentine pulls her down.

                         ADHARA
               Hey.

                         TOM
               Mr. Avery.

     Avery looks to Tom, who nods toward the back porch.

     THEIR POV

     A silhouetted figure is tentatively making its way along the
     porch, trying not to be seen.  We don't get a very clear
     glimpse.

     AVERY

     Draws his gun and takes aim.

     THE FIGURE

     Careful not to become fully visible, but growing more
     courageous with each step.

     AVERY

     Locked on him, waiting.

     VALENTINE

     Puts Adhara's hand to her ears.

     THE FIGURE

     We see a little more now than we have before.

     AVERY

     He sees enough.  Squeezes off a series of SHOTS, the muzzle
     flash strobing the kitchen area like a flashbulb, Adhara and
     Valentine flinching.

     THE FIGURE

     Hit.  Spinning and collapsing to the ground.

     AVERY

     Lowers his gun.  Turns to Tom.

                         AVERY
               Watch my back.

     Avery moves out from behind the counter and heads for the
     body.

     EXT. BIG SUR HOUSE.  BACK PORCH.  NIGHT.

     Avery makes his way to the figure, which is on its stomach
     and writhing slightly.

     AVERY

     Careful.  Takes the gun and turns the body over.

     STACY

     Stares up at him, choking on his last few breaths.

     AVERY

     Puzzled.  What the hell is this guy doing here?  He starts
     feeling around Stacy's jacket for anything useful, but is
     interrupted when his hand EXPLODES, accompanied by the sound
     of a gunshot.  He screams in pain.

     INT. BIG SUR HOUSE.  KITCHEN.  NIGHT.

     Valentine and Adhara drop to the floor.  Tom, gun raised and
     pointing, tries to see who shot Avery.

     EXT. BIG SUR HOUSE.  BACK PORCH.  NIGHT.

     Avery is turning toward his assailant, but not fast enough.
     A shot rings out and part of his neck disappears in a blossom
     of blood.  Stunned, he falls on his side, gasping.

     AVERY'S POV

     Uncle John.  Close by, huddled by the lip of the cliff.  He
     starts to move cautiously toward Avery and Stacy.

     INT. BIG SUR HOUSE.  KITCHEN.  NIGHT.

     Tom squints, trying to see.

                         TOM
               Fuck.

                         VALENTINE
               What?

                         TOM
               Avery's down.

     TOM'S POV

     A piece of Uncle John's silhouette appears.

     TOM

     Fires at it.  Didn't hit anything.

                         TOM
               Fuck this.

     Tom jumps up and runs for the living room, firing his gun in
     front of him toward where he last saw Uncle John's
     silhouette.

     LIVING AREA

     Tom runs through and reaches the sliding doors to the back
     porch.  A portion of the frame SPLINTERS from a gun shot as
     he gains access to the other side of the back porch.

     EXT. BIG SUR HOUSE.  BACK PORCH.  NIGHT.

     Tom is through the sliding doors and trying to make his way
     around to the driveway.

     UNCLE JOHN

     Crouched behind the opposite end of the porch, sticks his
     head up.

     HIS POV

     Tom crossing to the steps, slips on the damp wood, tries to
     right himself.

     UNCLE JOHN

     Squeezes off two shots.

     TOM

     Is shot in the ankle as he is about to reach the steps.  He
     yelps in pain, tries to raise his gun.

     UNCLE JOHN

     Crouched down.  A shot flies over his head.

     TOM

     Stops shooting.  Tries dragging his shattered ankle to the
     steps.

     UNCLE JOHN

     Looks over the edge of the porch.

     HIS POV

     Tom turning toward the steps.

     UNCLE JOHN

     Fires at him.

     TOM

     Screams again as his elbow of his gun hand disintegrates.  He
     slips on the first step and tumbles down, the gun bouncing
     beside him.

     UNCLE JOHN

     Sees this.  Stands up to cross the back porch.  Takes a step
     forward but is stopped by a bullet in the chest (about the
     only clean shot anybody makes).  He looks down at himself.

                         UNCLE JOHN
               Shit.

     He looks up to SEE:

     AVERY

     Near death.  Gun in his good hand.  He squeezes the trigger
     again.

     UNCLE JOHN

     A small black hole appears in his cheek.  He blinks, begins
     to raise his hand to his face, and collapses.

     AVERY

     Exhales and rolls over.

     TOM

     Still trying to get to his feet.  He gives up and just lies
     there, panting.

     A HAND

     Reaches for the gun beside Tom.  Tilt up with it to reveal:

     ED

     He puts the gun in his jacket and slides away.

     INT. BIG SUR HOUSE.  KITCHEN.  NIGHT.

     Valentine and Adhara are still stuck behind the counter.
     Valentine sees the shadowy shape of Ed slipping behind the
     back porch.

     VALENTINE

     Decides to make a run for it, following Tom's route, away
     from Ed.

                         ADHARA
               Where are you going?

     LIVING ROOM

     Valentine runs to the sliding door, smack into:

     WILSON

     Standing there.  Wet.  Mad.  He grabs Valentine by the shirt
     and pushes him back into the room.

     VALENTINE

     Bounces off the couch and onto the floor.

     WILSON

     Comes toward him.

     VALENTINE

     Grabs a lamp off an end table and hurls it at Wilson.  It
     careens off Wilson's arm and shatters.

     WILSON

     Is almost on him now.

     VALENTINE

     Tries to scramble away.  Throwing anything he can get his
     hands on at.

     WILSON

     Who keeps coming.  He grabs Valentine, pulls him up, then
     throws him into the television.

     VALENTINE

     Crashes into the TV face first and bounces to the floor.

     WILSON

     Goes to him, grabs him by the neck with one hand and pulls
     out his gun with the other.  He seems about to speak when
     suddenly he screams instead.

                         WILSON
               AAAAGGGGHHHH!

     ADHARA

     Has just stuck a kitchen knife into Wilson's back.

     WILSON

     Turns instinctively and whips the pistol around, smashing
     Adhara in the mouth.

     ADHARA

     Hits the ground.  She won't be retaliating.

     WILSON

     In agony, spinning, trying to reach the knife in his back,
     but IT'S JUST BEYOND HIS REACH.

     VALENTINE

     Scrambles through the sliding glass door.

     EXT. BIG SUR HOUSE.  BACK PORCH.  NIGHT.

     Valentine stumbles out.  Notices Avery slumped on the deck,
     mortally wounded.  Goes to him -- as if concerned -- but
     actually just to take the gun.  Then runs off the porch
     toward the STEPS that lead down to the sea.

     WILSON

     Comes out after him, the knife still in his back.  So intent
     on catching Valentine he fails at first to notice Avery lying
     in the shadows.

     AVERY

     Has just barely managed to reach Stacy's pistol.  Raises it
     weakly.  Points it at Wilson.

     WILSON

     Seems to feel it.  Turns.  Locks eyes with Avery.  Avery
     could already have shot him.  But there's a momentary sense of
     recognition:  both of them just foot soldiers for fat cats --
     and Avery's is not worth saving.

     AVERY

     Lowers the gun.  Nods in the direction Valentine went.

                         AVERY
               ... that way ...

     Wilson moves on.  Avery just lies there, presumably to die.

     EXT. BIG SUR HOUSE.  STEPS.  NIGHT.

     Valentine hurries down the rickety steps.  Trying not to slip
     in the darkness, though there are tiny Malibu lights
     illuminating the steep and winding wooden framework.

     EXT. BEACH.  NIGHT.

     A rocky cove.  Valentine looks back up the way he came,
     HEARING the FOOTSTEPS coming down after him.  Backs away a
     few paces on the slippery rocks.  Falls.

     Lands on the crumpled, dead body of LARRY, the bodyguard, who
     was thrown off the cliff.  Valentine recoils.  When Wilson
     appears, Valentine FIRES at him.  A wild shot that only makes
     Wilson duck momentarily.  Valentine scrambles to his feet,
     runs on.

     WILSON

     Jumps down from the steps.  Stops for a moment and leans his
     back against the railing.  Bends at the knees slightly.

     THE KNIFE

     The handle is forced upward just enough to be reachable now.

     WILSON

     Grimacing, pulls the knife out and discards it.

     FURTHER DOWN THE BEACH

     Valentine runs.  Or tries to.  It's dark and the ground is
     treacherous.  The beach runs out pretty soon.  Now just
     rocks.  Maybe he thought he could get around the rocks on the
     point at the other end.  But he can't see very far ahead.
     And the tide is in, water making any escape extremely
     difficult.  He tries to scramble over some rocks.  They're
     wet, slippery.  He falls, cries out as he literally breaks an
     ankle.

     WILSON

     A dark figure.  Coming into focus.  Walking inexorably this
     way.

     VALENTINE

     Painfully rights himself.  A small bone protrudes from his
     broken ankle.  He FIRES at Wilson, gun in one hand, other
     hand gripping his wrist to try and steady it.  Doing his best
     to aim.  But the SHOTS miss their mark.

     WILSON

     Steadily coming.

     VALENTINE

     Out of bullets now.  Gun CLICKING crazily on empty.  He
     simply drops it.

     WILSON

     Now stands before him.

     THE TWO OF THEM

     Both breathing hard.

                         WILSON
               Tell me.

     This is not what Valentine expected.

                         VALENTINE
               What.

                         WILSON
               Tell me.

                         VALENTINE
               Tell you ...

                         WILSON
               About Jenny.
                   (closer)
               Tell me about Jenny.
                   (closer)
               About the deal.  Whatever fucking deal
               you had to kill my daughter for when she
               found out about it, you bastard.

     Wilson drops to the ground too, in a passionate fury, starts
     strangling Valentine.

                         WILSON
               Tell me.  Tell me about it, you fucking
               bastard.

     Easing up just enough for Valentine to sputter out a
     response.

                         VALENTINE
               She could've had the deal!  I would've
               handed it to her if she wanted.  I would
               have given her everything.

                         WILSON
               Why then.  Why did you do it!

     They're locked in a kind of embrace.  Sprayed by the waves
     crashing into the rocks.  Sweating and gasping and exhausted
     and hurt and furious.

                         VALENTINE
               She didn't want to share it, she wanted
               to stop it.  To stop me.  She said she'd
               turn me in.

     WILSON

     Shock of recognition on his face.  At those words.

                         VALENTINE
               She said, "You go ahead with this, I'll
               turn you in, Terry."

     Wilson sits back.  Panting.  Totally spent.  The two of them.
     Both on the ground now.  Whatever energy they had left drained
     -- Valentine from his confession, Wilson from hearing it.
     Valentine shaking, sobbing.  Still not realizing the pathetic
     folly of his actions.

                         VALENTINE
               She was serious.  She would have done it.
               She had the phone in her hand.  She was
               going to do it.

     WILSON

     Knows that the girl he loved ... loved Valentine, too.  Having
     heard the truth, the last vestige of revenge has vanished.
     He gets up and walks away.  Leaving the quivering shell of
     Valentine behind.

                                                               CUT.

     INT. BIG SUR HOUSE.  LIVING ROOM.  NIGHT.

     Adhara wakes up.  Hand to her smashed cheek and mouth.  But
     it's not her hand.  It's Valentine's.  She sort of shuffles
     away from him along the floor.  Sits against a wall holding
     her face.  Valentine sits back against an opposite wall.
     They stare at each other.

                                                               CUT.

     INT. PLANE.  DAY.

     Wilson, lost in thought.  Accepts a drink from a FLIGHT
     ATTENDANT.  We can see it pains him to reach for it.

                         WILSON
               Ta.

     After setting the glass down, his other hand goes to the
     shoulder where his stab wound was no doubt only temporarily
     dealt with.

     FLASH CUTS:

     WILSON. At the roadside hotel, grimacing.

     ELAINE. Cleaning his wound.

     Wilson rubs his shoulder.  The AMERICAN LADY in the seat
     beside him heard the way he said thanks to the Flight
     Attendant.

                         LADY
               You're English.

     A small beat (which he takes each time he responds).

                         WILSON
               Yeah, that's right.

                         LADY
               I can never decide what I like better.
               Leaving home, or coming back.

     WILSON

     Takes this in.

     FLASH CUTS:

     WILSON. Shaving in the mirror at his L.A. motel. He stops.

     WILSON. In the car leaving Valentine's house. Fingering the
     picture of Jenny.

                         WILSON
               I would have preferred staying home, me.

                         LADY
               You're a reluctant traveller, then.

     Wilson nods.

     FLASH CUTS:

     WILSON. In the car with Elaine and Ed, driving back from Big
     Sur. Everyone in their own world.

     WILSON. At Ed's house. Saying goodbye.

     WILSON AND ED. Shake hands.

     ED. Watching him get into Elaine's car.

                         WILSON
               Got called out to L.A., unexpected like,
               to do a job of work.

     FLASH CUTS:

     WILSON. At the airport, staring at Elaine.

     ELAINE. Staring back.

     WILSON AND ELAINE. She embraces him.

     ELAINE. She watches him leave.

     WILSON. Disappearing into the terminal.

                         LADY
               You'll be looking forward to getting
               back, then.

                         WILSON
               Yeah.  Another little matter needs
               attending to soon as I return.

                         LADY
               No rest for the wicked.

     Wilson nods, exhales.

     FLASH CUT:

     WILSON. In the cab on the way to Ed's, at the beginning of
     the film. Watching the lights go by.

                         WILSON
               Been away a lot.

                         LADY
               Where else?

     Longer beat.  He actually turns to look at her now.  Takes
     her in, then looks forward again.

                         WILSON
               Out on a oil rig.  In the North Sea.
               Nine years.

                         LADY
               Nine years?
                   (laughs)
               Is that legal?

                         WILSON
               Well, time off for good behavior, you
               know.  I shouldn't have even been there
               -- it was these other blokes who shoulda
               gone in my place.  I got lumbered with
               the job they were responsible for.  I
               don't mind pulling me own cart, but not
               someone else's, know what I mean.

                         LADY
               But you stuck it out, anyway, all that
               time.

                         WILSON
               I had to, didn't I.  Nothing else for it.
               Then just when I'd finished my nine years
               -- my contract -- wallop, I had to bugger
               off to the States.

                         LADY
                   (reacting slightly to his
                    "colorful" language)
               Sounds like you need a rest.

                         WILSON
               Could do, yeah.

     Another beat.

                         WILSON
               But first I gotta give these lads a
               talking to, these geezers what sent me up
               the river, in a manner of speaking.

                         LADY
               The ones whose burden you took upon your
               own shoulders.

                         WILSON
               Yeah.

     And he turns away, to the window.  Looks at the blue sky.
     Sips his drink.  Then, hard:

                         WILSON
               Them next.

                                                     CUT TO BLACK.

     THE END.

                                                     draft 08/03/98









     NOTE:  THE HARD COPY OF THIS SCRIPT CONTAINED SCENE NUMBERS.
     THEY HAVE BEEN REMOVED FROM THIS SOFT COPY.










     Wilson's first impression of Los Angeles was blue.  He was in
     the sky at the time, so it was a curious reversal, looking
     down rather than up at the color he had always felt was
     nature's finest.

     Swimming pools.  Hundreds of them.  Pockmarking the landscape
     like miniature lakes.  A flat landscape of straight streets
     and square blocks and sparse grass that didn't look quite
     green enough.

     As far as Wilson could remember, he had only ever seen seven
     or eight swimming pools in his entire life and they had been
     public ones.  Here everyone had their own.  Marvellous.

     There was the one at the Butlin's holiday camp where he had
     enjoyed his last legitimate employment -- as driver of a tour
     bus.  And there was the one at Crystal Palace he had gone to
     once or twice when he was younger.  He was most familiar,
     though, with the Chelsea Baths as he had lived for some time
     in a flat nearby in what he now thought of as his good years
     -- before he'd gone grey, went to prison, and found himself in
     a plane over a foreign town arriving to avenge the death of
     his daughter.










     WHOOSH!  The sound of automatic doors opening and --

     EXT. ARRIVALS TERMINAL.  L.A. AIRPORT.  AFTERNOON.

     WILSON steps out into the late sunlight and the heat of the
     day.  A slow-motion moment while he gets acclimatized.  He
     wouldn't have ever felt quite this kind of heat before.
     After such a rigorously air-conditioned interior.  Or seen
     cops wearing guns on their belts.  Or black cops, for that
     matter, with guns on their belts.  Or seen people as fat as
     Americans on their home turf.  Things someone from England
     notices immediately, whether consciously at first or not.

                                                               CUT.

     EXT. MOTEL.  EVENING.

     Wilson's not here for comfort.  Shown to a shitty room, round
     the corner of a typical 2nd-level outside walkway.  Airport
     close by.

     INT. MOTEL ROOM.  EVENING.

     He draws a curtain open across a window in one strong easy
     glide.  His moves are neat.  His expressions just as
     economical, not giving much away.  Outside the planes are
     practically on top of us. The sunset colors strange and
     chemical.

     He's only got one light bag.  Unzips, unpacks a few things.
     Change of clothes, a travel kit, and some familiar items
     (shaving foam/toothpaste/deodorant} bearing unfamiliar
     British brand names.

     Goes into the bathroom.  Turns on the shower in there.

     Comes back to sit on the bed.  Takes an envelope out of his
     jacket.

     ENVELOPE

     Turns it over to see the return address on the back.

                                                               CUT.

     INT. TAXI.  NIGHT.

     Wilson in the back.  Stares at the impenetrable name on the
     driver's posted ID. Glances at the driver.

     DRIVER glances back at his quiet passenger in the rearview
     mirror.

                                                               CUT.

     EXT. SMALL HOUSE.  NIGHT.

     Wilson walks up a cracked little path to the front door.
     Lower middle-class street.  Two cars in the driveway, one
     behind the other.  Lights on inside the house -- as he rings
     the bell.

     ED RAMA

     Answers it.  Hispanic.  Late 30's.  Chairman Mao on his T-
     shirt notwithstanding, an easygoing sort of fellow.  Not
     looking for any trouble -- anymore.  But once did, and able
     to handle himself if any shows up.  Which it has.

                         WILSON
               Edward Rama?

                         ED
               Eduardo.
                   (rolling the R)
               Rama.

                         WILSON
               You're home, then.

     He turns, waves away the taxi he's kept waiting.  While
     Eduardo Rama waits for an introduction.

                         WILSON
               My name's Wilson.

     Accent speaks for itself.  Hard, working-class.

                         ED
               Wilson?

     Knows the name.  But just now it's unexpected.  He's holding
     a hot TV dinner, hand protected by a dish towel.

                         WILSON
               You wrote to me about my daughter.

                                                               CUT.

     INT. ED'S HOUSE.  NIGHT.

     Ed takes Wilson inside.

                         ED
               I didn't expect anyone.

                         WILSON
               No reason.

                         ED
               I mean, what has it been -- six months?

                         WILSON
               Round about, yeah.

     They've entered a cauldron of family life.  TV blaring
     (SHOWBIZ TONIGHT!).  A couple of younger KIDS yelling "Mama".
     Their MOTHER shouting back at them from the kitchen (in
     Spanish) that she only has two hands.  A sullen TEENAGER
     walking by.

                         ED
               I didn't even know who I was writing to --
               just someone with the same last name.
               She never talked about any family.

                         WILSON
               It was better than a telegram.

     Ed opens a screen door to the backyard.

     EXT. ED'S BACKYARD.  NIGHT.

     They sit at an outdoor table.  Wilson with a TV dinner in
     front of him now too.  Sounds from inside MUTED.  Even this
     little house has a little pool.

                         WILSON
               Who done it, then?

                         ED
               Huh?

                         WILSON
               Snuffed her.

     Ed surprised at Wilson's directness.  Ed stands nervously.

                         ED
               Now, wait up a second, man.

     And paces back and forth.

                         ED
               I never said nothin' about nothin' like
               that.  No, no, no.  That's not what I
               wrote to you.

                         WILSON
               No, but between the lines, eh?
               Mysterious circumstances, and that.

     Ed stops pacing.

                         ED
               Look, I sent you that newspaper clipping,
               all right?  I told you what I know.  It
               was an accident.  I didn't say anything
               about anybody being "snuffed."

     Beat.

                         WILSON
               This bloke she was bunked up with.  This
               Terry what'sit.

                         ED
               Terry Valentine.

                         WILSON
               Valentine.  What's he got to say for
               himself?

                         ED
               I dunno.  What's he gonna say?  They had
               a fight that night, she drove away, she
               was upset?  I don't even know the guy.
               Don't get me wrong, Jenny and me were
               friends, but we didn't travel in the same
               social circles.  She had her life, I had
               mine.

     Makes a kind of scoffing gesture:  and you can see what my
     life is.

                         ED
               Valentine came into the restaurant where
               I work with Jenny a couple times.  He's a
               money guy.  Jenny would say, hey, here's
               my friend Eddie and he would shake my
               hand and everything, but he wouldn't even
               see me, you know what I mean.

     Wilson gazes up at the sky.  Clear night.  Stars.

                         WILSON
               How long had she been in the States?
                   (as if to himself, somewhat
                    wistful)
               Near on ten years, wasn't it?  Long
               enough to know her way about, I reckon.

     Ed leans down, palms on the tabletop, facing Wilson.

                         ED
               There was an investigation, okay?  The
               car was totalled.  Jennifer was ... Her
               neck was broken.  On impact, they said.
               So she wouldn't have ... felt the effects
               of the fire.
                   (helpless shrug)
               It happens up there.  Happens a lot.
               What more can I tell you.

     Wilson taps out a cigarette from a pack of "Silk Cut" he's
     produced from his pocket.

                         WILSON
               What more is there.

                         ED
               I'm just sayin' -- it was a steep
               hillside.  There was no moon that
               night ...

     Wilson's quiet stillness is getting to him.

                         ED
               Coulda happened to anyone, man.  I never
               knew her to be reckless.  I mean, sure,
               she would smoke a little grass, or
               something, have a few drinks.  But that's
               it, nothing more than that.

                         WILSON
               No, not my girl.  Self-control, she had.
               Point of pride.
                   (smokes)
               And people don't change, do they.

                         ED
               I dunno ... Maybe they do.

     Wilson notes the tattoos on Ed's forearms.

                         WILSON
               Going straight, are ya.

     Ed looks at him.  Sits down again.  Keeping his forearms under
     the table.

                         ED
                   (looks away)
               Boomerang.

                         WILSON
               Y'what?

                         ED
               I knew when I was droppin' that letter
               into the mail slot it was gonna come back
               and smack me in the face.
                   (looks at Wilson again)
               I did my time, okay?  My sister, her ol'
               man's up in Chino right now doin' eight
               years.

                         WILSON
                   (re the family inside)
               This ain't your lot?

                         ED
               You kiddin', man?  I don't need a wife
               and screamin' kids.  I still got my
               youth.

     And yet -- he lives here.  Wilson declines to pursue the
     matter.

                         ED
               I go to work, try to keep my life
               together, put all that shit behind me,
               man.  What d'you want from me.

                         WILSON
                   (calmly smoking)
               I only asked.

     Ed sighs.  Reaches for one of Wilson's cigarettes.

                         ED
               Couple weeks before she died, Jennifer
               asked me to drive her downtown.  Said she
               was meeting -- her boyfriend --
               Valentine.  But I think she was looking
               for him.

     FLASH CUTS:

     ED AND JENNIFER. In a car, downtown. She has the same steely
     intensity as her father. Ed looks a little worried.

                         WILSON
                   (lighting Ed's cigarette)
               What, tryin' to catch him with another
               bird?

                         ED
               That's what I thought, man.  But it was
               not a hotel or nothin' that we went to.
               It was someplace else.

                         WILSON
               Where abouts?

     FLASH CUTS:

     JENNIFER. Talking to a beefy SUPERVISOR. Or talking at him.
     Either way, he isn't happy.

     MEAT PUPPETS. Watch instead of working.

     ED. Taking all this in.

                         ED
               Bad place, man.  Bad people.  Some guys
               loading some trucks.  Some kinda deal
               goin' down.
                   (anticipating Wilson's next
                    question)
               I don't know and I don't care.  Maybe
               they're shipping fava beans to Eskimos.

                         WILSON
               Did Jenny know?

                         ED
                   (shrugs)
               Valentine wasn't even there.  If he was
               into something, if she was involved --
               who can say.
                   (stands up again)
               But I'll tell you something.  She stood
               in front of these dudes, man.  Eyeballing
               them.  Checking them out.
                   (beat)
               I felt like she was covering my ass that
               day.

     Unconsciously rubbing his arms where his tattoos are.

                         ED
               I drove her back to Valentine's house.

     FLASH CUT:

     VALENTINE. Standing in front of his house. His expression
     says: We have something to discuss.

                         ED
               He was standing outside waiting for her.
               That's the only other time I ever saw
               him.
                   (a short sad note)
               Last time I saw her.

     He meets Wilson's gaze.  As hard and pointed as a drill
     through his skull.

                                                               CUT.

     INT. ED'S CAR.  NIGHT.

     Ed drives Wilson back to his motel.  Wilson silent.  Ed still
     not quite sure who he's dealing with.  Is this really or
     merely a grieving dad?

                         ED
               What you gonna do, man?  You gonna go to
               the cops?

                         WILSON
               Nah, coppers don't do nothing, do they.

                         ED
               Those streets up in the hills, man.
               Gotta be real careful, keep your eye on
               the ball.  Two o'clock in the morning,
               it's dark, your mind is all agitated,
               you're drivin' a little too fast ...
                   (beat)
               Those curves don't kid around.

     Could be talking about the girl.  Wilson doesn't move.  But
     touch him, he'll explode.  Out the window lights are passing,
     but no landmarks.  He might as well be on the moon.

                         ED
               You should talk to Elaine.  That was her
               best friend.

                         WILSON
               She didn't write to me, did she.

                         ED
               She didn't know what to say.
                   (shrugs)
               I thought someone should say something.
               To someone.  With me it was, I don't know
               -- Jenny liked me for some reason.  I
               felt like I owed her.

                         WILSON
               Who'd Jenny get it off of -- this grass
               or whatever?

                         ED
                   (self-conscious again)
               Not me, man.  I'm no drug dealer, what
               you think.

                         WILSON
                   (re Ed's tattoos)
               I think you didn't get that lot in the
               Navy, doing your National Service.

                         ED
               I already told you, man.  Corcoran.  Know
               what that is?  State prison.

                         WILSON
               Nick's a nick, n' it?  No matter what
               state you're in.  State of remorse, most
               likely -- for gettin' caught.

                         ED
               But that's not me anymore.  That's when I
               was into the gang lifestyle.  That's not
               who I am now.  Five years in the joint --
               that's it for me, man.

     Now Wilson drops the clanger.

                         WILSON
               Just got out meself, didn't I.

     And Ed turns.  Looks at Wilson.  Fellow ex-con.

                                                               CUT.

     EXT. WILSON'S MOTEL.  NIGHT.

     Wilson out of the car, shuts the passenger door.  Ed on the
     other side, looks over the roof at him.

                         ED
               Go home, man.
                   (plane taking off in
                    background)
               Get on a plane.

     Wilson has other plans.

                         WILSON
               I'll be needing a shooter.

     Makes his fingers like a gun.  And a clicking sound.

                         ED
                   (comes quickly over)
               You're kiddin' me, right?

                         WILSON
               What do I do, then, look in the bleedin'
               Yellow Pages?

                         ED
                   (an urgent whisper)
               These are not guys you can just go run a
               number on, man.

                         WILSON
                   (looking around)
               Thought perhaps there'd be dispensing
               machines, you know.  Bung in your coins,
               come out with a .44 Magnum, fully-loaded.

     Ed throws up his hands, walks back to his driver's side door.

                         ED
               Are you a resident of California?
               You gonna fill out forms, man?  Do the
               background check?  Go through a three-day
               waiting period?

                         WILSON
               Sod that.  Gotta get back before my
               probation officer wonders where I've
               skived off to.

                         ED
               Probation?  Man, you crazy.  They
               shouldn't've let you outta your country,
               much less prison.

                         WILSON
               Travelling on a dodgy passport, n' all.

     Walks round to come face to face with Ed once more.

                         WILSON
               Which is why I thought, save some time,
               get what I need under the table, like.

     ED

     As if resigned and mulling the problem over:

                         ED
               Under the table?

                                                               CUT.

     INT. GUN SHOW.  DAY.

     Hundreds of tables.  Under bright lights.  Displaying every
     kind of firearm.  Handguns, rifles, shotguns, parts to make
     machine guns.  A weapons bazaar.

     WILSON AND ED

     Walking around.  Even a cool customer like Wilson can't help
     but be impressed by America's loving embrace of senseless
     mayhem.

     DEALERS

     Touting their wares.

     VISITORS

     Trying out pistol grips -- or pushing baby carriages.  Guys
     in fatigue jackets with toddlers on their shoulders.  Women
     in stretch pants looking for a little something in personal
     protection.

     WILSON

     Doesn't know where to look.  At the booth featuring "Classic
     Cowboy Collectibles" -- or the most OBESE COUPLE he's ever
     seen who just walked by.

                         PA SYSTEM
               Attention:  the long-range vermin-
               shooting panel is due to commence in two
               minutes in the blue room at the rear of
               the Convention Center.

     ... and other anomalous oddball ANNOUNCEMENTS in the
     background as long as we're here.

     DEMONSTRATION

     At a booth selling laser attachments.

                         BEAM SALESMAN
               BeamSight II is easily mountable on any
               shotgun, rifle, or sidearm and will
               project a small, bright red dot directly
               onto the point where your weapon is
               aimed ...

     For purposes of display, a smiling YOUNG WOMAN is the
     "target."

     WILSON

     Walking past, almost subliminally noting the Young Woman with
     the symbol of death on her.

     TABLE

     A .45 passed from a DEALER's hand to Wilson's.

                         DEALER
               Man knows what he likes.

                         ED
                   (he'll talk if Wilson won't)
               Lookin' good.

                         DEALER
                   (while Wilson checks)
               That's a high-end item.  Total
               reliability.

                         ED
               What'd you call that -- the Protector?

                         DEALER
               Yes, sir.  Won't find a better CQC on the
               market.

     Wilson's eyes glance up -- but Ed asks the question.

                         ED
               CQ what?

                         DEALER
               Close Quarters Combat.  Keep one in my
               own home.

                         WILSON
               Trouble is, I'm not at home, see.
               Fancied a bit of target shooting, y'know,
               while I'm here -- with me mate.

     Nods at Ed.

                         DEALER
               Oh really?  Where you from?

                         WILSON
               England.
                   (sighting the weapon)
               Only, we saw there was a show on, thought
               I might pick something up for a price,
               type of thing.

                         DEALER
               You came to the right place, sir.  My
               wife's second cousin is English.  Well,
               Scotch-Irish.  Can I interest you in a
               holster?

                         WILSON
               Just luck, this, really.  Never been to
               one of these before.

                         DEALER
               You're in gun country now, my friend.

                         WILSON
                   (picks up another, checks it
                    out)
               Been to the Boat Show.

                         DEALER
                   (re Wilson's new selection)
               Packs a punch, but it's compact, has
               accessible features -- makes a nice
               concealed-carry piece.

                         ED
                   (playing the reluctant buyer)
               He don't have a concealed weapons permit.

                         WILSON
               Don't have time for a lot of paperwork,
               y'know.  Just popped over on a quick
               visit.

                         DEALER
               I can take care of the paperwork.

                         WILSON
               Yeah?

                         DEALER
               No problem.  If you don't have a problem
               with me reporting this gun stolen.

     A look of understanding between them.

                         WILSON
               No.  Not at all.
                   (to Ed)
               Do we?

                         ED
               Not me, man.

                         WILSON
               I mean, it's already a steal, n'it -- what
               you said -- four hundred for this one?

                         DEALERS
               Well, I'll have to add another two
               hundred on top of that.

                         WILSON
               Oh, aye?

                         DEALER
                   (another look)
               ... for the paperwork.

                                                               CUT.

     INT. ED'S CAR.  DAY.

     Ed drives.  Nervous at Wilson handling his new gun purchase
     beside him.

                         WILSON
               Violation of my parole, this.
                   (a perfect pause)
               -- Goin' abroad.

     Ed shakes his head at Wilson's sense of humor.

                         ED
               You hadda show up on a weekend.  This
               weekend.  Wouldn't've even been a gun
               show ... for another month.

                         WILSON
               Fucking out of order, that.  Shouldn't be
               allowed.

     As he puts away a box of ammo.

                         ED
               Now what.  You gonna take your new
               arsenal, go visit Terry Valentine, just
               like that?  Boom bam boom.

                         WILSON
               It's only insurance.  Can't be too
               careful.  This Terry Valentine, he's
               probably a wonderful fella.  They were
               together how long?

                         ED
               Five years, I think.  Long time.

                         WILSON
               Well, there you are.  Jen must've liked
               him.

     Doesn't make Ed feel any better.  Nor does the way Wilson
     seems now to be studying Ed's driving techniques.  Paying
     attention to the way traffic lights and left-turn lanes and
     cars without clutches work over here.

                         ED
                   (remembering)
               Jenny told me she met him at the beach.
               Got blinded by his smile.
                   (beat)
               You believe that shit?  Son of a bitch
               never smiled at me.  Buried her at a
               "private" service.  Private for who.
               Him?

                         WILSON
                   (confused)
               Hang about.  I thought you said he come
               into the restaurant where you worked with
               Jenny.

                         ED
               He came in with Jenny to the restaurant
               where I work.  That's not where they met.

                         WILSON
               And that's where you met Jenny.

                         ED
               No, no -- Jenny used to work as a
               waitress.  Before she met him.  But
               that's not where she met me.  Not in my
               restaurant.

                         WILSON
               How'd the two of you hook up, then?

                         ED
               Oh, Jenny was in my acting class.

                                                               CUT.

     INT. RENTAL CAR.  DAY.

     Wilson at the wheel himself.  Getting the hang of L.A.
     Driving downtown.  Along one of the major boulevards.

     Glances at a street sign as he goes by.  Picks up the map
     book on the seat beside him to check his route.

     EXT. BOULEVARD.  DAY.

     Wilson makes a sudden lane change to avoid getting fed in the
     wrong direction.  Gets HONKED by another driver.

     EXT. A STREET DOWNTOWN.  DAY.

     Wilson cruises past a particular building.  We don't have to
     really clearly see it just yet (we saw it in the flash cuts) --
     more important we see him seeing it.  Casing it with the eyes
     of a professional.  Sniffing it out; the instinct of a
     predator after prey.

     INT. CAR.  DAY.

     Parks it.  Produces the little leather travel kit we saw him
     unpack at his motel.  Unzips it.  Under the usual assortment
     of clippers, razors, etc., is a hidden layer -- storing still
     more personalized items:  a set of select slim
     lockpicking/cutting tools.

     EXT. SIDE STREET.  DAY.

     Wilson locks the car.  Walks away.  STAY with him.

     AROUND THE CORNER

     He walks down the block.  A nice long walk.  What we get out
     of it besides a sense of Wilson -- cool cat; ambling along;
     loner; sun beating down; not bothered; his shadow doubling
     him -- is this:

     The building approaching.  The one he has his eye on.  The
     target.  It's across the street.  A kind of flat windowless
     warehouse with adjoining loading yard.  Loading yard
     surrounded by a chain-link fence -- topped with barbed wire.

     The actual geography of where he left his car in relation to
     this building.  Safely around the corner.  And how he might
     practically get back to it, either this same way or via a
     more circuitous route round another block.

     The sense you get in downtown L.A. on a lazy Saturday
     afternoon that you're in a ghost town.  Particularly in this
     shabby kind of industrial section.

     EXT. THE BUILDING.

     Wilson crosses over to it now.  From sunny to shade.

     Walks past the chain-link fence.  The padlocked gate, big
     enough to accommodate the (couple of) trucks parked within
     the compound.

     Walks past the closed security door which would appear to be
     the building's main entrance.

     Round the next corner -- SEES there's a steel back door as
     well.

     Comes around this block again.  Looking surreptitiously around
     now.  Streets here utterly deserted.  Not even a passing car.
     Crappy residential building on an opposite corner, SPANISH
     MUSIC blaring from one of the open windows, but not with a
     direct view on the loading yard fence on this side.  Wilson
     nearing it now -- taking something out of his pocket.  One of
     the mysterious metallic tools from his travel kit.  Snaps his
     wrist, unfolding the tool with a CRACK.  Wire cutters.

     He doesn't go for the gate, the padlock, like we might have
     thought.  He suddenly drops to one knee, in shadow where the
     fence meets the adjoining building.  SNAP, SNAP, SNAP, SNAP,
     SNAP -- so quick, with great dexterity, though his face
     grimaces with the strength he has to exert with each
     application of pressure -- he cuts just as many links as he
     knows he needs to push in a little flap of fence and roll
     under.  Whole thing accomplished in seconds.

     LOADING YARD

     Walks fast to the cover of the trucks.  Passes.  Looks
     around.  Cement loading docks and bays.  Shuttered doors.  He
     jumps up to one, puts his ear to the metal.  Listens awhile.

     WILSON

     Scans the wall for any sign of an alarm box or anything.
     Then cocks an ear upwards... CAMERA CRANING UP to show us
     what he hears:  an air-conditioning unit HUMMING away.  Which
     means someone must be inside.

     Wilson looks back at his entry options.  Not the loading
     doors -- but a conventional door at one end, with a
     conventional lock his eye zeroes in on.  Gets out his tools,
     going over.

     INT. WAREHOUSE HALLWAY.

     A SCRATCHING at the door.  It opens.  He's in.

     Waits.  Cautious.  Nothing.  He starts along the hallway.

     INT. WAREHOUSE.

     A SUPERVISOR (the one from the flash cuts) does a double take
     as Wilson passes.

                         SUPERVISOR
               Hey!

     Wilson stops and turns.  Says nothing.

                         SUPERVISOR
               How'd you get in here.

                         WILSON
               Walked.

                         SUPERVISOR
               You walked.
                   (coming over)
               What the hell are you doing here.

                         WILSON
               Looking for a bloke named Valentine.
               Know him?

     MEAT PUPPETS (who we saw before as well) who work here
     gathering.  The Supervisor and the Meat Puppets exchange
     glances.

                         SUPERVISOR
               He's expecting you?

                         WILSON
                   (beat)
               I doubt it.

     The Supervisor moves toward Wilson.

                         SUPERVISOR
               So why would he want to see you.

                         WILSON
               I have a message for him.  About Jennifer
               Wilson.

                         SUPERVISOR
               Jennifer Wilson.

     More looks are exchanged.

                         WILSON
               You know her?

                         SUPERVISOR
               Yeah.  I know her, all right.  She came
               down here once, stirred up a shitstorm.
               We lost a full day's work, took me weeks
               to get back on schedule.  If she hadn't
               a' been Terry's woman I would've broke
               her jaw.  'Course, she's nobody's problem
               now.

     Wilson stares at him.

                         WILSON
               Is Valentine here?

                         SUPERVISOR
               What do you think?

     Wilson looks at the Meat Puppets, the loading area.

                         WILSON
               Where is he, then?

                         SUPERVISOR
               Listen, get the fuck out of here before
               you get hurt.  Who the fuck do you think
               you are, waltzing in here, asking
               questions?

     Wilson just looks at him.

                         SUPERVISOR
               Do you hear me, asshole?

     The Supervisor shoves him.  The Meat Puppets move a little in
     anticipation.  Wilson isn't giving any indication that he's
     going to leave.

                         SUPERVISOR
               Jesus, you really want your ass kicked,
               don't you?

     He pushes Wilson again, hard.

                         SUPERVISOR
               Go on, get outta here.

     He pushes Wilson again.  Still, Wilson won't leave.

                         SUPERVISOR
               Fuckin' nut.  Go on.

     This time he tries to slap Wilson.  Wilson blocks the
     Supervisor's hand and then punches him, hard.  The Supervisor
     stumbles back and falls to the floor.

     THE MEAT PUPPETS

     Move to Wilson.  He tries to fend them off, but there are too
     many.  They beat him.  When they find that he's armed, they
     beat him harder.

                                                               CUT.

     EXT. BUILDING.  DAY.

     Wilson is taken outside and dumped.  After a moment, he gets
     to his feet.  Dusting himself.  Reaches for ANOTHER GUN tucked
     in his lower back.  He re-enters the building.

     A beat.  We hear several SHOTS.

     Seconds later, one of the Meat Puppets comes stumbling out of
     the door, terrified.  He runs past us, fast.

     A moment later, Wilson emerges, gun in hand.

                         WILSON
               You tell him.  You tell him I'm coming!!

                                                               CUT.

     INT./EXT. VALENTINE'S HOUSE.  DUSK.

     A series of images that prove Valentine (whoever he is) has
     taste, wealth, and influence, stretching back a good three
     decades at least.

     Walking through some of these shots is a young beauty in a
     bathing suit named ADHARA.  She advances slowly, not entirely
     sure of herself, and stops to look at things just like we do.
     At one point she looks to see a BEEFY GUY (GORDON) sitting at
     the kitchen counter, flipping through a magazine.  He looks
     her up and down, more from reflex than anything.

     She continues on.  Eventually she emerges through sliding
     glass doors and on to a patio.

     HER POV

     A figure by the pool, talking on the phone.  His back to us.
     The pool is spectacular, mosaic tile bottomed.

     ADHARA

     Approaches, then sits beside him.  His voice is soothing, but
     with the tiniest hint of exasperation that comes with being
     slightly ahead of everyone.

                         VALENTINE
                   (into phone)
               Not before.  Not before.  Think about it.
               What does it mean?  What -- no, I'm not.
               Think.  Yes.  See?  You figured it out
               all by yourself.  I know.  Are we done?
               Okay.

     He hangs up, stands, still doesn't turn.

                         VALENTINE
               Adhara.  I told your father, if you're
               looking for a name, you can't go wrong
               with a constellation.

                         ADHARA
               I used to hate it.  Now I like it.

                         VALENTINE
               Could be worse, he could've named you
               Reticulum.

     He turns and we see him for the first time.

     VALENTINE

     Polished.  Handsome.  Charismatic.  Especially when he's
     smiling like he is now.  He leans over and kisses her.

                         VALENTINE
               Is there anything in the world that you
               want or need?

                         ADHARA
               I want to know why you need that scary
               guy in your house.

                         VALENTINE
               Gordon?  He's been with me for years.
               He's not as tough as he looks.

                         ADHARA
               Then what good is he?

                         VALENTINE
               Is it possible that you're too young to
               be acquainted with the idea of loyalty?

                         ADHARA
               Is that a problem?

                         VALENTINE
               Not for you, clearly.

                         ADHARA
               I'm loyal to things that make me happy.

                         VALENTINE
               Am I a thing?

                         ADHARA
               Well, you're certainly not a person.

                         VALENTINE
               I'm not.

                         ADHARA
               No.  You're not specific enough to be a
               person.  You're more like a vibe.

                         VALENTINE
               I'm so glad we're having this chat.

                         ADHARA
               It's not a knock.

                         VALENTINE
               It's not a compliment.

                         ADHARA
               It's an observation.  Like:  I'm hungry.
               When are we eating?

                         VALENTINE
               As soon as you get dressed.

                         ADHARA
               What kind of food?

                         VALENTINE
               Anything but Japanese.

                         ADHARA
               Why?

                         VALENTINE
               I'm not into finger foods.  Too fussy.

                         ADHARA
               Like you.

                         VALENTINE
               I don't like do-it-yourself cuisine.
               Buffets.  Salad bars.

                         ADHARA
               You demand to be served.  A fork
               fetishist.

                         VALENTINE
               It's just fuel to me.  I'm not there for
               distractions.

                         ADHARA
               For some, eating is a sensual experience.
               The sensual experience.

                         VALENTINE
               That's what Gordon's always saying.

                         ADHARA
               Oh, god.

     His cell phone rings.

                         VALENTINE
                   (into phone)
               Yes.

     He listens, then looks up at his balcony, where a MAN (AVERY)
     stands holding a phone, obviously talking to Valentine.

                         VALENTINE
                   (into phone)
               I'll be there as soon as I can.

     He hangs up.

                         VALENTINE (cont'd)
               We can leave as soon as you're ready.

                         ADHARA
               Okay.

     EXT. BALCONY.  EVENING.

     Valentine approaches Avery.

                         VALENTINE
               What.

                         AVERY
               There's been some trouble downtown.

                         VALENTINE
               What kind?

                         AVERY
               What the papers used to call a "gangland
               slaying."

                         VALENTINE
               Our black friends?

                         AVERY
               No, Terry.  They don't work like that.
               Jenny Wilson's father paid a little
               visit, left a message.

                         VALENTINE
               I thought he was in prison, in England.

                         AVERY
               Well, either they have a very liberal
               work-release program, or he's out,
               because he's here in L.A., looking for
               you.

     Valentine is a little ruffled.  Maybe Avery likes that.

                         VALENTINE
               What do we do?

     Beat.

                         AVERY
               We wait, and we watch.

     Valentine just looks at him.

     EXT. VALENTINE'S HOUSE.  POOLSIDE.  EVENING.

     Adhara approaches Valentine, who stands staring at the pool.

                         ADHARA
               Italian?

                         VALENTINE
               I'm sorry.

                         ADHARA
               Italian.

                         VALENTINE
               Who?

                         ADHARA
               Not who, food.  Should we get Italian.

                         VALENTINE
               Sure.

     Turns to her.

                         VALENTINE (cont'd)
               Yes.  Are you ready?

                         ADHARA
               As long as I don't have to pass Gordon
               again.  I'm never ready for that.

     He smiles, rises, and offers her his hand.

                         VALENTINE
               No.  I know another way out.

     She takes it.

                                                               CUT.

     EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING.  EVENING.

     ELAINE on her way in.  Handsome woman.  Intelligent, capable-
     looking.  Passes Wilson who's leaning somewhere smoking.

     ELAINE

     Aware as a wary woman will be of a strange man's presence
     without necessarily having looked at him.  Well aware too
     that he stayed where he was -- so she unworriedly unlocks the
     building's security gate and goes through to the inner --

     COURTYARD

     -- and closes the gate behind her, now seeing him amble up,
     arriving as it CLICKS shut between them.  He's looking at her
     a certain way.  She looks back.  And knows.

                         ELAINE
               You're Jenny's father.

     And the recognition on his part:

                         WILSON
               Had a feeling it was you.

                         ELAINE
               You look alike.

                         WILSON
                   (cigarette in hand)
               Perhaps it was the smoke.

                         ELAINE
               Not her brand.

                         WILSON
               She used to pinch 'em off me.
                   (trying to defuse Elaine's cold
                    stare)
               Funny that.  One thing she never tried to
               get me to stop.

     Elaine doesn't soften.

                         ELAINE
               Why did you come here?

                         WILSON
               Wanted to talk to you, didn't I?

                         ELAINE
               No, why did you come here?

     America.

                         WILSON
               Sort a few things out.

                         ELAINE
               Been busy, have you.

                         WILSON
               How d'you mean?

                         ELAINE
               It's been a while.

                         WILSON
               I was skint -- didn't have no money to
               get here.

                         ELAINE
               That's not what I heard.

                         WILSON
               What was that, then?

                         ELAINE
               I heard you were -- what's that adorable
               phrase? -- "at Her Majesty's pleasure."

                         WILSON
               It was the bars, then.

     Indicating his face, viewed by Elaine through the barred
     security gate that divides them.

                         ELAINE
               In any case, I don't suppose the salary
               you make sewing mailbags is really
               commensurate with international airline
               travel.

                         WILSON
               Sewing mailbags?  Me?  Never did an
               honest day's work in my life, dear.
               Wasn't about to start when I was in stir --
               not with all that leisure time on my
               hands.

                         ELAINE
               And not with all that buried loot you had
               waiting for you when you got out.  From
               the Wembley Staduim job, wasn't it?  Pink
               Floyd concert receipts.  Jenny would've
               been ... fourteen at the time?

                         WILSON
                   (trying to conceal his
                    surprise)
               Hardly buried.  Earning interest, love.
               Earning interest in an offshore account.
               Tidy little premium per annum, that.

                         ELAINE
               Well, that kind of security can't be
               bought.  Must be more comforting than a
               daughter to greet you.

     She turns to walk away.

                         WILSON
               Here, aren't you gonna let me in.

                         ELAINE
                   (without looking back)
               Try calling me again.

     INT. ELAINE'S APARTMENT.  EVENING.

     She comes in.  A modest studio apartment.  Puts her bag on
     the kitchenette countertop.  Glances at her answer machine to
     see if she has any messages.  The phone RINGS.  She sits down
     glumly on her couch, holds her head in her hands.

     EXT. ELAINE'S APARTMENT BUILDING.  EVENING.

     Wilson gives up, starts to walk away.  The gate BUZZES.

     INT. ELAINE'S APARTMENT.  EVENING.

     Elaine opens the door.  Wilson in the hall.

                         ELAINE
               I was just going to toss some vegetable
               rolls in the microwave, open a can of
               diet soda.
                   (beat)
               Want to take me out?

                                                               CUT.

     INT. RESTAURANT.  NIGHT.

     Wilson and Elaine at a table.

                         WILSON
               ... No, I went in for more improving
               pastimes.  Philosophy classes, language
               courses, European history, all that lark.
               Did you know that in Paris in the
               Eighteenth Century there were more rats
               in people's houses than there were people
               in people's houses.

                         ELAINE
               Sounds like Beverly Hills.

                         WILSON
               Here, are you always this sarky?

                         ELAINE
               Sarcastic, moi?  Maybe I'll mellow when
               my ship comes in.  It's expected any day
               now.  I'm all packed and ready to go.

                         WILSON
               Weren't you on a television series?

                         ELAINE
                   (has he seen it?)
               If it played in England somebody owes me
               money.  Who told you that -- Eddie?

                         WILSON
                   (yes)
               Said it went on for donkey's years.

                         ELAINE
               Three seasons.  They found that's the
               limit of human tolerance when it comes to
               following the adventures of a family of
               Mormons on the Chisum Trail.
                   (blinks coquettishly)
               I was wife number three -- the ingenue.

                         WILSON
               Oh, it just ended, then.

                         ELAINE
               Now who's being sarcastic?

                         WILSON
               When you've lost as many years as I have,
               love, puts things in perspective, know
               what I mean.

                         ELAINE
               I'm sorry.  I guess the rest of us have
               no excuse for wondering where the time
               went.
                   (raises her drink)
               It must've been the bars.

     Their food arrives.

                         ELAINE
               It's a kind of prison, doing a series.
               Early to bed, early to rise, no time off
               for good behavior, you grab the boodle
               for as long as it lasts.
                   (the kicker)
               Only difference is you can't get arrested
               afterwards.

     Wilson appears fascinated by the cold glasses of water on the
     table.  Ice cubes CLINKING as he holds his.  A BUSBOY
     bringing them to other people, too, just like that, without
     anyone even asking.

                         WILSON
               I can't believe Jenny told you all that.
               About me.  She was always so embarrassed.

                         ELAINE
               Not embarrassed.

                         WILSON
                   (correcting)
               Ashamed.

                         ELAINE
               Not ashamed.

     Wilson looks at her.  Okay.  What then.

                         ELAINE
               Disappointed.

                         WILSON
               She never told Eddie, though.

                         ELAINE
               She never told anyone else.
                   (making light now)
               About the convict strain -- or is it
               stain?  No, I was privileged.  I was
               someone who helped Jenny efface her past.

                         WILSON
               How'd you manage that, then.

                         ELAINE
               When I'm not honing my craft in episodic
               television I do double-duty as a voice
               coach.  Not that her accent would have
               hobbled her progress.  Not with that
               look.

                         WILSON
               Yeah, well, she started all that in
               London.

                         ELAINE
               Modelling.

                         WILSON
               Learnin' 'ow to speak proper.
                   (putting it on a bit there.
                    Then, upper crust:)
               Central School of Speech and Drama.
               It's no doddle gettin' in there, y'know.
               At seventeen.  They offered her a place
               at RADA n' all, only she'd've had to wait
               till the next session and she was always
               in hurry to get on, was Jenny.  She could
               talk posh without any training, when she
               was knee-high to a grasshopper.
                   (indicating himself)
               Show up the old man, you know.

     Elaine smiles slightly.  None of this information new to her.
     But warming to this man.

                         ELAINE
               You weren't disappointed in her, then.

                         WILSON
               In Jenny?  'Course not.  How could I be.
               'Course I wasn't.

                         ELAINE
               She was twenty-one when she came to me.
                   (looks at him)
               ... Straight from leaving you.

                         WILSON
               Footloose and fancy free.

                         ELAINE
               She was happy here.  However the two of
               you might have parted.  Don't think she
               wasn't.

     It's because Wilson thinks the opposite that he's here.
     Looks at Elaine.

                         WILSON
               That's the trouble, n' it.
                   (hard as nails again)
               She enjoyed life.

                                                               CUT.

     EXT. OCEANFRONT.  NIGHT.

     They walk along the seafront.  We HEAR the ocean but can't
     see it.

                         ELAINE
               When did you get in?

                         WILSON
               Yesterday.  Afternoon.

                         ELAINE
                   (occurs to her)
               You haven't been lurking outside my
               building all day.

                         WILSON
               No, I had -- some other matters to attend
               to, you know.  Getting a car sorted ...

                         ELAINE
               I might've been away for the weekend.

                         WILSON
               Well, I reckoned, Saturday night, if you
               were goin' out, you'd probably have to
               come home first.

                         ELAINE
               And you've seen Eddie Rama.

                         WILSON
               Yeah, saw Eddie, yeah.  Me and him are
               muckers.

     Mates.  Friends.  Makes a kind of bonding gesture.

                         ELAINE
               I should really give him a call.  He's a
               character, isn't he.  Well, not to you.
               I meant to us squares in the outside
               world.

                         WILSON
               He give me your address.

                         ELAINE
               I gave him yours.  Said, here, you want
               to write, I think this is a relative.  I
               guess I thought I was being true to
               Jenny.  Who told me she didn't have a
               father -- before proceeding of course to
               tell me why.

                         WILSON
               Well, don't suppose she did, really, most
               of her life.  On her own after her mum
               died.  Aunts and uncles for a time -- and
               then the bright lights beckoned.

                         ELAINE
               Were you still married at the time -- to
               Jenny's mother, I mean?

                         WILSON
               Nah, we split up when Jenny was six.  Her
               second husband done a runner after she
               got sick.  They give me compassionate
               leave from Parkhurst to go visit her in
               hospital.  We were always mates, me and
               Jenny's mum.  I like to think they're
               together again now.  Y'know.  Heavenly
               choir.

     Beat.

                         ELAINE
               The address Jenny gave me, that wasn't a
               prison, was it?

                         WILSON
               Nah, accommodation address.

                         ELAINE
               What's that, like a P.O. box.

                         WILSON
               Something like that, yeah.

                         ELAINE
               Where you get your bank statements.

     Wilson gives a laugh.

                         WILSON
               Well, you gotta have something permanent,
               don'tcha.  Even if it's a hole in the
               wall.  No matter which jug I might be
               transferred to, I always got someone on
               the out checks up on it for me, see.
               Anything I need to know, comes round on
               visitor's day -- word in my ear.

     Elaine pauses.

                         ELAINE
               Some word.

     Wilson leans on the wall overlooking the black ocean.  Sound
     of WAVES gently lapping the beach.

                         WILSON
               I already knew.  Knew beforehand.  When
               was it supposed to have happened? -- two
               o'clock in the morning, Eddie said.

                         ELAINE
                   (watching him)
               That's what was estimated.

                         WILSON
               Eight hours difference between here and
               London.  Would've been, what, ten in the
               morning, my time.  I was just coming out
               on the yard.  Now, I was in the habit of
               saving my newspaper till then.  Bit of
               fresh air, stretch me legs -- well,
               stretch the day out, really, that's what
               you wanna do.  And I'll tell ya:  I
               couldn't open the paper.  Could not pry
               the pages apart -- it was like they was
               glued together.  That's how weak my hands
               went.  Thought I was having heart attack,
               only I knew I wasn't.  Bloke come up to
               me, he says, Dave, he says, you've gone
               all white.  I said, fuck me, I've been in
               prison half my life, what d'ya expect.
               But he was dead on, 'cause I could feel
               the blood drain right out of me head.
               And I knew ...
                   (beat)
               Something had happened to Jen.

     They stand here a while.  Listening to the BREAKERS hit the
     shore.

                                                               CUT.

     INT. ELAINE'S APARTMENT.  NIGHT.

     They come in.

                         ELAINE
               Make yourself at home.  Steal something.

     That gets her a look.

                         ELAINE
               There's nothing I can't afford to lose.

     She goes to make coffee.  Wilson looks around.

                         ELAINE
               Do you even know who Terry Valentine is?

                         WILSON
               Well, I gathered something from the
               article what Eddie sent me.  Some sort of
               pop music producer, wasn't it.

     Maybe a smile from Elaine at the quaintness of "pop" music.

                         ELAINE
               Rock n' roll, is what we called it.  He's
               sort of a forgotten figure now, but back
               when the West Coast was the grooviest
               place on earth, Terry Valentine was where
               all the happenings happened.  More of a
               kind of promoter, I guess, whatever that
               means.  Just took that whole Southern
               California Sixties Zeitgeist and ran with
               it.  Packaged and sold it.  Made out like
               a bandit.

     FLASH CUTS:

     VALENTINE. At home. Watching as Adhara undresses, either
     deliberately for him, or just casually. She smiles as she
     notices he's looking.

                         WILSON
               What's he done lately.

     That line pregnant with meaning.  Elaine looks at him.
     Avoids answering the question actually implied there.

                         ELAINE
                   (brings a tray over)
               Lives high off the hog and waits for the
               next big thing.  Like me -- but on a
               grander scale of failure.

                         WILSON
               Now, you shouldn't run yourself down.  My
               employer, Mr. Lindgren --

                         ELAINE
               -- Your employer?

                         WILSON
               -- Mr. Lindgren.

                         ELAINE
               Who's Mr. Lindgren?

                         WILSON
               My employer.

                         ELAINE
               What line is he in.

                         WILSON
               Proprietor of a London firm.  Of
               longstanding.

                         ELAINE
               I see.

                         WILSON
               Based in London, but with international
               concerns.

                         ELAINE
               I bet.

                         WILSON
               Various enterprises, style of thing.

                         ELAINE
               I thought you said you never did an
               honest day's work in your life.

                         WILSON
               Well, not to say Mr. Lindgren is
               dishonest, exactly.

                         ELAINE
                   (she gets the picture)
               Right.

                         WILSON
               Anyhow, he's always saying to me, Dave,
               never run yourself down, son -- 'cause
               there'll always be plenty of people
               willing to do it for you.

                         ELAINE
               In what capacity are you employed by this
               Mr. Lindgren?

                         WILSON
               This and that.  Y'know.  Ways and means.

                         ELAINE
               -- When he wants someone run down, you're
               willing to do it for him.

     They sort of come together -- in mutual understanding -- and
     sit down.  Coffee steaming.

                         ELAINE
               So what's the deal.  You and Terry
               Valentine at twenty paces.  Is that what
               this is about.

                         WILSON
               Why not.

                         ELAINE
               Are you serious.

                         WILSON
               Have you ever known me not to be.

     Elaine looks away:

                         ELAINE
               You fuckin' guys and your dicks.

                         WILSON
               What'd you want me to do.  Stay at home,
               twiddlin' me thumbs.  Doing sweet F.A.
               [Fuck All].

                         ELAINE
               You don't believe it was a car accident.

                         WILSON
               What do you think.

                         ELAINE
               Terry's never going to give you
               satisfaction.  Not the type.

                         WILSON
               Depends, don' it.

                         ELAINE
               On what.  What makes you so certain.

                         WILSON
               I'll bloody well ask him.

                         ELAINE
               There's the phone.  You want his number.

     WILSON

     That look again.

                         WILSON
               I got his number.

     ELAINE

     Past caring.

                         ELAINE
               I'm not going to help you.

     She goes into a bathroom.  Shutting the door behind her.

     WILSON

     Sips coffee.  Bites into a cookie.

                                                               CUT.

     EXT. HILLSIDE.  UNDERBRUSH.  LATE AFTERNOON.

     Thickets part and we SEE Wilson scrambling up a rather steep
     hill.  Coming to a ridge where he settles down to look at
     something O.S.  His expression changes by degrees from
     curiosity to dawning realization to a kind of frustrated
     disappointment.

     INT. WILSON'S CAR (ON THE ROAD BELOW).  LATE AFTERNOON.

     Ed sits in here, RADIO on.  Wilson appears out of the brush,
     gets in.  Ed turns the radio down.

                         ED
                   (mindful of the odd car driving
                    past)
               Told you you wouldn't be able to see
               through that gate.

                         WILSON
               Gate's open.  I had a butcher's at the
               house.

                         ED
                   (alarmed)
               Who'd you butcher at the house?

                         WILSON
               Butcher's hook.  Look.
                   (doesn't anyone speak English
                    in this fucking country?)
               I don't much reckon those minders of his.

                         ED
               Huh?

                         WILSON
               He's brought in the heavy mob.

                         ED
               What?

                         WILSON
               Extra muscle.  Bodyguards.

                         ED
               Has he?

                         WILSON
               They look a right load of wallies.
               Patrolling back and forth outside the
               gate, all ponced up like the fuckin'
               Household Cavalry.
                   (ducks suddenly)
               Watch it.

     As one of the "bodyguards" runs by, only fleetingly glimpsed
     by us.

                         ED
               That was one of them?

                         WILSON
                   (sits up again)
               See what I mean?  Wearing bloomin'
               uniforms n' all.

     Off Ed's perplexed look ...

     EXT. HILLSIDE UNDERBRUSH.  LATE AFTERNOON.

     Wilson settles into position again, this time with Ed.

                         WILSON
               Look at that.

     Ed just laughs.

                         WILSON
               What's so fucking funny?

                         ED
               Those aren't guards.  They're valets.

     POV

     Now we SEE what Wilson had mistaken for Valentine's private
     army.  Half a dozen VALETS outside Valentine's hilltop home.
     Dressed in matching attire, a couple of them wielding walkie-
     talkies.

     RESUME WILSON AND ED

     Ed's still laughing.

                         WILSON
               Valets.  What d'ya mean valets.  What is
               he, then, the Earl of fucking Doncaster?

                         ED
               Valets.  They park cars.  He's having a
               party.

                                                               CUT.

     EXT. VALENTINE'S HOUSE.  LATE AFTERNOON.

     Wilson's car pulls up.  He and Ed get out.  Wilson engages in
     a mini tug-of-war with a Valet over his car key, it so rubs
     him the wrong way having to give it up.

                         WILSON
               Keep it handy, mate, all right?  We're
               not stopping long.

     He gestures, apparently getting the message across that he
     wants the car kept close by.

                         VALET
               Yes, sir.

                         WILSON
               Cheers.

     Exchanges the key for a card -- which he turns over in his
     hand and studies curiously as they head inside.

                         WILSON
               Valets, eh?  Aren't we all la-de-da.

                         ED
                   (nervous being here)
               I thought you just wanted to check out
               the house, man.

                         WILSON
               Well, that's what we're doin', n' it.

                         ED
               No one else is even here yet.

                         WILSON
               First in, first out, that's me.

     Looking over to note the multi-car GARAGE off the main house.

     INT. VALENTINE'S HOUSE.  AFTERNOON.

     Wilson and Ed are among the first to arrive.  A smattering of
     other GUESTS.  Elaborate catered cuisine.  They mosey over to
     the wet bar.

                         BARTENDER
               Gentlemen.  What can I get you.

                         WILSON
                   (suggesting Ed take first
                    crack)
               Dubonnet with a twist?  Baby sham?
               Tomato juice and Tabasco sauce?

     By now his whole dynamic with Ed is a verbal tease.

                         ED
                   (to Bartender)
               Got a Coke?

     INT. VALENTINE'S BEDROOM.  AFTERNOON.

     Valentine is checking himself in a full-length mirror.  TV on
     in background, sound low (ENTERTAINMENT WEEK!).  Not quite
     satisfied, Valentine crosses to the bathroom.

     BATHROOM

     Valentine takes one more closer look.

                         ADHARA (O.S.)
               You have the same posters.

     Valentine turns.

                         VALENTINE
               Hmm?

     ADHARA

     Is lounging in the large tub.  Staring dreamily at a couple
     of framed posters on the walls:  more 60's psychedelia.

                         ADHARA
               That you have down at your office.

     Valentine sits on the edge of the tub.  With a nostalgic air
     as he looks at her:  the embodiment of youth.

                         VALENTINE
               Different ones.

     He strokes her wet skin.  They kiss lightly.

                         ADHARA
               I like the colors.

                         VALENTINE
               We all did.

                         ADHARA
               It must've been a time.  A golden moment.

     Beat.

                         VALENTINE
               Have you ever dreamed of a place ... you
               don't really recall ever having been
               to ... a place that probably doesn't even
               exist except in your imagination ...
               somewhere far away, half-remembered when
               you wake up ... but when you were there you
               spoke the language, you knew your way
               around ...
                   (significant pause)
               That was the 60's.

     With that exit line (practiced?), he starts to go.

     Then pauses, turns again.

                         VALENTINE
               No, it wasn't.  Wasn't either.

     Comes back to her.  Faraway look in his eyes.

                         VALENTINE
               It was '66 ... early '67.
                   (comes back to now)
               That was all.

     He goes.

     INT. VALENTINE'S HOUSE.  DOWNSTAIRS HALLWAY.  AFTERNOON.

     Wilson wanders around, exploring the house.  Comes to a wall
     of photographes.  Casually scanning them as he passes slowly
     by, he's caught up short by one.

     POV

     A framed photo of JENNY, his daughter.

     WILSON

     A series of emotions play over his face.  He turns -- SEES
     Valentine coming down the stairs.  Valentine joins the party
     without noticing him.

     BY THE BUFFET TABLE

     Ed peruses the available food.  Valentine comes over to check
     it out.  Glances at Ed without recognizing him.

                         VALENTINE
               Hi.

     And goes away.  Leaving Ed more nervous than ever.

     INT. VALENTINE'S HOUSE.  UPSTAIRS HALLWAY.  AFTERNOON.

     Wilson has come up here.  Peeks into one room.  Moves along to
     another:  the master bedroom.  Opens the door gently.

     INT. MASTER BATHROOM.

     Adhara is still enjoying her bath.

     INT. MASTER BEDROOM.

     Wilson enters.  Careful.  Aware that someone's in the adjoining
     bathroom.  The soft RIPPLE of WATER from in there.  Perhaps he
     even glimpses her through the door as he boldly looks around.
     He notices a video camera on a tripod, a cord running to the
     television.  Suddenly we hear the CHIRP of a cellular phone.

     BATHROOM

     Adhara reacts.

                         ADHARA
               Shit.

     She gets out of the tub and goes for the nearest towel.
     Quickly wrapping herself, she exits.

     BEDROOM

     Adhara enters and goes for her purse.  She pulls the RINGING
     phone out and answers it.

                         ADHARA
               Hello?  Hey!  Great.  You got my message?
               Yeah.  No, Crestview Terrace, not
               Crestview Place.  Yeah, there's like three
               different ways up the hill; the quick way
               is to bear to the right.  Sure.  Okay.
               Okay.  'Bye!

     She hangs up and begins toweling her hair.  After a moment
     she stops.  Something isn't right.  She looks around the
     room, and her eyes stop on the TV.  Her brow furrows, trying
     to place the familiar image on the screen:  a girl towel-
     drying her hair by the bed.

                         ADHARA
               That's me.

     She looks over to see the video camera, which has been turned
     on and pointed toward the bed.  She's not sure if it's funny
     or creepy.

                                                               CUT.

     INT. VALENTINE'S HOUSE.  DOWNSTAIRS.  AFTERNOON.

     Valentine mingling, all smiles and movement.

     WILSON

     At the foot of the stairs.  Watches him, all stillness and
     intensity.

     VALENTINE

     Catches Wilson's eye for a nanosecond, does a subtle double
     take, then moves on.

     INT. VALENTINE'S HOUSE.  UPSTAIRS HALLWAY.  AFTERNOON.

     Adhara, dressed, looking great, exits the bedroom and heads
     for the stairwell.

     INT. VALENTINE'S HOUSE.  DOWNSTAIRS.  AFTERNOON.

     Adhara descends the stairs.

     WILSON

     Turning to SEE her as she comes down.

     ADHARA

     Makes her way across the room to Valentine.

                         ADHARA
               Hey, I thought you weren't a buffet
               person.

                         VALENTINE
               I'm a gracious host.

     WILSON

     Watching them, when --

                         GUY
               Excuse me?

     Wilson looks at him.  Reluctantly.

                         GUY
               Don't you work with Ian?

                         WILSON
               Ian?

                         GUY
               I could swear I met you with Ian at the
               EMI offices in London.

                         WILSON
               Sorry.  Wasn't me.

                         GUY
               You sure?

                         WILSON
               Unless I'm not who I think I am.

                         GUY
               That's too bad.  Ian's got a good thing
               going over there.

                         WILSON
               Yeah?

                         GUY
               Turned that place completely around.  180
               degrees.

                         WILSON
               No kidding.

                         GUY
               What I like about Ian, he believes in a
               chain of command, but not a chain of
               respect, you understand what I'm saying?

                         WILSON
               Right.  Chain of respect.  That's good,
               that.

                         GUY
               Yeah.  I really admire the guy.  Well.
               Good to meet you.

                         WILSON
               Yeah.  Cheers, mate.

     The Guy leaves.  Wilson sees that Adhara is now on the other
     side of the room, separated from Valentine.  He heads for
     her.

     VALENTINE

     Still dealing with people desperate to be the focus of his
     attention.  He notices:

     WILSON AND ADHARA

     Talking in a corner.  She seems attentive.

     VALENTINE

     In a SERIES OF CUTS, still being the gracious host, still
     keeping his eyes on:

     WILSON AND ADHARA

     Who, in a SERIES OF CUTS, continue to talk.  Finally, they
     separate, Wilson heading outside onto a deck.

     VALENTINE

     Excuses himself from a group of sycophants and goes to her.

     ADHARA

     Valentine approaches and begins talking to her, low.  After a
     few moments of conversation, they both look toward:

     WILSON

     On the deck outside.  Joining Ed, who's taken refuge out here
     with a plate of food.  What Wilson can't belleve when he SEES
     it -- is that behind Valentine's house, which is on top of a
     high hill, is nothing but desolate scrub canyon.  On the other
     side of the railing around the deck, which is surely less
     than regulation height, is a sheer drop into an abyss.

                         WILSON (cont'd)
                   (jumps back with only slightly
                    affected vertigo)
               Flipping heck.

     Ed, a little more accustomed to L.A. architecture, nods in
     agreement.

                         ED
               If you could afford a house like this you
               would buy a house like this.

     Wilson edges forward to the rail again.

                         WILSON
               What are we standing on?

                         ED
               Faith.

     They stand there looking out.  Quite a view once you get used
     to it.  Breeze.

                         ED (cont'd)
                   (nods to the hazy distance)
               You could see the sea from here if you
               could see it.

                         WILSON
               Could you?

     But now Ed gives Wilson a nudge -- SEEING that Valentine
     inside the house is making his way out here.

                         WILSON
               Why don't you go nick one of those little
               cooker what's its warming up the sausages
               cocktail and meet me in the garage.  Look
               about for a toolbox while you're at it.

     Ed considers.  His is not to reason why.

                         ED
               Okay.

     Ed moves off.  Valentine steps up, smile fully loaded.

                         VALENTINE
               Hi.  Terry Valentine.

     He extends his hand.  Wilson shakes it.

                         WILSON
               Pleasure.

                         VALENTINE
               Have we met?  There's something I can't
               quite --

                         WILSON
               EMI in London.  I work with Ian.

                         VALENTINE
               Ah.

                         WILSON
               You must know Ian.

                         VALENTINE
               I don't.

                         WILSON
               Great bloke.  Really turned things around
               there.  180 degrees.

                         VALENTINE
               I suppose that's good, unless things were
               fine the way they were.

                         WILSON
               Oh, I think a shake-up was in order.
               Definitely.  Otherwise, people get lazy,
               don't they?  Forgetful.  Start thinking
               they can get away with things.  Gotta
               shake 'em up now and again, make 'em pay
               attention.

     Wilson looks at him.  Valentine looks back.  Something about
     those eyes ...

                         EXCITED GUY
               Terry, Terry ...

     The Excited Guy appears, tugging at Valentine.

                         WILSON
               Glad I got to meet you.

                         EXCITED GUY
               Ter ... Ter ... you gotta ...

                         VALENTINE
               Thanks.  You, too.

                         WILSON
               Be seein' you.

     The Excited Guy ushers Valentine away.  Wilson watches him
     go.

                         EXCITED GUY
               Charles Grodin is here.

                                                               CUT.

     INT. VALENTINE'S GARAGE.  AFTERNOON.

     Ed, waiting.  Wilson enters.

                         WILSON
               Got it?

     Ed displays the Sterno.

                         WILSON
               Toolbox?

     Ed points to a table, where a toolbox sits.  Wilson crosses
     to it, begins going through the contents.

                         WILSON
               Put the Sterno on the ground, near the
               center of the garage.

     Ed does.  Wilson pulls a brace-and-bit from the toolbox and
     crosses to the rear of one of the cars.  Dropping to the
     ground, he bores a hole in the gas tank.  Ed raises his
     eyebrows and moves toward the door.  Wilson crosses to the
     other car and puts a hole in that gas tank as well.  Then he
     puts the brace-and-bit back in the toolbox and heads for the
     exit, Ed right behind him, giving a quick backward glance.

     THE GASOLINE

     Spills out, slowly but steadily, and slithers toward the
     garage door.

     EXT. BETWEEN VALENTINE'S HOUSE AND GARAGE.  AFTERNOON.

     Wilson and Ed walk briskly along the path.

                         WILSON
                   (gives Ed parking ticket)
               Bring the motor around.  Bang out in
               front, right?

                         ED
               You goin' back inside?

                         WILSON
               One thing I need.

     INT. VALENTINE'S HOUSE.  DOWNSTAIRS.  AFTERNOON.

     Valentine is talking to Gordon, his beefy bodyguard, and
     looking around.  He stops as he sees Wilson once again
     stepping onto the deck.  He points Wilson out to Gordon, who
     nods and heads for the deck.

     EXT. VALENTINE'S HOUSE.  AFTERNOON.

     Ed hands the ticket to a Valet.  He exchanges looks with a
     couple of the other Valets.

     INT. VALENTINE'S HOUSE.  DOWNSTAIRS.  AFTERNOON.

     Valentine is talking to Adhara, who is introducing her
     Girlfriend.  As Valentine greets her, he glances outside
     where Gordon is approaching Wilson on the deck.

     EXT. DECK.

     Wilson SEES Gordon approaching.  Gets ready to greet him.
     Removes cigarette from mouth, drops it to floor of deck,
     presses it out under his shoe.  Limbers up his shoulders in a
     subtle way.

     Gordon coming towards him.  As if to challenge Wilson's
     legitimacy as an invited guest.  Closer.  About to speak.

     But Wilson doesn't even give him a chance to do that.  In
     quick succession:  Wilson HEAD BUTTS Gordon, splintering his
     nose; KNEES him in the groin; then, using the knee for
     leverage, grabs Gordon by the lapels -- and heaves him over
     the railing!

     It happened so fast that if anyone else is nearby they
     probably didn't even notice -- or didn't readily grasp what
     they saw.

     INT. VALENTINE'S HOUSE.

     Valentine had turned his attention back to Adhara and her
     Girlfriend.  When he glances back to the deck he's a little
     concerned not to see Gordon anywhere out there anymore --
     just Wilson coming back in.

     WILSON

     Adjusting his jacket, walking back through the house.  Behind
     him, people are rushing to the railing and looking over.  A
     few yells of "Call an ambulance!" etc. are heard.

     VALENTINE

     Moves that way.

     WILSON

     Moving across the room towards the front door.  They are
     heading right toward each other.

     WILSON AND VALENTINE

     Pass each other, eyes locked, almost dream-like.  Wilson's
     eyes cold, though with the hint of a smile.  Valentine throws
     a last look back before reaching the deck.

     EXT. DECK.

     Valentine pushes through to look over the railing.

     HIS POV

     Gordon -- a crumpled, inert heap way down the hill below.

     VALENTINE

     Turns to look toward the front door.  Wilson not to be seen.
     Valentine pushes through the crowd toward the door.

     EXT. VALENTINE'S HOUSE.  AFTERNOON.

     Valentine emerges in time to see Ed and Wilson pulling away.
     Wilson looks at him, impassive, through the passenger window.

     AVERY

     Is just arriving in his car.  Valentine gestures at him.
     Suddenly we HEAR a loud, bass-heavy WHHUUUMMMPPP.

     Valentine (and a few others) turn toward the sound, which
     came from:

     THE GARAGE

     There is smoke coming from under the door.

     EXT. CANYON ROAD.  AFTERNOON.

     Wilson's car practically tobogganing back down the hill.
     BOOM!  We hear an explosion from back UP the hill.

     INT. WILSON'S CAR.

     Ed jumps -- though he's driving.  The gas pedal his most
     pressing concern.  Negotiating the dangerously winding road
     comes second.  Exhilaration mixed with panic.

                         WILSON
               Steady on.

                         ED
               You steady on, man.  What the fuck else
               did you do back there.

     EXT. ROAD.

     An especially sharp curve looms ahead.

     WILSON

     Flinches, grabs a handhold.

     CURVE

     Car makes it around on two side wheels.

     WILSON

     Gulps.

                         WILSON
               Bloody hell.

     Ed regains control.

     AVERY

     In his car, takes a different turn.

     EXT. ROAD.  CAR.

     Swerves some more curves.  Should be some sense here that a
     similar skyline route would have been taken by Wilson's
     daughter on her final drive.

     INT. WILSON'S CAR.

                         ED
               Why didn't you just kill him, you had the
               chance.

                         WILSON
               That would be too easy.

                         ED
               Too easy?

                         WILSON
               He's gotta know why.

                         ED
               You think a fuckin' guy like that ever
               will?  What more do you want, man?

     Suddenly out of nowhere -- (a side street) -- BAM! -- another
     car shoots out to cut them off, sideswiping them.

     EXT. ROAD.

     Wilson's car SKIDS into a spin from the impact.

     THE OTHER CAR

     It's Avery.  Chased them via a shortcut down the mountain.
     Now jumps out of his car, levels a shotgun at them and pumps
     off a BLAST.

     WILSON'S CAR

     BAM! -- the trunk pops open as the car rights itself.  Avery
     FIRES again, but the upended trunk is a kind of shield,
     deflecting the shot.

     INT. WILSON'S CAR.

     Despite the fact that Ed is still in the driver's seat (and
     managed rather skillfully to avoid crashing) -- Wilson acts
     like he's not there, grabs the steering wheel, jams the car
     into reverse, virtually sitting on Ed as he pounds his own
     foot onto the gas pedal -- and with his ferocious eyes
     monitoring the door-mirror, steamrolls the car backwards
     towards Avery.

     EXT. ROAD.

     Wilson reverses his car like a speeding tank:  SMASHING into
     Avery's car.  Pushing it right off the edge of the road.

     AVERY

     Falls backwards to the ground as he gets the hell out of the
     way.

     WILSON

     Jumps out of his car.  Gun drawn.  Advancing on Avery with it
     pointed.

     AVERY'S CAR

     CRASHING through underbrush down the steep bank of the
     hillside.

     WILSON'S FACE

     SOUND of the divebombing car OVER.  Another pointed echo of
     his daughter's fate.

     AVERY

     Their eyes meet momentarily.  And before Wilson can shoot,
     Avery rolls over the edge of the road himself.

     ED

     Calls frantically to Wilson from their car.

                         ED
               C'mon, man!  C'mon!

     SIRENS in the distance.

     WILSON

     That consuming rage overtaken him again for a second.  But
     the exigencies of the moment snap him out of it.

     WILSON

     Turns on a dime, goes back to the car.  Before he's halfway
     in, Ed's driving them away again.  Trunk at the back BANGING
     up and down, up and down.

     AVERY

     Pulls himself back up to the road.  Brushing himself off.
     Looking the way they went.

     He gently tosses his shotgun down into some thick brush where
     maybe he'll retrieve it later.

     EXT. VALENTINE'S HOUSE.  AFTERNOON.

     Avery returns, sweating, walking back up the road to where
     all the action is.  Party guests milling outside, waiting for
     their cars so they can leave.  A fire truck, a police car.
     SMOKE pouring out of Valentine's garage.

     Valentine finishes talking to a couple of COPS.  Walks over to
     Avery.

                         AVERY
               You should have let me do the talking.

                         VALENTINE
               Why, because you're my security
               consultant?
                   (insecure)
               This cocksucker nearly burnt my house
               down.

                         AVERY
                   (more concerned about police
                    presence)
               What did you tell them.

     Valentine blows air, runs a hand through his hair.

                         VALENTINE
               I told them a long-time employee flipped
               out.  Had a drug problem, refused
               counselling.  Set the garage on fire,
               then committed suicide.  One of my
               "guests" tried to stop him -- but how do
               you stop Gordon.

     In this context meaning how did that rangy Englishman do it.

                         VALENTINE
               I mean, Gordon must weigh a good four
               hundred pounds.

                         AVERY
               Heavier than that now.  But are there any
               drugs in that stomach to back up your
               story.

                         VALENTINE
               As it happens.  I didn't make that part
               up.

                         AVERY
               And where is this guest?  Don't they want
               to interview him.

                         VALENTINE
               I don't know everyone here.  He was so
               traumatized he split.
                   (another notion)
               Maybe he was Gordon's pusher.

     Avery stares at Valentine.  Impressed at him thinking on his
     feet.

                         VALENTINE
               Where do you think he is, Mike.

                         AVERY
                   (already turning)
               We'll find him.

                         VALENTINE
                   (stops him)
               No.  I mean.  Not even your people should
               be involved.  Right?  It's too close now.

                         AVERY
               You could use a few of my prime
               shitkickers up here.

                         VALENTINE
               You think I'm staying?

                         AVERY
               There's already gonna be talk about how
               people close to you keep falling into
               canyons.

                         VALENTINE
               Well, can we make it one more.  Nowhere
               the fuck near me.

     He's being glib, but he's being serious.  His open-handed
     gesture inquiring of Avery:  are you up to the task?

                         AVERY
               I have other resources.

     He turns to go.

     EXT. VALENTINE'S HOUSE.  CANYON.  AFTERNOON.

     The huge dead bulk of Gordon hoisted back up to the deck by a
     paramedic team.

     INT. VALENTINE'S HOUSE.

     Valentine comes back in.  In the living room beyond, Adhara
     stands anxiously, where she's been waiting for him.  Cops
     visible outside on the deck, peering over the edge.

     VALENTINE

     Heading that way.  Then stops.  Backtracks.  Something
     peripherally had caught his eye and he returns to it.  His
     wall of photographs.

     AN EMPTY FRAME

     The one that had contained the picture of Jenny.

                                                               CUT.

     INT. WILSON'S CAR.  AFTERNOON.

     Safely down the hill.  Driving away in traffic, Ed calmer
     now.

     WILSON

     Pulls the rolled-up photograph of his daughter out of his
     jacket and looks at it.

                                                               CUT.

     INT. POOL HALL.  NIGHT.

     Two characters stand, leaning, against a back wall.  Staring
     ahead, without purpose.  Halfheartedly watching a game of
     pool in progress.  Just hanging out.  Strange, threatening
     characters.  One of them is young.  Lean, hungry-looking.
     STACY is his name.  A shrewd, scheming kid.  But definitely a
     little unhinged.  Weirder is his companion.  UNCLE JOHN.  The
     title isn't one of courtesy.  He's an actual blood relative.
     Maybe 25 years older than Stacy.  But intellectually younger.
     Physically, much bigger.  The man is huge.  Nevertheless, the
     safer of the two -- until Stacy tells him otherwise.  Way
     they're standing next to each other suggests the ease they
     feel in each other's company.  Tight bond.  They're good
     buddies.

     AVERY

     Walks in.  Stops to look around.  Spots his two freaks.
     Walks toward them.

     DOORWAY

     A mysterious black man has followed Avery in.  THOMPSON is
     his name.  He hangs back and watches.

     AVERY

     Makes contact.

                         AVERY
               Stacy.

     Stacy turns to see him.  Uncle John looks vacantly.

                         STACY
                   (bored)
               Hey.

                         AVERY
               Come over here.

     That was in the way of an order.  He nods around the corner
     where it's less crowded.  Stacy stops Uncle John from
     following, and goes after Avery.

     THOMPSON

     At the bar.  Keeping his eye on them.

     AVERY

     Speaks softly.  Alone with Stacy.

                         AVERY
               How they goin', kid?

                         STACY
               Not bad.

                         AVERY
               How'd you like to kill someone for me?

                         STACY
               Okay.

     Avery gives him an envelope.

                         AVERY
               Same as last time -- the rest after.

                         STACY
                   (pockets it)
               Where do we go?

                         AVERY
               When you find the guy, you'll know.

                         STACY
               What shit is this.  I just do it.  I
               don't prepare it.

                         AVERY
               I'll point you in the right direction,
               but you'll have to take it to the end-
               zone.  He's a hit-and-run gunman -- I
               figure he's not cruising the Polo Lounge.

                         STACY
               This is un-fucking professional.

                         AVERY
               See, a successful man like me has
               limitations -- I lose touch at a street
               level.  So I have to depend on a smart
               boy like you who's closer to the nitty
               and the gritty than I am.

                         STACY
               Fuck you, Mr. whatever-your-name is.
               This is a lifestyle I embrace.

                         AVERY
               That's why I'm letting you take care of
               this.  I'm the one with appearances to
               maintain.  But who gives a shit about
               you?  Not even God.

                                                               CUT.

     INT. WILSON'S MOTEL.  NIGHT.

     Wilson on the bed.  Watching TV (ACCESS HOLLYWOOD!).  KNOCK
     at door.  He turns down the TV.  Takes a .45 from the springs
     under the bed.  Looks carefully through the peephole in the
     door.

     Opens it.  Elaine has come to visit.  Lets her in.  After
     closing the door resumes his position on the bed.

     Elaine looks around.

                         ELAINE
               I was in the neighborhood.  I come down
               here quite a bit.  Watch the planes
               taking off.
                   (re this motel)
               Study the architecture of early David
               Lynch.

     But she doesn't really have it in her to be ironic right now.
     Leans back against the door.

     Wilson remains silent.  He's done the same to Elaine now that
     he did to Ed.  Almost magically induced her to a confessional
     verge.

     Elaine, too, isn't sure she wants to be complicit in this
     revenge tragedy.  But here goes:

                         ELAINE
               Jenny was supposed to come to my place
               that night.  She called me, asked if she
               could come over.  She and Terry had been
               -- having some trouble.  Lately.  I don't
               know about what.  On this occasion, it
               reached some sort of crisis point.

                         WILSON
               She told you all about my details but not
               about his.  Lovely.

                         ELAINE
               She'd never called me like that before.
               She sounded more ... pissed off -- angry --
               than upset or afraid.  But she never
               turned up.  I called the house but only
               got the answer machine.  When they found
               her ... she'd been going the wrong way.
               Not the direction she'd have gone if
               she'd been coming to see me.  Or coming
               straight to see me.  Who knows.  Maybe she
               just wanted to drive.

     She looks at Wilson.  Shrugs.  That's it.  That's all.  Isn't
     it?

                         WILSON
                   (measured)
               How did you come to have my address?
               Found it, did you.  Among her things.

                         ELAINE
               You think Terry gave me access to her
               things?  Probably sold her clothes.

                         WILSON
                   (gently urging)
               And how did you get it?

     Elaine looks at him.

                         ELAINE
               She gave me your address.

     Wilson nods.

                         ELAINE (cont'd)
                   (starting to realize)
               Not long before ...
                   (realizing)
               She said if anything ever happened ...
                   (realizes)
               That's how you know.  That's why you're
               so sure.
                   (realization)
               Jenny's telling you.

     She's sitting on the bed now.

                                                               CUT.

     EXT. MEAN STREET.  NIGHT.

     Stacy, putting on a jacket that says "Bomb Hanoi" comes out
     of the pool hall.  Uncle John in tow.

                         UNCLE JOHN
               How much.

                         STACY
               Five thousand.

                         UNCLE JOHN
                   (impressed)
               Hey.

                         STACY
                   (taps pocket)
               I got half.

                         UNCLE JOHN
               Makin' trouble for someone?

                         STACY
               Yeah.

                         UNCLE JOHN
               Which kind?

                         STACY
               The forever kind.

     BEHIND THEM

     Thompson, the mysterious black man, watches them from the
     hall doorway.

                                                               CUT.

     EXT. WILSON'S MOTEL.  MORNING.

     Early.

     INT. WILSON'S ROOM.

     Wilson and Elaine.  Getting dressed.  She's in pantyhose.
     Fastening a bra.  He's got trousers on, reaching for a shirt.

                         WILSON
               How long've you lived here?

     Elaine sits on the bed, fastening her skirt.  Her bra strap
     cuts across her bare back.

                         ELAINE
               This town's been chewing my flesh
               since ... what we now refer to as "the
               early 70's."
                   (thinks back)
               Christ, my past became nostalgia and no
               one even asked me.

                         WILSON
               Early 70's.  I was away.
                   (tries to remember)
               Maidstone.  Possibly Brixton.

                         ELAINE
               These more highlights from the Zagat
               prison guide?

     Wilson looks at her:  she's the one who goes to bed with ex-
     cons.

                         WILSON
               You don't seem bothered.

                         ELAINE
               You don't know how I've compromised my
               standards.

                         WILSON
               Tell us about it.

                         ELAINE
               It's too involved; a lifetime of non-
               involvement.  Anywhere else I'd be an
               interesting little number, here I'm just
               SAG number forty-eight thousand and one.
                   (quickly)
               SAG meaning Screen Actor's Guild.

                         WILSON
               Oh, I was gonna say ...

                         ELAINE
               Still, there have been rewards.  It's
               sunny.  And some of the producers who
               call even have credits.

                         WILSON
               I can see the attraction.

     She glances up at him to try and see how he means that.  Is
     he looking at her or out the window?

                         ELAINE
               What did you do?  To make them take the
               early 70's away from you.

                         WILSON
               A jeweller's up the West End.  We
               tunnelled our way under the shop floor
               from the public lavatory down the road.
               Filthy work.  Trouble was, the bloody
               thing collapsed -- after we'd made the
               grab, 'n all.  Would you Adam n' Eve it.

                         ELAINE
               You mean if they'd nabbed you before you
               actually broke and entered you would only
               have been charged with making a mess.

                         WILSON
               We were lucky to be nicked.  Me and the
               lads went down there Sunday evening, we
               weren't discovered till the Monday.  Good
               job we were still breathing.

                         ELAINE
               It didn't discourage you, though.

                         WILSON
               Hey?

                         ELAINE
               From pursuing your chosen profession.

                         WILSON
               I'll tell ya something:  it made me a
               model prisoner.  Put me right off any
               escape attempts.  Tunnel my way to
               freedom after that experience?  Not
               bloody likely.

                         ELAINE
               I was inside once.  I punched a cop at a
               demo.

                         WILSON
               Did you.  What was that in aid of?

                         ELAINE
               Who remembers.

                         WILSON
               Get seven years, did you?

                         ELAINE
               Overnight.  What about just now?

                         WILSON
               Just now?
                   (playful, goes over, ready for
                    more)
               Overnight?

                         ELAINE
               You have been away.
                   (lies back, regards him
                    carefully)
               Or is all this just new to you?

                         WILSON
               It's true.  Has to be said.  I got off to
               a slow start.

                         ELAINE
               I don't believe it.

                         WILSON
               Honest.  Didn't know where to look till I
               was 21.

                         ELAINE
               Pushing the legal limit even then.

     He stands again, vaguely disappointing her.

                         WILSON
               Me mate introduced me to a woman up the
               street.  Funnily enough, she was married
               to a milkman.  Straight up.  I said,
               "Good is she?  Been around?"  He said,
               "Good?  Listen, mush, it's not that she's
               been around, it's that she's been around
               hell of a long time."

     He laughs uproariously at that.  But the point is:  he's sort
     of complimenting both Elaine and himself.  They've been
     around, had their knocks, they've lasted.  Elaine remains
     unsmiling.

     Still leaning back on her elbows on the bed, in bra, skirt,
     hose, no shoes.  She asks again the question Wilson avoided
     answering.

                         ELAINE
               Your most recent incarceration.  What was
               that for?

     And again he evades the answer she wants.

                         WILSON
               It was for nine years.
                   (buttoning his shirt)
               The last nine years.

                                                               CUT.

     EXT. PACIFIC COAST HIGHWAY.  MORNING.

     For the first time, we see the Pacific coastline.  Impressive.

     And a sleek Italian sports car.  Heading north.

     INT. SPORTS CAR.

     Valentine at the wheel.  Adhara besides him.

                         ADHARA
               I've lived in L.A. all my life, I've
               never done this drive.

                         VALENTINE
               All your life.  That happened while I
               swam the length of my pool.

     Adhara looks back over her shoulder.  Checking the road
     behind.

                         VALENTINE
               What's the matter?

                         ADHARA
               Nothing.  I guess it's hard to pass on
               this road.

                         VALENTINE
               The freeway's faster, but lacks a certain
               majesty.

                         ADHARA
               Just feels like the car behind has been
               following us the longest time.

                         VALENTINE
               I sure hope so.

     INT. THE CAR BEHIND.

     A big utility vehicle.  With Avery in the front passenger
     seat.  And three bodyguards he's brought along to protect
     Valentine.  RICK driving, TOM and LARRY in the back.

                         TOM
               All I'm sayin' is travel time shouldn't
               be the same rate.  Travel time is down
               time, right?  I mean, we're not even in
               the same car as the client.
                   (to Avery)
               You told me the job was at the house.
               When we get to it.  Well, are we shadowing
               the client right now or are we just going
               the same way?  The company I was with in
               Seattle, these distinctions were made.
               Now, I don't dispute him getting the full
               whack.
                   (he means Rick, who's older)
               Seniority and all that.  But if I'm
               getting paid the same hourly rate when
               we're at the house as I am in this car,
               that doesn't sit well with me and I feel
               obliged to say so.  'Cause in Seattle
               what you're paying now for so-called
               travel time was half what we got for
               actual clock-time with the client.  So I
               just feel we should get more when the job
               actually commences.

     After this spineless whining weak-willed sob story, Larry
     just turns to him and says:

                         LARRY
               ... I'd really like to eat your pussy.

                                                               CUT.

     EXT. ELAINE'S NEIGHBORHOOD.  DAY.

     Stacy and Uncle John sitting on a bench in a beach setting
     (though we still don't see the ocean).  Or on some grass,
     maybe, in a little park -- opposite Elaine's building.

     People-watching.  In their own unique way.  Stacy commenting
     on fellow humanity all around them.  TIME CUTS between each
     comment:

                         STACY
                   (after laughing loudly at a
                    handicapped person)
               I believe in mocking the afflicted.  Good
               for 'em.  Makes 'em stronger.

     Uncle John picks at the grass or sand.  As they kill the day.

                         STACY
                   (spotting a woman with a dog)
               Ever take a look at the women who work in
               pet stores?  Wow.

                         STACY
                   (as a fat jogger passes)
               Good luck.

                         STACY
                   (watching someone else go by)
               Jesus, are you gay enough or what.

                         STACY
                   (barely out of earshot of a
                    black woman with dyed blonde
                    hair)
               Very attractive.  Good idea.  Now I
               really want to fuck you.

                         STACY
                   (after a long time in silence,
                    just staring at someone)
               ... you can always tell the ones who'll do
               anal.

                         STACY
                   (regarding some other
                    beachgoers)
               Kinda makes you wonder why more people
               don't put a bullet through their fuckin'
               skulls, doesn't it.

                         STACY
                   (reading a newspaper)
               Looks like they just airbrushed the dick
               out of his mouth.

                         STACY
                   (leaning back on his elbows)
               Why don't they have TV shows about people
               whose daily lives you'd be interested in
               watching.  Y'know.  Like SKINNY LITTLE
               WEAKLING.  Or BIG FAT GUY.  SICK OLD MAN.
               FAMILY OF LOSERS.  Wouldn't that be good?

                         STACY
                   (sitting up)
               Two blacks and a Mexican in a car.  Who's
               driving?

                         UNCLE JOHN
               I don't know.

                         STACY
               The L.A.P.D.

                         STACY
                   (observing a "fast-walker")
               Oh yeah, keep doing that.  That's really
               healthy.

                         STACY
                   (his gaze following another
                    unfortunate)
               Can't you do something about your ass?

                         STACY
                   (his head turning after someone
                    else)
               Other people's lives scare the shit out
               of me.

                         STACY
                   (watching some guy rooting in a
                    trash bin)
               "Homeless" people.  Fuck them.  Remember
               when they were just bums?  Everyone with
               an axe to grind.  Like to grind in their
               face.  Pretty soon there'll be shit-in-
               your-pants rights groups.  Stupidity
               activists.

                         STACY
                   (glad he's who he is and not
                    who he's looking at)
               Wonder what it's like being a dumb guy in
               a dumb suit trying to cross the street.

                         STACY
                   (staring at another sad couple)
               Life sure is a minefield.

                         STACY
                   (clocking another female)
               Look at that one.  She's really been
               used.

                         STACY
                   (in a contemplative mode)
               I'd love to be famous so I could snub
               ordinary people.  Imagine, you're famous,
               you're sitting in a restaurant, some fool
               comes up to you, wants you to sign your
               name on his napkin, his wife is there, it
               would be something these poor saps would
               cherish the rest of their lives, talk
               about to their cretin friends.  Bam!  You
               tell 'em to FUCK OFF!  God, I'd love
               that.

     Suddenly Uncle John speaks.

                         UNCLE JOHN
               Is that her?  I bet that's her.

     Stacy turns.

     POV

     Across the street, Elaine comes out of her building.  (We're
     supposing this is an apartment building somewhat worth living
     in that has outdoor parking of some kind, visible from the
     street, or only street parking.)

                                                               CUT.

     EXT. SOME STREET.  DAY.

     Elaine's car on the move.  Stacy and Uncle John in a car
     following.

     INT. ELAINE'S CAR.

     Going somewhere.  Unaware of the creeps in her wake.

     INT. STACY/UNCLE JOHN'S CAR.

     An "8x10" of Elaine on their back seat.  Another picture of
     her on a page torn from a "Player's Directory."

                         UNCLE JOHN
               Maybe she doesn't even know the English
               guy.

                         STACY
                   (driving)
               Avery said she was tight with his
               daughter.

                         UNCLE JOHN
               That don't mean nothin'.

     Stacy knows better than to argue with a moron.

                         UNCLE JOHN
               She's nice lookin'.

                         STACY
               So what.

                         UNCLE JOHN
               I dunno.  I just said she's nice lookin'.

                         STACY
               And I said so what.  You think she's any
               happier?

                         UNCLE JOHN
               What d'you mean, any happier?

                         STACY
               Any happier than any other asshole in
               life.

     Pause.

                         UNCLE JOHN
               I dunno.  I never met her.

     INT. SOUND STUDIO.  DAY.

     On screen:  A BEAUTIFUL MODEL -- but speaking in ELAINE'S
     VOICE.

     ELAINE

     At a mic.  Wearing headphones.  Matching her voice to the
     model's lip movements.  Looping this commercial or whatever
     it is.

     INT. HALLWAY.

     Wilson.  Comes to a window where he can see Elaine inside in
     the sound-proofed studio.

     INT. SOUND STUDIO.  DAY.

     Wilson and Elaine talk while technicians change reels.

                         ELAINE
               -- they want Southern, I do Southern,
               they want Midwest, I do Midwest, they
               want tall, blonde, and twenty-two, I'm
               shit out of luck.
                   (pauses)
               One thing I can't do is English.
               Americans can't.  Shouldn't even try.
               And Laurence Olivier couldn't do us.

                         WILSON
               You ever been to London?

                         ELAINE
               Only in the movies.

                         WILSON
               I've 'ardly ever left it.

                         ELAINE
               Yeah, well, you're here now --
                   (re Wilson's accent)
               -- where hurricanes hardly ever happen.

                         WILSON
               I've got the hang of the driving.  Found
               this place all right.

                         ELAINE
               Stick with me, kid.  Looks big when you
               get here but you can cover it in five
               minutes.

     Beat.

                         ELAINE (cont'd)
               So, is there anybody in your family who's
               not a criminal?

                         WILSON
               Not that I recall.

                         ELAINE
               What about your grandmother?

                         WILSON
               Nah -- she was married to me grandad --
               he was as bent as a boomerang -- used to
               make knuckle-dusters down the shop.
               Crafty old sod.

                         ELAINE
               He alive to see this?

                         WILSON
                   (shakes head)
               Dropped dead in the stalls in the Odeon,
               Muswell Hill.  Watching Doris Day.

                         ELAINE
               What'd your father do?

                         WILSON
               Black market during the war.

     Elaine shakes her head.

                         ELAINE
               I guess you're just habitual.

                         WILSON
               You sound like my fucking probation
               officer.

                         ELAINE
               Won't he be looking for you about now?

                         WILSON
               Good luck to him.  He couldn't find his
               prick if he didn't wear Y-fronts.

                         ELAINE
               Minor officials bother you, don't they?

                         WILSON
               Do us a favor.  Can't even go have a
               slash without 'em saying, what're you
               going in there for?

     EXT. ELAINE'S BUILDING.  DAY.

     Elaine and Wilson enter.  Stacy not far behind.  Catches
     outside gate before it slams shut.

                                                               CUT.

     INT. ELAINE'S BUILDING.  DAY.

     Wilson and Elaine turn the corner into the corridor
     approaching her apartment door.  Pause to kiss.  Walk closer.

     And Stacy appears at the other end of the hall.  Both arms
     stretched out with the .38 at the end of them.

                         STACY
               Hi, kids.

     Starts to squeeze off a shot.  As Wilson pushes Elaine to the
     floor.  As another SHOT rings out from further along the hall
     behind Stacy.  Catching him across the cheek.  Only skimming
     him.  But knocking him down.  Bullet chipping the wall.

     UNCLE JOHN

     Across from Stacy.  Freezes, his own gun in hand.

     AT THE STAIRS

     Three BLACK GUYS.  Including Thompson.  They approach.  Guns
     pointed at Stacy and Uncle John.

     WILSON

     Hand on his .45 now.  But a fourth Black Guy coming up behind
     him.  Wilson lowers the .45.

     ELAINE

     Flattened herself back against a wall.  Petrified.

     STACY

     Sits on the floor.  Holds his hurt face.  Thompson walks over
     and picks up Stacy's gun.  One of the other blacks relieves a
     reluctant Uncle John of his.

                         THOMPSON
                   (stops at Wilson)
               Come with us.

     If there's any doubt whether Wilson will -- one of the blacks
     gently puts the muzzle of a gun to Elaine's head.  Cocks the
     hammer.

     They all go off down the stairwell.  Except Stacy and Uncle
     John.

     Hit men wondering what hit them.

                                                               CUT.

     INT. ROOM.  DAY.

     Like Wilson's motel room, another version of a cell.

     A small window, high up.  Bricks and debris around the floor.
     And Wilson and Elaine.  Sitting, leaning against opposite
     stone walls.

                         ELAINE
               Tell me you wouldn't prefer a steady
               income.

     Wilson takes a cigarette pack from a pocket.  Lights himself
     one.  Then tosses the stuff over to Elaine.

                         WILSON
               I got a steady income -- I'm on the dole.

                         ELAINE
                   (lights up)
               A leech on the welfare state in addition.
               You don't miss a trick.

                         WILSON
               I fiddle it.  They got me down as an
               immigrant with five kids.

     Elaine sort of shares a laugh at that.

                         ELAINE
               Yeah ... Jenny spoke fondly of her
               imaginary siblings.

     Though real ones might have been nice.  This an unspoken
     thought between them.

                         ELAINE (cont'd)
               Do you remember the last time you saw
               her?

                         WILSON
               Last time might as well've been the
               first.  I remember all the times, don't
               I.  Watching her grow up --
                   (finding the word)
               in increments.

                         ELAINE
               She told me you were a ghost in her life.
               Daddy the friendly ghost.  Coming back to
               haunt her.

                         WILSON
               Well, she twigged by the time she was
               eight or nine that daddy wasn't in the
               Royal Marines or doing scientific
               research in the jungles of Borneo or
               playing Iago in a worldwide tour of
               OTHELLO.

                         ELAINE
               Still, you could never ... do what she
               wanted.

     Wilson shakes his head.

                         WILSON
               She used to tell me she'd turn me in.
                   (tries to laugh about it)
               Little kid.  Ten year old.  "If you're
               naughty, Dad, I'll tell on ya."  She
               didn't want me sent down again, see.
               When I was planning some job.  "I'll tell
               'em, Dad, I promise I will.  Here, look,
               I'm calling the Old Bill right now" --
               picking up the telephone.  I can see her,
               the phone in her hand.  Became a sort of
               joke between us.  Only it wasn't a joke.

                         ELAINE
               She never would have turned you in, not
               in a million years.

                         WILSON
               I know that.  But as time went on ...
               well, it wasn't a joke, was it?  She had
               a feeling about it -- about the last job
               -- how long I'd get the hook for.  Said
               she wouldn't be there this time when I
               got out.

     DOOR opens.  Thompson.  Gun in hand.

                                                               CUT.

     INT. HALLWAY.  DAY.

     Thompson leads Wilson past a row of windows.  Dockyards,
     harbor activity outside.  Toward a door with things
     stencilled on it.  One of them:  US DEPT. OF CUSTOMS.

     INT. OFFICE.

     A man named FEATHER.  Black.  Half sitting on the edge of a
     table.  Wilson is shown in.

     Wilson at the door.  Sizes Feather up at a glance.

                         WILSON
               This is where I come in.

     He walks confidently in.  Outside, through the window, an
     image of a foreign sports car being hoisted in the air by a
     crane.

     There's a chair.  Wilson sits in it.

     Feather squints a little.  Seems ready to listen to whatever
     Wilson has to say.

                         WILSON (cont'd)
               How's it going, squire, all right?  Now
               listen -- when I was in the nick --
               second time, it was -- no, third.  Third
               stretch, yeah.  There was this screw had
               it in for me.  That geezer was top of my
               list.  Two years after I was slung, I saw
               him.  He was sitting on a bench in
               Holland Park.  There was no one else
               about.  I coulda gone up behind him and
               snapped his fucking neck.  But I left it.
               Coulda nobbled him, but I didn't.  'Cos
               what I thought I wanted wasn't what I
               wanted.  What I thought I was thinking
               about was something else.  This berk on
               the bench wasn't worth my time.  See what
               I mean?  It didn't matter.  It meant sod
               all in the end.

     Feather has been listening to this, expressionless.  Now he
     raises a finger as if there's a point he wants clarified.

                         FEATHER
               There's one thing I don't understand.
                   (wants to make this clear)
               The thing I don't understand ... is every
               motherfucking thing you're saying.

                         WILSON
               Look, mush, you're the guv'nor here, I
               can see that, I'm on your manor now,
               right.  So there's no need to get out of
               your pram.  I'm Johnny-come-lately to all
               this.  Whatever the bollocks between you
               and this slag Valentine, it's got nothing
               to do with me.  I don't wanna know.

                         FEATHER
               Well, I'll tell you.  I believe this
               Valentine screwed me out of a fair sum of
               money.

                         WILSON
               I can well believe it.  I'm sure he has
               done, son.  He's about as straight as a
               dog's hind leg.

                         FEATHER
               But I can't be sure.  I don't even know
               who he is.  He's too insulated.  Too many
               layers around him.

                         WILSON
               Your guess is as good as mine, mate.  I'm
               here on another matter entirely.

                         FEATHER
                   (moves to window)
               Yeah, I guess you are.

                         WILSON
               Good job your lot showed up when they did
               or it would've been me for the high jump.

                         FEATHER
               That dude who works for Valentine.  He's
               the one sent those guys after you.  You
               know that.

                         WILSON
               Yeah.  Shouldn't wonder.  Must've done.

                         FEATHER
               So what's your beef, pal?

                         WILSON
               Nothing financial.  Strictly personal.
                   (moves to window)
               I can see how all this import-export
               malarkey might give rise to confusion
               where I'm concerned.  A foreigner,
               showing up unexpectedly, like.

                         FEATHER
                   (looks at him)
               It was you.  Downtown.

                         WILSON
                   (all innocent)
               Eh?

                         FEATHER
               Because that wasn't anything to do with
               me.  And suspicion has been cast in my
               direction.
                   (pondering)
               Didn't make any sense.  Choosing those
               shitheads over me, cutting me out of the
               deal, then screwing them over too.

                         WILSON
               No, I can reassure you on that point.
               Valentine was just as surprised by that
               turn of events as you.

                         FEATHER
               He'd already grabbed more than his
               allotted cut.  Didn't think he'd be so
               bold as to take all of it.

                         WILSON
               All of what?

                         FEATHER
               Of the deal, man.

                         WILSON
               Oh, yeah, right.  The deal.

                         FEATHER
               But if you're mad at him too and he's mad
               at you ... that must make us pals.

                         WILSON
               As you prefer, squire.  As you prefer.

                         FEATHER
                   (weary of his life)
               In which case I'll just do what I usually
               do.

                         WILSON
               And that is?

                         FEATHER
               What am I doing?

     He's standing at the window, staring out.  As if Wilson isn't
     even in the room any more.  A ship being loaded out there.
     Inspectors with clipboards.  Trucks like the ones we saw at
     that warehouse downtown.

                         WILSON
               Looking the other way.
                   (turns to go)
               Gotcha.

                                                               CUT.

     EXT. INN.  DAY.

     Along the way up the coast.

     Through a window we SEE Valentine and Adhara enjoying a
     pleasant lunch.

     The bodyguards hang out by the cars outside with fast food
     bags and drinks.

                         TOM
                   (to Rick)
               I mean, how much are you getting?  Just
               as a point of interest.  See, I didn't
               realize there was a sliding scale.

     AVERY

     At a payphone.  His idiots in the background.  Dials a
     number.

     INT. POOL HALL.  DAY.

     Stacy.  Nasty bruise on his cheek.  Takes a cue off the rack.
     Chalks up.

                         STACY
               Straight rotation, no shit, call your
               shot.

                         UNCLE JOHN
               Lemme break.

     They're playing against a couple of other creeps.

                         CREEP
               You broke last time.

                         STACY
               Let him break - he likes to break.

                         CREEP
               Fuck you.

                         STACY
               I wouldn't talk.

                         CREEP
               Huh?

                         STACY
               I saw your mother on the Strip last
               night.  She went up to three guys, said
               she'd like 'em to stick one in each,
               know what I mean?

     Creep rushes Stacy.  But doesn't get past Uncle John.  Who
     drops him with one punch.  Flooring him between two pool
     tables.  Stacy then goes over.  Supports himself with a hand
     on each table, swings his boot into the thug's face.

                         BARTENDER
                   (calls)
               Stacy.

     Stacy looks.  Bartender holds up phone.  Stacy goes over.

                         BARTENDER (cont'd)
               I can do without you inhibiting my
               business.

     Stacy just scowls, takes the phone.

                         STACY
                   (into phone)
               Yeah.

     UNCLE JOHN

     Breaks.

     STACY

     Hangs up.  Goes back to Uncle John.  Picks up his cue again.

                         STACY (cont'd)
               We've been fired.

                                                               CUT.

     EXT. VALENTINE'S HOUSE.  L.A.  DAY

     Someone we've never seen before and will never see again
     stands in Valentine's driveway.  His name is FIELDING.

     A car comes up.  Another guy, GRAMMS, sits in it.  He waits.
     Eventually Fielding walks over.

                         GRAMMS
                   (re:  the burnt garage)
               Valentine had himself a party, I hear.

                         FIELDING
                   (by rote)
               My client has already given a statement
               regarding yesterday's events.

                         GRAMMS
               A statement?  I wouldn't mind getting a
               statement.  You see, my client -- the
               United States Government -- would love to
               get a statement about a few of the deals
               going down with your client.

                         FIELDING
               Deals?  My client is involved in any
               number of deals at any given moment.
               You'd have to be more specific.

                         GRAMMS
               Your client have a deal in Long Beach?
               How about downtown?  There's some folks
               there -- oh, wait, they're all dead.  Any
               of this ring a bell?

                         FIELDING
               My client is an entrepreneur.  I am his
               lawyer, not his business manager.

                         GRAMMS
               So you wouldn't have any idea how your
               client continues to make so much fucking

               He's always been very forward-thinking.
               He invested wisely.

               He had urgent business in the north.

     Gramms just laughs.  Just laughs and laughs.  And we leave him
     laughing.  And Fielding not.

     INT. RESTAURANT.  KITCHEN.  DAY.

     Ed takes off an apron, heads out the door.  It's clear that
     he's not the head chef here -- because the HEAD CHEF, an
     Anglo, turns, wondering where he's going.  Over this we hear:

               What d'you say, Elaine?

                         ELAINE
               Not much -- you?

               I was gonna be in that Michael Mann

               We coulda used the other two-and-a-half
               grand.

                         STACY
               There's more than a measly few grand in
               this.

                         UNCLE JOHN
               There is?

                         STACY
               Something's on.

                         UNCLE JOHN
               What?

                         STACY
               I happen to know more about Mr. Whatever-
               his-name-is than he thinks I know about
               him and his operation.

                         UNCLE JOHN
               You do?

                         STACY
               You bet.

                         UNCLE JOHN
               Like what.

                         STACY
               Like he'd never hire me for real.  Not
               week-to-week.  I don't have the
               credentials.  He thinks I'm just a
               sociopath, someone he can turn to when he
               needs "plausible denial."

                         UNCLE JOHN
               Well, we blew it, didn't we?  He ain't
               wrong.

                         STACY
                   (savage mimicry)
               "He ain't wrong."  Listen, I know this
               asshole who did just go to work for him.
               Full-time.  And this dickhead's parents
               just told me he took a road trip up the
               coast.  That's the type of individual gets
               hired, someone who'll shoot his mouth off
               to his family while on the job.

                         UNCLE JOHN
               I don't get it.

                         STACY
               I don't know who that English guy is.
               Some kind of --
                   (finding the word)
               -- courier or something.  Maybe a seller.
               Maybe a buyer.  But Mr. Avery wanted him,
               those jigs wanted him -- and I betcha
               there's a briefcase somewhere.

                         UNCLE JOHN
               What's in it?

                         STACY
                   (shrugs)
               Drugs?  Cash?  Both if we're lucky.

                         UNCLE JOHN
               How we gonna get that lucky?

                         STACY
               While they're all fucking each other

                         ED
               I've been wondering something.

                         WILSON
               Again?

                         ED
               Do you have any friends, man?

                         WILSON
               Yeah, I suppose.  Call 'em that, yeah.
               Down the boozer Saturday night.  Meet
               some of the lads.

                         ELAINE
                   (a little more pointed)
               Friends and colleagues.

                         WILSON
               You can't count on very many people,
               that's the trouble.  Number of times a
               decent job's been cocked up ...

                         ELAINE
               Poor baby.

     Little back-seat sarcasm there.  Wilson looks kind of bitter.

                         WILSON
               Useless gits.  I was gonna do the Post
               Office once.

                         ED
               What post office?

                         WILSON
               The lot.  The whole British bloody Post
               Office.  I had a brilliant plan -- all
               worked out -- work of genius, it was.
               Could I get anybody interested?  No --
               they're too busy pinching orange squash
               from the milkman.  Lazy sods.  Jumble
               sale on in Watford, they'll be up at the

               You're just on a higher plane, Wilson.

                         WILSON

     EXT. HOUSE.  BIG SUR.  DAY.

     An impressive clifftop dwelling.  Isolated on a winding road.
     On a beautiful promontory overlooking the sea.  Valentine
     RINGS the DOORBELL (actually CHIME).  It's opened by his ex-
     wife.  SUSAN.  Very well-maintained.  50-something.
     Surprised to see him.  But not overjoyed.

                         VALENTINE
               Hello there.

                         SUSAN
               What are you doing here?

                         VALENTINE
               Exercising my visitation rights.

                         SUSAN
               Since when?

                         VALENTINE
               I miss my kids.

                         SUSAN
               They're at college.  Or doesn't your
               accountant even tell you where the money
               goes anymore.

     Valentine goes inside.

     INT. HOUSE.

     He looks around.  She doesn't shut the door.

                         VALENTINE
               You've made it ... brighter.

                         SUSAN
               I don't want you here, Terry.

                         VALENTINE
               Sure you do.

     He turns to look at her.  Smiles.  Somehow it doesn't work on
     her.  One of the reasons she divorced him.  Just one.  She
     sighs.  Resigned to his presence.  Starts to close the door.

                         VALENTINE (cont'd)
               Don't shut the door -- I have people with
               me.

     Now she gets it.

                         SUSAN
               What kind of trouble are you in?

                         VALENTINE
               No trouble.

     Susan SEES Adhara get out of the sporty car parked in the
     drive and stand against it in a posture of younger chick
     defiance.

                         SUSAN
               Surely you can think of somewhere else to
               take one of your chippies for a quick
               getaway.

                         VALENTINE
               Susan.

     He actually puts his hands on her arms.  To hold her firm
     while he locks onto her eyes.  And doesn't smile.

                         VALENTINE (cont'd)
               I just need ... somewhere remote.  Away
               from L.A.  For a couple of days.
                   (now the kicker)
               I pay for this house too.

     Susan reads him.  He's not claiming ownership rights.  He's
     telling her this house, because of the connection to him, is
     a target of some kind.

                         SUSAN
               What have you done?

     The Land Cruiser pulls up outside.  Avery emerges, comes
     over, comes in.  Susan notes the bodyguards out there as well.

                         AVERY
                   (to Valentine)
               We weren't followed.
                   (to Susan)
               Susan.

     Valentine lets Susan go.  Knowing she's now speechless at
     what's turned into, as far as she's concerned, a home
     invasion.

                         VALENTINE
                   (moving, looking around)
               Where's ... what's-his-name -- Fred --

                         SUSAN
               -- You know his name is Frank.

                         VALENTINE
               Is he here?

                         SUSAN
               You know I don't live with him.

                         VALENTINE
               Go to him.  Go to his studio, or writers
               workshop or artists colony, Esselin
               retreat, nudist camp --

                         SUSAN
               Are you finished?

                         VALENTINE
               In a couple of days this whole thing --

                         SUSAN
               Who's looking for you?

                         VALENTINE
               Go now.

     Encouraging, if not in fact ushering, her towards a bedroom.

                         SUSAN
               It's been five minutes and I'm packing to
               leave again.  I can't believe this.

                         VALENTINE
               That's right, your life is Shit, and I'm
               to blame.  It's that simple.

     That does it.  Susan turns on him.

                         SUSAN
               It is that simple.  I blame you for
               everything.  Losing inhibitions and
               chicks without bras didn't have to lead
               to hardcore porno in every American
               household:  that was you.  The first on
               your block to turn on a camera in a hot
               tub and peddle it to your friends.  A
               little recreational pot didn't inevitably
               have to lead to the eventual devastation
               of the inner cities:  you made that
               happen, the first time you bought a
               bigger stash than you yourself meant to
               smoke.  It happened when you made your
               first buck hyping some so-called "event"
               that was over before it began or marketed
               some "product" whose only value was its
               instant disposability.  You were the
               first person to see there was a lot of
               money to be made selling Navajo rugs --
               you've even stolen from the fucking
               Indians!  You looked at Charlie Manson
               when all he had to show for himself was a
               guitar instead of a knife and saw another
               merry prankster, the freedom of the
               frontier.  Your pal here --
                   (Avery)
               -- He saw gated communities.  Rich people
               coming to him with their money, terrified
               of what people like you had left of this
               society.  Why invest in a marriage and
               children when you had him?  He's your
               oracle.  But you couldn't even trust in
               friendship, could you?  Still he's the
               dog you call for its dinner.  Because
               everything that might once have been fun
               or nice or sweet you had to turn mean and
               cold and sour.  That was your "genius,"
               Terry.  Haven't you read your own press?

                                                               CUT.

     EXT. MOTEL.  EVENING.

     Wilson and his friends pull in.  Get out of the car.
     Stretch.

                         ELAINE
                   (finding herself at another
                    shithole)
               What is it, you just like the reassuring
               smell of disinfectant?

     Wilson just heads for the motel office.  Elaine and Ed follow
     a little distance behind.

                         ED
               Hey, Elaine.  You even know what he's
               saying half the time?

                         ELAINE
               No, but I know what he means.

                                                               CUT.

     EXT. DECK.  BIG SUR HOUSE.  NIGHT.

     Adhara sways in a hammock.  Staring at Valentine.  Wanting to
     know what the hell is going on.

     Valentine stands smoking at the rail, looking out over the
     dark sea.  Ignoring Adhara.  Avery sits at a table.
     Bodyguards visible inside the house.

                         VALENTINE
                   (finally, to Avery)
               Do any of these guys cook?

                                                               CUT.

     EXT. MOTEL PORCH.  EVENING.

     Wilson at the car.  Elaine and Ed watching.

     Ed has gathered that something has developed between Wilson
     and Elaine.  The way she's looking at Wilson.

                         ED
               ... Reminds me of Jennifer.

                         ELAINE
                   (barely perceptible nod)
               Hard to miss.

     Ed sighs.  Awkward.

                         ED
               I thought maybe you just came for the
               ride.

                         ELAINE
               I'd rather be with him than without him.
               I don't want to be found dead in L.A.

     Wilson walks back to them.  Looking at Ed as if to say, ready
     to go?  At her as if to say ... maybe farewell.

     EXT. VALENTINE HOUSE.  NIGHT.

     Tableau.  Evening has descended.  Surfaces glisten from a
     light drizzling rain.

     INT. VALENTINE HOUSE, BEDROOM.  NIGHT.

     Adhara, dressing.  Behind her, outside, way out of focus, a
     figure slithers by.

     INT. VALENTINE HOUSE, LIVING ROOM.  NIGHT.

     Valentine and Avery sit watching TV (CELEBRITY REPORT!).  Tom
     is behind them in the kitchen, flipping through Marie Claire
     magazine.

     VALENTINE

     Turns to look through the sliding glass doors.

     HIS POV

     Beyond the deck stands Larry, his back to us, facing the
     ocean.

     EXT. VALENTINE HOUSE.  BACK YARD.  NIGHT.

     Looking toward the house, Larry in the foreground, facing us.
     He takes a bite from a cinnamon granola bar, then looks at it
     unhappily as he chews.

                         LARRY
               Fuck.

     EXT. VALENTINE HOUSE, ANOTHER ANGLE.  NIGHT.

     Looking at the house from the top of the hill.  Rick stands
     in the driveway next to Valentine's car, smoking a cigarette.

     REVERSE ANGLE

     Wilson and Ed watching him.  Wilson nods his head to the
     left, and Ed moves in that direction.  Wilson moves quietly
     off to the right.

     INT. VALENTINE HOUSE.  LIVING ROOM.  NIGHT.

     Valentine and Avery, still watching TV.

                         VALENTINE
                   (re:  the channel)
               Check the news.

     Avery starts looking around.

                         AVERY
               Where's the remote?

     Suddenly, we hear a CAR ALARM.  Tom looks up from his
     magazine.  Valentine looks to Avery, who shakes his head:
     It's nothing.

     EXT. BIG SUR HOUSE.  DRIVEWAY.  NIGHT.

     Rick turns and looks up the driveway toward the sound.  He
     puts his cigarette out.

     EXT. BIG SUR HOUSE.  BACK YARD.  NIGHT.

     Larry has turned toward the sound as well.  Through a
     partially obscured side entrance, he sees Rick walking up the
     driveway.

     EXT. BIG SUR HOUSE.  DRIVEWAY.  NIGHT.

     Rick walks away from us, toward the vehicle (the Land Cruiser
     they drove here) parked up the driveway.  We lose sight of
     him as he crosses to the driver's side.  The alarm goes off.
     We hold for several beats.  He doesn't emerge.

     INT. BIG SUR HOUSE.  LIVING ROOM.  NIGHT.

     Valentine and Avery are still looking for the remote.  Avery
     stops, his attention drawn to the fact that he hasn't heard
     anything from Larry.  He crosses to the window.

     HIS POV

     The driveway, car at the top partially visible.  No sign of
     Rick.

     AVERY

     His brow furrows.

     VALENTINE

     Notices this, looks out toward the backyard.

     HIS POV

     Same as before, except Larry isn't there.

     VALENTINE

     Moves to the sliding glass door to get a better look at the
     deck and back yard.  Still no Larry.

                         VALENTINE
               Where's Larry?

     AVERY

     Leaves the window and moves to Valentine.  Tom has joined
     them.  After a beat:

                         AVERY
               Turn all the lights out.  I'll get Adhara.

     Tom begins looking for the light switches.

                         VALENTINE
               What's happening?

     Avery is already heading for the bedroom.

                         AVERY
               Stay away from the windows.

     EXT. BIG SUR HOUSE.  BACK YARD.  NIGHT.

     Tableau.  Avery exits the kitchen and takes the surrounding
     porch to the bedroom.  Are we seeing this from someone's POV?

     INT. BIG SUR HOUSE.  BEDROOM.  NIGHT.

     Adhara, finished dressing, looking at herself in the mirror.
     The lights behind her go off.  She turns to see Avery coming
     toward her to turn off the lights by the mirror.

                         ADHARA
               Uh, you've heard of knocking?

                         AVERY
               I need you to come with me.

                         ADHARA
               Why, what --

     He takes her by the arm.  Firmly, but not roughly.

                         AVERY
               Please.

     She sees in his expression that something is up.

                         ADHARA
               Okay.

     INT. BIG SUR HOUSE.  LIVING ROOM.  NIGHT.

     Tom and Valentine have finally found the light switches, and
     the room is dark.  Valentine moves slowly to the window,
     takes a tentative peek.

     HIS POV

     The driveway.  Hard to see.  Is there something moving out by
     the shed?

                         AVERY
                   (off)
               I thought I said stay away from the
               window.

     AVERY

     Entering the kitchen with Adhara in tow.  He brings her
     around behind the counter.

                         AVERY
               Everybody in the kitchen.

     Valentine and Tom move to join Avery and Adhara.

                         AVERY
               Behind the counter.

     Everyone moves behind the large counter in the center of the
     kitchen and crouches down.  They have a wall behind them and
     all the windows in front of them.

                         ADHARA
                   (scared)
               What's going on?

     Avery and Tom have drawn their guns.

                         VALENTINE
               We think someone is here.

                         ADHARA
               We think?

                         VALENTINE
               We can't find ...
                   (what are their names?)
               ... two of our guys.

                         TOM
                   (fucking typical)
               Larry and Rick.

                         ADHARA
               Did somebody call the cops?

     Tom snorts.  Avery looks at Valentine:  Haven't you told this
     girl anything?

                         VALENTINE
               No.

                         ADHARA
               Why not?

                         VALENTINE
               Because --

                         AVERY
               Because I'm taking care of it.

                         ADHARA
               You guys are fucking nuts, I'm calling --

     She starts to stand.  Valentine pulls her down.

                         ADHARA
               Hey.

                         TOM
               Mr. Avery.

     Avery looks to Tom, who nods toward the back porch.

     THEIR POV

     A silhouetted figure is tentatively making its way along the
     porch, trying not to be seen.  We don't get a very clear
     glimpse.

     AVERY

     Draws his gun and takes aim.

     THE FIGURE

     Careful not to become fully visible, but growing more
     courageous with each step.

     AVERY

     Locked on him, waiting.

     VALENTINE

     Puts Adhara's hand to her ears.

     THE FIGURE

     We see a little more now than we have before.

     AVERY

     He sees enough.  Squeezes off a series of SHOTS, the muzzle
     flash strobing the kitchen area like a flashbulb, Adhara and
     Valentine flinching.

     THE FIGURE

     Hit.  Spinning and collapsing to the ground.

     AVERY

     Lowers his gun.  Turns to Tom.

                         AVERY
               Watch my back.

     Avery moves out from behind the counter and heads for the
     body.

     EXT. BIG SUR HOUSE.  BACK PORCH.  NIGHT.

     Avery makes his way to the figure, which is on its stomach
     and writhing slightly.

     AVERY

     Careful.  Takes the gun and turns the body over.

     STACY

     Stares up at him, choking on his last few breaths.

     AVERY

     Puzzled.  What the hell is this guy doing here?  He starts
     feeling around Stacy's jacket for anything useful, but is
     interrupted when his hand EXPLODES, accompanied by the sound
     of a gunshot.  He screams in pain.

     INT. BIG SUR HOUSE.  KITCHEN.  NIGHT.

     Valentine and Adhara drop to the floor.  Tom, gun raised and
     pointing, tries to see who shot Avery.

     EXT. BIG SUR HOUSE.  BACK PORCH.  NIGHT.

     Avery is turning toward his assailant, but not fast enough.
     A shot rings out and part of his neck disappears in a blossom
     of blood.  Stunned, he falls on his side, gasping.

     AVERY'S POV

     Uncle John.  Close by, huddled by the lip of the cliff.  He
     starts to move cautiously toward Avery and Stacy.

     INT. BIG SUR HOUSE.  KITCHEN.  NIGHT.

     Tom squints, trying to see.

                         TOM
               Fuck.

                         VALENTINE
               What?

                         TOM
               Avery's down.

     TOM'S POV

     A piece of Uncle John's silhouette appears.

     TOM

     Fires at it.  Didn't hit anything.

                         TOM
               Fuck this.

     Tom jumps up and runs for the living room, firing his gun in
     front of him toward where he last saw Uncle John's
     silhouette.

     LIVING AREA

     Tom runs through and reaches the sliding doors to the back
     porch.  A portion of the frame SPLINTERS from a gun shot as
     he gains access to the other side of the back porch.

     EXT. BIG SUR HOUSE.  BACK PORCH.  NIGHT.

     Tom is through the sliding doors and trying to make his way
     around to the driveway.

     UNCLE JOHN

     Crouched behind the opposite end of the porch, sticks his
     head up.

     HIS POV

     Tom crossing to the steps, slips on the damp wood, tries to
     right himself.

     UNCLE JOHN

     Squeezes off two shots.

     TOM

     Is shot in the ankle as he is about to reach the steps.  He
     yelps in pain, tries to raise his gun.

     UNCLE JOHN

     Crouched down.  A shot flies over his head.

     TOM

     Stops shooting.  Tries dragging his shattered ankle to the
     steps.

     UNCLE JOHN

     Looks over the edge of the porch.

     HIS POV

     Tom turning toward the steps.

     UNCLE JOHN

     Fires at him.

     TOM

     Screams again as his elbow of his gun hand disintegrates.  He
     slips on the first step and tumbles down, the gun bouncing
     beside him.

     UNCLE JOHN

     Sees this.  Stands up to cross the back porch.  Takes a step
     forward but is stopped by a bullet in the chest (about the
     only clean shot anybody makes).  He looks down at himself.

                         UNCLE JOHN
               Shit.

     He looks up to SEE:

     AVERY

     Near death.  Gun in his good hand.  He squeezes the trigger
     again.

     UNCLE JOHN

     A small black hole appears in his cheek.  He blinks, begins
     to raise his hand to his face, and collapses.

     AVERY

     Exhales and rolls over.

     TOM

     Still trying to get to his feet.  He gives up and just lies
     there, panting.

     A HAND

     Reaches for the gun beside Tom.  Tilt up with it to reveal:

     ED

     He puts the gun in his jacket and slides away.

     INT. BIG SUR HOUSE.  KITCHEN.  NIGHT.

     Valentine and Adhara are still stuck behind the counter.
     Valentine sees the shadowy shape of Ed slipping behind the
     back porch.

     VALENTINE

     Decides to make a run for it, following Tom's route, away
     from Ed.

                         ADHARA
               Where are you going?

     LIVING ROOM

     Valentine runs to the sliding door, smack into:

     WILSON

     Standing there.  Wet.  Mad.  He grabs Valentine by the shirt
     and pushes him back into the room.

     VALENTINE

     Bounces off the couch and onto the floor.

     WILSON

     Comes toward him.

     VALENTINE

     Grabs a lamp off an end table and hurls it at Wilson.  It
     careens off Wilson's arm and shatters.

     WILSON

     Is almost on him now.

     VALENTINE

     Tries to scramble away.  Throwing anything he can get his
     hands on at.

     WILSON

     Who keeps coming.  He grabs Valentine, pulls him up, then
     throws him into the television.

     VALENTINE

     Crashes into the TV face first and bounces to the floor.

     WILSON

     Goes to him, grabs him by the neck with one hand and pulls
     out his gun with the other.  He seems about to speak when
     suddenly he screams instead.

                         WILSON
               AAAAGGGGHHHH!

     ADHARA

     Has just stuck a kitchen knife into Wilson's back.

     WILSON

     Turns instinctively and whips the pistol around, smashing
     Adhara in the mouth.

     ADHARA

     Hits the ground.  She won't be retaliating.

     WILSON

     In agony, spinning, trying to reach the knife in his back,
     but IT'S JUST BEYOND HIS REACH.

     VALENTINE

     Scrambles through the sliding glass door.

     EXT. BIG SUR HOUSE.  BACK PORCH.  NIGHT.

     Valentine stumbles out.  Notices Avery slumped on the deck,
     mortally wounded.  Goes to him -- as if concerned -- but
     actually just to take the gun.  Then runs off the porch
     toward the STEPS that lead down to the sea.

     WILSON

     Comes out after him, the knife still in his back.  So intent
     on catching Valentine he fails at first to notice Avery lying
     in the shadows.

     AVERY

     Has just barely managed to reach Stacy's pistol.  Raises it
     weakly.  Points it at Wilson.

     WILSON

     Seems to feel it.  Turns.  Locks eyes with Avery.  Avery
     could already have shot him.  But there's a momentary sense of
     recognition:  both of them just foot soldiers for fat cats --
     and Avery's is not worth saving.

     AVERY

     Lowers the gun.  Nods in the direction Valentine went.

                         AVERY
               ... that way ...

     Wilson moves on.  Avery just lies there, presumably to die.

     EXT. BIG SUR HOUSE.  STEPS.  NIGHT.

     Valentine hurries down the rickety steps.  Trying not to slip
     in the darkness, though there are tiny Malibu lights
     illuminating the steep and winding wooden framework.

     EXT. BEACH.  NIGHT.

     A rocky cove.  Valentine looks back up the way he came,
     HEARING the FOOTSTEPS coming down after him.  Backs away a
     few paces on the slippery rocks.  Falls.

     Lands on the crumpled, dead body of LARRY, the bodyguard, who
     was thrown off the cliff.  Valentine recoils.  When Wilson
     appears, Valentine FIRES at him.  A wild shot that only makes
     Wilson duck momentarily.  Valentine scrambles to his feet,
     runs on.

     WILSON

     Jumps down from the steps.  Stops for a moment and leans his
     back against the railing.  Bends at the knees slightly.

     THE KNIFE

     The handle is forced upward just enough to be reachable now.

     WILSON

     Grimacing, pulls the knife out and discards it.

     FURTHER DOWN THE BEACH

     Valentine runs.  Or tries to.  It's dark and the ground is
     treacherous.  The beach runs out pretty soon.  Now just
     rocks.  Maybe he thought he could get around the rocks on the
     point at the other end.  But he can't see very far ahead.
     And the tide is in, water making any escape extremely
     difficult.  He tries to scramble over some rocks.  They're
     wet, slippery.  He falls, cries out as he literally breaks an
     ankle.

     WILSON

     A dark figure.  Coming into focus.  Walking inexorably this
     way.

     VALENTINE

     Painfully rights himself.  A small bone protrudes from his
     broken ankle.  He FIRES at Wilson, gun in one hand, other
     hand gripping his wrist to try and steady it.  Doing his best
     to aim.  But the SHOTS miss their mark.

     WILSON

     Steadily coming.

     VALENTINE

     Out of bullets now.  Gun CLICKING crazily on empty.  He
     simply drops it.

     WILSON

     Now stands before him.

     THE TWO OF THEM

     Both breathing hard.

                         WILSON
               Tell me.

     This is not what Valentine expected.

                         VALENTINE
               What.

                         WILSON
               Tell me.

                         VALENTINE
               Tell you ...

                         WILSON
               About Jenny.
                   (closer)
               Tell me about Jenny.
                   (closer)
               About the deal.  Whatever fucking deal
               you had to kill my daughter for when she
               found out about it, you bastard.

     Wilson drops to the ground too, in a passionate fury, starts
     strangling Valentine.

                         WILSON
               Tell me.  Tell me about it, you fucking
               bastard.

     Easing up just enough for Valentine to sputter out a
     response.

                         VALENTINE
               She could've had the deal!  I would've
               handed it to her if she wanted.  I would
               have given her everything.

                         WILSON
               Why then.  Why did you do it!

     They're locked in a kind of embrace.  Sprayed by the waves
     crashing into the rocks.  Sweating and gasping and exhausted
     and hurt and furious.

                         VALENTINE
               She didn't want to share it, she wanted
               to stop it.  To stop me.  She said she'd
               turn me in.

     WILSON

     Shock of recognition on his face.  At those words.

                         VALENTINE
               She said, "You go ahead with this, I'll
               turn you in, Terry."

     Wilson sits back.  Panting.  Totally spent.  The two of them.
     Both on the ground now.  Whatever energy they had left drained
     -- Valentine from his confession, Wilson from hearing it.
     Valentine shaking, sobbing.  Still not realizing the pathetic
     folly of his actions.

                         VALENTINE
               She was serious.  She would have done it.
               She had the phone in her hand.  She was
               going to do it.

     WILSON

     Knows that the girl he loved ... loved Valentine, too.  Having
     heard the truth, the last vestige of revenge has vanished.
     He gets up and walks away.  Leaving the quivering shell of
     Valentine behind.

                                                               CUT.

     INT. BIG SUR HOUSE.  LIVING ROOM.  NIGHT.

     Adhara wakes up.  Hand to her smashed cheek and mouth.  But
     it's not her hand.  It's Valentine's.  She sort of shuffles
     away from him along the floor.  Sits against a wall holding
     her face.  Valentine sits back against an opposite wall.
     They stare at each other.

                                                               CUT.

     INT. PLANE.  DAY.

     Wilson, lost in thought.  Accepts a drink from a FLIGHT
     ATTENDANT.  We can see it pains him to reach for it.

                         WILSON
               Ta.

     After setting the glass down, his other hand goes to the
     shoulder where his stab wound was no doubt only temporarily
     dealt with.

     FLASH CUTS:

     WILSON. At the roadside hotel, grimacing.

     ELAINE. Cleaning his wound.

     Wilson rubs his shoulder.  The AMERICAN LADY in the seat
     beside him heard the way he said thanks to the Flight
     Attendant.

                         LADY
               You're English.

     A small beat (which he takes each time he responds).

                         WILSON
               Yeah, that's right.

                         LADY
               I can never decide what I like better.
               Leaving home, or coming back.

     WILSON

     Takes this in.

     FLASH CUTS:

     WILSON. Shaving in the mirror at his L.A. motel. He stops.

     WILSON. In the car leaving Valentine's house. Fingering the
     picture of Jenny.

                         WILSON
               I would have preferred staying home, me.

                         LADY
               You're a reluctant traveller, then.

     Wilson nods.

     FLASH CUTS:

     WILSON. In the car with Elaine and Ed, driving back from Big
     Sur. Everyone in their own world.

     WILSON. At Ed's house. Saying goodbye.

     WILSON AND ED. Shake hands.

     ED. Watching him get into Elaine's car.

                         WILSON
               Got called out to L.A., unexpected like,
               to do a job of work.

     FLASH CUTS:

     WILSON. At the airport, staring at Elaine.

     ELAINE. Staring back.

     WILSON AND ELAINE. She embraces him.

     ELAINE. She watches him leave.

     WILSON. Disappearing into the terminal.

                         LADY
               You'll be looking forward to getting
               back, then.

                         WILSON
               Yeah.  Another little matter needs
               attending to soon as I return.

                         LADY
               No rest for the wicked.

     Wilson nods, exhales.

     FLASH CUT:

     WILSON. In the cab on the way to Ed's, at the beginning of
     the film. Watching the lights go by.

                         WILSON
               Been away a lot.

                         LADY
               Where else?

     Longer beat.  He actually turns to look at her now.  Takes
     her in, then looks forward again.

                         WILSON
               Out on a oil rig.  In the North Sea.
               Nine years.

                         LADY
               Nine years?
                   (laughs)
               Is that legal?

                         WILSON
               Well, time off for good behavior, you
               know.  I shouldn't have even been there
               -- it was these other blokes who shoulda
               gone in my place.  I got lumbered with
               the job they were responsible for.  I
               don't mind pulling me own cart, but not
               someone else's, know what I mean.

                         LADY
               But you stuck it out, anyway, all that
               time.

                         WILSON
               I had to, didn't I.  Nothing else for it.
               Then just when I'd finished my nine years
               -- my contract -- wallop, I had to bugger
               off to the States.

                         LADY
                   (reacting slightly to his
                    "colorful" language)
               Sounds like you need a rest.

                         WILSON
               Could do, yeah.

     Another beat.

                         WILSON
               But first I gotta give these lads a
               talking to, these geezers what sent me up
               the river, in a manner of speaking.

                         LADY
               The ones whose burden you took upon your
               own shoulders.

                         WILSON
               Yeah.

     And he turns away, to the window.  Looks at the blue sky.
     Sips his drink.  Then, hard:

                         WILSON
               Them next.

                                                     CUT TO BLACK.

     THE END.

          BANG IN FROM BLACK, FACE OF A MAN
          MICKEY HALLER, 40, lawyer-- TIGHT on him, as morning light
          flies across his features. He's fresh-shaved, neat suit,
          gazes out with a stark/steady focus from the back seat of--

          INT. LINCOLN TOWN CAR (MOVING) IN A HARD RAIN--

          GRADUALLY FADE IN, under the SOUND of rain & freeway, his
          DRIVER, black, 20s, low patter to which Mick barely listens--

                         EARL
          I'm thinkin', when Not-Guilty-
          Two gets to four thousand miles,
          that's two cars ready, that's
          enough to start the airport runs...
          (then, realizing)
          You gettin' any of this, Mr.
          Haller?
          Not this morning. Mick watches the rain without seeing it.

                         MICK
          Just keep your speed up, Earl.
          Earl kicks it, passes cars...
          Mick takes a FILE from a stack beside him. Also laptop, cell-
          phone rack: His back seat is his rolling office. Opens the
          file. Top sheet:
          THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA v. LOUIS ROULET.
           Tight on Mick. His eyes see back to the be innin CUT TO,

          EXT. LINCOLN (MOVING) - BRIGHT SUN - ANOTHER MORNING

          The town car sails along, bright glint off the surface
          streets-- We HEAR HARD RAP, TUPAC SHAKUR-- CELL PHONE RINGS--

          INT. LINCOLN (MOVING) - SAME TIME


                         MICK
          Earl-- buds.
          A command. Earl puts in earbuds, Rap cuts out. Into cell--

                         MICK (CONT'D)
          This is Haller.

          MAN'S VOICE OVER CELL
          Where are you this morning?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          2.
          This time Mick's in a mussed suit, surrounded by newspapers,
          open files, electric shaver, take-out coffee...

                         MICK
          On my way to Lancaster for a
          calendar call. Why, have you got
          something?

          MAN'S VOICE (VAL)
          I got a franchise player is what.
          Reaction Mick: He's heard it before...

                         VAL'S VOICE
          I mean it, this guy could be money.
          But he goes before the judge at
          eleven.

                         MICK
          Van Nuys by eleven could be hard--

                         VAL'S VOICE
          But this client, listen Mick, his
          mother's lawyer just waltzed in

                         HERE--

                         MICK
          He's already got a lawyer?--

                         VAL'S VOICE
          Strictly real-estate, doesn't know
          his ass about criminal. Will you
          listen?

                         MICK

                         GO AHEAD--

                         VAL'S VOICE
          Guy waltzes in, ready to put up the
          family's beach house in Malibu
          against the million in bail...

                         MICK
          A million? What'd they book him on?

                         VAL'S VOICE
          He picked up a girl last night--
          Whatever went down she ended up
          pretty bad. Cops want Aggravated
          Assault with G.B.I.--

                         MICK
          Has the D.A. filed yet?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          3.

                         VAL'S VOICE
          No. See? I'm giving you ground
          floor. So make it work for me,
          Mick. Don't let him use the house,
          get him to go for my bond--
          Meanwhile the Lincoln's approaching the Lancaster courthouse,
          there are cars, people-- a traffic jam. To Earl--

                         MICK
          Bring me around to the employee's
          gate, I'll talk my way in.
          (into cell, writes)
          I'm at the courthouse. Give me the
          name.

                         VAL'S VOICE
          That would be Louis Roulet...

                         (PRONOUNCED ROO-LAY)
          R-O-U-L-E-T, like the wheel.

                         MICK
          That's not how you spell the wheel
          but I got it, thanks.

                         VAL'S VOICE
          Remember: I steered him to you.

                         MICK
          You're on my Christmas list, Val.
          Lincoln swings abruptly to a steel gate. "EMPLOYEES."

          INT. LANCASTER COURTHOUSE - COURTROOM - MINUTES LATER

          MOVING with Mick through the press of lawyers, others, before
          the Judge shows up, as a few PRISONERS are led into the
          holding pen-- Mick picks out his client, HAROLD CASEY, 30s,
          lanky, with a ponytail and skull & halo tattoo... Mick tries
          catching his eye but Harold's clearly avoiding him...

                         MICK
          Harold. Hard Case.

                         (HAROLD DUCKS)
          Don't hide from your lawyer,
          Harold, you know what I want to
          talk about.
          Caught, Harold slouches towards him.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          4.

                         MICK (CONT'D)
          Listen. when the judge comes in
          he's going to want to know if we're
          ready for trial...

                         HAROLD
          We are.

                         MICK
          We're not and you know why not. You
          haven't paid me. Rule one, remember
          Rule one, Harold? I get paid or I
          don't work.

                         HAROLD
          Don't worry, I have your money...

                         MICK
          Right, you have my money, I don't.

                         HAROLD
          It's coming. I talked to my boys.

                         MICK
          Harold-- I looked at the list of
          people I trust, and you know what?
          You're not on it.

                         HAROLD
          The law says you can't just quit.
          The Judge won't let you. I looked
          it up.
          Mick's about to react to this jailhouse lawyering-- when a
          hush falls, and the JUDGE comes out: ORTON POWELL, 60...

                         MICK
          Pay close attention, Harold.
          Goes to his seat...

          INT. COURTROOM - MINUTES LATER

          Harold's case has been called, Mick stands--

                         MICK
          Mickey Haller for the defense, your
          honor. If I may, I'd like to carry
          this over.

                         JUDGE ORTON
          Do you have a reason, Mr. Haller?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          5.

                         MICK
          I'm having trouble locating a
          witness, your honor. An
          indispensable witness. A Mr. Green.
          With emphasis. A look goes between the Judge and Mick.
          Meantime Harold stares from the pen. The Judge, to Mick--

                         JUDGE ORTON
          How much time do you need? Would a
          week be enough?

                         MICK
          I hope so, your honor. As your
          honor knows, Mr. Green can be hard
          to track down.
          A look of understanding. Judge nods--

                         JUDGE ORTON
          I'm holding this over pending
          notification from counsel...
          Then gavels down, for the next case-- As Casey's led off,
          Mick joins him along the rail-- He hisses--

                         HAROLD
          That was bullshit, askin' for a
          delay-- I know what that was about.

                         MICK
          And so does Judge Powell. He spent
          a lot of years as a defense lawyer,
          so he knows all about having to
          chase "Mr. Green," and he doesn't
          look kindly on defendants who don't
          pay their attorneys. Now do you get
          it, Harold?
          Casey won't look him in the eye-- RAP MUSIC IN AGAIN, TUPAC'S

          EXT. FREEWAY - LINCOLN (MOVING) - DAY

          The black town car cruises south, past dry brown hills...

          CELL PHONE RINGS AGAIN...

          INT. LINCOLN MOVING - BACK SEAT

          Earl, unasked, puts in his buds, as Mick answers the call--

                         

                         

                         

                         

          6.

                         MICK
          This is Haller.

                         LORNA'S VOICE
          And this is your office.

          INTERCUT: LINCOLN (MOVING)/ INT. LORNA'S CONDO -DAY

          It's a one-bedroom in Studio City, Lorna's 33, redhead,
          pretty as hell, works at her kitchen table in her bathrobe,
          among breakfast dishes...

                         MICK
          Actually I'm in my office. On my
          way to court in Van Nuys.

                         LORNA
          That means Val reached you about
          his customer.

                         MICK
          Oh yeah: "This is the franchise,
          Mick." According to Valenzuela
          every case is "the franchise." I'd
          have paid my mortgage ten times
          over by now--

                         LORNA
          It could be he's right. I ran the
          name, the family's got a real
          estate business in Beverly Hills.
          The Times has them down for some
          big house sales, movie-star
          dollars...

                         MICK

                         (CONSIDERS)
          Sounds like the media might be
          interested. Call Sticks, tell him
          to show up. Any other calls?

                         LORNA
          A couple of DUI's, I quoted them
          the house number. That's it, you're
          free after Roulet.

                         MICK
          Good. Then I can go to County lock-
          up.
          Under which Mick sees Earl indicate something on the road...
          while Lorna reacts to what Mick said, exasperated...

                         

                         

                         

                         

          7.

                         LORNA
          You're going to see Gloria. Why do
          you waste time on her, Mickey?
          Mick sees where Earl's pointing: SQUAD OF MOTORCYCLES,
          HARLEYS, IN THE SIDE-VIEW MIRRORS... They pull up alongside:
          gang jackets, black leather vests... Big guys...

                         EARL
          Want me to do somethin' about this?
          'Cause I can.

                         MICK
          Ignore them, you're doing fine.
          FACE OF THE LEADER OF THE MOTORCYCLES, leers at Mick through
          window, as Mick ignores, answers Lorna re "Gloria":

                         MICK (CONT'D)
          What can I say, Lorn, I've got a
          soft spot for redheads. Why do you
          think I married you?

                         LORNA
          The divorce papers called it
          temporary insanity.

                         MICK
          Lucky for you there was a cure.
          When-- Earl interrupts, insistent now--

                         EARL
          Mr. Haller?
          Calling his attention to-- THE MOTORCYCLES HAVE PULLED IN
          FRONT. The leader signals Earl to pull off. Mick sees they're
          surrounded. Shit.

          EXT. OFF-RAMP FOR VASQUEZ ROCKS STATE PARK - CONTINUOUS

          The Lincoln follows the Harleys off, PULLS TO A STOP in a lot
          at the crest of the exit. Jagged rocks, craggy peaks.
          The leader gets off his bike. EDDIE VOGEL, nearly 300 lbs.
          Skull & halo patch on leather vest-- same as Harold's tattoo.
          The "Road Saints." Mick lowers a window.

                         EDDIE
          Counsellor, how's it hanging?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          8.

                         MICK
          Fine, Eddie, how's it with you?

                         EDDIE

                         (CASUAL)
          Hard Case called me from the pen,
          he said I might catch up to you.
          Said you're stalling his case til
          you see more green, is that right?

                         MICK
          If you want me to work you've gat
          to pay me.

                         EDDIE
          We paid you. Five thousand.

                         MICK
          That's long gone. I could tell you
          half went to the aerial-photo
          expert. He's going to blow the
          state's case by showing that the
          DEA violated the air space over
          Harold's farm by flying too low...
          but you don't need to know that.
          All you need to know is, we had a
          deal. Time to refill the tank.
          Eddie smiles. Taps the side of the Lincoln.

                         EDDIE
          Sure, gas-guzzler like this. I
          heard you got three more. What's
          one man need with four Lincolns?

                         MICK

                         EDDIE--

                         EDDIE
          What? You want another five grand?

                         MICK
          Ten. I'm flying the guy in from
          Kodak in New York, he wants
          business class...

                         EDDIE
          And I want Harold back on the farm.
          He's the best farmer we got, if you
          know what I mean...

                         

                         

                         

                         

          9.

                         MICK
          I don't. And I don't want to.
          Either pay me my money or go with
          the Public Defender the judge finds
          you. Of course he won't know much
          about air space, but--

                         EDDIE
          Keep your shirt on, Counsellor. We
          want you.
          He reaches into a vest with his big hand. Thick envelope.
          Mick takes it. Starts to count, and realizes:

                         MICK
          You had the whole ten ready. What
          if you'd backed me down to five?

                         EDDIE
          This vest got lots of pocket.
          Eddie taps another pocket and GRINS. one tooth missing.

          INT. VAN NUYS COURTHOUSE - HOLDING CELL - DAY

          CAMERA MOVING ON: EIGHT MEN, prisoners in grey jumpers. Six
          are black. Of the two white men, one's a wet-eyed, skanky
          JUNKIE, 40s. The OTHER is a tall young man, somehow polished
          even in prison outfit, definitely out of place here--

                         MICK
          Louis Roulet?
          LOUIS turns: the proverbial deer-in-the-headlights: Scared.

                         MICK (CONT'D)
          My name is Michael Haller. I had a
          call.

                         LOUIS
          Yes-- Mr. Haller--
          Mick stands behind a painted line three feet from the cell.
          Signals Louis to come to the bars to talk. Louis approaches,

                         FREAKED--

                         LOUIS (CONT'D)
          I-- called you because I need

                         SOMEONE--

                         

                         

                         

                         

          10.

                         MICK
          You want me to represent you for
          your first appearance. I get twenty-
          five hundred for that. We can work
          out what comes next.

                         LOUIS
          Thank you-- This is a set-up, Mr.
          Haller-- I made a mistake with that
          woman, she was setting me up--

                         MICK
          Keep your voice down. And don't say
          anything about the case, not til
          I've got you out on bail. Okay?
          Mick's voice, as always, is easy and calm. Louis nods.

                         MICK (CONT'D)
          I understand your family lawyer's
          in court?

                         LOUIS
          That's him. Cecil Dobbs.
          Points to-- DOBBS, balding dignified WASP, a few rows in.

                         MICK
          Is he ready to post bail?

                         LOUIS
          He'll do whatever he has to.
          Mick nods, noting the tinge of desperation in Louis's voice.
          Takes out a notebook...

                         MICK
          Okay, tell me about yourself. How
          old are you?

                         LOUIS
          Thirty-two...

                         MICK
          Ties to the community? You grow up
          here, go to school?

                         LOUIS
          Both. Beverly Hills, UCLA. I work
          for my mother's business...

                         MICK
          "Windsor Estates?"

                         

                         

                         

                         

          11.

                         LOUIS
          It's named for her second husband.

                         MICK
          How much did you make last year?
          (when Louis hesitates)
          If I'm going to get you out I need
          to know everything.

                         LOUIS
          My taxes last year said four
          hundred thousand.
          Just then, the White Junkie lurches forward towards Mick--

                         JUNKIE
          I want a lawyer too, you got a
          card?

                         MICK
          They'll have one for you out there.
          I need you to back up and leave us
          alone. Can you do that, pal?
          Junkie backs off, does just what Mick says. Impressing Louis.
          Then Mick, low-voiced--

                         MICK (CONT'D)
          Listen. They've put some heavy
          charges on you. The DA will
          probably ask for No-Bail...

                         LOUIS
          No bail?
          Frightened voice, the others react, Mick hushes him, and...

                         MICK
          I said they're going to ask it.
          When was the last time you were
          arrested?

                         LOUIS
          Never.

                         MICK
          So if I checked your record--

                         LOUIS
          --you'd find parking tickets.
          Mick looks briefly into the younger man's eyes-- he's scared,
          fragile -- but sincere. He sputters--

                         

                         

                         

                         

          12.

                         LOUIS (CONT'D)
          This whole thing is--

                         MICK
          We're not talking about the case,
          remember? Not even to the judge.

                         LOUIS
          Don't I even say "Not guilty?"

                         MICK
          Today's about setting arraignment,
          period. You say nothing.

                         LOUIS
          Are you going to get me out?

                         MICK
          I'm gonna try, Louis.

                         (THEN)
          One more thing: There are lots of
          lawyers. Why pick me?

                         LOUIS
          I.. remembered your name from some
          case in the papers...

                         MICK
          What case?

                         LOUIS
          A drug case, I don't know.

                         MICK
          You remember the name or anything?

                         LOUIS
          No-- but you got the evidence
          thrown out against some guy-- Does
          it matter?
          (when Mick hesitates)
          I need your help, Mr. Haller.
          Off Mick, GO TO,

          AN 8 X 10 PHOTO OF A WOMAN'S BEATEN-UP FACE. CLOSE.
          Right eye bruised, swollen shut. Nose broken. Bloody gauze
          protrudes from her nostril. Lip cut and swollen like a plum.
          Gash over the right eye. Fear in her expression...
          Studying it is ASSISTANT D.A. MAGGIE McPHERSON, 30s. We're:

                         

                         

                         

                         

          13.

          INT. ARRAIGNMENT COURT - PROSECUTOR'S TABLE - LATER

          Maggie's in a navy suit, raven-black hair: smart and strong
          and a beauty. Coming up behind her--

                         MICK
          Are you the prosecutor who used to
          have the Roulet case?
          She starts to smile-- until his emphasis registers.

                         MAGGIE
          Don't tell me. Son of a bitch,
          Haller.

                         MICK
          Rules are rules.

                         MAGGIE
          I wanted this one...

                         (YIELDS)
          Alright I'll go quietly. But after
          today's hearing, if you don't
          object.

                         MICK
          Depends. You going for no-bail?

                         MAGGIE
          That won't change with the
          prosecutor. Not with what your guy
          did.
          With which she shows him the photo: gruesome.

                         MICK
          If he did it.

                         MAGGIE
          Sure. "If." They only picked him up
          in her home with blood all over
          him, but it's a valid question...

                         MICK
          I love it when you're sarcastic.
          Can I at least see the arrest
          report?

                         MAGGIE
          Get it from whoever takes over. No
          favors on this one.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          14.
          Mick looks admiringly at Maggie. At her passion.

                         MICK
          How's Hayley?
          A beat. Off the sudden shift in topic, Maggie starts putting
          away the things on her desk...

                         MAGGIE
          She's good. She likes the things
          you send her but would rather you
          show up yourself...

                         MICK
          How about this weekend?
          This takes her by surprise. But she takes him up on it.

                         MAGGIE
          Okay, I'll tell Hayley. Tonight.
          Only Mick-- don't cancel on her.

          CUT TO, INT. COURTROOM - LATER

          A TV CAMERA is trained toward LOUIS in the HOLDING AREA, he
          tries avoiding it... while MICK AND MAGGIE are ARGUING IN

          FRONT OF THE JUDGE...

                         MICK
          Judge, there is no way the state
          can claim my client is a flight

                         RISK--

                         MAGGIE
          With resources like this man has,
          it's always a risk-- let alone the
          fact that the victim was brutally

                         ASSAULTED--

                         JUDGE
          Ms. McPherson, the extent of her
          injuries are not the point. I'm
          setting bail at a million
          dollars...
          Mick wins, Maggie loses. Exchange glances--

          WE'RE-- INT. DOORS TO THE COURTROOM - MOMENTS LATER

          Mick bangs out, always moving. Getting the door for him is
          his friend, bail bondsman "VAL" VALENZUELA, excited--

                         

                         

                         

                         

          15.

                         VAL
          What'd I tell you, Mick, we got us
          a franchise...

                         MICK
          We'll see, Val...

                         VAL
          There's the lawyer-guy, you get him
          to go for the cash-bond...
          MOVING from Val, Mick HEADS DOWN THE HALL, through the BUSY
          CRUSH of attorneys, clients, spectators to-- DOBBS, waiting.

                         MICK
          Cecil Dobbs?

                         DOBBS
          Mr. Haller.
          (They shake hands.)
          It was depressing to see the boy
          caught up in that cattle call...

                         MICK
          Boy?

                         DOBBS
          I've represented the family so long
          I think of Louis that way.

                         MICK
          He did look a little frail. My
          advice is, let Mr. Valenzuela fix
          you up with a bond and take "the
          boy" home.

                         DOBBS
          A bond? But Mrs. Windsor was
          thinking of putting up property...

                         MICK
          No good. Assessing it will take
          days. By then Louis might be
          carrying somebody's child.
          (before Dobbs can argue)
          So just tap Val for the bond,
          spring Louis, and take him to your
          office. We'll meet there at Four.
          And heads off again. Dobbs follows him out, to...

                         0

                         

                         

                         

                         

          16.

          EXT. VAN NUYS COURTHOUSE, DAY - MICK AND DOBBS

          Sunlight. Where Dobbs suddenly TENSES as he SEES: A TV
          CAMERAMAN coming out with camera. Off Dobbs's reaction--

                         MICK
          Yep. Media's already picked us up.

                         DOBBS
          Mrs. Windsor's sensitive about the
          press...
          Mick, a beat. Then calls the cameraman over. When he comes--

                         MICK
          I saw you in there filming. What's
          your name?

                         CAMERAMAN
          Rob Gillen. They call me "Sticks."

                         MICK
          You freelancing on this, Sticks?

                         STICKS
          Your client's got profile, I figure
          I can sell it to local news.

                         MICK
          How much?

                         STICKS
          'Scuse me?

                         MICK
          How much will they pay you for what
          you shot today?

                         STICKS
          That depends. Seven, seven-fifty.

                         MICK
          Suppose we take it off your hands
          for eight.
          Sticks hesitates, like it's not the legit thing to do.

                         MICK (CONT'D)
          Or do we make it a thousand.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          17.
          Sticks hesitates no longer. Takes the tape from the camera
          and hands it to Mick... who's already counting out money from
          the roll of cash Ted gave him. To Dobbs--

                         MICK (CONT'D)
          I can expense this, right?

                         DOS
          Of course. Absolutely.
          Sticks takes the money, goes. Dobbs, impressed, beaming now--

                         DOBBS (CONT'D)
          I'll admit, Mr. Haller, you weren't
          my choice. You were Louis's.
          Frankly I'd never heard of you. But
          maybe I should have. Seems to me
          I've underestimated you.

                         MICK
          Then let's talk about my fees.
          (before Dobbs can reply)
          I'll need a hundred thousand up
          front. Working off five-fifty an
          hour, it'll come to another hundred
          thousand if we go to trial. That's
          estimating the trial at a week.
          Appeals, we start over.
          Mick's Lincoln pulls up smoothly to fetch him at the curb.
          Mick, hand on the door--

                         MICK (CONT'D)
          I take it that's not a problem.
          Reaction Dobbs-- hesitates but has no choice. MICK GETS IN,
          we GLIMPSE THE LINCOLN'S LICENSE PLATE: NT GLTY 2-- CUT TO,

          INT. LINCOLN (MOVING) - RAP PLAYS, EARL DRIVES, AS:


                         LORNA'S VOICE
          How'd it go, Mickey? We get the
          case?

                         MICK
          (into his cell)
          We've got it if we want it. I'd
          still like to know the state's
          case, what they've got on him...

                         LORNA'S VOICE
          What's the difference? 'Course we
          want the case...
          Mick says nothing. Gaze out the window. Then...

                         MICK
          I've got an hour til he's released.
          Til then I'll be at county. With
          Gloria.
          (before she says anything)
          Any calls?

                         LORNA'S VOICE
          Only Sticks. He says he owes you
          five hundred next time he sees you.

                         MICK
          Yeah he does.

          Mickey Mantle. You're going to bat
          for me again?
          GLORIA, redhead, 27 but good looks already fading-- greets
           the arriving Mick in a client/attorney booth.

                         MICK
          You don't even know who the Mick
          was. You don't look good, Gloria.

                         GLORIA
          Thanks. For coming, not for the
          compliment.
          Mick's already paging through her arrest-sheet, sees...

                         MICK
          Something new for you, getting
          booked on possession of coke, along
          with the usual.

                         GLORIA
          Dumb, I know. A guy paid me with
          it, I had it on me when I went to
          my next.

                         MICK
          And your next was a cop.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          19.
          She shrugs/nods. Mick keeps turning pages, looking for a
          break... while...

                         GLORIA
          Can't you get me into one of those
          rehab places where they get you
          straight?

                         MICK
          We did a pre-trial rehab, last
          time. The D.A. won't go for it
          again. You may have to do some jail
          here.

                         GLORIA
          I can't.

                         MICK
          Yeah you can. They've got programs
          in jail, too. Look, you've had a
          long run. Maybe after this you can
          finally get out of the life.

                         GLORIA
          And do what? Have kids and plant
          flowers? Look at me.
          Mick doesn't have an answer. Opens a notebook, gets to work.

                         MICK
          Okay, tell me what happened.

                         GLORIA
          I did a guy at the Travel Lodge on
          Santa Monica...

                         MICK
          The one who paid you coke instead
          of money?

                         GLORIA
          He had a shitload in there. I saw.
          Which gets Mick's attention. His wheels suddenly turning...

                         MICK
          Do you know who he was?

                         GLORIA
          No. He reached me on my website. He
          was Mexican or something.

                         MICK
          (writes, likes this--)
          Did you screen him?

                         GLORIA
          Don't I screen 'em all?

                         MICK
          off what, his driver's license?

                         GLORIA
          No, his passport. I think his name
          was, Hector, or--

                         MICK
          Hector what? Last name. Think.

          INT. CRIMINAL COURTS BUILDING, L.A. - D.A.'S OFFICE - DAY


                         MICK
          Moya. Hector "Arrande" Moya is what
          you get if you run a trace. He's
          Colombian, a fugitive from a Grand
          Jury indictment down in Florida.
          The DEA wants him for drug
          trafficking.
          The D.A.'s LESLIE FAIRE: a woman, well-dressed, humorless.

                         MICK (CONT'D)
          Leslie? They want him a lot.

                         LESLIE FAIRE
          And your girl's looking to trade?

                         MICK
          She'll give you his motel and room
          number.

                         LESLIE FAIRE
          She'll also have to testify on the
          coke.

                         MICK
          That's a No. Location only. Your
          guys take it from there. My
          investigator says Hector hasn't
          checked out yet.

                         LESLIE FAIRE
          (as she weighs it)
          What's she want in exchange?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          21.

                         MICK
          You drop charges, and all she does
          is a Pre-trial Rehabilitation. The
          facility at USC-Med would be nice.
          (when she hesitates)
          Or do I take this straight to the
          Feds?
          Which, though veiled, is a threat. Leslie hates this.

           INT. DOBBS'S CENTURY CITY LAW OFFICE - CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

           HIGH FLOOR, TALL WINDOWS. DOBBS, ON THE CUT, lets in MICK.
           Mick's checking the impressive room, vast views all the way
           to the Pacific, as the OTHERS enter behind him: MARY WINDSOR
          (distinguished, 60), LOUIS (suit, silk t-shirt, Ray-bans.)
          Another man, 45, thickly built, enters at Mick's side.

                         MICK
          Mrs. Windsor, this is Raul Levin.
          Mr. Levin's my investigator.
          Accepting this, everyone takes their place at the long,
          blonde-wood conference table. Mick can't help run his hand
          over the surface, everything's a contrast to his own on-the-
          fly office... Dobbs, to Mrs. Windsor...

                         DOBBS
          Mrs. Windsor, I can't commend Mr.
          Haller highly enough for his
          performance in court this morning.
          Mary Windsor nods, provisionally pleased.

                         MARY WINDSOR
          I have a check for you, Mr. Haller.
          And slides it towards him in an envelope. Mick, tries not to
          seem too much in a hurry as he glances inside--
          ANGLE, we glimpse the amount, the zeroes... $100,000... BUT:

                         MICK
          I'm going to need that to come from
          your son, Mrs. Windsor.
          (slides it back to her)
          You can give him the money so he
          can write the check. But I want the
          check to come from Louis. He's my
          client and that's got to be clear
          from the start. No offense.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          22.
          She is offended-- but takes back the envelope, nods to LOUIS.
          He takes out a checkbook, writes. Mick continues to Mary--

                         MICK (CONT'D)
          Thank you. I'll expect you to
          support your son through this in
          other ways. If you're willing.

                         MARY WINDSOR
          Don't be silly. I'll back my son
          come hell or high water. These
          ridiculous charges. That ridiculous
          woman.

                         MICK
          It's good to know you'll be there
          when we need you.

                         MARY WINDSOR
          But not now, is that it?

                         MICK
          We'll be going over the case. The
          D.A. could make you testify about
          what you hear. Attorney privilege
          doesn't cover you.
          Mary Windsor's motionless a moment. Rather than respond, she
          simply rises. To Louis--

                         MARY WINDSOR
          I will see you at dinner.
          And goes. Dobbs gets the door for her. When she's gone:

                         LOUIS
          My mother built a good business.
          From the ground up.

                         MICK
          I've got no trouble believing that.
          (after a beat)
          I say we get started.
          All agree, they sit, Mick starts up--

                         MICK (CONT'D)
          Our first choice is whether we
          waive our right to a speedy trial.

                         LOUIS
          No. I want this behind me.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          23.

                         MICK
          You sure? You can stretch things
          out, enjoy your freedom. Most
          clients...

                         LOUIS
          Guilty clients, you mean. I want
          this over.
          Mick's struck by how firm.

                         MICK
          Fine. We go to trial right away.
          Puts more pressure on the D.A.

                         DOBBS
          Or maybe the case never even goes
          to trial.
          (They look at him.)
          Our firm's clout is considerable.
          Pressure can be brought to bear--

          MI C K
          Don't kid yourself, Cecil.
          (to Dobbs and Louis)
          No way the state is dropping these
          charges. In fact, they've already
          upped them-- to improve their
          negotiating position.

                         LOUIS
          There won't be any negotiating.
          (before Mick can speak)
          No plea bargain, no nothing. I'm
          not going to jail for something I
          didn't do.

                         MICK
          It might not be jail.

                         LOUIS
          Even if I walk. I'm innocent and if
          there's a trial I want to get on
          the stand and tell the jury I'm
          innocent. If that's a problem we
          can part company right now.
          Mick looks at the young man. Evaluating. Then...

                         MICK
          Time to tell me what happened.
          Louis. Removes his Ray-Bans. SUDDENLY:

                         

                         

                         

                         

          24.

          WE'RE IN A BAR (MORGAN'S, STUDIO CITY)... NIGHT...
          CAMERA MOVES among L.A. yuppies, night-players. The scene's
          low-key but sexy, expensive... Waitresses roam...

          LOUIS (V.O.)
          I was having a drink at Morgan's,
          Ventura Boulevard...

          MICK (V.0.)
          Morgan's, that's a singles bar,
          right?
          Camera finds LOUIS at the bar, checking out the action...

          LOUIS (V.O. )
          Right, nice place, good for pick-
          ups. That's why I was there.
          Looking to get laid, pure and
          simple.

          BACK TO, LAW OFFICE
          Mick, to Raul, who's holding a dark blue file:

                         MICK
          Raul, what's the file say about the
          girl?

                         RAUL
          (reads-- Chicago accent)
          Regina Campo, goes by "Reggie."
          Twenty six. An actress and a
          telephone solicitor.

                         DOBBS
          And hoping to retire. Soon as she
          sues my client.

                         MICK
          (ignores Dobbs; to Louis)
          Did you know her before last night?

          BACK TO, MORGAN'S, NIGHT... HAND-HELD, CLOSE ON...
          REGGIE CAMPO, mid-20s, the finest sexual kitten imaginable,
          humor enlivening her face and eyes and mouth, moving...

                         

                         

                         

                         

          25.

          LOUIS (V.O.)
          I'd seen her around, but never
          spoke to her. She was always with a
          guy. She was with one last night.
          She slows as she passes Louis, whispers, her lips brush his
          face as she discreetly hands him something...
          LOUIS (V. O.) (con t' d)
          She just laid her address on me. On
          a napkin.

          MICK (V.0.)
          But she was still with a guy?
          Reggie returns to: THE GUY at the bar: 40s, hard like a vet.

          LOUIS (V.0.)
          I got it that she wasn't too into
          her date. She told me he'd be gone
          by ten if I was interested.

          BACK TO, LAW OFFICE

                         LOUIS (CONT'D)
          I didn't keep the napkin. I work in
          real estate, I remember addresses.

                         MICK
          Raul. Check that file you've got
          and see if the Police report has
          any of this.
          While Raul looks, Mick explains to Louis and Dobbs, can't
          hide some professional pride in Raul Levin's work--

                         MICK (CONT'D)
          Raul's already worked us a little
          miracle. He's managed to score a
          copy of the discovery file,
          everything the D.A.'s got. They'd
          have to turn it over eventually but
          it could have been weeks.
          Under which, Raul's checked the blue file, and...

                         RAUL
          Nope. They don't have the other
          guy. They don't even have the bar.

                         MICK
          All they've got is, Louis shows up
          and beats the crap out of her?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          26.

                         RAUL
          That's it.

                         LOUIS
          That is such bullshit--

                         MICK
          Just keep telling me.

          EXT. PARKING LOT, REGGIE'S APARTMENT COMPLEX... NIGHT...

          LOUIS is sitting in a Porsche Carrera...

          LOUIS (V.0.)
          I didn't want to walk in on
          anything, so I got there early.
          His POV, shadow-figure of Hard-Guy approaching in the dark..

                         LOUIS (CONT'D)
          I waited til the guy came out.

          MICK (V.0.)
          You see what he was driving?

          LOUIS (V.0.)
          A Corvette. Yellow.
          Hard-Guy gets in the Corvette, pulls out.

          MICK (V.0.)
          So he leaves, and you go in...

          INT. HALLWAY/ DOOR TO REGGIE'S APARTMENT... HAND-HELD...

          Arriving up the stairs is Louis, knocks. A little while, and
          the door opens a crack. Reggie, part of her face, peers out.

          LOUIS (V.O.)
          She saw it was me...

          CONTINUOUS AS LOUIS ENTERS HER APARTMENT...
          LOUIS (V. O.) (coast' d)
          The hallway inside was tight. I had
          to walk past her, y'know, so she
          could close the door. So I had to
          turn my back to her.
          We SEE this, she's behind him... as we hear, simply...

                         

                         

                         

                         

          27.
          LOUIS (V.0.) (cont'd)
          Then, that was it.

          BACK SUDDENLY TO, LAW OFFICE. MICK, SURPRISED.

                         MICK
          What was what?

                         LOUIS
          She hit me with something and I
          went down. It got black fast.
          SUDDEN POP TO, LOUIS STRUCK FROM BEHIND... Blacking out as he
          tumbles... BACK TO,

          INT. LAW OFFICE

          Conference table's silent. All looking at Louis.

                         MICK
          Okay then. What do you remember
          next?

                         LOUIS
          Waking up with two guys sitting on
          me. Holding me down.

          QUICK CUT TO, REGGIE'S APARTMENT, LIVING ROOM...
          TWO GUYS straddle Louis who is face down on the floor.
          LOUIS (V.0.) (cont'd)
          Couple of faggots from next door.

          BACK TO, LAW OFFICE

                         RAUL
          Police report has them, homosexual
          couple from down the hall...

                         LOUIS
          Like I said. Faggots.
          To which Raul says nothing. After a beat--

                         MICK
          Go on, Louis.

                         LOUIS
          I was still foggy when the cops
          came...

                         

                         

                         

                         

          28.
           BACK TO, LIVING ROOM... Louis is cuffed by now, hands behind
          him, COP looms over...
           LOUIS (V.O.) (cont'd)
           She was on the couch telling all
          these lies...
           PARAMEDICS work on Reggie's bloodied face while, to a FEMALE
          COP (MAXWELL), through sobs, still frightened--

                         REGGIE
          .he was like an animal! He said
          he'd rape me and kill me... then
          rape me again when I was dead...
          Louis looks around at his left hand in a plastic ba Bloody.

          LOUIS (V.O. )
          That's when I saw she'd set it up.

          BACK TO, LAW OFFICE.

                         MICK
          Set it up how?

                         LOUIS
          Put blood on my hand. My left hand.
          But I'm right-handed, I'd use my
          right if I was going to... punch
          someone. Which is crazy.
          Louis mimes throwing a punch, in the air. Inept.

                         DOBBS
          Louis never hit anyone in his life.

                         RAUL
          What she did made sense. It's the
          right side of her face that was
          hit, she had to bloody your left.

                         MICK
          Louis: You said she opened the door
          a crack. Did you see her face?

                         LOUIS
          Not all of it...

          CUT TO, DOOR OF REGGIE'S APARTMENT... OPENING AGAIN...
          It open a crack. Enough for her look out, half her face...

                         

                         

                         

                         

          29.
          LOUIS (V.0.) (cont'd)
          Mainly her eye. Her left eye.

          RAUL (V.0.)
          That's it!...
          BACK TO, LAW OFFICE. Raul... mimes the opening of the door...

                         RAUL (CONT'D)
          She already had the injuries, on
          the right. She was hiding it from
          him when he steps in...

                         MICK
          And then she clocks him?

                         LOUIS
          Yes.

                         MICK
          So our case is, she beat herself
          up?
          Mick takes the file, takes the 8xl0s, REGGIE'S PULPED FACE...

                         MICK (CONT'D)
          We're saying, she pounded her face
          into hamburger meat, or had her
          boyfriend do it, hoping some far-
          off day a jury would give her a big
          fat reward?

                         LOUIS
          She must have.

                         DOBBS
          Of course. She saw his Porsche, his
          Rolex, it's known the family has
          money... I'll wager she's already
          filed in civil court.
          Mick. Thinks. Then, to Raul--

                         MICK
          Okay, the police report. Let's hear
          how Reggie tells it.

          CUT TO, INT. DOORWAY TO REGGIE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

          She's opened a crack, peering out... Raul reads...

                         

                         

                         

                         

          30.

          RAUL (V. 0. )
          "According to the victim, she was
          at home alone when the suspect
          presented himself at the door as
          someone she knew..."
          Louis is there, talks MOS. Reggie opens the rest of the way.
          RAUL (V.0.) (cont'd)
          "Upon letting him in, she was
          immediately struck..."
          WHICH WE SEE: The vicious repeated pounding of her face,
          bloodying her, but it's too fast & jumbled for details...

          MICK (V.0.)
          Does it say he knocked her down?
          She falls... Louis flies down on top of her...

          RAUL (V.0.)
          Yeah, then straddled her. "Held the
          victim by the neck until she agreed
          to cooperate..."
          Louis does as described, strangle-hold... Eventually lets her
          up, turning her toward the bedroom. And...
          RAUL (V.O.) (cont'd)
          "The suspect maintained a position
          behind her, holding a knife against
          the left side of her throat..."

          CLOSE, HAND-HELD, KNIFE-POINT TO NECK, SLIGHT CUT, BLOOD...

          RESUME, INT. LAW OFFICE.

          Raul takes something new from the file: PHOTO OF A BLOODY
          KNIFE. Sharpened to a point. Louis looks at it. Seethes.

                         LOUIS
          This isn't my knife.

                         MICK
          Raul, are his prints on there?

                         RAUL
          That's what the report says. I'm
          not surprised, if she put blood on
          his hands she's gonna put prints on
          his knife...

                         

                         

                         

                         

          31.

                         LOUIS
          I told you, it's not "my" knife!
          Mick ignores, still intent on Raul's reading...

                         MICK
          Okay, how's she say he went down?

                         RAUL
          "As Ms. Campo entered the hallway,

          And Reggie scurrying free... STAY ON the fallen Louis as...

          RAUL (V.0.)
          "Realizing her attacker would catch
          her at the front door, she ducked
          into the kitchen and seized a
          bottle of vodka..."
          Louis, struggling to his feet, HIT ON THE HEAD from behind..

          MICK (V. D. )
          And clonked him when he got up?

          RAUL (V.0.)
          That's how she tells it.

          RESUME, INT. LAW OFFICE


                         LOUIS
          Those are all lies, this is bull--

                         MICK
          If everything she said is a lie,
          this will be the easiest case ever.
          I'll tear her apart and throw her
          entrails into the sea. But Louis...
          (He moves closer, for:)
          You swear it's all lies? Is there
          anything you aren't telling me?
          Mick's eyes burn into him. Louis answers simply.

                         LOUIS
          Nothing.
          Mick holds him in a long, hard, assessing stare. Over which,
          eventually, we PRE-LAP--

          MICK (V.O.)
          The way Louis tells it...

          INT. BAR (SMOKEHOUSE) - NIGHT - THE ENTRANCE


                         MICK
          .it's just quirky enough.
          Mick and Raul coming out, after having a few. It's a lawyers'
          hangout at this hour, others are coming/going...

                         RAUL
          Quirky enough for what?

                         MICK
          To be true. Maybe it went down just
          like he says.
          (off Raul's look)
          Anyway there's a. chance.
          In a party of law-types, we GLIMPSE MAGGIE, who catches sight
          of Mick in the doorway... while Raul mulls what Mick said...

                         RAUL
          An innocent client. Jeezus.

                         MICK
          Yeah. But you know what my father
          said about innocent clients...
          Maggie's overheard this, gives the answer.

                         MAGGIE
          He said there's no client as scary
          as an innocent man.
          Mick, seeing her, smiles and continues, a little tipsy...

                         MICK
          That's right. Because if you screw
          up and he goes to prison, it scars
          you for life. There's only one
          verdict. You've got to put an N.G.
          on the board.

                         (ADDS)
          Hey Mags.
          She reads the state he's in.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          33.

                         MAGGIE
          Raul, if you let a man drive in his
          condition I think I can charge you
          both.
          The guys look at each other. Maggie swipes the keys--

                         MAGGIE (CONT'D)
          I'll drive him to his house.

                         RAUL
          And how will you get home?

                         MAGGIE
          My friends brought me. I'll keep
          the car, he can pick it up at my
          place in the morning.

                         (TO MICK)
          Get in.
          And she gets in the driver's side, waits. Mick to Raul--

                         MICK
          Okay, you know the moves. Make the
          rounds, check out Morgan's Bar...

                         RAUL
          And Mr. Corvette...

                         MICK
          And Regina Campo. The way Louis
          says she came on's got me
          wondering.
          Mick gets in and closes the door. As Maggie starts it up and
          pulls away, and we SEE the "NT GLTY" PLATES again... go to...

          INT. LINCOLN (MOVING) - NIGHT

          Ride in silence. Then Mick, mischievous, turns on the RAP.

                         TUPAC
          "God bless the dead and buried
          nigga,
          Don't worry if you see God first,
          Tell him shit got worse..."

                         MAGGIE
          You've got to be kidding me.

                         MICK
          Earl lays this stuff on me.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          34.

                         MAGGIE
          Where is Earl tonight?

                         MICK
          I never keep him this late.

                         MAGGIE
          Hasn't he worked your fee off yet?

                         MICK
          A while ago. But he likes driving,
          keeps him out of trouble... He's
          taking courses, too, in music.

                         MAGGIE
          You can't tell by this stuff.
          She snaps the rap OFF.

                         MICK
          You get used to it. Besides, Tupac,
          he helps me understand my clients.
          Most of them go to school on his

                         MAGGIE
          Not Roulet.

                         MICK
          Not Louis, no. Louis is my
          franchise player, he pays for all
          the rest...
          After a beat... Office gossip...

                         MAGGIE
          I heard Smithson assigned Ted
          Minton to your case.

                         MICK
          Never heard of him.

                         MAGGIE
          He's brand new. Bright, though.
          Smithson's protegee. Naturally.
          Georgetown, buys his suits at
          Brooks, above all he's a guy...
          Mick looks over at her, as she flares, calms... Moonlight
          lines her profile. Made self-conscious by his watching her,
          she moves her hair from her face. Beyond pretty: Beautiful.

                         MICK
          Lorna made me my schedule.
          Saturday's fine to take Hayley.

                         MAGGIE
          Saturday there's the Sponge-Bob
          movie...

                         MICK
          I'm all over it. How's she doing?

                         MAGGIE
          I'll know when I drop you and get
          home to relieve the sitter...
          (catches him looking)
          What?

                         MICK
          Moonlight becomes you.

                         MAGGIE

                         (GLANCES)
          That's not doing me any good,
          Haller.

          EXT. MICK HALLER'S HOUSE, LAUREL CANYON - DARK - NIGHT

          The Lincoln pulls up. Mick gets out but stands there.

                         MICK
          Thanks.
          She nods You're welcome. And pulls away. Mick's smile fades
          as he looks up at his dark lonely house.

          INT. MICK HALLER'S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER - ON:

          AN ANSWERING MACHINE, he's just hit Play. BEEP.

          VOICE OF A CHILD (HAYLEY)
          Daddy, Mommy said I could call and
          say G'night. Sorry you're not
          there. G'night, Daddy.

                         MICK
          Me too, baby.
          Then Mick hits "Play" again. BEEP.

          VOICE OF HAYLEY
          Daddy, Mommy said I could call...

          Top o' the mornin', Mr. McGinley!
          You know what day it is?
          Mick's client, DARIUS McGINLEY, black, 2B: In chains. Mick is
          beside him, as he answers, confused--

                         DARIUS
          The day I get my sentence?

                         JUDGE FLYNN
          That too. But it's also St.
          Patrick's Day. A day to revel in
          your Irish heritage.
          Darius doesn't get Flynn's joke. Mick cautions Darius, low--

                         MI CK
          He's an asshole but just be cool.
          Darius scowls... under which Mick notices that RAUL has
          showed up, is trying to get his attention... while...

                         JUDGE FLYNN
          Do you know the origin of your
          name, Mr. McGinley?

                         DARIUS
          Slave-holder, I 'spect. Why do I
          care who that motherfucka be?

                         MICK
          Darius I told you--

                         DARIUS
          The man's dissin' me!

                         JUDGE FLYNN

                         (GLARES)
          Alright: If you don't care about
          your name, then I don't.

          Let's get on with your sentence for
          the sale of rock cocaine and get
          you off to prison, shall we?
          Darius, pissed. Raul waves to Mick, wants to talk...

          INT. COMPTON COURTROOM - LATER - ANGLE...

          Darius led off by guards-- Mick, defeated, confronts Raul.

                         MICK
          What couldn't wait, Raul?

          We caught a break. The owner had a

          I know the place. They got a
          smoking porch out front.

                         RAUL'S VOICE
          That's where he goese. Giving
          Reggie her chance. Watch her.
          She passes behind Louis, trails her hand along his
          shoulders... keeps going out of frame...

          MICI{' S VOICE
          That's not how he said it went

          How can they? I got the one and
          only. It ain't a copy.

                         MICK
          You're exceedingly beautiful.

                         MICK
          It means he's right-handed. But the
          facial blows were from the left...

                         RAUL
          Slow down. You said you knew
          Morgan's. So you oughta realize...
          (as Mick stares)
          This image is in the mirror over
          the bar. That's how the owner set
          the camera to watch his register.

                         MICK
          So everything's backwards...

                         RAUL
          Yeah. But it's not on the tape.
          You know how you were wondering
          about Regina?

                         MICK
          Yeah?
          Raul just looks at him. Off Mick,

          HARD CUT TO, EXT. STREET, BEVERLY HILLS, DAY - THE LINCOLN...

          Jams/wedges its way through traffic, to halt at the curb.
          MICK exits, heads towards... into...

          INT. WINDSOR ESTATES, OUTER OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

          Behind the reception desk is ROBIN, tan/sexy blonde, hair
          hanging straight over one eye like a scythe...

                         MICK
          Mickey Haller. Here to see Louis.

                         ROBIN
          Mr. Roulet is with someone. He
          can't be disturbed.
          It's like he doesn't hear her-- walks calmly past her-- to --
          THE DOOR TO LOUIS ROULET'S OFFICE- Mick ENTERS, finds Louis
          with his loafers off, on the couch with his cell-phone
          cradled to his ear. Robin chases behind...

                         ROBIN (CONT'D)
          I'm sorry, Mr. Roulet, this man
          just came back here--

                         LOUIS
          It's okay, Robin. You can go.
          Robin exits. Louis mutters an apology into his cell-phone and
          rings off. Looks annoyed at Mick.

                         LOUIS (CONT'D)
          I was setting up a showing.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          41.

                         MICK
          There won't be any showings in
          Pelican Bay.

                         LOUIS
          Where's that?

                         MICK
          It's a supermax prison where they
          send violent sex offenders. You'll
          fit in real good in your loafers.

                         LOUIS
          What's the matter?

                         MICK
          You lied to me, Louis. I'm about to
          go and see the new prosecutor,
          who's doing everything he can to
          put you away, and now I find out
          you've been lying.
          (before Louis can deny)
          Tell me about Reggie Campo.

                         LOUIS
          What about her? I've told you--

                         MICK
          You didn't tell me. That you were
          going to pay her for sex.
          (off Louis's surprise)
          You think it's hard to find out
          somebody's not Snow White?

                         LOUIS
          Alright yes, I was going to pay.
          She wrote down a price on the
          napkin, four hundred dollars...

                         MICK
          Why didn't you tell me this in
          Cecil's office?

                         LOUIS
          I didn't want my mother to know.
          Cecil tells her everything. And can
          we keep it down? Her office is on
          the other side of that door...
          Mick looks at Louis's concern. Believes it. Easing up...

                         

                         

                         

                         

          42.

                         MICK
          This changes things. You see that,
          don't you?

                         LOUIS
          I'm not a lawyer. Explain it to me.

                         MICK
          Alright I will. You know that guy
          on the Venice boardwalk? The one
          who has all those plates spinning
          on sticks?

                         LOUIS
          What does this have to do with--

                         MICK
          Just listen. A bunch of spinning
          plates: that's the state's case. In
          the middle is a big one. It's a
          fucking platter. And if that falls
          it takes the others down with it.
          (He gets closer to Louis)
          The big plate is the victim. The
          only witness against you. I knock
          her down, the act is over and the
          crowd goes home. No trial.
          Mick has Louis' attention now.

                         LOUIS
          You can make this trial go away?

                         MICK
          We've lost time. You concealed from
          me the fact that could do it. It
          comes down to why.

                         LOUIS
          Why what?

                         MICK
          Why would a guy with a Porsche and
          a Rolex need a knife to get sex
          from a woman who sells it anyway?
          The answer is, he wouldn't. And
          when you see that you see the set-
          up, the trap. And suddenly it's the
          defendant who looks like the
          victim.
          Louis gets it. Penitent.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          43.

                         LOUIS
          You're going to the prosecutor now?

                         MICK
          Yes. Young hot-shot named Ted
          Minton. He wants to give me the
          discovery file. Poor guy doesn't
          know that Raul already got it. He's
          new to felonies but he's no dope.
          When he hears his vic's a hooker
          he'll know we've knocked all his
          plates down.

                         LOUIS
          Then it'll be over?

                         MICK
          No promises, Louis.
          Louis closes his eyes, savors the prospect. Then sees Mick to
          the door. When he opens it: MARY WINDSOR's there. Surprised
          to see Haller.

          MRS. WINDSOR
          I didn't know you were here. Is
          there news?

                         LOUIS
          There will be, Mother.
          And puts out a hand to Mick. Grateful. Hesitating half a
          beat, Mick shakes it and goes...
          Louis and his Mother. Regard each other. Face to face.

          INT. VAN NUYS CIVIC CENTER - D.A.'S OFFICE, RECEPTION - DAY

          Mick in a chair. Impatient. Legal secretaries, prosecutors,
          etc., come and go, when-- a guy Mick recognizes, DETECTIVE
          KURLEN, fat, 40, approaches a desk with a stack of papers--

                         SECRETARY
          Are these for A.D.A. Knight?

                         KURLEN
          Yeah, and they're my only copies.
          I'll wait while you copy them.

                         SECRETARY
          I'll have to ask her...
          But, he holds them back. Stares. She yields...

                         

                         

                         

                         

          44.

                         SECRETARY (CONT'D)
          I'll run them for you now.

                         KURLEN
          Just what I wanted to hear.
          She goes. Mick tries to avoid Kurlen-- but too late--

                         KURLEN (CONT'D)
          Well, look who's come callin'.

                         MICK
          Detective Kurlen.

                         KURLEN
          (re papers he dropped off)
          Puttin' a case away. Guy drowned
          his neighbor's kid in a tub to see
          what it felt like. It won't shock
          you to hear he was high...

                         MICK
          Thanks for clearing that up.

                         KURLEN
          If he gets San Quentin, maybe he
          can look up your boy Jesus
          Martinez.
          Mick bristles at this reference. Turns away again. To a

                         PASSING SECRETARY:

                         MICK
          (to a passing secretary)
          Is Minton back yet?--

                         SECRETARY #2
          He'll be a few more minutes, sir.
          Kurlen, seeing he's drawn blood, continues to needle.

                         KURLEN
          How's he doin' up there, anyway? He
          make the pucker-up-and-kiss-me
          team?

                         MICK
          I haven't talked to him.

                         KURLEN
          I guess once they plead guilty,
          they're not much use to you.

                         (MORE)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          45.

                         KURLEN (CONT'D)
          (rubbing it in)
          He went down forever, right?

                         MICK
          He got life, but he'll be out. I
          don't know when.

                         KURLEN
          Too bad. 'Cause his victim, Martha
          Renteria? She's dead forever.

                         MICK
          You don't have to remind me you
          were lead dick on that.
          Kurlen grins. Shakes his head.

                         KURLEN
          How's a guy like you sleep at
          night? With the scum you represent.
          Mick's had enough. Moves closer. To tell him a story.

                         MICK
          I had a client once, he decapitated
          his ex-wife, then kept her head in
          the refrigerator.

                         KURLEN

                         (DISGUSTED--)
          Naturally you got him off.

                         MICK
          The D.A. got greedy. Tried to pile
          on two unsolved murders, trick up
          evidence to stick my guy with them.
          It's called the justice system, we
          don't do things that way.

          KURT. EN
          So your guy's out walkin' around.
          He ever do it again?

                         MICK
          I don't know. I never heard of him
          after that.

                         KURLEN
          But he could have. Fuck you,
          Haller.

                         MICK

                         (THE POINT:)
          No. Fuck the D.A.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          46.
          Before Kurlen can react-- TED MINTON arrives. Fresh-faced,
          Ivy League, 30.

                         TED
          Mr. Haller?
          (Mick stands, relieved.)
          Sorry you had to wait. I hope it'll
          be worth your while.
          He gives Mick a thin, white-covered file from a briefcase.
          Mick, leaving the still-sneering Kurlen behind, takes the
          file and follows Minton off-- tapping the file with a finger--

                         MICK
          Looks kinda thin for a discovery

                         FILE--

                         TED
          Yes well-- We can go to my office--

                         MICK
          I've got a question first.
          He takes from his pocket: Raul's DISC. The DVD Raul gave him.

                         MICK (CONT'D)
          You have something to play this on?

          INT. TED MINTON'S OFFICE - AT HIS DESK - MOMENTS LATER

          ANGLE the young prosecutor's face as he watches the bar-tape.
          And Mick watching him for his reaction...
          When it's done, Ted clicks it OFF. Not much reaction at all.

                         TED
          What else do you have?
          The simple, polite question throws Mick.

                         MICK
          Look Ted, let's cut the bullshit.
          Not only is your so-called victim a
          working prostitute, but we've got
          her on tape soliciting my client!
          Maybe you're new, but you gotta
          know how hard it's gonna be to
          convince a jury a guy would have to
          rape a hooker to have sex with her--

                         

                         

                         

                         

          47.

                         TED
          Nothing you're telling me's going
          to change my offer.

                         MICK
          Offer? You're making an offer?
          going forward?
          Not the way Mick thought it would go. Ted goes on...

                         TED
          We'll drop the charges to Assault
          with a Deadly and Attempted Sexual
          Battery. The guidelines put him at
          seven years, maybe he'll do four.
          Mick, uncertain now, doubts himself for the first time...

                         MICK
          .What am I missing here?...
          Ted stays innocent-looking. Blank.

          EXT. GRIFFITH PARK - KID'S AREA, PONY RIDES - SATURDAY

          MICK with his daughter, HAYLEY, 8. Mick's ON A BENCH near
          where Hayley waits on line for the next pony...
          EARL approaches from the refreshment stand with an ice-cream
          for Hayley and one for himself. Kids playing everywhere, a
          MINIATURE TRAIN chugs past... but Mick's lost in thought, his
          beat-up briefcase open, he's working.

                         EARL
          Got you the good stuff, Hayley...

                         HAYLEY
          Thank you, Earl.
          Just then a little girl gets off a pony. The attendant holds
          it for Hayley.

                         EARL
          Man's got your ride ready...

                         MICK
          Go on, I'll hold your ice cream.
          Excited, Hayley goes. The attendant lifts her up and on, and
          The pony carrying Hayley joins the others in the wide ring...
          Mick watches her for a moment, waves-- then, balancing the
          ice cream, returns to his files--

                         

                         

                         

                         

          48.

                         MICK (CONT'D)
          There's something right in front of
          me and I'm not seeing it.
          On his lap he's spread out: PAGES from the TWO FILES: the
          blue-covered one Raul gave him. The white-covered from Ted.
          Mick starts turning pages, compares... The same, the same...
          When he turns the next one over:
          It's the page Raul gave him showing the PICTURE OF A KNIFE,
          the picture we saw in Cecil Dobbs' office.
          Turns to the matching page from Ted's file. Reaction Mick...

          HARD CUT TO, EXT. LINCOLN (MOVING) - COUNTRY CLUB - LATER

          In the parking lot, pulls up. Louis is in front of the club,
          golf-clothes, waiting. Comes out to meet the Lincoln...

          INT. LINCOLN, BACK SEAT - SAME TIME


                         HAYLEY
          You said we',re going to the movies!
          You promised me last week!

                         MICK
          Daddy's got to talk to somebody.
          You stay with Earl.
          Mick gets out, Hayley stays...

          EXT. LINCOLN - CONTINUOUS

          Louis hurries over, as far from the clubhouse as possible, in
          order not to be seen or heard-- eager--

                         LOUIS
          What's happened? Is it over? You
          said it would be over by now--

                         MICK
          That was before I found out you
          were still lying to me.
          He shoves a sheet at Louis. Louis looks: PICTURE OF A KNIFE,
          but DIFFERENT from the knife-picture we saw before.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          49.

                         MICK (CONT'D)
          You know what that is? It's a
          picture of your knife. The one you
          had on you when you went to Reggie
          Campos. The one the cops have.
          Look at the blood on the blade.
          Look at the initials.
          Louis is stuck for an answer--

                         MICK (CONT'D)
          That's why Ted Minton didn't care
          when I told him Reggie's a
          prostitute. What's it matter, when
          he's got a knife with her blood and
          your initials on it?

                         LOUIS
          This wasn't the knife in the file--

                         MICK
          (scowls, sore)
          That's right. The file Raul got us
          was a loaded deck. The cops must
          have been on to him, because they
          used it to set us up. So we'd think
          they had nothing, when in fact they
          had enough to put your Hugo Boss,
          golf-playing ass away for twenty
          years!
          Mick looks back towards the car, parked maybe 20 yards off.
          He sees HAYLEY in the backseat looking out. So does Louis.
          Mick sees him looking her way...
          Feeling the man's look, Hayley sits back. Out of sight. A
          moment... then Mick resumes. Cold and firm.

                         MICK (CONT'D)
          Explain to me why you lied about
          the knife.

                         LOUIS
          I didn't lie. I said the one in the
          picture wasn't mine.
          Mick frowns/grins at the answer...

                         LOUIS (CONT'D)
          I said it twice! Nobody listened!

                         

                         

                         

                         

          50.

                         MICK

                         (MOCKING)
          What are you now, a lawyer? A
          clever, third-rate fucking lawyer
          with smart-ass technicalities? "You
          said it wasn't yours"-- What you
          should have said was, "I had a
          knife but this isn't it!" What did
          you think, it would just go away?
          (closing in on him)
          You brought a murder weapon to a
          meeting with a prostitute, Louis!
          How am I supposed to make that look
          like she set you up?

                         LOUIS
          1. Did. Not. Do this.
          Off which, Mick stares hard at Louis. At his frightened look.
          Then tries-- slowly-- as if for the last time--

                         MICK
          Then kindly tell me why you went to
          her apartment with a custom-made
          knife, serrated tip, with "LR"
          engraved on the blade?

                         LOUIS
          I always carry it.
          For a moment, Mick takes this in. Echoes.

                         MICK
          You always carry it.

                         LOUIS
          Yes. In real estate we show homes,
          to people we don't know. This one
          time...
          He stops. Like it's difficult. Then goes ahead...

                         LOUIS (CONT'D)
          My mother. She was showing a place.
          It was in Bel-Air, so she thought
          it was okay to go alone, even
          though there was a man at the time
          who had raped some women that way.
          He was there.

                         MICK
          Who was there?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          51.

                         LOUIS
          The man. He raped her. When she
          didn't come back, I went to the
          house and found her.
          Mick. Stirs. Like he's seeing a possibility...

                         LOUIS (CONT'D)
          That's when she stopped showing
          property. I do the selling now. And
          I started carrying a knife. Always.
          Mick turns it over. Finally...

                         MICK
          That's quite a story, Louis.

                         (BEAT)
          Your mother will have to testify.

                         LOUIS
          We don't want that.

                         MICK

                         (COLD)
          I don't give a damn what you think
          we want. From now on you do what I
          tell you while I try this case. Do
          I make myself clear?
          Louis is silent. Mick looks off. Towards Hayley, in the car.

          INT. DOOR OPENING TO: MAGGIE'S HOUSE, STUDIO CITY - NIGHT

          ON THE CUT she OPENS TO MICK CARRYING HAYLEY IN HIS ARMSi
          fast asleep but still clutching a carton of movie popcorn...

          INT. KITCHEN

          Maggie leads Mick-with-Hayley through, Hayley snuggles
          further in her father's arms. As they continue...

                         MICK
          If she wasn't so darn heavy I'd
          carry her all night, I swear.

                         MAGGIE
          Defense lawyers will swear to
          anything...

                         

                         

                         

                         

          52.

          INT. LIVING ROOM, LATER - MICK AND MAGGIE

          He's at the door about to go. Maggie delays him with,

                         MAGGIE
          You look like you're in a daze.

                         MICK
          It turned into a rough week. Being
          with Hayley was the only high.
          She can't find anything to say. As he heads out again...

                         MAGGIE
          Nobody's seen you at Four Green
          Fields lately.

                         MICK
          I stopped going. Too much of a
          scene.

                         MAGGIE
          Yeah well. If you start going
          again.
          Now she has his attention.

                         MICK
          If I start again, what?
          She's awkward. Smiles, shrugs to cover--

                         MAGGIE
          Bunch of us from the office are
          there. Tuesdays, after work.
          An invitation. S-zrprising him.

                         MICK
          I'll keep it in mind.

                         MAGGIE
          Okay.

                         MICK
          Okay.
          After more awkwardness, goes. She closes the door. CUT TO,

                         

                         

                         

                         

          53.

          INT.'FOUR GREEN FIELDS' (LAWYERS' BAR) - MONDAY - EVENING

          Noisy, drinking CROWD of legal types-- We're MOVING through
          it-- Don't realize it at first but it's--
          MICK'S POV-- he's trying to shoulder his way through towards--
          A BOOTH OF WOMEN from Maggie's office--
          Maggie sees him, lights up a little--

                         MAGGIE
          Haller! Let him in, girls! Buy you
          a beer?

                         MICK
          You won't make it to the bar...

                         MAGGIE
          Then let's share this.
          They fight to a table for two, edge of the crowd. When he
          balks at sipping from her glass--

                         MAGGIE (CONT'D)
          We've had a taste of each other
          before.
          He laughs a little, reads that she's had a few. He drinks.

                         MAGGIE (CONT'D)
          Feeling a little better tonight? Or
          did Ted Minton sandbag you?

                         MICK
          (How'd she know?)
          Yeah, that's exactly what--

                         MAGGIE
          With that guy Corliss, right? I
          told them using that dirtbag was a
          bullshit play. But you'll take the
          the guy's head off on the stand...
          Mick's off-guard, doesn't know what she's talking about.

                         MAGGIE (CONT'D)
          (catches herself, giggles)
          Whoops, I shouldn't say that...

                         MICK
          (to keep it alive)
          So Ted talked to you about Corliss?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          54.

                         MAGGIE
          Huh? It was me who sent him to Ted.
          Corliss thought it was my case
          because I handled first appearance.
          (sees Mick is too eager)
          I'm telling you too much.

                         MICK
          Nah, nothing I don't know, they
          always use a professional snitch...
          (when she doesn't bite)
          I mean Corliss has done this
          before, right?

                         MAGGIE
          (clams up, with:)
          Can't we just forget work and have
          a friendly Guiness?

                         MICK
          How about we go somewhere to eat?
          (before she objects)
          So we can talk about our daughter.

                         MAGGIE

                         (WEAKENS)
          Let me tell my friends I'm leaving.
          She goes. And Mick, quick, writes the name CORLISS on napkin.

          INT. ITALIAN RESTAURANT - NIGHT - AT A TABLE:


                         MAGGIE
          I'll bet you didn't know Sponge-Bob
          movies could be so much fun.

                         MICK
          The fun's watching her.
          Maggie likes this. Touch glasses. After a quiet moment...

                         MAGGIE
          You didn't know Minton had Corliss
          til I blabbed, did you.

                         MICK
          He was hiding something, I thought
          it might be a jailhouse snitch...

                         

                         

                         

                         

          55.

                         MAGGIE
          You got me drunk to find out what
          you wanted to know. Except I was
          already drunk. Good point, right?
          He feels something. ANGLE, her hand on his knee...

                         MAGGIE (CONT'D)
          Hayley's probably asleep. I gotta
          go relieve the sitter--
          (makes a face)
          Only I don't think I can drive
          myself home.

                         MICK
          one good turn. I'll drive you.

                         MAGGIE
          And will you take me back to get my
          car in the morning?
          A loaded proposition. Covers her hand with his own. CUT TO,

          INT. MAGGIE'S BEDROOM - THE BED - MORNING

          ANGLE HAYLEY, sleeping between her two parents. Mick opens
          his eyes: Maggie's awake and staring at him. Grim.

                         MAGGIE
          This is not fair to her.

                         (MICK STIRS--)
          Waking up and finding you here.
          She'll get her hopes up.

                         MICK
          How'd she get in here?

                         MAGGIE
          She comes in here when she has
          nightmares. She has nightmares.

                         MICK
          So she sleeps in here a lot?

                         MAGGIE
          Don't start. You have no idea what
          it's like raising a child alone.
          He can tell by her tone: All last night's tenderness gone.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          56.

          INT. GUEST BEDROOM DOWN THE HALL - MOMENTS LATER

          He's dressing-- she enters to him in a robe--

                         MICK
          Look-- I'll leave-- then come back
          in an hour. We'll go together to
          get your car then I can take her to

                         SCHOOL--

                         MAGGIE
          Just like that? You're gonna start
          taking her to school?

                         MICK
          Don't you remember what we talked
          about last night?

                         MAGGIE
          I thought you were just trying to
          get into my head on your case-- or
          get me into bed--

                         MICK
          (getting angry now)
          I can't win with you--

                         MAGGIE
          Not when you're being a defense
          lawyer! Do you know how crazy we
          were to think we could ever make
          it? Me trying to get dirtbags off
          the street, you keeping them there--

                         MICK

                         ALRIGHT MAGGIE--

                         MAGGIE
          Just go!

          INT. DINER (DUPAR'S) - MORNING - MICK AT THE COUNTER:

          Unshaven. Edward Hopper drabness. To lose himself in work,
          looks down at his files:
          An 8x10 OF REGGIE CAMPO'S BATTERED FACE.
          WAITRESS, 50s, pours coffee. Recoils as she glimpses the
          picture, the gruesome wounds, Mick didn't mean her to see.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          57.

                         MICK
          Sorry. It's work.

                         WAITRESS
          I just hope you catch the bastard
          who did it to her.
          And goes. Mick tucks the picture under some papers, to hide
          it-- but finds that he's only hid it halfway. Leaving half
          her face exposed. The good half. Something about this... He
          picks it up again, folds it...

          INT. MEN'S ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

          Leaning over the sink, Mick holds the folded photo against
          the mirror, the unhurt left side showing. Creates a full
          image of a face. He stares a long time. Then, to himself:

                         MICK
          Martha Renteria.

          INT. ANGLE ON A WAREHOUSE-GARAGE DOOR RISING - FROM WITHIN

          Mick, enters. THREE LINCOLNS LINED UP along a wall. Mick's
           "fleet." California plates: NT GLTY 1, NT GLTY 3, NT GLTY
          4.. Walks past... to some battered file cabinets. He turns
          on a single-bulb lamp...
          DRAWER OPENING ON FILE CABINET... Mick's fingers fly through
          the tabs of old files, stops at: MARTINEZ.
          Cut to, MARTINEZ FILES ON DESK, MOMENTS LATER: Mick examines
          them: Police reports, printouts. Until he finds...
          Autopsy report. Name: RENTERIA, MARIA. Takes out... Bx10
          PHOTO: WOMAN DEAD ON A BED, NAKED. Dark bloodstains.
          NEXT PHOTO - TIGHTER: Knife-wounds. And bruises.
          NEXT PHOTO - HER FACE: BEATEN: Injuries to the left side
          (opposite of Reggie's.) Dark-haired, large brown eyes.
          MICK. Folds this one in half. Takes the folded shot of
          Reggie, fits them together, crease to crease: So alike, they
          form what could be the face of one woman.
          Mick. Not wanting to face the memory: a VOICE in his head:

                         MICK'S VOICE
          I wish you'd called me before you
          talked to the cops, Jesus...

                         

                         

                         

                         

          58.

          GO TO, INT. VAN NUYS JAIL, ATTORNEY/PRISONER ROOM - DAY

          FLASHBACK OF MICK WITH MARTINEZ, who's stalking around, in a
          panic, while Mick is laying out the bad news...

                         MARTINEZ

                         (MEXICAN ACCENT)
          I seen my picture every place! They
          was gonna bring me in, so...

                         MICK
          But you told Kurlen you were in her
          apartment. He didn't have that, he
          doesn't even have any prints...

                         MARTINEZ
          That shit I tol' is true, man! I
          seen her at the Cobra Room, she
          said if I paid we could go to her
          place, she didn't care about the
          other guy...

                         MICK
          Nobody saw any "other guy"...

                         MARTINEZ
          There was another guy, bpi guy that
          she was talking to...

                         MICK
          Plus the coroner says her vagina
          was brutalized...

                         MARTINEZ
          Are you my lawyer or what, man?
          (insists, crazy now)
          When I left that chick was fine! I
          fucked her but I didn't hurt her--
          You ain't even listenin'--

                         MICK
          Three people saw you throwing a
          knife into the L.A. River...

                         MARTINEZ
          'Cause I had that knife in my car!
          I knew they was gonna find it...

                         MICK
          If all you did was fuck her then
          why didn't you leave any prints?
          The place was wiped down...

                         (MORE)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          59.

                         MICK (CONT'D)
          But your semen was on the towel,
          you forgot you wiped your penis on
          that towel...

                         MARTINEZ
          I didn't forget nothing! I jus'
          used that towel, then I give the
          chick the money and I left!

                         MICK
          It's not gonna make.

                         MARTINEZ
          Don't say that!

                         MICK
          Jesus they want the death penalty!
          I can see to it that never happens,
          but not if you don't plead.

                         MARTINEZ
          You want me to say I did this?
          Mick hesitates but stays level. Unbending. No choice.

                         MILK
          Jesus, there's a deal to be made. I
          can do that. I can get you Life.
          (Martinez crumples...)
          Life means you'll do fifteen...

                         MARTINEZ
          I'm innocent! Inocente! You know
          what that means?
          Mick just looks at him.

          EXT. GOLDEN GATE BRIDGE, SAN FRANCISCO BAY - DAY

          Not much traffic rolling out of the city, mid-morning...

          INT. CAR NORTH OF THE BAY - DAY

          Mick at the wheel. Beside him, his briefcase. SEES OUT ON THE
          WATER: the prison-fortress of SAN QUENTIN.

          INT. VISITOR'S ROOM: GLASS-DIVIDED - SAN QUENTIN - LATER

          ON THE CUT, JESUS MARTINEZ sits. 29, only a few years older
          than when we saw him but looks bad. Glass wall divide them.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          60.

                         MICK
          I'm not going to ask you how you
          are because I know.
          Martinez glares at him, then spits on the floor.

                         MICK (CONT'D)
          Look. I need to ask some questions.

                         MARTINEZ
          you didn't have no questions then.
          Never ask, Did you kill that girl?

                         MICK
          I am trying to make it right.
          Martinez is silent. Cold.

                         MICK (CONT'D)
          Tell me again about the Cobra Room.

                         MARTINEZ
          Tell you what?

          CUT TO, INT. COBRA ROOM - NIGHT

          The black-light Latina club, music, smoke-- In the middle is
          a pit iwith a BIG COBRA BASKET, out of which a girl in a
          snake costume emerges-- MARTHA. Watching is MARTINEZ--
          MARTINEZ (V.0.) (cont'd)
          She was workin'. Dancin'.
          LATER, AFTER THE ACT-- Camera finds Renteria half-curling
          herself around MARTINEZ--
          MARTINEZ (V.0.) (cont' d)
          Then she came and talked to me...
          She's whispering, Martinez is loving it--
          MARTINEZ (V.0.) (cont'd)
          She tol' me I could take her home.
          I did, but I didn't kill her.

          MICK (V.O.)
          You said there was another guy...
          Disentangling from Martinez, Martha slides toward a MAN,
          TALL, his back to us...

                         

                         

                         

                         

          61.

          MARTINEZ (V.0.)
          Si, she talk to him too, but she
          come back to me.
          Though she's with the other man, she glances back at Jesus...

          RESUME, INT. VISITING, SAN QUENTIN

          Mick opens his briefcase, takes out a stack of photos. One by
          one holds them against the glass with his fingers... WHEN:

          SPEAKER (GUARD'S VOICE)

          GET BACK FROM THE GLASS. OR THE

          INTERVIEW WILL BE TERMINATED.
          Frustrated, Mick complies-- but calls--

                         MICK
          Guard!
          Long beat. Guard enters. Clean-Marine. Mick shows the stack.

                         MICK (CONT'D)
          I need him to look at these.

                         GUARD
          You can't give him anything.

                         MICK
          But if you won't let him close to
          the glass, how can he see them?

                         GUARD
          That's not my problem.

                         MICK
          All right, but can you stay a
          minute? If he IDs one of these mug-
          shots I need you to witness it.

                         GUARD
          Don't drag me into your bullshit.
          And goes.

                         MICK
          Godammit.
          (then, to Martinez)
          Try. See if one is the guy.
          Mick holds up one after another. Martinez shakes his head no--
          Then the booking photo of Louis Roulet.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          62.
          Mick holds it up. Off Jesus, as his eyes narrow...

          EXT. AIRLINER LANDING, BURBANK AIRPORT - DAY

          PRE-LAP the YELPING/SNARLING of a small /fierce dog... We're:

          INT. RAUL LEVIN'S BUNGALOW, GLENDALE - EVENING

          Raul in shorts, lets Mick in over the barks of his Shih-Tzu.

                         RAUL
          Cool it, Ahab... C'mon in, Mick...
          Leaves Mick alone while he puts out the dog--
          Mick cools his heels. Takes in: Cubs pennant, Raul's old
          peaked policeman's cap, mounted... finally pours himself a
          vodka. Notes the photo of a YOUNGER GUY, its frame hung with
          the "Fight Aids" ribbon. Raul re-enters.

                         MICK
          (re the drink)
          I helped myself.

                         RAUL
          It's okay. I owe you, the way I let
          you down on that discovery file--

                         MICK
          It wasn't you. The cops set you up.
          Who was it slipped you the file,
          anyway?

                         RAUL
          Some guy in vice I play cards with.
          Lonnie Fry. You don't know him.

                         MICK
          You're right, I don't. But I know
          who his partner was, when he was in
          homicide. Kurlen.

                         RAUL
          That prick. I'll make him sorry.

                         MICK
          Don't bother. We've got bigger
          problems.
          The way Mick says it. Raul sits, asks--

                         

                         

                         

                         

          63.

                         RAUL
          Like what? Where were you today
          anyway? You were hard to reach...

                         MICK
          Cell phones don't work too well
          where I was.
          Raul waits. Knows this is why Mick came here.

                         MICK (CONT'D)
          I came to tell you a story. About
          Jesus Martinez.

                         RAUL
          You were at San Quentin.

                         MICK
          It's about what happened after he
          left Martha Renteria's apartment.

                         RAUL
          After he killed her?

                         MICK
          He never killed her. He went there,
          had sex, flushed the condom--

                         RAUL
          Wiped his prick on the pink towel--

                         MICK
          And then went home. The story
          starts after he left.

                         RAUL

                         (GETS IT)
          The real killer.

                         MICK
          The real killer. She lets him in.

          CUT TO, INT. MARTHA RENTERIA' S APARTMENT - NIGHT


                         MICK
          Maybe he fakes like it's still
          Martinez and he forgot something.
          Or maybe it was an appointment...
          We see the door open but we don't see who enters...

                         

                         

                         

                         

          64.

          RAUL (V.O.)
          The other guy from the club? The
          one Jesus said he bid against?

          NICK (V.0.)
          Right. He comes in, punches her a
          few times to soften her up...
          Renteria staggers as she's suddenly pummeled, then spun...
          NICK (V.0.) (cont'd)
          Then takes out a knife and holds it
          to her neck while he walks her to
          the bedroom...
          We SEE the knife-tip against her throat...
          MICK (V.0.) (cont'd)
          Only she isn't lucky like Reggie
          Campo will be. He climbs on top,
          puts on a condom, rapes her...
          CUT TO, BEDROOM, as Mick gives us the action...
          MICK (V.0.) (cont'd)
          And when he's done he stabs her
          over and over, fifty-two times,
          while he works out something in his
          sick fucking mind.
          We SEE, the stabbing, bleeding, then--

          RESUME, INT. RAUL'S BUNGALOW


                         MICK
          Do you need to ask what kind of
          knife it was, based on the wounds?

                         RAUL
          A short-blade folding knife...

                         MICK
          Or whose face Martinez picked out
          of the mug-shots I brought him?
          No. No need. A beat. Raul's dog barks from outside.

                         MICK (CONT'D)
          Of course the story goes on from
          there. From there it's about the
          lawyer Martinez gets himself...

                         

                         

                         

                         

          65.

                         RAUL
          Don't do this to yourself...

                         MICK
          (ignores, on a roll now)
          The lawyer who just assumes he did
          it because of the DNA. The lawyer
          who gets him the best deal he can,
          and feels pretty good, because the
          deal keeps his client off Death
          Row... and this guy, this lawyer,
          he's all about the deal, see?

                         RAUL
          Mick-- You can't beat yourself up
          for what you didn't know--

                         MICK
          I just saw him and he's twenty-six
          going on forty. He's a little guy.
          You know what happens to the little
          ones up there.
          A beat. Mick drinks.

                         MICK (CONT'D)

                         (SUDDENLY)
          He has a type. Roulet. It's more
          than a type, Renteria and Campo,
          you put their faces together you
          get the same face...

                         RAUL
          (off the drink Mick takes)
          You better take it easy...

                         MICK
          Listen, I was thinking about this
          the whole way down on the plane--
          That night with Renteria? It was
          like he hit the jackpot-- got to do
          his thing and get away with it.
          Then he's in a bar, sees Reggie--

                         RAUL
          Who he's seen before, remember--

                         MICK
          Yeah but tonight he sees who she
          looks like.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          66.

                         RAUL
          Renteria?

                         MICK
          Right. And he's right back there.

                         RAUL

                         (DOUBTFUL--)
          Mick, we're talking about a really

                         STRANGE--

                         MICK
          We're talking about a killer at
          work. You know that video from the
          bar? Just like you, he saw that Mr.
          X was left-handed.

                         RAUL
          (struck by this)
          Smart as the devil--

                         MICK
          He knows what he's doing. Reggie's
          the luckiest woman alive.

                         RAUL
          You think there are others? With
          that face, or--

                         MICK
          You find out. Dig into Roulet.
          (recalls...)
          "All you'll find is parking
          tickets," I don't buy that anymore.
          Check out knife-murders of women.
          Not just the unsolved ones, Martha
          Renteria was a closed case.

                         RAUL
          Look man, I can't throw a net like
          that. I'm just one guy! You gotta
          bring the cops in.

                         MICK
          I can't. He's my client.
          (clear on this:)
          That's why he hired me.
          Raul looks up, startled by this. Mick lays it out...

                         

                         

                         

                         

          67.

                         MICK (CONT'D)
          I was thinking about that on the
          plane too: He was worried I might
          hear about the case and put it
          together. But if he was my client,
          I'd be bound to keep my mouth shut
          and protect him.

                         RAUL

                         (SEES)
          Attorney-client privilege.

                         MICK
          I told you: He knows what he's
          doing.

                         RAUL
          You got one guy in prison for what
          your other client did. What are you
          going to do, Mick?
          A beat.

                         MICK
          I'm working on it.

          CUT TO, EXT. MICK HALLER'S HOUSE - NIGHT - LATER

          Lincoln in front. Mick, working on Raul's question. Trudges
          up the steps. PHONE RINGS before he gets in, he fumbles keys--

          INT. HOUSE - KITCHEN... AS HE ANSWERS...


                         MICK
          This is Haller...

                         MAGGIE'S VOICE
          Did you get my messages?

                         MICK
          Maggie, no, I was up in San
          Francisco for the day...

                         MAGGIE'S VOICE
          No you weren't. You don't go to San
          Francisco, you go to San Quentin.
          Must have been seeing a client...

                         MICK
          You always were too smart for me.
          Is Hayley okay?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          68.

                         MAGGIE'S VOICE
          She's good. Look, she's playing
          soccer tomorrow, and she wants you
          to come to the match. You've
          started something, Mickey...

                         MICK
          Fine, I look forward to it.

                         MAGGIE'S VOICE
          You'll need to pick her up at noon.
          But, under this, he sees, DOWN THE HALLWAY, light from a
          room. Sudden chill. Angling to see, keeping a normal voice...

                         MICK
          Noon, I'll do that. See you then.
          And hangs up before she can say goodbye.. And Stops. Freezes.
          Eyes on the LIGHT at the end of the hall. Carefully, Mick
          begins to move down the hall...
          Pauses at the door he comes to first, bedroom, dark...
          Kicks it-- Nothing. starts walking again, when: there's a
          SOUND. Then silence. What was it?... Mick continues-- to--
          The LIT ROOM: SIDE ANGLE, we see it's the den-- Mick braces--
          And BURSTS IN SUDDENLY:

          INT. DEN - LOUIS IS THERE...

          Sitting in Mick's chair, leg up on the desk...

                         MICK
          What the hell are you doing here?

                         LOUIS
          Funny thing is I've been here
          before. I was offered the house to
          show, never gave back the key--

                         MICK
          (over,doesn't give a shit)
          Get out of my house! Now!

                         LOUIS
          (rising, but)

                         EASY MICK--
          But, sees Mick noticing-- the ELECTRONIC ANKLET on his leg--

                         

                         

                         

                         

          69.

                         LOUIS (CONT'D)
          Your friend Valenzuela put this on.
          A tracer. As if I were going
          anywhere.

                         MICK
          I said Get up! Get up and get out
          of this house!
          Off Mick's force, Mick's almost crazy-- Louis smirks, goes--

          EXT. FRONT DOOR, PORCH - MOMENT LATER, AS THEY COME OUT...


                         LOUIS
          (turns to him, to

                         "EXPLAIN")
          I couldn't reach you! I'm on trial
          for my life, Mick, and I get
          nervous when I can't reach yout
          And you were away all day. Like you
          told "Maggie."
          Meaning he listened to the call. Mick goes white.

                         MICK
          You don't come near this house
          again, do you understand me? We
          aren't friends, we aren't partners,
          you're my client, eriod--

                         LOUIS
          Just what I wanted to remind you
          of. I'm your client.
          Mick reacts. Louis lets in sink in, then:

                         LOUIS (CONT'D)
          Besides, I like it in your house,
          Mick... Pretty pictures of your
          kid, Hayley...

                         MICK
          Fucken don't.

                         LOUIS
          Don't what, don't say she's pretty?
          But I saw her, the other day at the
          club...
          At which, Mick's had enough: belts Louis in the mouth. Quick,
          solid.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          70.
          His lip bloodied, Louis flashes with anger-- but then, just
          as suddenly, he steels himself. Glares coldly at Mick.

                         LOUIS (CONT'D)
          Okay. Okay I'm going. But--
          And extends his hand: with Mick's house-key in it.

                         LOUIS (CONT'D)
          --first I think I should give you
          back your key. It isn't right that
          I have it. Now that we can trust
          each other.
          Mick takes the key. Panting, he watches Louis go down the
          fucking steps.

          SUDDEN CUT TO,, EXT. ON HAYLEY: SOCCER MATCH IN PROGRESS

          Hayley, defending, scrambles to get in the way of another
          girl, a forward, dribbling towards her...
          ANGLE MICK, on the sideline... among other parents...

                         MICK
          That's it, Hayley, get in her way!
          Hayley isn't quick enough, the forward dribbles round her,
          goes in for the score. Hayley looks despondently at Mick--

                         MICK (CONT'D)
          It's okay, honey!
          When-- his CELL-PHONE RINGS. Into it--

                         MICK (CONT'D)
          This is Haller...
          He strains to listen... Stops cold. His look darkens... Even
          from the field, Hayley sees this...

          CUT TO, INT. RAUL'S BUNGALOW - DAY

          MOVING ON THE CUT, WITH MICK, as he ENTERS... It's a CRIME
          SCENE, swarms with cops, forensics, technicians...
          Mick distressed, moves as if through heavy water. DETECTIVES
          are leading him: LANKFORD, 38, clean-marine-- and HEIDI
          SOBEL, 30. They wear paper booties, thin rubber gloves...

                         

                         

                         

                         

          71.

                         LANKFORD
          Levin was back in his office...

                         SOBEL
          We wouldn't have found him if a
          neighbor hadn't brought the dog
          back. It was running loose.

                         LANKFORD
          (shows a desk calendar)
          Your name's all over this. Were you
          the only guy he worked for?

                         MICK
          No, but I've got a big trial next
          month, attempted rape and murder.
          He was helping me.

                         SOBEL
          Is that the Roulet case?

                         MICK
          How did you know?

                         SOBEL
          Because every file that's been
          rifled has the name.

                         LANKFORD
          Only thing, Roulet himself is
          already cleared for this. We've
          checked the tracking on his tracer-
          anklet and it doesn't show him
          anywhere near this place. And
          there's no way to trick those
          things, no way in the world.
          We see Mick register this-- wants to ask about it, but before

                         HE CAN--

                         LANKFORD (CONT'D)
          By the way, Counsellor, where were
          you this morning?
          Mick rocked by the question. What it means.

                         MICK
          I'm a suspect?

                         SOBEL
          He knew whoever shot him. There are
          no signs of forcible, he even let
          the killer into the back room.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          72.

                         MICK
          I was watching my daughter play
          soccer. A couple of dozen people
          can confirm I was there.
          Provisionally buying this, Lankford takes out booties.

                         LANKFORD
          Put these on and don't touch
          anything back there.

          INT. RAUL'S BUNGALOW - HOME OFFICE

          Raul face down on the floor, in front of his desk chair.

                         SOBEL
          Can you tell us if you see anything
          unusual?
          Mick draws close. Lankford, abruptly--

                         LANKFORD
          All I see are pictures of a guy.
          Was he a fruit?

                         MICK

                         (BITTER)
          He was a hell of an ex-cop, is what
          he was. Crimes Against Persons,
          back in Chicago. And yeah he was
          gay, and what the hell's that got
          to do with it? If the murder was
          some kind of gay thing, why'd they
          ransack the office? Isn't it
          obvious they were looking for
          something to do with his work?
          Lankford can't argue with this. When Sobel, near the body:

                         SOBEL
          Look. The position of his hands.
          ANGLE: Two middle fingers point down. Two outside fingers up.

                         LANKFORD
          Was this guy a Longhorns fan or
          what? Or is it some kind of sign,
          like he was trying to tell us who

                         SHOT HIM--

                         (MAKES "HORNS")
          --"The devil did it?"

                         

                         

                         

                         

          73.

           EXT. MOVING ANGLE ON: SUBURBAN HOUSES (VALENCIA) - EVENING

           Seen from the POV OF--

          INT. LINCOLN (MOVING) - MICK AT THE WHEEL - SAME TIME

          He drives the street, his focus pumped up... until he comes
          to: A HOUSE, its garage door wide open. Mick pulls into the
          drive behind it...

          INT. GARAGE - MOMENTS LATER - MICK ENTERS

          What he FINDS inside, beside a family van, is a LARGE THIN
          CARDBOARD BOX... It's upright, marked "Fragile."

          EXT. HOUSE - FRONT DOOR - MOMENTS LATER

          Mick stands there KNOCKING at the door. It's opened by:

                         VAL
          Hey Mick!
          Val's surprised... a mix of emotions...

                         VAL (CONT'D)
          What're you doin' here?... and I
          heard about Raul Levin, man...

                         MICK
          (ignores all that)
          You know your garage door's open?

                         VAL
          Shit: I just had a plasma
          delivered...
          And rushes to... the GARAGE. Mick trails... Val's relieved to
          find the box is okay.

                         VAL (CONT'D)
          Oh man, if we still lived in Van
          Nuys this sucker'd be gone. Set me
          back eight grand, too. But it's
          gonna be great for the games...
          (notes Mick's silent mood)
          What's up anyway? What brings you
          out here?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          74.

                         MICK
          Raul's murder.
          (Val waits, listens.)
          I've been with the cops. They can't
          tie Roulet to it, because your
          ankle bracelet doesn't put him near
          the house.

                         VAL
          I know, I gave them the trace. The
          bracelet's got a mass detector,
          there's no way to beat that.

                         MICK
          Did the cops ask you where you were
          this morning, Val?
          Val's slow at first, to register just what Mick's asking...

                         MICK (CONT'D)
          Somehow, some way, Louis killed
          Raul Levin. And it didn't show up
          on the trace.
          Mick looks at the plasma TV, then back at Val. Val reddens--

                         VAL
          You better not be sayin' what I
          think-- that I cut him loose-- to
          let him kill Raul--?

                         MICK
          Maybe you didn't know what he was
          going to do--

                         VAL
          (over, angry--)
          You think I'd let that happen? For
          a fuckin' TV?
          And he lunges at Mick, shoves him back agains the van, Mick
          shoves back, harder, backwards into the TV box-- it hits the
          cement floor, hard, and Val falls on top of it--
          Sickening snap/crunch from within the box--

                         VAL (CONT'D)
          Shit, man--

                         MICK
          Where'd you get the money for an
          eight thousand dollar TV, Val?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          75.

                         VAL
          That's bullshit! I didn't do that!
          How dare you say that to me-- I'm
          inocente, man--
          Mick reacts to the word-- Martinez's word-- as Val glares at
          him from the ground.

                         VAL (CONT'D)
          Get outa here; Get out of here,
          Mick, and get outa my life!
          Mick's already backing off-- towards the car--

                         VAL (CONT'D)
          Keep going, man!
          Mick keeps going-- down the drive and into his car-- CUT TO,

          INT. FOUR GREEN FIELDS - NIGHT - MICK AT THE BAR...

          Drinking, CAMERA moves on him, he taps the glass for another.
          Bartender comes over like he's going to pour one. Mick's keys
          are on the bar--
          Instead of pouring the bartender swipes the keys. Mick looks
          at him, uncomprehending.

                         BARTENDER
          That's it. You're done here, pal.
          And you're not driving either.
          (shows keys, keeps them)
          Call yourself a cab or something.
          Off Mick,

          INT. MICK HALLER'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT

          MAGGIE, lugs him into his room, he's a mess...

                         MAGGIE
          Being married to you sucked but it
          beat being a car service...

                         MICK
          That's the idea, y'know. Car
          service, with the Lincolns-- Drive
          the illustrious turds of our city
          back and forth to LAX--

                         

                         

                         

                         

          76.

                         MAGGIE
          I'll be your first customer. First
          dollar.
          And rolls him onto the bed. He looks at her. Drunk as he is:

                         MICK
          Lemme ask you something. Corliss.
          The name Corliss. You didn't just
          give me that just because you'd
          been drinking. You wanted me to
          have it.
          She doesn't confirm or deny. Just gets him into bed-- says

                         POINTEDLY--

                         MAGGGIE
          I'm not staying.
          He knows, but-- one thing more--

                         MICK
          Maggie-- Raul. Did I get him
          killed?
          Moved, she shakes her head no. Straightens his pillow.

                         MAGGIE
          How do you do it, Haller? You're a
          sleazy defense lawyer with two ex-
          wives and a daughter, and we all
          still love you.
          We STAY ON HIM as she stands up, goes. To no one:

                         MICK
          I can't do this anymore.

          INT. MICK HALLER'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - MORNING

          He's in bad shape as he comes out of the bedroom. Stares at
          the light pouring in from the glass doors onto the porch.
          Finds: THERE'S A DOLLAR TAPED TO THE GLASS. (From Maggie.)
          Also: the MESSAGE LIGHT ON HIS PHONE is ON.
          MOMENTS LATER: He's pressed the button, listens to...

                         MACHINE VOICE
          Message received: YESTERDAY, ELEVEN-

          SEVEN A.M.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          77.

                         RAUL'S VOICE
          Mick, it's me. Guess I missed you.
          Wanted to go over a few things, so
          I wouldn't interrupt your day with
          Hayley. Anyway...
          Presses STOP. Raul's voice: Mick's not sure he can deal. But
          pulls the pencil & pad near him, and presses START again...
          RAUL'S VOICE (cont'd)
          First, that witness name you gave
          me. Corliss? Turns out he's this
          hype, Dwayne Jeffrey Corliss,
          sometimes goes by "DJ." When you
          run it that way you find out he's
          played the courtroom snitch a lot,
          mostly in Arizona. But here's the
          thing: One time down there? It blew
          up on him. I'm working on it, it
          can be good for us... Don't know
          how we get to him, though. They
          put him in USC lock-up, just to
          make it harder...
          Under which Mick, excited, is writing down D J CORLISS...
          ARIZONA... then USC, circles this last...
           RAUL'S VOICE (cont'd)
          Other thing is, you asked me to dig
          deep-on Roulet? Mick, I found
          something. I found Martinez' ticket
          out of the Q.
          When, on the tape he hears DOG BARKING... and a DOOR BELL...
          RAUL'S VOICE (cont'd)
          Uh, that's somebody at the door...
          Look, have a good time with your
          kid. Gotta go, boss.
          And MESSAGE goes OFF. Mick thinks a moment. Tries to clear
          his head. Then pulls out a card and dials a number...

          Detective Sobel.

                         MICK

                         (INTO PHONE)
          It's me. Haller.

                         (MORE)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          78.

                         MICK (CONT'D)
          Look, I-- just checked my phone
          messages. It turns out Raul called
          me. Just before he was killed. I
          didn't know.

                         (SHE REACTS)
          The message came at Eleven-oh-
          seven. He said, "I think I found
          Martinez' ticket out of the Q."

                         SOBEL

                         (WRITING)
          Meaning Jesus Martinez-- that's a
          former client of yours--

                         MICK
          In San Quentin. Right.

                         SOBEL
          Did he say anything else?
          Looks down at his notes. At "Corliss." "USC." A beat. As he
          tears off the note, stuffs it in his pocket...

                         MICK
          No-- No, that's it. Then the dog
          barked, somebody was at the door.
          He hung up.
          (before she can ask more)
          Look, maybe you can tell me if
          there's any progress on the case.
          (when she hesitates)
          He was my friend.
          Sobel, makes a decision...

                         SOBEL
          Well, we did catch a break. We
          found a bullet casing in the room,
          from a 22. It turns out Levin owned
          a .22, but when we checked it out
          it wasn't a Woodsman, like the gun
          that killed him...
          To which, Mick reacts... as she goes on...

                         SOBEL (CONT'D)
          The other thing is we can't find
          his cell-phone...
          (noticing Mick is silent)
          Are you still there?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          79.

                         MICK
          Yeah... just, I'll let you know if
          I think of anything. About his cell-
          phone, I mean. Thanks.
          And hangs up. Too sudden. Leaves Sobel wondering...

          CUT TO, MICK MOVING QUICKLY THROUGH HIS HOUSE...
          Down the hall, to a closet, climbs clumsily above to a shelf--
          Tossing clothes out of the way... Finds: AN OLD WOODEN GUN
          BOX. The top has a brass plate: COLT "WOODSMAN."
          Mick, in a cold sweat, opens the box. It's EMPTY. Suddenly--

          EXT. HOUSE - MICK STEPS OUT ONTO THE PORCH...

          For air-- He can hardly breathe-- straightens his thoughts--
          Takes the note from his pocket, studies it.

          INT. USC-COUNTY LOCK-UP - MOVING WITH MICK...

          GUARD leads him DOWN A HALL... leads him to a room and leaves
          him there.
          With GLORIA. In prison jumper. Faint smile.

                         MICK
          Gloria I'm not here about you. I'm
          here about me. I need your help.

          FADE OUT.

          FADE IN: THE FACE OF LOUIS ROULET - INT. COURTROOM - MORNING

          Louis, lanky, graceful, takes a seat at the DEFENSE TABLE.
          Mick, sorts papers. Louis, turns, seems to watch him...
          ANGLES, THE GALLERY: DOBBS and MARY WINDSOR, she's on edge
          but hides-- Also LORNA, to support Mick. While, AT THE TABLE:

                         LOUIS
          Mick. I want to tell you something
          before we start.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          80.

                         MICK
          Better make it fast.

                         LOUIS
          You're my lawyer, right? So I can
          tell you anything, even a crime
          I've committed, and you have to
          keep it secret.

                         MICK
          (a beat, uncomfortable--)
          That's right. Unless it's one
          you're going to commit.

                         LOUIS
          I've killed people, Mick.
          Reaction Mick. Just then, Courtroom clerk gives a warning--

                         COURTROOM CLERK
          Two minutes, people...

                         MICK

                         (TO LOUIS)
          Now? Now? Why now, are you telling
          me this...

                         LOUIS
          Because I know your plan.
          Mick looks at him. Before he can deny--

                         LOUIS (CONT'D)
          Your plan is to defend me on this--
          then, when I'm not your client,
          throw me to the cops.
          (when Mick says nothing)
          I can't let that happen. So I'm
          telling you: I've killed people and
          guess what? Martha Renteria was one
          of them. There now. If you use what
          I've told you you might get Jesus
          Martinez out of jail, but you'll
          never practice law again. And I'll
          never be prosecuted. I think it's
          called fruits of the poisoned tree--

                         MICK
          Come with me.
          Cuts Louis off, rises, leads him... past prosecution table,
          TED MINTON turns, watches them... as Mick leads Louis out to--

                         

                         

                         

                         

          81.

          INT. ENTRY VESTIBULE, DOUBLE DOORS - CONTINUOUS

          He suddenly spins on Louis and puts him against a wall.

                         MICK
          You son of a bitch. You killed
          Raul.

                         LOUIS
          You're right about one thing. I am
          a son of a bitch.

                         MICK
          How did you do it? The trace said
          you weren't even in Glendale...

                         LOUIS
          He was getting too close.

                         MICK
          (yanks Louis's lapels)
          You piece of shit, do you think you
          have this wired? You don't!

                         LOUIS
          I do have an insurance policy.
          He grabs Mick's wrists. Strong: pulls them off his chest.

                         MICK
          I want my gun, Louis--

                         LOUIS
          I walk away from this trial a free
          man-- and remain free-- and it
          never falls into wrong hands.
          The deal. Mick's close to hitting him-- when the door opens--

                         COURTROOM CLERK
          Judge Fullbright is on the bench.

          INT. COURTROOM - MOMENTS LATER - MICK AND LOUIS ENTER...

          What this case is about is a
          predator... On the night of March
          Sixth, Louis Roulet was out
          stalking his prey...
          Jury of twelve, two alternates...

                         TED (CONT'D)
          You are going to hear from the
          victim herself about her lifestyle,
          one that we would not condone. But
          remember that anyone, anyone, can
          be the victim of a violent crime.
          (approaches the jury box)
          The case is clear. Straightforward.
          A man attacked a woman in her home
          in order to rape and kill her.
          It is only by the grace of God that
          she's here to tell you the story.

          (glances at Ted)
          Mr. Minton doesn't want to use the
          word prostitute for the woman who's
          supposed to be Louis's victim. He
          needn't worry, this case isn't
          about how she makes her money...
          But it is about her actions. How
          she saw a young man with signs of
          wealth, and chose to target him...
          (closes in on the jury...)
          What she didn't count on, was you.
          The fact that you'd put two and two
          together, and let your common sense
          tell you who was the real predator.

          As Mick exits with Lorna for the lunch-break. Low-voiced--

                         LORNA
          You had a message from Gloria. She
          thinks she can do what you asked.

                         MICK
          Thinks?

                         LORNA
          Corliss has the same meal time. She
          can try.

                         MICK

                         (DISCOURAGED)
          Let her try. But it may not matter.

                         LORNA
          What do you mean?

                         MICK
          I mean, Corliss isn't on the
          witness list. It could be Ted
          Minton is holding him back. He
          won't use him until he has to.
          Until I screw up his case so bad he
          has no choice.

                         LORNA
          Mickey? Can you do that?
          Off Mick, tries for a confident smile...

          CUT TO, INT. COURTROOM, LATER - ON THE STAND:


          FEMALE COP (MAXWELL)
          I'd describe Ms. Campo when we got
          there as... hurt and frightened...

                         TED
          Frightened?

                         OFFICER MAXWELL
          She kept asking us if she was safe,
          even after Roulet was taken away.

          INT. COURTROOM, LATER

          Mick has Maxwell on cross... Clerk hands her pages...

                         MICK
          Officer, would you read from your
          arrest report where it's marked?

                         OFFICER MAXWELL
          "The victim does not know the man
          who assaulted her or why she was
          attacked."

                         MICK
          Why did you write that she didn't
          know him?

                         OFFICER MAXWELL
          Because that's what she said.

                         MICK
          So, she just opened the door at ten
          o'clock to a stranger?

                         OFFICER MAXWELL
          She didn't put it like that...

                         MICK
          Was there blood on his right hand?

                         OFFICER MAXWELL
          (confused by the shift)
          No, his left. Or we would have
          bagged his right one, too.

          INT. CAMERA TRAILS THE JURY...

          As a new witness is on the stand, Ted's witness...

                         TED
          Mr. Talbot, you were with Miss
          Campo on the night of March Sixth?
          CHARLES TALBOT, 48, the customer from the video. Blurred
          tattoos on muscled forearms, dyed blonde hair.

                         TALBOT
          Yep. Had a date with her at
          Morgan's. Then from there we went
          to her place and had another date,
          if you know what I mean.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          B5.
          Air of a sleaze-ball sex-player, but calm and good-humored.

                         TED
          Had you known Miss Campo before?

                         TALBOT
          Nope. Just called her up.

                         TED
          How did you know to call her?

                         TALBOT
          From her website. She's got a real
          good website.
          Jury laughs a little. Fascinated but repulsed by this guy...
          but Fullbright stirs, disliking Talbot's tone...

                         TED
          Did you have sexual relations?

                         TALBOT
          Four hundred bucks worth. And she
          earned every cent.
          Angle a male JUROR, red-faced with disapproval. Mick catches
          his reaction, likes it. Ted goes on...

                         TED
          And what time did you leave?

                         TALBOT
          About five minutes before ten.

                         TED
          She say she had another engagement?

                         TALBOT
          No, she acted like she was done for
          the night...

                         MICK
          Objection, I don't think Mr.
          Talbot's qualified to interpret Ms.
          Campo's thinking or plans...

                         TALBOT
          I just mean she acted satisfied...

                         FULLBRIGHT

                         (OFFENDED--)
          Sustained! Go on, Mr. Minton.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          86.

                         TED
          When you left, what condition was
          she in? Was she hurt?

                         TALBOT
          No, she was fit as a fiddle. I know
          because I'd just played her.
          (before Fullbright bursts)
          Sorry, your honor. She was fine.
          Minton goes, lifts a sheet over an easel, REVEALS the blown-
          up PHOTOS of the Reggie's battered face.

                         TED
          She didn't look like this?

                         TALBOT
          Man. What kind of bastard does
          something like that?

                         FULLBRIGHT
          Answer the question.

                         TALBOT
          No. We made consensual and
          pleasurable love. Which is what
          life is all about. Then I paid her.

          CUT TO, MICK HAS TALBOT ON CROSS...

                         MICK
          Mr. Talbot, are you right or left-
          handed?

                         TALBOT
          Left.

                         MICK
          Left. And isn't it true that before
          you left Regina Campo asked you to
          strike her repeatedly in the face?

                         TED

                         (OBJECTING)
          Your honor, there's no basis for
          this sort of questioning. Mr.
          Haller is just muddying the waters
          with outrageous statements.
          Fullbright looks to Mick for a reply. Mick half-shrugs...

                         

                         

                         

                         

          87.

                         MICK
          Part of the defense theory, Judge.

                         FULLBRIGHT
          The witness can answer.

                         TALBOT
          I never hit her or any other woman.

                         MICK
          Do you know a prostitute named...
          (checks his sheet)
          Shaquille Barton? "Shaquilla
          Shakels" is her work name.

                         TALBOT
          Okay, yeah. I seen her one time...

                         MICK
          And if I brought her here and she
          said you had struck her with your
          left hand...

                         TALBOT
          She'd be lying. I tried Shaquilla,
          that rough stuff's not for me. I'm
          a missionary man.

                         MICK
          With a strong left. Thank you.
          And Mick sits-- drawing a nasty look from Ted for this last,
          and a pleased one from Louis. CUT TO,

          INT. COURTHOUSE - CORRIDOR - MOMENTS LATER

          Where Mick, as he exits the courtroom for the day, is

          SURPRISED TO FIND: DETECTIVES LANKFORD AND SOBEL WAITING FOR
          HIM. Sobel holds documents. Reaction Mick: Oh shit.

          CUT TO, INT. BACK SEAT, DETECTIVES' CAR (MOVING) - LATER

          Mick looks over the pages Sobel hands him. Lankford drives.

                         MICK
          This warrant is bullshit--

                         LANKFORD
          Good enough to search your house.
          For a Woodsman registered to you.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          BB.

                         SOBEL
          We need to run ballistics on it.
          She turns around: The good cop, but she's hurt:

                         SOBEL (CONT'D)
          It would have been better if you'd
          told me that you had a Woodsman.

                         MICK
          I don't anymore. It was stolen.
          The worst yet. Lankford laughs: "How convenient..."

          INT. MICK HALLER'S HOUSE - LATER - ON:

          The BOX FOR THE WOODSMAN: Sobel in gloves, examines, while--

                         LANKFORD
          We got the history on the piece.
          Turns out it belonged to Mickey
          Cohen the gangster, in the forties.

                         MICK
          I know. My father represented him.
          He got him off for using it in self-
          defense, so Cohen made him a
          present of it.
          Sobel, careful, opens it... It's empty. Like Mick said.

                         SOBEL
          Why didn't you report it stolen?

                         MICK
          Because I knew who took it.
          (They look at him.)
          A client. He told me, so I couldn't
          turn him in without breaking a
          trust. They do that.

                         LANKFORD
          (doesn't buy this)
          Still and all, mind if I look
          around? Just in case you haven't
          had time to toss it off a pier?

                         MICK
          Go crazy. You've got the warrant.
          Lankford sneers, starts for the next room. To Sobel--

                         

                         

                         

                         

          89.

                         LANKFORD
          Heidi-- bag the box.
          He leaves. As she bags it-- He wonders why.

                         MICK
          You can't do ballistics on a box.
          She glances, seeing Lankford's gone-- explains.

                         SOBEL
          That old Mickey Cohen shooting?
          It's kind of famous. It turns out
          the county still has the evidence
          in storage. The bullet.

                         MICK
          You can match casings to a slug
          that's fifty years old?

                         SOBEL
          It'd be easier with the gun, but
          yeah.
          She goes to join her partner. Mick stops her with--

                         MICK
          Detective? How long will ballistics
          take?

                         SOBEL
          Careful. You'll make me think
          you're worried what we'll find.

                         MICK
          I'm in the middle of a trial.

                         SOBEL
          A day. Maybe forty-eight hours.
          She leaves. Mick's gaze, in the mirror: Fear.

          INT. COURTROOM - NEXT MORNING - ARRIVING...

          Mick and Ted, at the same time. As they move to the front...

                         TED
          Morning, Haller. Word is, you had
          interesting visitors last night...

                         

                         

                         

                         

          90.

                         MICK
          Worry about yourself, Ted. You're
          dying the death of a thousand
          razors up there and you don't even
          know it.
          They peel off-- Mick to the defense table, where Louis waits
          for him. Before Louis can speak: Low--

                         MICK (CONT'D)
          Listen, you little shit: This gun-
          scheme of yours is about to blow
          up, and I'm not going down for it.
          If I have to drive people to the
          airport the rest of my life.
          Mick is seething. Louis smiles. Unruffled.

          INT. COURTROOM, LATER - TED RISES...


                         TED
          One last witness, your honor. The
          prosecution calls Regina Campo.

          INT. COURTROOM, LATER - REGGIE ON THE STAND...

          Diminutive, conservative dress, dark curls around her pretty
          face-- none of the aggressive sexiness. Hesitant but frank.

                         REGGIE
          It's true that I lied. I knew him
          when he came to the door.

                         TED
          In fact, you'd arranged his coming
          Miss Campo: why did you lie?

                         REGGIE
          I was scared. I wasn't sure the
          police would believe me and I
          wanted to make sure they arrested
          him... because he's an animal...
          She looks tentatively at Louis, as if still scared-- then she
          looks away. Louis is blank. Mick takes it in. Ted follows up--

                         TED
          Do you regret that decision now?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          91.

                         REGGIE
          Yes. If it helps him to get free
          and do this to somebody else.

                         MICK
          Your honor, prejudicial--

          But ANGLE THE JURY: the damage is done. Reggie's moved them.

          Your witness, Mr. Haller.
          Mick about to rise when-- Louis grabs his hand. Low-voiced----

                         LOUIS
          I want to remind you of your words.
          You were going to tear her apart
          and throw her entrails into the
          sea.

                         MICK
          That's it, keep acting like you
          pull the strings.

                         LOUIS
          I do.

                         JUDGE FULLBRIGHT
          Mr. Haller.
          Emphatic. Mick frees his hand, straightens himself. watched
          by Louis. Then all at once, to surprise her--

                         MICK
          Ms. Campo have you engaged an
          attorney to sue Mr. Roulet for the

          But have you talked to an attorney?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          92.

                         REGGIE
          I haven't hired anybody or--

                         MICK
          I asked if you talked to one. About
          a possible lawsuit.
          Mick's crisp like he knows for sure. She wilts a little.

                         REGGIE
          It was nothing more than talk...

                         MICK
          Did you ask if you could sue Mr.
          Roulet for damages?

                         REGGIE
          I thought what you say to lawyers
          is private.

                         MICK
          If you wish, you can tell the
          jurors.
          Faces her. Ted squirms, seeing the box she's in.

                         REGGIE
          I think I want to keep it private.
          Ted squirms again. Wrong answer.

                         MICK
          Okay, let's go back to the night at
          Morgan's. Had you ever seen Louis
          Roulet before that night?

                         REGGIE
          Yes. There and other places.

                         MICK
          Ever noticed he wore a Rolex watch?

                         REGGIE

                         NO--

                         MICK
          Or that he drove one of two cars, a
          Porsche or a Range Rover?

                         REGGIE
          I never saw him driving.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          93.

                         MICK
          And what made you approach him?

                         REGGIE
          I knew he was in the life. You
          know. A player. I had seen him
          leave with girls who do what I do.

                         MICK
          With prostitutes. To go to a hotel,
          or their apartments...?

                         REGGIE
          I don't know where.

                         MICK
          So how do you know they left? Maybe
          they just went out for a smoke...

                         REGGIE
          Because they got in his car and
          drove away.

                         MICK
          But you just testified that you
          never saw Mr. Roulet drive! Now you
          saw him leave with a prostitute
          like yourself. Which is it?
          The contradiction rings round the room. Reggie, tries...

                         REGGIE
          I saw him get in a car but I didn't
          know what kind it was.

                         MICK
          Do you know the difference between
          a Porsche and a Range Rover?

                         REGGIE
          one's big and one's small, I guess.
          Reactions... Reggie shakes her head, knows she's not making
          it... But Mick, like he's just getting started...

                         MICK
          The women he left with, when you
          saw them again, had they been
          beaten or injured?

                         REGGIE
          I don't know, I didn't ask.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          94.

                         MICK
          But girls in your profession talk
          about customers, don't you? Warn
          each other if someone's a freak...

                         REGGIE
          Yeah, usually...

                         MICK
          And how many had warned you about
          Louis Roulet?

                         REGGIE
          None. No one.

                         MICK
          So you believed you'd be safe?

                         REGGIE
          I, thought he was a known quantity
          and I needed the money, so...

                         MICK
          So you thought he could solve your
          need for money?

                         REGGIE

                         NO--

                         MICK
          No? Isn't that why we're sitting
          here? Because you zeroed in on him?

                         REGGIE
          No! I mean yes, but not like that--
          (looking round, a plea to

                         BE BELIEVED)
          He attacked me, I swear!

          CUT TO, INT. COURTROOM, LATER - ON A VIDEO PLAYING:

          The BAR TAPE, blown-up projection, SHOWS REGGIE PASSES LOUIS

          SITTING AT THE BAR, LEANS HER BODY INTO HIM SEXILY...
          ANGLE COURTROOM, ON REGGIE watching the tape. Also JURORS,
          reacting, enthralled, and Mick watching them...

          RESUME ANGLE SCREEN, REGGIE HANDS LOUIS A NAPKIN, PASSES BY.
          RESUME COURT, Mick signals the TECHNICIAN. It goes OFF.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          95.

                         MICK
          What did the napkin say, Ms. Campo?

                         REGGIE
          My name and address...

                         MICK
          And your price?

                         REGGIE
          Yes. Four hundred dollars.

                         MICK
          (after a beat)
          It's a hard line of work...

                         REGGIE
          And dangerous.

                         MICK
          In fact, haven't you told friends
          you were looking for a way out?

                         REGGIE
          Yes. I'm not proud of what I do--

                         MICK
          And so, isn't it true-- nothing
          would be easier to understand--
          that you saw Louis Roulet and his
          money as a way out?

                         REGGIE
          No! That's not what this is about!
          That man hit me and tried to kill
          me.

                         MICK
          Yes, we've heard you say that--

                         (TO FULLBRIGHT)
          Judge may I ask the witness to
          stand up?

                         JUDGE FULLBRIGHT
          (surprised, but)
          The witness will stand. I hope
          you're going somewhere with this,
          Mr. Haller.
          Reggie stands.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          96.

                         MICK
          Now if you please, walk over to my
          client.
          She goes, stands before Louis. Who rises on cue from Mick.

                         MICK (CONT'D)
          This is the man you broke free
          from, overpowered, knocked out?

                         REGGIE
          Yes-- You can do amazing things
          when you're afraid--

                         MICK
          How much do you weigh, Ms. Campo?
          Because your website REGGIE-FOR-FUN-
          DOT-COM says one hundred three...

                         REGGIE
          That's right.
          A beat. Louis sits. Reggie stands there... suddenly cries.

                         MICK
          I've got no further questions for
          the witness, your honor.
          Reggie returns to a seat behind the prosecutor's table. Where
          we pick up TED MINTON. Staring at Mick, hiding the sense of
          damage as best he can... He's startled when:

                         JUDGE FULLBRIGHT
          Mr. Minton? Do you have another
          witness for us?
          Ted rouses, summons confidence, rises...
          WHILE, ASIDE, Louis to Mick, re Ted...

                         LOUIS
          He looks worried.
          Mick watching Ted, waits, tense...

                         TED
          The state rests, your honor.
          Mick's disappointed: No Corliss.

                         MICK
          Not worried enough.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          97.

                         JUDGE FULLBRIGHT
          (raises a gavel...)
          Then the defense will call its
          first witness after lunch.
          And the gavel comes down.

          INT. COURTROOM, AFTER THE BREAK - MICK, ON DIRECT, HAS...


                         MARY WINDSOR
          Yes, I recognize this knife.
          (holding an evidence bag)
          It's the one my son carried with
          him for protection for the last
          four years. Almost exactly.

                         MICK
          Why would he need protection?

                         MARY WINDSOR
          Because realtors alone in a house
          are sometimes robbed or hurt...
          Even raped or murdered.

                         MICK
          But has Louis ever been the subject
          of such a crime?

                         MARY WINDSOR
          No. But he knew someone who...
          (hesitates...)

                         MICK
          Go on, please.

                         MARY WINDSOR
          She was raped and robbed by a man.
          Louis found her. It was terrible.
          The first thing he did afterwards
          was get himself a knife to carry,
          at all times.
          (looks at Ted Minton)
          March Sixth would have been no
          different.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          98.

          INT. COURTROOM, LATER - TED HAS MARY WINDSOR ON CROSS...


                         TED
          Mrs. Windsor, you seemed pretty
          exact, about when your son started
          carrying around this, this weapon,
          a five-inch folding knife...

                         MARY WINDSOR
          I am. The incident took place on
          June ninth, two-thousand-one.
          Mick watches Ted, carefully... Cat and mouse...

                         TED
          Was it in the newspapers?

                         MARY WINDSOR
          No.

                         TED
          Or, do you somehow remember because
          the police came to talk to Louis...

                         MARY WINDSOR
          There was no police investigation.

                         TED
          Then how can you remember the exact
          date so well?
          (sly look at Mick)
          Were you given the date before
          testifying here?

                         MARY WINDSOR
          I know the date because I'll never
          forget the day I was attacked.
          The news falls on Ted. She goes on before he can rally...
          MARY WINDSOR (cont'd)
          Louis will never forget it either.
          He found me in that house, tied up.
          Naked. It was traumatic for him.
          She's perfect: a strong woman, unused to showing emotion.
          Mick smiles, impressed. When, with some sarcasm:

                         JUDGE FULLBRIGHT
          Mr. Minton-- anything else?
          Ted, still thrown, stares down at his notes.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          99.

                         TED
          As Louis's mother, you'd do or say
          anything to save him, wouldn't you?

                         MARY WINDSOR
          I wouldn't lie. Not about what
          happened that day...

                         TED
          We have no police or hospital
          record that it even occurred...

                         MARY WINDSOR
          I never reported it...

                         TED
          Why not?

                         MARY WINDSOR
          I was ashamed. If you don't
          understand that I can't explain it
          to you. And yet I live with it
          every day.

                         TED
          But it's only you who says so:
          Mary looks at Ted, and at the Judge, as if confused:

                         MARY WINDSOR
          Is that a question?
          Off Mick, admiring, GO TO,

          INT. COURTROOM - POST-ADJOURNMENT, END OF DAY...

          Mick packing his stuff-- looks up, as Ted approaches.

                         TED
          I've been thinking about the
          thousand razors.

          EXT. COURTHOUSE - MINUTES LATER

          Louis waits on the steps, Mick comes out. Where they're
          alone...

                         MICK
          We've had an offer. Want to spend
          six months in county jail?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          100.

                         LOUIS
          I told you from the beginning--

                         MICK
          I know: The only verdict's Not
          Guilty. Okay. We'll get there.
          Grateful for this, Louis puts a hand on Mick's arm. But:

                         MICK (CONT'D)
          Don't touch me, Louis. You want to
          show your gratitude give me my gun
          back.
          Louis grins: meaning No way.

                         MICK (CONT'D)
          I thought so.

                         (THEN)
          You still sure you want me to put
          you on the stand?

                         LOUIS
          I insist on it.

                         MICK
          Then get some rest tonight, you're
          up next.
          Leaving Louis, Mick continues down the steps, to where the
          Lincoln waits. He gets in.

          INT. LINCOLN - CONTINUOUS

          Earl in the front seat.

                         MICK
          There's something I need you to get
          me, Earl.
          A tone Earl never heard him use before. Earl turns around.

          CUT TO, INT. COURTROOM - NEXT DAY - CRISP...

          Mick steps past Ted on his way to his desk. As he passes--

                         TED
          Did you talk to your client?

                         MICK
          Yes. No deal.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          101.
          Ted feigns surprise-but-acceptance... While, TO THE JUDGE:

                         MICK (CONT'D)
          The defense calls Louis Ross
          Roulet, your honor.

          INT. COURTROOM, LATER - LOUIS ANSWERS ON DIRECT...


                         LOUIS
          I turned toward the living room,
          the way she pointed...
          ANGLE MICK, has a floorplan of the apartment, on an easel.

                         MICK
          And what happened when you turned?

                         LOUIS
          Something hit me and I blacked out.
          I don't know for how long.

                         MICK
          That was all?

                         LOUIS
          Then when I woke up these guys were
          on me, telling me not to move. I
          couldn't anyway. I was too scared.
          Mick moves toward Louis, as if determined to find flaws...

                         MICK
          But, there was blood on your jacket
          and your left hand...

                         LOUIS
          Someone put it there because I
          didn't.

                         MICK
          Are you left-handed?

                         LOUIS
          No.

                         MICK
          You didn't strike Ms. Campo with
          your left fist?

                         LOUIS
          No!

                         

                         

                         

                         

          102.

                         MICK
          Threaten to rape her, or kill her?--

                         LOUIS
          No!

                         MICK
          You're angry. Why?

                         LOUIS
          (passionate but simple--)
          Do you know what it's like to be
          accused of something like this? To
          listen to people tell lies about
          your having done something so sick
          and awful? I, I understand I had to
          be quiet and wait my chance and not
          say anything-- but if guilty people
          have rights, what about innocent
          people? I am innocent!
          Mick. Meets Louis's eye, communicates: You were perfect.

                         MICK
          Nothing further, Judge.
          Ted already up & moving, passes Mick as he takes his seat--

                         TED
          According to you, Ms. Campo punched
          herself or had a man she never met
          before punch her lights out as part
          of a set-up?

                         LOUIS
          All I know is that I didn't.

                         TED
          And this knife you always carry,
          how did she know she'd find it on
          you as part of the set-up?

                         LOUIS

                         ("HONEST")
          She couldn't, could she? I mean, I
          never took it out or showed it to
          anybody-- so she must have just
          found it when she went into my
          pocket for the money I had that I
          was going to pay her with, right?--

                         

                         

                         

                         

          M.

                         TED
          I'd really prefer it if I ask the
          questions, and you answer them!
          (then calming himself)
          Would you look at this, please--
          Goes to the easel, REVEALS: PHOTO of Reggie's beaten face.

                         TED (CONT'D)
          Please tell us again if you think
          Regina Campo would or could have
          done this to herself.

                         LOUIS
          I don't know who did it, but it
          wasn't me. Nobody deserves that to
          happen...

                         TED
          (seizes on this)
          What do you mean by "deserves?" Do
          you mean crimes of violence come
          down to a whether a woman gets what
          she "deserves?"

                         LOUIS
          (right back at him)
          I mean no matter what she does for
          a living or who she is-- No woman
          deserves that.
          Ted keeps staring at the photo: Wants the jury looking there.

                         TED
          I have no more questions.
          At which, suddenly there's a wave of movement-- SLOW-MOTION--
          Louis dismissed from the chair-- Ted returning to his seat,
          passing Mick as Mick rises--
          Louis gives Mick a "How'd I do?" look, Mick nods,
          unmistakably, "You did fine..."-- Mick's look finds Ted--
          Mick and Ted holding each other in a gaze-- Mick's face in a
          kind of smile, Ted grim--
          As Mick brings out, speaking to the Judge but his smiling
          eyes fixed on the unhappy Ted-- RESUME NORMAL SPEED for
          Mick's confident, fateful words:

                         MICK
          Your honor, the defense rests.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          104.
          Ted hears this, sets his jaw. Fullbright turns to him.

                         JUDGE FULLBRIGHT
          Mr. Minton?
          Ted is uncertain...

                         TED
          Your honor...
          (She waits.)
          The state needs the night to
          decide, your honor...

                         JUDGE FULLBRIGHT
          To decide what?

                         TED
          Frankly I wasn't anticipating the
          defense would rest after two
          witnesses. I-- I'd like the night
          to consider calling a rebuttal
          witness.

                         MICK
          (reacts, "objects--")
          Your honor, first we've heard of

                         THIS--

                         TED
          I said `-consider." I need to find
          out if the witness is even

                         AVAILABLE--

                         MICK
          The state still has an obligation
          to disclose the identity--

                         TED
          Not if I decide not to use him.
          (a note of pleading)
          I'm begging the court's indulgence,
          your honor.

          It's the vast view from Mick's porch. He has a drink in his
          hand. And holds a phone to his ear...

                         MAGGIE'S VOICE
          There's a rumor in the office...

          How I'm the one who shot Raul?

          INT. MAGGIE'S HOUSE - ON THE PHONE IN THE KITCHEN

          In the BG we SEE HAYLEY, in pajamas, jumping on her bed...
          Maggie closes the bedroom door so she can speak...

                         MAGGIE
          Haller, is this serious?

          INTERCUT: MICK ON THE PORCH, RAIN/ MAGGIE IN HER KITCHEN

                         MICK
          I'd say so. I'm being set up for
          his murder. Couple of detectives
          from Glendale are following me
          around, just waiting for the go-
          ahead to hit me with an arrest
          warrant... Could be any minute...

                         MAGGIE
          How is this possible?

                         MICK
          Bad timing, bad client, me being
          dumb...

                         MAGGIE
          Is it Roulet? Is that the client?

                         MICK
          I can't talk to you about my
          clients. How is Hayley?

                         MAGGIE
          Fine. But Haller, if she ever hears
          anything about this--

                         MICK
          She won't. Not if I play it right.

                         MAGGIE
          What are you going to do?
          A long beat. Then he says, just as he told Raul--

                         MICK
          I'm working on it. I have a plan.

          CLOSE ON MICK, in the back seat. Looking out at the rain. His
          look a little different: close shave, neat suit. Fade up
          sound of Earl, meanwhile, rattling on...

                         EARL
          .when Not Guilty Two gets to four

          You gettin' any of this, Mr.

          As he moves down the hall. Everything counts today. Enters:

          INT. COURTROOM - EMPTY, EARLY - CONTINUOUS

          Ted prepares at his table. Look at each other without
          greeting-- as Mick moves to the CLERK, who shuffles papers...

                         MICK
          Bill, I'm getting coffee. Any for
          you?

                         CLERK BILL
          No man, I'm off caffeine...

          Hey, is that the custody list? Can
          I see if any of my no-good clients
          are on it?
          Bill lets him have it. Mick, casual, looks over the names...

          INT. COURTHOUSE - COFFEE COUNTER - DAY

          LORNA, she's paying for a take-out coffee, when Mick scoops
          her up by the arm, urgent, he's been looking for her--

                         MICK
          Minton's putting on Corliss. He's
          got him in lock-up already...

                         LORNA
          But Gloria still hasn't let us know
          if she got to him!

                         MICK
          You said she had mealtimes to work
          it...

                         LORNA
          Yes but...

                         MICK
          I'll take my chances. Meantime did
          you serve Kurlen?
          Moving her OUT OF THE CAFE, DOWN THE HALL-- hushed & fast--

                         LORNA
          Yes but I didn't like forging the
          judge's signature...

                         MICK
          Yes you did.

                         LORNA
          Yes I did.
          Just then, approaching, he sees SOBEL & LANKFORD: Are they
          coming for him? No, they turn into the courtroom along with
          others showing up for the trial's last day. Relieved--

                         MICK
          Now go, and be ready for my call.
          Lorna starts to go-- then pauses.

          Extra flip to her hips as she goes because Mick's watching.

          INT. COURTROOM - CONTINUOUS

          No sooner enters than KURLEN's in his face, waves a document.

                         KURLEN
          What shit is this, Haller? I got
          nothing to do with your case!
          Mick, "innocent," inspects the papers. With surprise--

                         MICK
          Subpoena to appear as a witness?
          You'll just have to wait and see.
          It's a legal document, Detective.
          Cursing, Kurlen takes himself off to a corner. Leaving Mick
          with the "legal document." He tucks it away--
          And continues to the front-- Past CECIL DOBBS and MARY
          WINDSOR, to LOUIS, at the defense table. OVER WHICH, PRE-LAP:

          JUDGE FULLBRIGHT (V.0.)
          Mr. Minton--

          INT. COURTROOM, MINUTES LATER - COURT'S IN SESSION...


                         JUDGE FULLBRIGHT
          Does the state have any rebuttal?

                         TED
          (rises, ready)
          The state calls Dwayne Jeffrey
          Corliss as rebuttal witness.

                         MICK
          Judge? Who is this witness? Why
          wasn't I told before now?

                         JUDGE FULLBRIGHT
          A fair question. Mr. Minton?

                         TED
          Dwayne Corliss is a cooperating
          witness who spoke with Mr. Roulet
          in custody, following his arrest.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          109.

                         LOUIS
          (shouts, suddenly--)
          Bullshit! I didn't to talk to--

                         JUDGE FULLBRIGHT
          Quiet, Mr. Roulet! Mr. Haller,
          control your client!
          Mick bends over, to Louis, sotto voce--

                         MICK
          That was good. Now leave it to me.
          (to the court)
          I do share my client's outrage,
          your honor. I'd at least like to
          know how long the state has been
          sitting on this testimony...

                         TED
          Mr. Corliss did not come forward
          until yesterday.

                         MICK

                         (OUTRAGED)
          This is incredible...

                         JUDGE FULLBRIGHT
          Do you want to go back and talk to
          him? Given the timing I'd allow it.

                         MICK
          No, Judge, we all know what this
          is, this is a jailhouse snitch, and
          anything he'd say would be a lie--

                         TED
          That's groundless, your honor--

                         MICK
          --I just want my objection noted.

                         JUDGE FULLBRIGHT
          Then I'm going to rule he can

                         TESTIFY--

                         MICK
          Can I ask one indulgence? Can I
          step into the hallway and make a
          call to an investigator? For
          whatever good it will do at this
          late date.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          110.

          INT. COURTHOUSE - CORRIDOR OUTSIDE THE COURTROOM

          Mick already dialling-- Lorna answering--

                         LORNA'S VOICE
          Yep, here.

                         MICK
          Put your watch at quarter of. At
          ten fifteen you enter the room.

                         LORNA'S VOICE
          Got it.

                         MICK
          With the printouts.

                         LORNA'S VOICE
          Mickey, I know the moves!
          He snaps shut his cell-phone.

          INT. COURTROOM, MINUTES LATER - DWAYNE CORLISS ON THE STAND

          Prison jumpsuit. We recognize him: the holding-cell junky.

                         TED
          Mr. Corliss, are you incarcerated
          at this time?

                         CORLISS
          Um, no, now I'm just in the
          courtroom.
          Dumb answer draws laughs. ANGLE LOUIS, seething...

                         TED
          But you are currently held in the
          jail-ward at USC hospital?

                         CORLISS
          Yes. Since I got arrested.

                         TED
          For burglary and drug possession?

                         CORLISS
          That's right.

                         TED
          Now. Do you know the defendant?

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         CORLISS
          Yes. I met him in lock-up. We was
          bussed over from jail, and then we
          was together in the tank when we
          came for first appearance.

                         TED
          And did you talk at that time?

                         CORLISS
          Yes... we talked about how bad we
          needed cigarettes.

                         TED
          Anything else?

                         CORLISS
          You know, "what are you in for?"
          Like that.

                         TED
          Did he say what he was "in for?"

                         CORLISS
          He said, "For giving a bitch
          exactly what she deserved." Those
          were his words.
          Reaction Louis, stirs like a caged animal. Mick steadies...

                         TED
          I have only one more question. Have
          I, or has anyone, made you promises
          to get you to testify?

                         CORLISS
          No. It's the right thing to do.
          Ted sits. Judge turns to Mick-- who's just staring, angrily.
          Then rises. Like he doesn't know what to do. Louis, the
          others, watch anxiously. Mick crosses to the front, steals a
          glance at the rear, SEES KURLEN standing against the wall,
          LANKFORD AND SOBEL seated in front of him. Then...

                         MICK
          How many times have you been
          arrested, Mr. Corliss?

                         CORLISS
          About seven in L.A. Couple of times
          in Phoenix if you count those.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          112.

                         MICK
          So you know how the system works?

                         CORLISS
          I try to survive...

                         MICK
          And sometimes that means ratting
          out fellow inmates, is that it?

                         TED
          Objection, your honor...

                         JUDGE FULLBRIGHT
          Take a seat, Mr. Minton. I gave you
          leeway bringing this witness in.

                         MICK
          Thank you, your honor. But I'll
          rephrase: How many times have you
          snitched on an inmate? Testified
          against a fellow inmate for the
          prosecution?

                         CORLISS
          This makes my fourth.

                         MICK

                         (LOOKING SURPRISED)
          Four times? People just come up and
          tell you they committed crimes so
          you can testify against them--

                         CORLISS
          People talk to me. I'm a friendly
          guy.
          Mick, walks toward Louis, indicates him--

                         MICK
          So you and my client were friends--

                         CORLISS
          That's right, we was friendly--

                         MICK
          And he just said what you said he
          said, about what the woman
          "deserved," and then you went back
          to talking about cigarettes?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          113.

                         CORLISS
          Not exactly. He was like, bragging.
          He told me he did it before...
          Mick freezes... Like he's in a mine field and can't move...

                         CORLISS (CONT'D)
          He said the other time he killed
          the bitch... He got away with it
          then and he would get away with it
          now.

                         MICK
          (staring at Corliss)
          You... Wait...
          All eyes on Mick. The Judge prompts...

                         JUDGE FULLBRIGHT
          Mr. Haller?

                         MICK
          No more questions, your honor.

                         TED
          Re-direct, your honor.
          Fullbright nods permission. While Louis leans over to Mick...

                         LOUIS
          What the hell is this?

                         MICK
          You tell me! What did you say to
          this guy?

                         LOUIS
          (through gritted teeth)
          Nothing! This is a set-up! You're
          doing this!

                         MICK
          How? How am I doing this?
          But Louis has no answer. Meanwhile Ted's taken the floor...

                         TED
          You said he was bragging. How?

                         CORLISS
          Well, like, he told me the details.
          About the other one, that he
          killed.

                         (MORE)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          114.

                         CORLISS (CONT'D)
          He called her a snake dancer. She
          danced in some joint where she was
          like in a snake pit.
          ANGLE, REACTION DETECTIVE KURLEN, he leans forward at this...
          SAME TIME, REACTION at the defense table: Mick, "alarmed,"
          low to Louis--

                         MICK
          How does he know this?

                         LOUIS
          Do you think I know?

                         MICK
          If you didn't tell him this shit
          somebody did. Who? Start thinking!
          RESUME Ted, moving closer to Corliss--

                         TED
          Is there anything else he told you?

                         CORLISS
          No, that snake-girl stuff was it.

                         TED
          (after a beat)
          Then no further questions, your
          honor.
          Ted sits. The look he gives Mick in passing is one of
          abounding confidence. Mick stews... Swivels around...
          Covert glance, MICK'S POV, looks to see if Kurlen is where he
          was, against the wall. He's not. He's gone. So is Lankford.
          And the courtroom door still swings slightly, as if they've
          just left... While IN FRONT:

                         JUDGE FULLBRIGHT
          Any re-cross from the defense?
          Mick rises to answer, hesitates-- and just then turns to see
          Lorna enter and approach down the aisle.

                         MICK
          A moment with my staff, Judge?

                         JUDGE FULLBRIGHT
          Be quick.
          He meets Lorna at the gate. Brings his head close to hers--

                         

                         

                         

                         

          115.

                         LORNA
          This is where I whisper in your
          ear, tell you stuff...

                         MICK
          (takes a file from her)
          It's all here, right? You go now, I
          don't want anyone talking to you.

                         LORNA
          Damn.
          She goes, he returns to the table. Before Louis can speak:

                         MICK
          I don't know what's going on here,
          but it won't matter if it's two
          murders or a hundred if I can show
          he's a liar--

                         LOUIS
          If you set me up I swear I'll--

                         MICK
          Just tell me if there's anything
          else he knows. Anything else I have
          to stay away from.

                         LOUIS
          I don't know because I never talked
          to him. I'm not that stupid.

                         MICK
          It doesn't matter. If I destroy him
          none of it counts...

                         LOUIS
          (from his gut)
          Then destroy him.
          A command. Mick nods. Returns to the witness Corliss--

                         MICK
          Dwayne, if I can call you that--

                         CORLISS
          It's what people call me--

                         MICK
          Don't they also call you D.J.? For
          example, down in Phoenix, right?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          116.

                         CORLISS
          Maybe.
          He's a bit wary. Mick looks through the file Lorna brought--

                         MICK
          Because you know, my assistant, she
          was just reading on the internet
          about D.J. Corliss-- arrested in
          Phoenix, 1989 on drug charges--
          Hometown of Mesa, Arizona?

                         CORLISS
          Yeah, that'd be me. But--

                         MICK
          You remember Fred Bentley, right?
          Corliss, darkens, stumbles at this-- Ted's quick--

                         TED
          I object, your honor, where is the
          defense going with this?

                         JUDGE FULLBRIGHT
          Connect the dots soon, Mr. Haller.
          But the witness can answer.

                         CORLISS
          I don't remember any Bentley--

                         MICK
          Sure you do. You testified that he
          confessed to you the crime he was
          charged with-- rape of a ten-year-
          old girl-- even though he denied
          his guilt in court. Am .I ringing
          any bells, D.J.?

                         CORLISS
          Uh-- 1989, I was high a lot,
          there's not much I recall--

                         MICK
          Then I'd like you to read this to
          us, D.J. It's a printout of a news
          story from the Arizona Star, 1997,
          that's eight years after he was
          convicted. I ask that it be
          admitted into evidence--

                         TED
          Your honor? A news report?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          117.

                         JUDGE FULLBRIGHT
          Let's see where it takes us. The
          state can object later.
          Mick hands printout to the bailiff, who gives it to Corliss.

                         MICK
          I've marked the paragraph.

                         CORLISS
          I ain't too good at reading...
          (clears his throat)
          "A man, Frederick Bentley, wrongly
          convicted of rape, was released
          Saturday after con--

                         (HESITATES)
          --conclusive DNA results cleared
          him of the crime. The case was
          bolstered at trial by testimony
          from an informant, D.J. Corliss of
          Mesa, who claimed Bentley had--
          bragged to him about the rape while
          together in a holding cell--"

                         MICK
          That's enough.
          (takes it from him)
          Were you charged with perjury for
          that incident, D.J.?

                         CORLISS
          No I was not.

                         MICK
          Was that because the police were
          complicit in your confession?

                         TED
          (rises, angry--)
          Judge, how can the witness know
          what went into the D.A.'s decision?

                         MICK
          (ignores, over--)
          Were you promised the same deal
          here, Mr. Corliss? To say that
          Louis Roulet "bragged" to you in
          the "holding cell?"

                         JUDGE FULLBRIGHT
          Alright, Mr. Haller, that will do!

                         

                         

                         

                         

          118.

                         MICK
          (Ceases. Angry.)
          Sorry. I have no more questions.
          And Mick sits. Courtroom's hushed. Until--

                         JUDGE FULLBRIGHT
          I'm excusing the jury for an early
          lunch. Bailiff, see them out.
          Maintains a smile as the jurors leave. Then her smile dies.

          INT. JUDGE FULLBRIGHT'S CHAMBERS - MOMENTS LATER

          No sooner through the door-- than Fullbright wheels on Ted:

                         JUDGE FULLBRIGHT
          Mr. Minton do you know what you
          have done? You've put a documented
          liar on the stand, a man with a
          record of putting innocent people

                         IN PRISON--

                         TED
          Your honor, I--

                         JUDGE FULLBRIGHT
          You shut the fuck up when I'm
          talking to you! I can think of
          nothing more prejudicial or corrupt
          than what I just saw out therel
          (in a rage now--)
          Do you realize what you've done to
          my trial?

          INT. COURTHOUSE CORRIDOR - MOMENTS LATER

          As Mick and Ted exit into hall-- Ted hurrying off, angry--
          Mick to LOUIS, DOBBS, and MARY WINDSOR-- tells them re Ted:

                         MICK
          He's going to see his boss. To
          decide what to do before the judge
          comes down with a directed verdict.

                         LOUIS
          What's a directed verdict?

                         MICK
          She takes it out of the jury's hand
          and declares an acquittal.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          119.

                         MARY WINDSOR

                         (GLAD/HOPEFUL)
          Oh my god...

                         MICK
          We'll know in a few minutes.
          And heads off. Louis's cold stare, watches him go...

          INT. COURTHOUSE - MEN'S ROOM

           Mick at the urinal. Louis enters in and slides behind him.

                         LOUIS
          I'm not celebrating just yet, Mick.

                         MICK
          Yeah I can see that.

                         LOUIS
          I want to know how Corliss got that
          shit he was saying.

                         MICK
          Let it go. You're getting what you
          want, I'm getting you off...

                         LOUIS
          What I want is get off for good.
          Leans into him. Pushes a hand into his back. A threat.

                         LOUIS (CONT'D)
          You'd better understand that.
          You've got enough reasons to be
          afraid of me already.
          When-- DOOR OPENS-- the courtroom CLERK, BILL, enters.

                         CLERK BILL
          It's starting.

          CUT TO, INT. COURTROOM - MINUTES LATER - ON...


                         TED
          I just spoke to the District
          Attorney, your honor. The state
          wishes to dismiss all charges.
          Here's a motion...
          Mick, Louis, watch Ted hand it to Fullbright...

                         

                         

                         

                         

          120.

                         TED (CONT'D)
          It acknowledges that the procedures
          which guarantee justice were not
          followed in this case...

                         JUDGE FULLBRIGHT
          (as she reads)
          This is a motion to dismiss with
          prejudice. No coming back. Ever.

                         TED

                         (WITH DIFFICULTY)
          Yes, your honor.

          INT. COURTROOM, CORRIDOR - LATER - MARY WINDSOR...

          .tearful at the news, grips Mick's hand... she and Dobbs...

                         MARY WINDSOR
          Mr. Haller, thank you for my son...

                         DOBBS
          You were splendid--
          And Louis. Private, a few feet away. Smiles...

                         LOUIS
          I knew I wasn't wrong about you...

                         MICK
          I want the gun.

                         LOUIS
          Of course you do.
          No more can be said, because Mrs. Windsor-- descends on Mick--

                         MARY WINDSOR
          Mr. Haller, this time I insist you
          come to Orso for a celebration--

                         MICK
          I don't think so.
          Mary would insist, but before she can, OUT OF THE ELEVATOR
          comes KURLEN-- with LANKFORD AND SOBEL. Mick freezes, expects
          the worst-- but they move AROUND him and CLOSE IN ON:

                         KURLEN
          Louis Roulet, you are under arrest.
          Turn around and place your hands
          behind your back.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          121.

                         LOUIS
          (as Kurlen cuffs him)
          Mick? This shouldn't be happening.
          Mrs. Windsor rushes Kurlen-- Sobel tries forcing her back--

                         MARY WINDSOR
          No! Take your hands off my son!

                         LOUIS
          Mother.
          Louis' voice controls her. Stricken, Mary gives up. Then--

                         DOBBS
          What are you arresting him for?

                         KURLEN
          (starting to take Louis)
          Suspicion of murder. The murder of
          Martha Renteria.

                         DOBBS
          That snake-dancer nonsense? Are you
          crazy? Everything that man Corliss
          said was a lie!
          Which stops Kurlen. He grins, confirmed.

                         KURLEN
          If it was all lies, how'd you know
          I meant the snake dancer?
          Dobbs sees his mistake. Kurlen begins again to take Louis--

                         MICK
          A moment with my client, Detective?
          Kurlen nods, why not. Mick leads Louis a few steps away.

                         MICK (CONT'D)
          This is it, Louis. I got you off.
          Now get yourself a new lawyer.

                         LOUIS
          You're forgetting I have the gun...

                         MICK
          Yeah, and you'll have to explain
          how you got it. But you know what?
          I've stopped giving a shit. You're
          going down, and Martinez is getting
          out, and that's all I care about.

                         (MORE)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          122.

                         MICK (CONT'D)
          When they stick that needle in your
          arm, that will be me.

                         LOUIS
          And what if I don't go down?
          But Mick's finished, ready to leave, though Louis persists...

                         LOUIS (CONT'D)
          Because I don't think they have
          enough to hold me. I could be out
          by tomorrow... You've got women,
          you've got a daughter...
          At this, Mick's head snaps to him, angrily...

                         LOUIS (CONT'D)
          You can't protect everybody.
          Kurlen arrives, takes Louis's elbow...
          Mick's already moving to the elevators... watched by SOBEL.

          EXT. COURTHOUSE - STEPS - MINUTES LATER - DAY - STILL RAINING

          SOBEL catches up as MICK reaches the Lincoln. Stops him. They
          move to beneath an overhang, where they're almost dry.

                         MICK
          Please tell me you've got enough on
          Louis for the murder of Renteria.

                         SOBEL
          We will. We have the ticket.

                         MICK
          What ticket?

                         SOBEL
          The parking ticket, that Raul
          found. That was the phone message
          he left you...
          (Sees Mick doesn't know)
          Raul checked. Louis got one at a
          meter outside the victim's place,
          same time she was murdered.

                         MICK
          What about Raul's murder? Do you
          have him for that?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          123.

                         SOBEL
          No. We still don't know how he
          could have slipped the tracer
          anklet.
          (before Mick can ask more)
          Haller? Leave it alone.
           He hesitates-- but goes. Into the rain. Gets into--

          INT. LINCOLN (PARKED) - CONTINUOUS

          He watches Sobel hurry back to courthouse through rain. When:

                         EARL
          Mr. Haller? Got that thing you
          asked for.
          And he hands Mick something wrapped in a towel: A GUN. Mick,
          puts it away, in the armrest. A bit regretful, because:

                         MICK
          I said I'd never do this. Ask you
          to violate your parole.

                         EARL
          It's called, lookin' out for your
          blood.
          Mick sits back. Earl pops in a RAP CD, TUPAC.

                         TUPAC
          "To be a man in this wicked
          land..."

          CONTINUES OVER: EXT. LAUREL CANYON - LATER - STILL RAINING...

          HAND-HELD, MICK in windbreaker, jogging... RAP continues...

          INT. MICK HALLER'S HOUSE - LATER - KITCHEN

          AS RAP FADES, CAMERA TRAILS Mick's messy kitchen: take-out
          pizza, beer bottles... and the GUN. Barrel protrudes from
          under the thrown-aside windbreaker.
          Mick's seen on the porch. PHONE RINGS, he rushes into answer.

                         MICK
          Yeah?

          Maggie?

                         MAGGIE'S VOICE
          I reached the sitter, she'll keep
          Hayley at the bus-stop...

                         MICK
          Good. As soon as you've got her,
          take her somewhere safe. And call
          me.
          (shifts calls/to Val--)
          Where is he, Val?

                         VAL
          I see him but I don't know where
          he's goin'...

                         

                         

                         

                         

          127.

                         MICK
          What?

                         VAL
          He's not goin' to your house.
          Sonofabitch sailed right past the

                         MICK
          So where's he going?

                         VAL
          He's heading for the Valley.

                         MICK
          Fuck, he's going to Maggie's. Keep
          track of him.
          Hangs up again. Looks around-- as if looking for an idea--
          then, frantic, looks up a number-- can't find it, finds it--
          dials-- it rings-- Cold sweat til somebody answers--

                         MICK (CONT'D)

          Haller...

          the RINGING OF A PHONE brings us BACK TO--

          He's almost there, Mick.

          EXT. ROAD OVER THE CANYON - LOUIS ROULET'S PORSCHE...

          Descending on the valley side...

          EXT. STREET, VALLEY - THE ROAD ANGELS (MOVING)...

          Harleys pouring it on in formation, like fighter-jets...

          EXT. VENTURA BOULEVARD - RAIN - MAGGIE'S CAR...

          She screeches to the curb, hops out... School bus stop, where
          other parents wait, in cars, under umbrellas... Maggie rushes
          forward, scans for the approaching bus... Nowhere in sight...

          CUT TO, INT. KITCHEN - MICK

          He's holding a phone, squeezing it, LISTENING TO A RING AT
          THE OTHER END... To himself, a prayer...

          Maggie be there, Maggie pick up...

                         MAGGIE'S VOICE
          You've reached the cell-phone of
          Maggie McPherson...

                         MICK

          DAMMIT!
          Slams down the phone... Desperate, grabs his jacket, his gun,
          flies towards the front door...
          OPENS it-- and MARY WINDSOR stands there. Before he speaks--
          She raises her hand and SHOOTS him. BRIGHT FLASH--
          Nick's POV, Woozy-- he falls back, she raises her gun again--

                         MARY WINDSOR
          You took my son away from me!
          She raises her gun again-- Mick FIRES AT HER FROM INSIDE THE
          JACKET. Her body jerks back, she falls...
          Mick, stunned, lies there...
          He watches, through the haze of his condition, as Mary
          Windsor's fallen body jerks, on the floor... CUT TO,

          EXT. LOUIS ROULET'S PORSCHE (MOVING) --

          Hate contorting his features, he's checking out the street
          numbers through the DOWNWARD SLASH OF RAIN... WHEN...
          The ROAD SAINTS, MOTORCYCLES SPANNING THE STREET, ARE HEADING

          RIGHT FOR HIM...
          Off Louis, his confusion and dawning fear... Cut to,

          EXT. VENTURA BOULEVARD - OUT OF THE SCHOOLBUS...

          Out steps Hayley, safe into Maggie's arms. Sitter looks on as
          Maggie hugs her... WHILE...

          INT. MICK'S HOUSE - MICK LIES ON THE FLOOR...

          Where he was shot. He's alert but still...

                         

                         

                         

                         

          130.
          Then rouses more as he HEARS feet come up the front steps...

                         WOMAN'S VOICE

          POLICE! PUT DOWN YOUR WEAPONS!

                         MICK
          (forces out the words)
          They're down! I'm shot!
          Suddenly LANKFORD & SOBEL are through the door-- Lankford
          sees Mary on the floor, while--

                         SOBEL
          Don't move, Haller--
          She rushes to him. Lankford's already on his phone--

                         LANKFORD
          This is Lankford, we've got a
          shooting, twelve-twelve Creek off
          Laurel, we need paramedics,
          ambulance transport for two--
          During which he's checking Mary Windsor's body, revises--

                         LANKFORD (CONT'D)
          Transport for one.
          Rings off. Sobel takes Mick's hand, presses it to his wound--

                         SOBEL
          Press hard and keep pressing.
          Mick's hand is on a blood-soaked hole, hurting like hell...
          while Lankford makes another call...

                         LANKFORD
          Yeah, it's Lankford again. Tell
          them it's over, they can grab
          Roulet and bring him in... He what?

                         (LISTENS-- SURPRISED)
          So, bring him to the Emergency Room
          first, then bring him in!
          (rings off; to Sobel)
          Dig this. The uniforms had some
          help picking up Roulet. Some
          motorcycle gang was already beating
          the shit out of him.

                         MICK
          (figures it out--)
          The police were tailing him?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          131.

                         SOBEL
          (She levels.)
          We thought he'd come after you. We
          couldn't tell you. The truth is we
          had plenty on him for killing
          Renteria. Jesus Martinez will be
          released. But we wanted Roulet for
          Levin, too. I told you: We had to
          find out how he beat the trace. Now
          we know.
          (her glance goes to Mary

                         WINDSOR)
          It was almost perfect. He's still
          wearing the anklet...

                         MICK
          I know...

                         SOBEL
          And it puts him half a city away.
          Just like last time.
          They share a look at the cleverness of it. When--

                         LANKFORD
          Look at this.
          Mick looks, HIS WOOZY POV AGAIN: Lankford, wearing a glove,
          lifts Mary's gun. Pearl-handled: The WOODSMAN. Admiring--

                         LANKFORD (CONT'D)
          They don't make'm like this
          anymore.
          Mick, makes a shape with his free hand. The "Longhorns" sign:
          inner fingers pointing down. Like Raul made.

                         MICK
          "W." Mrs. Windsor.
          Which is the last thing he manages to say before blanking.

          FADE OUT.

          FADE IN, EXT. HAYLEY, CLIMBING A TREE - DAY OF BLUE SKY

          L.A.'s best weather: Smog-blue. The tree off Mick's porch.
          Hayley's skinny legs climb nimbly from branch to branch.
          From the angle, we can tell someone is watching her.

          FADE OUT.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          132.

          FADE IN AGAIN, ANGLE, HAYLEY ON THE NEXT BRANCH, LATER
          Lifts herself. Nimble. And so pretty. Watching is:

          MICK - ON THE PORCH - WRAPPED UP IN A LOUNGE CHAIR
          Recovering, but not fully there. MAGGIE SITS INTO FRAME
          beside him.

                         MAGGIE
          I didn't know you were awake.
          He looks at her. Questioning.

                         MAGGIE (CONT'D)
          Don't worry, we haven't been living
          here. We did, for a while. When you
          were touch and go.
          Mick. Returns his gaze to-- HAYLEY, going branch to branch.

                         MAGGIE (CONT'D)
          I'd better get her down, she can
          get hurt up there--

                         MICK
          You can get hurt anywhere. Let her
          climb.
          An almost normal tone of voice. She smiles. CUT TO,

          He's IN THE BACK-SEAT, IT'S A MESS... He's scribbling on

Lock, Stock & Two Smoking Barrels

INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - PRESENT

This whole scene is shot using only extreme close-ups of eyes, cards, 
tapping fingers and mouths. We open on a bright  pair of eyes. One is 
bruised and slightly swollen, but this does not detract from their 
clarity.

EDDY
Three card brag is a simple form of poker; you are dealt only three 
cards and these you can't change. If you don't look at your cards 
you're a `blind man' and you only put in half the stake. Three of any 
kind is the highest you can get: the odds are four hundred and twenty-
five to one. Then it's a running flush - you know, all the same suit 
running in order; then a straight, then a flush, then a pair, and 
finally whatever the highest card you are holding. There are some tell-
tale signs that are valuable; I am not going to tell you them because 
it took me long enough to learn them, but these can only help a player, 
not make one. So you want to play?

DISSOLVE TO BLACK. THE FIRST OF THE CREDITS APPEAR ON THE SCREEN.

FADE IN:

What have you got?

We cut to a beady pair of eyes and then to his cards as they are turned 
over: three hearts of no consecutive numbers are exposed. That's a good 
hand. A flush beats my pair. What about you?

* Cut from completed film.

Another pair of excited eyes widen to the question. We see more cards: 
a run is revealed.

And here's me trying to explain the game to you. Hustlers, you're all 
hustlers!

We cut to a shot of a small amount of money being scooped up. OK! You 
got some real money?

DISSOLVE TO BLACK: MORE CREDITS APPEAR ON THE SCREEN.

FADE IN:

Ed scoops up a large pile of money.

Odds chaps, you gotta remember the odds.

There ? a loud slam of a door. We cut to a wide shot of a policeman 
who has just entered. It is then revealed that two of the three players 
are also policemen. They stand to attention, red faced with 
embarrassment.

SERG
I hope I am not interrupting. Comfortable, Edward?

EDDY
I haven't slept for forty-eight hours, got a dozen broken ribs, can 
feel a case of the flu coming on and . . .

SERG
(interrupts)
All right, all right, don't think I wouldn't like to get rid of you; 
but before I do, I need to know what's going on, son.

EDDY
If you think you're in the dark, I am in a black hole, blindfolded.

DISSOLVE TO BLACK. THE MUSIC STARTS.

We pull back out of the black to reveal that we have been sitting in 
the inside of a shotgun. The barrels recede further, then `boom.' LOCK 
STOCK are shot out of the top of the screen in peppered letters. We 
wait for a while, as the barrels reappear through. the smoke. We then 
see one smoking barrel; 'boom!' the other is let off: AND TWO SMOKING 
BARRELS joins the sentence.]

EXT. STREET (FLASHBACK] - DAY

We open on a smart, casually dressed man selling perfume and jewellery 
on a street corner. A crowd has gathered, attracted by the alarming 
volume at which he is advertising his wares.

BACON
See these goods, they never seen daylight, moonlight, Israelite, Fanny-
by-the-gas-light. If you can't see value here today you're not up here 
shopping, you're up here shoplifting. Take a bag, take a bag. I took a 
bag, I took a bag home last night and she cost a lot more than ten 
pounds I can tell ya. Tell me if I am going too cheap. Not ninety, not 
eighty, not forty, half that and half that again, that's right, ten 
pounds. Don't think 'cos it's sealed up it's an empty box. The only man 
who sells empty boxes is the undertaker, and by the look of some of you 
here today I would make more money with me measuring tape.

A well-dressed, zealous character (Eddy) appears from behind the crowd 
waving money. It seems he can't wait to get rid of it.

EDDY
Bargain, that's a bloody bargain if I ever heard one. Ten pounds you 
say? I'll have five.

Certainly sir. I'll just wrap.

Changing his attention.

BACON
Excuse me misses, sorry sir, ladies first and all that.

A tourist spectator, rather than a buyer, has been. put on the spot. 
She fumbles through her bag hastily all too aware of the attention of 
the crowd, of which she is now the focus. She passes her money like 
it's contaminated. Others follow suit.

Buy 'em, you better buy 'em; they're not stolen, they just never been 
paid for.

This really stokes the fire. The money can't come fast enough. Just as 
business reaches its peak there is a call of alarm from the first 
enthusiastic punter, who seems to be rather more familiar than he first 
pretended.

EDDY
Bacon!

Bacon's expression changes dramatically. A series of crash zooms 
between Ed's, Bacon's and a third party's eyes (the police) reveal 
there is a problem. They're off: EDDY and BACON run like they have done 
this before. They go down an ally; Ed jumps some stairs, we freeze.

BACON
(voice-over)
Ed can run fast, talk fast, eat fast, and play cards fast, but he's 
fucking slow when it comes to spotting the roz.

EDDY
(voice-over)
The reason he is called BACON is he spent so much of his youth in the 
police station that people thought he was one of them. But he is a big 
boy now and it is time to move on.

We cut to a shot of Ed as he lands. He has made good distance.

INT. GROCER'S SHOP - MORNING

EDDY arrives at a grocer's shop. We meet Tom. Tom is talking to Nick 
the Greek.

TOM
What are you talking about? I am bloody skinny, pal.

NICK
Of course you are. All right, Ed.

EDDY
Nick the Greek, always a pleasure. All right Tom, what you been eating?

Tom examines his midriff and adopts a confused expression.

TOM
Please, both join me in my orifice.

INT. GROCER'S SHOP STORE ROOM - DAY

They work their way past a maze of boxes.

NICK
(fingering and admiring one of the boxes)
How much did you say it was, Tom?

TOM
You know how much it is, Nick.

NICK
And that does include the amp?

TOM
You know it doesn't include the amp.

INT. RESTAURANT KITCHEN -AFTERNOON

Tom and Ed make their way through a busy, well-equipped kitchen. This 
is obviously a smart and serious establishment. They stop in front of 
the man whose uniform is covered in blood; he appears to be the head 
chef. Meet Soap.

TOM
What have you come as?

SOAP
Cupid stupid! That's the last time I am getting any more fruit off you 
Tom. Call that fresh? There was more small hairy armoured things in 
your fruit than there was fruit. You should open a butcher's, not a 
grocer's.

TOM
If you will order stuff that comes from Kat-Man-Fucking-Du don't be 
surprised if your fruit picks up a few tourists en route. ~ Never mind 
that, what about the money?

SOAP
Get your fingers out of my soup!

SLOW MOTION

Soap pulls out a bag from under where he is sitting.

TOM
(voice-over)
Soap is called Soap because he likes to keep his hands clean of any 
unlawful behaviour. He is proud of his job, and even more proud that 
it's legal.

BACON
(voice-over)
 He's a stroppy sod but he's got more balls than a golfer, only he 
doesn't know it. ' * Cut from completed film.

RELEASE SLOW MOTION]

Ed looks in bag.

EDDY
Are you sure you can afford twenty-five?

SOAP
Well that depends on how you look at it. I can afford it as long as I 
see it again, if that's what you mean. You got the rest from the fat 
man and Bacon?

Tom looks on with suspicion.

TOM
Who's this fat man, then?

EDDY
Bacon, the fat man and myself, and it's time to make a call to Harry.

INT. HATCHET HARRY'S OFFICE - DAY

A hard-looking man of about fifty is sat behind a large antique desk. 
On this desk is a hatchet resting in a block of wood, poised like a 
judge's hammer. Harry is obviously in the sex game. Cluttered up in a 
hazardous way are a selection of dildos, spanking paddles, etc. A 
cabinet of fine-looking shotguns is placed behind. We have a split 
screen involving EDDY and his friends (listening in) and Hatchet with 
one hand on the phone and the other on a shotgun.

HATCHET
You got it all?

INT. KITCHEN - DAY.

EDDY
A hundred grand.

FREEZE SHOT OF HATCHET

TOM
(voice-over)
You see it's not easy to take a seat at this table; the money involved 
has to be a hundred grand upwards and there is no shortage of punters.

EDDY
(voice-over)
The man who decides if you can play is this man Harry, or Hatchet Harry 
as some including himself like to call him.

RELEASE FREEZE SHOT OF HATCHET

HATCHET
Well if you got it, you got it. Now, if you don't mind . . .

The phone is slammed down.

SHOT OF HATCHET

SOAP
(voice-over)
When the old bastard is not playing cards he's chasing a thousand debts 
that ill-fated individuals owe for an array of reasons.

BACON
(voice-over)
Sex and sleaze and antique shotguns are all deep and dear in Harry's 
stone cold heart.

Cut from completed film.

RELEASE FREEZE SHOT OF HATCHET

HATCHET
What's this EDDY like, then?

The camera spins round to reveal a massive monster of a man sitting 
opposite Hatchet. Meet Barry the Baptist.

EDDY
(voice-over)
Hatchet has a colleague, a monster of a man: Barry the Baptist.

BACON
(voice-over)
The Baptist got his name from drowning people for Hatchet.

TOM
(voice-over)
But he needs him, because he is good at making sure debts get settled 
and jobs get done.

RELEASE FREEZE SHOT OF BARRY

BARRY
EDDY been shaking the knees of a lot of good players. The boy has a 
rare ability, he seems to make cards transparent, got bluffing dow . . 
.

HATCHET
(interrupts)
All right, all right, so we can say he is good.

BARRY
Better than good, he is a fucking liability.

HATCHET
Where did he get a hundred grand?

20

BARRY

He has got some adhesive mates, they have tossed up between them.

HATCHET
And JD is his dad, and owns the whole property?

BARRY
No mortgage, no debts; lock, stock, the sodding lot . . . don't worry, 
I got it under control.

HATCHET
Good, you can get this under control now.

A glossy Christie's brochure displaying a pair of impressive antique 
hammer-lock shotguns is shoved in Barry's face.

It seems Lord Appleton Smythe has run out of money, and these little 
beauties are up for auction, but I am not paying quarter of a million 
quid for 'em, if you know what I mean Barry. One of my associates has 
given me an address and the location of these lovelies. Make sure we 
get everything from inside the gun cabinet. I don't want to know who 
you use, as long as they are not complete muppets; and don't tell them 
what they're worth.

Changing the subject.

'Ere! Hold on, what do you think of these? We are selling hundreds.

Holds up one of the spanking paddles.

BARRY
Er, very nice Harry. What's it for?

HATCHET
Don't play innocent with me Bazza; spanking!

The paddle is brought down hard on the desk: slap.

INT. TORTURE ROOM - DAY

Meet the Dog. Dog is horrible. He is large and intimidating. 
Administering pain is Dog's forte. He is also the Guy we cut from the 
last scene `slap' to the teeing of a golf ball. Wallop. Dog pulls a 
sadistic and alarmingly pleasurable face.

DOG
It's a dog eat dog world, lads, and I got bigger teeth than you.

We see an individual hanging upside down tied up with gaffer tape but 
otherwise naked. An orange is stuck in the man's mouth. Dog is standing 
on another man's chest who has a tee stuck between his teeth from where 
Dog fires golf balls at the other unfortunate figure. The tied-up man 
is Gordon. The other is Slick. Gordon nods his head erratically 
implying that he has reached a decision.

(to Plank)
I think your man is trying to say something.

Pause.

Perhaps not; maybe I should have another swing just to make sure.

Agonised muffled screaming from Gordon. Slick (who has a tee in his 
mouth) shuts his eyes in horror as the golf ball thumps into Gordon.

Yes, Gordon, is there something you would like to tell us?

The orange is removed from Gordon's mouth.

GORDON
(rushing to get the words out)
In the kitchen, under the floor . . .

SLICK
(interrupts)
Shut it, you idiot . . .

Dog swings the golf club round Slick's jaw, knocking him unconscious.

DOG
You were saying?

GORDON
It's in the karzi, pull the fishing wire under the seat. Jesus, for 
god's sake let me down.

PLANK
Oh, Dog! . . . I think you want to have a look at this!

Plank returns holding an assortment of drugs and cash. Gordon starts to 
scream. Dog picks up a steel for sharpening knives and throws it across 
the room. Thunk. Silence follows. Plank grimaces.

Oh, Dog!

EXT. ED AND BACON'S HOUSE - EVENING

Ed, Bacon, Soap and Tom park outside their house. As they get out they 
pass Plank and John who have also just parked. They ignore each other, 
and go to their separate doors.

INT. ED AND BACON'S HOUSE - NIGHT

BACON places a pile of money on a table. The rest are eating, Tom keeps 
looking at his plate distastefully.

BACON
Twenty-five from me, Tom, Soap and yourself; a hundred grand to the 
pound. You don't need to count it.

EDDY
I still will, if you don't mind.

TOM
(eating)
So, a reasonable return should be in the region of one hundred and 
twenty, for twenty-five grand invested. That's going on previous 
experiences.

SOAP
That's going on optimism.

TOM
Whatever it's going on, it's still enough to send you on a cooking 
course.

SOAP
You're not funny Tom; you're fat and look as though you should be 
funny, but you're not.

Tom is definitely not overweight, quite the opposite in fact. He 
examines himself to see if something has developed.

TOM
Fat? Who are you calling fat? What are all these fat jokes about?

The light switch above Tom's head lets out a few sparks causing him to 
cower in a sharp defensive action.

Jesus! It's good in here, ain't it! Trains overhead, walls exploding . 
. . Why the hell did you move in?

EDDY
Because it's cheap like a budgie.

BACON
And nobody wants to live next door to the people that we live next to; 
a bit anti-social, you know.

BACON beckons Tom to a cupboard built into the wall.

TOM
What do you mean?

EDDY
He means they're thieving dogs.

BACON
I mean when they are not picking peanuts out of poop, they're ripping 
off unfortunate souls of their hard-earned drugs.

BACON opens the cupboard doors and puts his finger to his lips. The 
noise from next door immediately gets louder.

Not exactly thick, these walls.

DOG
(off)
No you prat, that's for me.

INT. DOG'S HOUSE - NIGHT

Dog has a small pile of money and pills that he is distributing to his 
lads.

DOG
How many times do I have to explain this to you, Plank? You find a job 
worth doing and you will find your share improving . . . Now do you 
have a problem with that?

He obviously doesn't.

INT. ED AIVD BACON'S HOUSE - NIGHT

Tom raises his eyebrows and frowns to Bacon.

EXT. BIG BOY'S GYM/SOLARiUM - NIGHT

Meet Big Chris and Little Chris (twelve years old).

BIG CHRIS
How long has he been in there, son?

LITTLE CHRIS
About twenty minutes.

BIG CHRIS
Is he on his own?

LITTLE CHRIS
Just carrying a bag.

BIG CHRIS
Let's have a look, shall we?

INT. GYM/SOLARIUM - NIGHT

BIG CHRIS
Son, have a look under that one.

Little Chris looks under one of the sunbeds.

LITTLE CHRIS
It's not him, Dad.

BIG CHRIS
Try that one.

Little Chris returns from a peek and nods in confirmation.

LITTLE CHRIS
Sleeping like a baby.

Big Chris then approaches and raises the sunbed.

BIG CHRIS
This is one of those high-powered numbers, isn't it?

John O'Driscoll's eyes widen; Chris slams down the sunbed on top of him 
as hard as he can.

Got some bad news for you, John.

JOHN O'DRISCOLL
What the fu-!

Big Chris slams down the sunbed on top of John.

BIG CHRIS
Mind your language in front of my boy.

JOHN O'DRISCOLL
Jesus Christ!

Big Chris repeats the earlier treatment twice more.

BIG CHRIS
That includes blasphemy as well. Now tell me, John . . .

JOHN'O'DRISCOLL
Tell you what, Chris?

A man opens the sunbed mom door.

SUNBED MAN
I say, hold on.

LITTLE CHRIS
I say shut it!

SUNBED MAN
You what?

BIG CHRIS
He said shut it!

Chris pulls a mean face; the door is closed.]

Tell me John, how you can concentrate on improving a lovely tan, and it 
is a lovely tan by the way, when you have more pressing priorities at 
hand?

JOHN O'DRISCOLL
Tell Harry . . .

Bang as sunbed comes down again.

BIG CHRIS
Did I say speak? And it's Mr Harry to you . . . Now don't disappoint me 
and chose your words carefully. You may speak.

JOHN O'DRISCOLL
I'll have it for Mr Harry in a few days. I have been busy, and I am 
nearly there.

BIG CHRIS
Son, have a look in his locker.

JOHN O'DRISCOLL
No chance of you lifting this sunbed up is there?

* Cut from completed film.

30

BIG CHRIS
Yeah, all right.

Big Chris lifts it, then smashes it down again. Now, you want me to 
lift it up again?

Little Chris pipes up. Obviously familiar with counting money he has 
flown through it.

LITTLE CHRIS
He's not poor. Five hundred and sixty pounds and that's just in his 
wallet . . . Fuckin' 'ell John, you always walk around with that in 
your pocket?

The expression on Big Chris's face changes.

BIG CHRIS
Oi! Next time you use language like that, boy, you'll wish you hadn't!

LITTLE CHRTS
Sorry, Dad.

BIG CHRIS
Right, well, put the rest of the stuff in that, son. You can go home in 
a plastic bag tonight, John. You owe what you owe arid before this tan 
has faded, you want to have paid.

Chris punches John unconscious and turns the time dial up.

INT. JD'S BAR - NIGHT

JD's bar is an impressive sort of uptown-downtown establishment with 
pretty girls serving a laddish clientele. The boys are propped up at 
the bar, looking straight ahead in silence. They look nervous. The 
silence is broken by Ed.

32

EDDY
I am going to the john.

He walks off.

TOM
What you telling us for? The only thing I care about is whether you get 
your rest in.

SOAP
Tom, you're all heart.

TOM
Listen cooky, you want to make sure that man rests before he plays; 
it's in all our interests.

JD
(the bar owner and Ed's father)
All right lads? How's things? How's it going, Soap? Cooking all right? 
Where's that son of mine?

Each time a question is asked the lads try to answer but are just left 
with their mouths open, which remain open as a gorgeous girl walks 
through the bar (Daisy).

INT. SLOANES' HOUSE LABORATORY - NIGHT

We cut to a small, humid, artificially lit, illegal forest being 
cultivated for profit. Someone is smoking a joint and raising his 
eyebrows at his friend. These two characters are J and Charles; they 
have got hair down to their shoulders, small try-hard goatees and 
science-lab coats, with nothing much underneath.

J
(coughing)
This gear is getting heavier you know, Charles. I got a suspicion we 
should have been rocket scientists, or Noble Peace Prize winners or 
something.

A horn blows (the door bell).

CHARLES
Who the hell is that?

INT. SLOANES' HOUSE - NIGHT

The door opens to reveal Willy. Under each arm is a large bag of 
fertilizer.

WILLY
Give me a hand Charlie, I could break sweat at any second.

A voice comes from behind them. At the top of the stairs stands 
Winston. He slowly starts to walk down.

WINSTON
Charles, why have we got this cage?

Pause. Charlie shrugs.

CHARLIE
Er, for security.

WINSTON
That's right, for security. So tell me, Charles, what's the point in 
having it if we don't fucking use it?

CHARLIE
Well, because it's Willy and Willy lives here.

WINSTON
Yes Charlie, but you didn't know it was Willy, did you?

WILLY
Chill, Winston, it's me and Charlie can see it's me, so what's the 
problem?

WINSTON
The problem is, Willy, that Charlie and yourself are not the quickest 
of cats in the alley at the best of times, so just do as I say and keep 
the fucking cage locked.

Pause as the two in the door look slightly pissed off at being shouted 
at. Winston sighs and looks at what Willy is carrying.

WINSTON
What are you carrying, Willy?

WILLY
Er, fertilizer.

WINSTON
You went out six hours ago to buy a money counter and you come back 
carrying two bags of fertilizer. Alarm bells are ringing, Willy.

WILLY
We need fertilizer, Winston.

WINSTON
We also need a fucking money counter, William! We have to get the money 
out by Thursday and I'll be buggered if I am counting it . . . and if 
you have to get your sodding fertilizer, couldn't you be a little more 
subtle?

WILLY
What do you mean?

WINSTON
I mean we grow copious amounts of ganja, and you don't look like your 
average hort-er-fucking-culturalist, that's what I mean, Willy.

Winston turns on his heels and walks off. 35

INT. JD'S BAR - NIGHT

Ed returns to the bar to find Tom, Soap and BACON
looking in disbelief.

TOM
(pointing to watch)
What the hell are you doing here?

EDDY
Why, what's up?

TOM
Er, let me guess, my foot in your arse? A game of cards and Hatchet 
Harry. You're supposed to be getting some rest, boy!

Ed grimaces as his father approaches. He has overheard this last 
statement.

JD You playing cards tonight with Harry?

EDDY
(pauses)
Don't be silly Dad, I wouldn't have anything to do with that.

INT. ED AND BACON'S HOUSE - NIGHT

We calm down for a while. A cool track is playing. Ed is now smartly 
dressed, sitting in an armchair. We have a close-up of his face. He is 
motionless, eyes closed; he looks asleep. The camera slowly tracks down 
his body We reach a single hand; he is cutting the pack skilfully and 
faultlessly; he is very much awake. There is a knock on his door. His 
eyes open.

INT. SEEDY BAR - NIGHT

Near-naked girls are gyrating against blue poles, which keep 
distracting these men's attention. Meet the two Scousers - Gary and 
Dean. The Scousers are in their late twenties, one big, one small. Gary 
(the smaller) sports a large demi-perm. They bear strong Liverpudlian 
accents. They are meeting Barry (Hatchet's man).

GARY
Shotguns? What, like guns that fire shot?

BARRY
Oh, you must be the brains then. That's right, guns that fire shot . . 
. Make sure you bring everything from inside the gun cabinet. There 
will be a load of guns, that's all I want. I'll pay you when you 
deliver. Everything outside the cabinet you can keep; it's yours.

GARY
(sarcastically)
Oh, thanks very much. And there had better be something there for us.

BARRY
It's a fucking stately home, of course there'll be something there.

DEAN
Like what?

BARRY
Like antiques.

DEAN
Antiques? What the fuck do we know about antiques? We rob post offices 
and steal cars, what the fuck do we know about antiques?

BARRY
If it looks old, it's worth money, simple. So stop fucking moaning and 
rob the place.

GARY
So who's the Guv? Who we doing this for?

BARRY
You're doing it for me is all you need to know. You only know that 
because you need to know.

GARY
I see, one of those `on a need to know' basis things, like a James Bond 
film, is it?

BARRY
Careful, remember who's giving you this job.

A bit of confused eye-rolling goes on. Barry eventually looks at his 
watch.

I am off, it's all yours now. Call me when you're done.

As he leaves, the two Scousers eye him distastefully.

GARY
(to Dean)
I hate these Southern shites.

BARRY
(on his way out, whispering to himself)
Fucking Northern monkeys.

EXT. BOXING CLUB ENTRANCE - NIGHT

EDDY and the lads have all made an obvious effort with their 
appearance. They are met by a doorman.

DOORMAN
Invitations.

EDDY
Invitations?

DOORMAN
Yeah invitations, you know a pretty white piece of paper with your name 
on it.

EDDY
Well we have got about a hundred thousand pretty pieces of paper with 
the Queen on it. Will that do?

DOORMAN
All right, just you; the others can wait in Samoan Jo's next door.

EDDY
Samoan Jo's? Yon mean the pub? Hold on . . .

DOORMAN
Hold on bollocks, no one but card players in here tonight sonny, and I 
do mean no one.

INT. BOXING GYM - NIGHT

EDDY enters the boxing gym on his own, and raises his eyebrows at the 
thought of climbing into the ring. Everybody else is sitting down 
counting their money and converting it to chips. Ed takes the only 
empty chair and has a quick look around, particularly behind.

EDDY
Evening Frazer, Phil, Don. This is a bit dramatic, isn't it? Is it 
supposed to be symbolic?

40

PHIL/DON
All right Ed. Apparently it's for security.

EDDY
I would have brought my gloves if I had known.

HATCHET
You must be Eddy. JD's son.

EDDY
Yup, you must be Harry? Sorry, I didn't know your father.

HATCHET
Never mind son, you just might meet him if you carry on like that.

There is an attractive blonde croupier shuffling the cards. EDDY

Evening Tanya, it has been a while.

EXT. SAMOAN JO'S - NIGHT

As the boys walk in to Samoan Jo's, a man comes tearing out of the door 
covered in flames followed by his friends trying to put the flames out. 
The lads look on in mild shock.

TOM
I heard this place was rough.

EXT. STATELY HOME - NIGHT

The Scousers make their way to the front door and unravel their lock-
picking kit. '

42

SAMOAN Jo's - NIGHT

SOAP
What sort of a pub is this then?

SAMOAN JO
A Samoan one. Anything else?

BACON
(receiving a monstrous, leafy cocktail)
What's that?

SAMOAN JO
A cocktail, you asked for a cocktail.

BACON
No, I asked you to give me a refreshing drink. I wasn't expecting a 
fucking rainforest; you could fall in love with an orang-utan in that.

SAMOAN JO
You want a pint, go to the pub.

BACON
I thought this was a pub.

SAMOAN JO
It's a Samoan pub.

BACON
Well whatever it is, could you get your man to turn the TV down?

SAMOAN JO
You ask him if you like, but I would leave him to it if I was you.

BACON looks at Rory Breaker, the man watching the TV.

BACON
Excuse me, could you turn the TV down?

RORY BREAKER
No.

He takes a swig of whatever he is drinking and frowns at Bacon. BACON 
frowns back, then Soap interrupts.

SOAP
This is the English-Brazil game, isn't it?

INT. BOXING GYM - NIGHT

CROUPIER
This is three card brag, gentlemen. That means that three threes is the 
highest, then three aces and then running down accordingly; then it's a 
running flush, a run, a flush, then a pair: An open man can't see a 
blind man, and it will cost you twice the anti to see your opponent. 
Don't fuck around, fellas; you all know the rules and you know I won't 
stand for it.

FRAZER
What sort of shirt is that then, Ed? 'Three hundred open.

EDDY
The type of shirt that has buttons on the front and collars at the top, 
Frazer. One hundred and fifty blind.

DON
Three hundred and fifty open.

PHIL
Fold.

* Cut from completed film.

HATCHET
Three hundred and fifty open.

FRAZER
You're the only fella in London who wears shirts like that. Three 
hundred and fifty open.

EDDY
No Frazer, it's just I'm the only classy fella you have had the 
pleasure of seeing in London. One hundred and seventy-five blind.

DON
Four hundred open.

HATCHET
Four hundred open.

FRAZER
Eight hundred. Like that, do ya, son?

EDDY
When my knees stop knocking I'll live with it. Four hundred blind.

INT. BOXING GYM CHANGING ROOM - NIGHT

Barry, who is sitting among sweaty towels, takes out a four-inch 
monitor and switches it on, and hey presto we can see the card table. 
The camera is placed behind Ed in one of the four posts. Barry zooms 
in, pauses on the back of Ed's head, gets his focus and jibs down to 
view his cards, pauses and re focuses, because Ed is playing blind. He 
hasn't raised them: there is nothing Barry can do. We cut to Barry's 
other hand. He is pressing a button on a remote control. We cut 
straight to Harry's leg which is receiving the pulse.

46

BOXING GYM - NIGHT

HATCHET
Listen ladies, this is cards. Men play cards, you want to talk soft you 
should be at the fucking hairdressers, so shut up and play.
(dramatic pause)
I fold.

FRAZER
Two thousand open.

EDDY
One thousand blind.

DON
Two thousand open.

FRAZER
Deep end, eh? Fold.

EDDY
Two thousand blind.

DON
You what?

There is a pause as Don examines Ed's brow looking for a trace of  
nerves.

Two grand? You're still blind. You have been eating too much English 
beef, mate; honkers, mad.

HATCHET
Well, you going to play?

Cut from completed film.

DON
Fucking right I am going to play. Three thousand, there.

CROUPIER
Four thousand to an open man, you know that.

We can feel the confidence emanating from Eddy. Don continues to search 
Ed's forehead waiting for a break of nervous moisture, but it's as dry 
as a desert disco.

EDDY
Donald, do you know how to play this game? The reason I put in half the 
anti is because I don't know what I have got. Now play, or fold.

Silence.

EXT. STREET - NIGHT.

Don is thrown out on to the street, screaming and cursing.

EXT. STATELY HOME - NIGHT

The Scousers, having now entered, make their way through the large 
house.

DEAN
OK Gary, we call each other Kenny, all right?

GARY
All right, Kenny.

Dean looks at Gary's disguise with some distaste. He has a stocking 
pulled over only half his face. A sexy thigh grip is replicating an 
artificial, frilly moustache, not giving the desired menacing look. A 
big bouffant head of hair is neatly being conntrolled up on top.

DEAN
Can't you pull that stocking down further, Kenny?

GARY
It just cost me fifty quid to have this done.
(Lovingly rearranging his hair)
If you think I am going to ruin it for a couple of old bastards you're 
mistaken, Kenny.

INT. BOXING GYM - NIGHT

Music starts. We cut to a montage of Ed, Hatchet and Barry at work. Ed 
must be about 250,000 up but the game is getting out hand and pieces of 
paper are being signed; IOUs.

INT. STATELY HOME BEDROOM - NIGHT

Dean returns down a corridor carrying an armful of rifles and enters a 
large bedroom. There are a couple of toffs (English aristocrats) tied 
up in bed. The old man has bits of tissue between is toes which Gary 
has seen fit to light, in order to extract information. Briefly meet 
Lord and Lady Appleton Smythe Winston and Daisy's parents).

DEAN
What are you doing, Kenny?

Gary is on the point of lighting another piece of tissue.

GARY
Finding out where he keeps the money.

48 49

DEAN
Kenny, you twat, does it look like these people have got any money? 
They can't even afford new furniture. We've got the guns; now if you 
don't mind . . .

At that moment they are interrupted by the sound of a shotgun 
cartridge. The ancient butler has made an unexpected entrance. He is 
holding an equally ancient pair of hammer-lock guns (the ones from the 
catalogue) which he has obviously got little control of. The recoil 
knocks the butler clear off his feet. The second shot hits the ceiling 
covering the old boy in plaster.

We cut to a POV of the butler on his back. We see Dean looking down.

You want to be more careful, old fella. You very nearly took my man's 
head clean off with that. You all right, Kenny?

We cut to a shaking shell-shocked Gary, mouth agape. The gun shot has 
torn through the centre of Gary's bouffant hairdo leaving him with a 
pair of smoking Mickey Mouse ears. Shock prevents him from answering.

Kenny?

INT. BOXING GYM - NIGHT

EDDY
Ten grand blind.

We see Hatchet feeling his leg; he looks shifty

INT. BOXING GYM CHANGING ROOM - NIGHT

Barry zooms in again; he can see nothing.

HATCHET
Twenty thousand open.

EDDY looks at his cards: he has a running flush.

EDDY
Twenty thousand open.

INT. BOXING GYM CHANGING ROOM - NIGHT

Barrv sighs with relief and types in the relevant information.

INT. BOXING GYM - NIGHT

Having received this information Hatchet pauses, then . . .

HATCHET
I'll fold.

We hear lots of oohs and aahs. EDDY frowns slightly This is odd play. 
Rather than looking happy he has a discrete glance over his shoulder; 
satisfied that nothing can be amiss, he collects his money.

Don't go spending, that all at once, boy.

INT. BOXING GYM CHANGING ROOM - NIGHT

Barry's phone rings. He jumps in shock and fishes around to find it.

BARRY
What?

50 ~ 51

INT. RED PHONE BOX - NIGHT

The Scousers reply; Gary is still unable to speak due to his shotgun 
experience.

DEAN
I thought you said no staff, Bazza!

BARRY
You get the guns?

DEAN
You should see what they did to poor Gary.

Gary wanders past the phone box in a gormless state. He obviously 
doesn't know what day of the week it is.

DEAN
Gary, get back into the van!

Barry frowns down the telephone. Yeah, yeah, we got 'em.

BARRY
Good. I'll speak to you later.

Barry clicks the phone off. Dean looks at Gary and raises his voice as 
if speaking to a deaf person.

DEAN
Gary, Gary, if you can hear me, I think we better get you back in the 
van now, OK?

Dean takes his arm and guides him back into the van.

BOXING GYM - NIGHT

Stakes have increased dramatically. There is a pause as Frazer looks at 
his cards.

EDDY
Twenty thousand open.

PHIL
OK. My Doctor would beat me to a heart attack if he knew what was going 
on here. I fold.

HATCHET
Got some cards there, boy? Thirty thousand. Back to you already Eddy?

Hatchet looks impatiently at the door.

EDDY
Fifty grand.

Hatchet scours Ed's forehead. It is still dry.

HATCHET
Eighty grand.

BOXING GYM CHANGING ROOM - NIGHT

Barry, who is trying as hard as he can to see Ed's cards, frustratedly 
zooms in and out; eventually Ed raises them just
enough; Barry jibs, hey bingo he sees Ed's cards!

Ed's got nothing but a pair of sixes. Barry excitedly starts tapping 
away.

53

INT. BOXING GYM - MGHT

EDDY
One hundred grand.

FRAZER
Hold on fellas, I know . . .

HATCHER (interrupts j
I know you're not in, which means nobody cares what you know. Two 
hundred and fifty.

Hatchet and EDDY minutely study each other's hairlines, waiting for a 
nervous droplet to appear. Sweat breaks; a drop on Ed's forehead, fills 
frame. Slowly we follow a droplet's journey coursing down Eddy's brow 
Eventually this is met by a large unblinking eye, at this point the 
pause is broken.

EDDY
That is quite a raise, one hundred and fifty on my hundred.

HATCHET
Yes . . . and is there something else you want to say? EDDY

As you know, this puts us in an awkward position. I don't have enough 
to continue.

Pause.

CROUPIER
We will have to see both your cards if no one loans EDDY the money to 
continue. It's a loan or we see both your cards.

Silence follows. A lot of nose scratching and examining of imaginary 
dirty ftngernails spreads contagiously throughout the remaining 
company.

It doesn't look . . .

HATCHET
(interrupts)
I will.

EDDY
You will what?

HATCHET
I will loan you the money.

Silence. The sweat bead reaches the bottom of Ed's chin, trembles for a 
second, then unattaches itself. Very slowly it falls. We follow its 
long silent journey. Eventually it is greeted by the back of Ed's 
cards. It explodes dramatically in sound and vision, symbolizing this 
worrying news.

EDDY
I think I would rather just turn them over.

HATCHET
I am not interested in what you would rather; I want to keep going. I 
am also offering you the money, so we don't have to turn them over 
because you can borrow.

EDDY
I need two hundred and fifty grand.

HATCHET
No, you need five hundred grand to see me.

Ed's face is now awash, busily blistering with sweat.

EDDY
That's if I want to see you.

HATCHET
Well, you're going to have a problem carrying on, aintcha.

The pause is painful.

55

CRUOPIER
You can still fold.

EDDY doesn't like the sound of this. There is sympathy in her voice. 
Harry looks sharply through narrowed eyes at the croupier; the croupier 
pleads with Eddy.

EDDY
I'll see ya.

HATCHET
For half a million?

EDDY
Unless you are going to accept twenty quid.

HATCHET
And still got a sense of humour. That's not monkey nuts son; you can 
still fold.
(Pause)
OK, before I loan you this, I expect, if you lose of course, my money 
back within a week, Crystal? That's Sunday, OK?

These last few words echo in the distance of Ed's mind (and ours). He 
is committed, but has now left the world of the conscious. Hatchet 
turns over the first card; it's a seven. EDDY
ushers him on; another seven, it looks as though he will have three; 
then the third: it's a four. There is an anti-climatic silence. After a 
loud pause . . .

CROUPIER
Is that it?

* Cut from completed film.

FRAZER
He was bluffing!

Hatchet looks content and rather nonchalant.

HATCHET
Let's see your fucking cards.

Nobody is impressed by Hatchet's cards; all eyes fall on EDDY 
expectantly We crash in to Ed's pupils with a loud swoosh. They 
contract to the size of pinheads. His world has changed for ever.

FREEZE SHOT OF EDDY

EDDY
(voice-over)
I knew he was bluffing, but somehow the worst card player round the 
table had fucked me like a frozen virgin with a pair of sevens. A 
series of blows to my head with a baseball bat would have been greeted 
with a grin compared to this. Ten minutes earlier, I was two hundred 
thousand pounds richer; now I owed half a million.

RELEASE FREEZE SHOT OF EDDY

Harry approaches Ed and whispers in his ear.

HATCHET
I know your friends are responsible for most of that cash, so I'll give 
you all a week to find it. After that, I'll take a finger off each of 
you and your friend's hands for each day that passes without payment; 
and when you have all run out of digits, then who knows what?

Ed gets up. We stumble with him in slow motion. He is hardly able to 
stand. He wobbles over to the door. Harry continues to talk over the 
top.

Business is business, and I am good at making mine work. I like your 
dad's bar, JD's, so don't get clever or lethargic. If you can't pay in 
a week, a few fingers and a bar for starters.

Ed stumbles out of the door, doubles up and vomits all over the f door.

INT. SAMOAN JO'S - NIGHT

Ed has made his way into the bar. All his friends have fallen asleep. 
One of Bacon's eyes opens to see Ed cleaning himself up.

BACON
This doesn't look good.

The others wake on this statement. We cut between the lads and their 
frozen reaction.

FREEZE SHOT OF LADS IN SHOCK

EDDY
(voice-over)
I then explained the unfortunate position we were in. Harry was going 
to start sizing up all our fingers in a week, 'cause he knew there was 
no way I could raise that kind of money on my own. Harry saw it as 
their money on the table so it was also their debt off the table. I 
hate to admit it but I could have kissed the old bastard for that. If I 
said I wanted to settle this debt on my own it would have been a lie.

RELEASE FREEZE SHOT OF LADS

EDDY
Listen, I wish he would let me settle it on my own.

Tom drops his drink and rushes Eddy.

58

TOM
I'll kill him!

BACON
(intercepts Tom)
Stop fucking around, Tom, and think. What are we going to do?

SOAP
What's all the fuss about Harry? Why don't we just boycott the payment?

They all look at Soap like he is mad.

INT. HATCHET HARRY'S' OFFICE - NIGHT

BACON
(voice-over)
Let me tell you about Hatchet Harry. Once there was this geezer called 
Smithy Robinson who worked for Harry. It was rumoured that he was on 
the take. Harry invited Smithy round for an explanation. Smithy didn't 
do a very good job. Within a minute Harry lost his temper and reached 
for the nearest thing at hand, which happened to be a fifteen-inch 
black rubber cock. He then proceeded to batter poor Smithy to death 
with this; that was seen as a pleasant way to go . . . Hence, Hatchet 
Harry is a man you pay if you owe.

EDDY
I'll think of something, don't worry.

EXT. STREET - DAY

Ed, who looks like he is close to suicide, has developed a two-day 
stubble and his eyes have disappeared into black sockets. He stumbles 
along the street with a bottle of scotch poking out of a pocket. He 
stops outside JD's, looks at the entrance and decides not to go in.

60

INT. SLOANES' SITTING ROOM - DAY The ridiculous door-bell horn blows.

J
Who the hell's that. It's only twelve.

WINSTON
Use that cage, that's what it's there for.

WILLIAM
(off)
Who is it?

PLANK
(off)
Plank, open up.

This is done without the use of the steel-caged security door.

This weed is getting quite a reputation, you know, fellas. Gloria 
remains motionless in her chair. Plank waves his hand about in a sort 
of `how you doing' way to everyone and goes to take a seat. At the last 
minute, poised like he is sitting on a potty he realizes he is about to 
sit on this girl.

Jesus! Never saw you there. Hello, love. Enjoying yourself?

Gloria doesn't respond. Plank waves his hand over her face. Still no 
response. Plank looks around for some acknowledgement.

Is she, er, compus?

WINSTON
(doesn't look up)
What do you think?

Plank takes a close look at the girl.

61

GIRL
BOO!

Plank jumps back, completely taken by surprise, knocking over a 
pedestal of shoe boxes stacked up against a wall, full of fifty-pound 
notes.

PLANK
Fuck me!

Charles, pissed off, looks at William like it's his fault.

CHARLES
Fod God's sake.

WILLIAM
Clean that up, Charles.

CHARLES
Sod you, you clean it up.

PLANK
Sorry fellas, but that stupid cow!

WILLIAM
Never mind, could you please just sit down and stay out of the way.

WINSTON
Anyway, how much do you want?

PLANK
(trying to look like the money hasn't had an impact on him)
I am after a half weight.

WINSTON
That's one and a half thousand. Pass those scales, Willie, and sort out 
the gear, Charlie. Any chance of seeing your money?

INT. JD' S BAR - DAY

Cut to Bacon, Soap and Tom sitting and talking in the back of JD's bar. 
They don't look a lot better than Ed.

BACON
The odds are one hundred to one so all we need is five grand.

SOAP
I would rather put my money on a three-legged rocking horse. The odds 
are a hundred to one for a good reason, BACON
. . . it won't win. So where is Ed with all the bright ideas?

BACON
At the bottom of a bottle and has been for two days; it's hit him hard.

SOAP
It's hit us all hard!

BACON
Yeah, but he has got to tell his Dad he is about to lose his bar.

Tom, who has not really been listening, suddenly interrupts.

TOM
Listen to this one then; you open a company called the Arse Tickler's 
Faggot Fan Club. You take an advert in the back page of some gay mag, 
advertising the latest in arse-intruding dildos, sell it a bit with, er 
. . . I dunno, `does what no other dildo can do until now', latest and 
greatest in sexual technology. Guaranteed results or money back, all 
that bollocks. These dills cost twenty-five each; a snip for all the 
pleasure they are going to give the recipients. They send a cheque to 
the company name, nothing offensive, er, Bobbie's Bits or something, 
for twenty-five. You put these in the bank for two weeks and let them 
clear. Now this is the clever bit. Then you send back the cheques for 
twenty-five pounds from the real company name, Arse Tickler's Faggot 
Fan Club, saying sorry, we couldn't get the supply from America, they 
have sold out. Now you see how many of the people cash those cheques; 
not a single soul, because who wants his bank manager to know he 
tickles arses when he is not paying in cheques!

There is a long pause while BACON considers this.

BACON
So how long do you have to wait 'till you see a return?

TOM
Probably no longer than four weeks.

BACON
A month? So, my friend, what fucking good is that, if we need it in six 
. . . no, five days?

TOM
Well, it's still a good idea.

SOAP
Listen to this one . . .

INT. DOG'S HOUSE - DAY

We see the back of a head.

DOG
So do you know these geezers well?

PLANK
Well enough. I have been buying gear off one of them for a couple of 
years.

DOG
What they like then?

PLANK
Poofs. Nothing heavy, four public school guys. Soft as shite.

INT. JD'S BAR - DAY

Soap is finishing off his suggestion for raising money.

SOAP
And you keep all the money'

Pause. BACON and Tom frown at Soap.

TOM
I have heard some fucking stupid ideas in my time but yours makes 
Bacon's sound inspired.

INT. ED AND BACON'S HOUSE - DAY

Ed fumbles with his keys at his front door. He enters his house in a 
sort of zombie state, takes off his jacket and opens the cupboard 
doors. He hangs his coat up (it promptly falls off" the hanger) and he 
collapses in a pile on the floor. The cupboard doors now being open, he 
can clearly hear next door's discussion. We track in very slowly on Ed.

PLANK
They ponce around in funny hippie clothes all day, talking bollocks. 
They're just good at growing weed, that's all, and business has got 
bigger than what they can keep up with.

INT. JD'S BAR - DAY

SOAP
If you're so fucking clever why don't you come up with a suggestion?

BACON
I am thinking, I am thinking.

INT. ED AND BACON'S HOUSE - DAY

DOG
(off)
Listen, they can't be all stupid if they got a container load of cash 
sitting in shoe boxes, a skip-load of Class A gear and you don't think 
there is anybody sensible involved.

We reach the end of our track. Ed's head is on a pitiful angle in full 
close-up. It straightens and his dark eyes widen immediately on this 
news.

INT. DOG'S HOUSE - DAY

DOG

What about security?

PLANK
There's one steel gate as you go in but they never lock it.

DOG
What do you mean, never? Well what have they got it for, then?

PLANK
I must have been there fifty times, it's never been locked; they're not 
suspicious. Everybody who goes there are toffs. They're all into that 
karma crap: `If I don't harm nobody, nobody harms me' stuff.

DOG
Is there no way they can get back to you?

PLANK
Even if they could they'd be too shit scared. They have got no muscle; 
they're gutless faggots.

66 ~ 67

IN'T. HATCHET HARRY'S OFFICE - DAY

Barry and Harry are talking. Harry is polishing a shotgun. It is very 
different in appearance to the hammer-locks.

HATCHET

Is Big Chris on his way?

BARRY
Should be here any minute. I think you're making a mistake, Harry. 
That's a lot of money for Chris to be running after. I wouldn't trust 
him to bring it back here.

Hatchet's speech is laced with cut-aways of Big Chris in action, and on 
the ascent (with Little Chris) of Hatchet's stairs.

INT. HATCHET HARRY'S STAIRCASE - DAY

HATCHET
(voice-over) 
What do you know about Chris, eh? You put Big Chris on a job and he 
will make sure it gets done, no matter what's in his way. His dad used 
to collect debts and his dad before that, and that monster of a boy 
will after he has gone. It seems that the Almighty himself requested 
them to collect debts for eternity and not to fear knocking on old 
Nick's door himself, if he was behind on his payment. But he has never 
nicked a picker in his life. Straight as an arrow and as strong as the 
bow that fired it. If you dropped your tenner he would search till he 
found ya . . . the only problem is he isn't stable, has a temper like a 
runaway train, and he hits twice as hard. Heaven protect anyone who 
touches that boy, not that the boy needs protecting.

We see Big Chris walking up the stairs. He reaches the top and knocks 
on the door.

INT. HATCHET HARRY'S OFFICE - DAY

Big Chris is sitting in front of Hatchet, Barry behind Chris.

HATCHET

Want a drink?

BARRY
Hello son, would you like a lolly?

LITTLE CHRIS

Piss off you nonce!

BIG CHRIS

Oi, watch it! No thanks Harry, we are both all right. Nice shooter.

HATCHET
Like it? One of a pair, Holland and Holland. Here, you want to hold it?

BIG CHRIS

Nah, not my thing, thank you, Harry. Business good? I imagine that's 
what I am here for.

Harry leans the gun against the side of the desk and takes a seat, does 
a breast-stroke movement to clear his desk of all the sexual debris, 
takes a big breath of air and begins.

HATCHET

I want you to forget about any other debts at the moment; there are 
fresher fish to fry!

BIG CHRIS

Go on.

HATCHET

It's a bit of a priority. Four young fellas who got in deeper than they 
could handle; they owe me half a million pounds.

68 ~ 69

LITTLE CHRIS

How much?

INT. ED AND BACON'S HOUSE - NIGHT

Tom, BACON
and Soap are sitting in front of Ed who looks as though he is about to 
launch in to a speech.

TOM
What's the flapping about? You told the old man yet? EDDY

I hope I won't need to. I got a plan. So listen carefully.

INT. SLOANES' SITTING ROOM - NIGHT WINSTON

Look, he set us up. That means he put money into us, which means he 
expects money out of us. You don't need to be an economist to work that 
out.

J
He might think we smoke a lot and burn a bit of profit, but he can't 
have any idea about the hard currency we've accumulated. We can just 
slice it off the top.

WINSTON
You guys, you've got to realise who this chap is. He's a fucking 
lunatic. If he gets the slightest inkling that we are not throwing 
straight dice, you - and fuck it, me - are going to know what the sharp 
side of a kebab knife feels like.

*CHARLES Come on, we are in this for the cash however it comes.

The phone rings. Winston picks it up.

* Cut from completed film.

70

WINSTON
Hello.

DAISY 
(she is upset) 
Winston?

WINSTON
Yeah.

DAISY 
It's Daisy.

WINSTON
I know who it is. What's the problem?

INT. ED AND BACON'S HOUSE - NIGHT

The situation has been explained. There are thoughtful frowns on all 
foreheads. There is a pause.

SOAP
Well, what do you want us to do about it?

EDDY
Hit the fuckers.

Pause while this is digested.

I know it sounds a bit heavy, but it's not like you are doing anything 
illegal.

BACON
I don't know how you've reached that conclusion.

EDDY
They can't report they have had all their drugs and money nicked, can 
they?

71

TOM
How heavy are the fellas anyway?

EDDY

They don't look all that.

SOAP

Hitler didn't look all that.

EDDY
All right, but for Christ's sake we're in the soup and this is the 
silver spoon. If you can think of another way to get out, let me know. 
It's not like we've got all the time in the world either . . . Dig?

Silence falls over them.]

BACON

I am game.

TOM

Me too.

S0AP

Oh, god!

EDDY
Well, we hit them as soon as they come back. We'll be waiting and 
prepared for them.

Pause as Ed's voice drops a little. And they are armed.

SOAP
What was that, armed? What do you mean, armed? Armed with what?

EDDY
Er, bad breath, colourful language and a feather duster! . . . What do 
you think they will be armed with? Guns, you tit!

SOAP
Guns! You never said anything about guns. A minute ago this was the 
safest job in the world, now it's turning in to a bad day in Bosnia . . 
.

EDDY
Jesus, Soap, stop being such a mincer. I thought about that and...

SOAP

And what exactly?

EDDY
And we will just have to find out who's going to be carrying them.

SOAP
Carrying them. They could all be carrying them for what we know.

EDDY
No, just one of them is in charge of them going to the job. So I assume 
he will still

be carrying when he comes back from the job.

SOAP
Oh, you assume, do ya? What do they say about assumption being the 
brother of all fuck-ups?

TOM
It's the mother of fuck-ups, stupid!

SOAP
Well, excuse me, brother, mother or any other sucker, doesn't make any 
difference, they are still fucking guns, and they still fire fucking 
bullets!

72 ~ 73

EDDY

Soap, if you got a better idea to get five hundred grand in the next 
few days you let us know . . . In the meantime, Tom, speak to Nick the 
Bubble about moving the weed.

INT. JD'S BAR - NIGHT

Tom and Nick are stuck away in a corner playing on a fruit machine.

NICK

Weed?

TOM
Not normal weed. This is some fucked-up skunk class A. I can't think 
let alone move shit.

NICK
Doesn't sound very good to me.

TOM
Neither me, but it depends on what flicks your switch, and the light's 
on and burning bright for the masses.

NICK

You'll need samples, Tom.

TOM

No can do.

NICK

Where's that? A place near Katmandu? Meet me half way, mate.

TOM
Listen, it's all completely chicken soup.

NICK

It's what?

.

TOM

Kosher as Christmas

NICK
(rolls his eyes)
Jews don't celebrate Christmas, Tom.

TOM
Never mind that now. I also need some artillery, you know, a couple of 
sawn-off shotguns.

NICK
Bloody hell, Tom! This is a bit heavy. This is London, not the Lebanon' 
Who do you think I am?

TOM
I think you're Nick the Greek.

INT. RORY BREAKER'S OFFICE - DAY

There's a cacophony of seventies funk and football filling the room. We 
meet Rory Breaker. Rory is a very well-dressed cool-looking black dude. 
He is in his own way sophisticated, considering what he does for a 
living. His help, however, are less well-informed. Rory has Nick the 
Greek in front of him.

RORY
Nick, I don't have anything to do with weed, normally, but if it is 
what he says it is, I'll give him three and a half thousand a key, 
that's if it is what he says it is. I don't want to see it after a 
sample, I don't want to touch it after a sample. I'll leave you in the 
capable hands of Nathan here. He will work out the details, but let me 
get this straight. If the milk turns out to be sour, I ain't the kind 
of pussy who will drink it. Know what I mean?

74 ~ 75

INT. GARAGE UNDER THE ARCHES - DAY

The Scousers are handing over all the shotguns from their previous job 
to Barry and assistant. Dean has got a complicated hair arrangement to 
disguise his accident with the butler. Barry raises his eyebrows at 
this new look.

BARRY
Is your hair supposed to look like that, then?

Gary ignores this question.

DEAN
Next time we do a job like this we gonna want more money, or we are 
going back to post offices and cars.

BARRY
Where're the others?

Barry is looking with same concern for the hammer-lock Purdeys.

DEAN
There are no others.

BARRY
Now, stop fucking around. The others, the old ones?

DEAN
I don't know what you mean.

BARRY
(dead serious)
There were two old guns there; where are they?

DEAN
Not in the cabinet there wasn't. There was a couple of old hammer-lock 
muskets the butler was carrying; they were ours, and we sold 'em!

77

BARRY
Well you just better un-sell 'em, sharpish.

DEAN
They were . . .

BARRY
(interrupts)
I am not fucking interested.

Shouting. If you don't want to end up counting the fingers that you 
haven't got, or sharing a bed with the anti-Christ, I suggest you get 
those guns, quick.

INT. BACK OF VAN - DAY

We are facing Nick's large behind, builder's cleavage poking out of the 
top of his trousers. Nick is unwrapping two long implements from a 
sheet: the hammer-lock Purdeys.

TOM
Jesus, if I pick them up, will they stay in one piece? Where did you 
get them from?

NICK
I got contacts. Listen Tom, if you pointed them at me I'd shit myself 
or do whatever you said to do. Either way you still get the desired 
effect.

TOM
They look nice, I agree . . . but lacking in criminal credibility, 
aren't they? I might get laughed at. How much do you want for these 
muskets?

NICK
Seven hundred each.

78

TOM
What's that, a pound for every year they have been around? I know 
they're antiques, but I ain't paying antique prices. Pause.

And they're a bit long, aren't they?

NICK
Sawn-offs are out, Tom; people like to have a bit mare range nowadays.

TOM
Range? I don't want to blow the arse out of this country, granted, but 
I don't want anybody blowing a raspberry at me either. I want to look 
fucking mean.

NICK
Of course you will look mean, Tom, you will look really scary.

TOM
All right, let's forget about them for the time being. What about your 
weed man?

NICK
Rory Breaker is standing by. You stand to make a lot of money, Tommy 
boy.

INT. JD'S BAR - NIGHT

We are looking directly at JD's shell-shocked face. He gently lays down 
an empty glass on the bar.

HATCHET
I understand if this has come as a bit of a shock, but I'll tell you 
how this can be resolved by the good father.

* Big Chris in completed film.

Pause. The camera spins round to reveal Hatchet and Barry the Baptist.

JD
Go on.

HATCHET
I like your bar.

JD
Yes?

HATCHET
I want your bar.

JD
And?

HATCHET
Do you want me to draw a picture?

JD
Harry, that boy doesn't know his arsehole from his ear-hole, or you 
from a hoodwink. This bar is mine, and he has nothing to do with it.

HATCHET
What, and I care? Remember, you do have the luxurious advantage of 
being able to sustain your son's life.

JD
And you do have a reputation, so I'll choose my words carefully. But 
not to put too fine a point on it, fuck yourself, Harry!

Barry pulls a kind of mock-scared face and clutches his heart.

80

HATCHET
Oh, careful JD, you'll give Barry a heart-attack.

We crash-zoom again into Harry's eyes to see the pupils contract. It's 
time to look mean.

I'll put that down to shock, but only once, only once can or will I let 
you get away with that. Your son's still got three days to find half a 
million, but make up your mind which one you prefer: your son, or your 
bar.

We have a slow-motion close-up of the drink being slammed down, proving 
a point.

INT. ED AND BACON'S HOUSE - DAY

BACON has rigged up an amplifier to the hole in the cupboard along with 
a ridiculous amount of recording equipment. The house lights still 
flicker on and off. We start the first part of the conversation looking 
at Bacon, who has his headphones on. We cut to Dog halfway through the 
second sentence.

INT. DOG'S HDUSE - DAY

PLANK
There's nothing to worry about, it's going to be easy.

DOG
There is no such thing as easy in my experience and, if you think this 
is going to be easy, you're a dick. It may be easier than most but it's 
not going to be easy.

INT. ED AND BACON'S HOUSE - DAY

BACON has a kettle next to where he is sitting. It steams away quite 
happily but a worrying noise starts to come from the plug socket. BACON 
prepares himself.- BOOM! He disappears into black.

INT. DOG'S HOUSE - DAY

They react to the BOOM! Dog looks at the wall with suspicion, misses a 
beat, then continues.

DOG
What's that idiot doing next door?
(Points at Paul)
We use your van. It's up some stairs this place, so we'll stick out 
like balls on a bulldog. Plank is going up first. There is a cage but 
it is never locked, is it Plank?

PLANK
No.

DOG
And it better bloody not be. Once he is firmly in place, he gets the 
rest of us in. We'll get nasty with a couple of them, shit 'em up, 
scare and gag 'em. I can't see these wankers giving us a problem, but 
they might have a couple of tools hanging around like any cowboy. When 
the job is done we'll come straight back here. It's dark by then, 
unload and Robert's your father's brother. Everybody savvy?

ALL TOGETHER
Yup.

DOG
Right, tomorrow, eight o'clock we'll do it. Apparently these stags 
don't get out of bed till midday, lowest ebb and all that, and that's 
how I like it.

INT. ED AND BACON'S HOUSE - DAY

BACON is now lit by candle.

BACON
Jesus.

DOG
(off)
So no messing around tonight. We leave eight a.m., OK?

EDDY
Yes?

BACON
It's happening tomorrow morning. Get back here now.

INT. ED AND BACON'S HOUSE - NIGHT

SOAP
(staggering)
Where did you get those from, a museum?

TOM
Nick the Greek.

BACON
How much did you part with?

TOM
Seven hundred for the pair.

SOAP
Drachmas, I hope. I would feel safer with a chicken drumstick. They 
could do more harm than good.

BACON
Jesus, Tom, do they work?

TOM
I dunno, but they look nice. I rather like ' em.

EDDY
Top of the list of priorities, how nice they look.

SOAP
Ladies, if you don't mind, back to a more important issue. We've only 
got two real guns . . . apparently that's what they are. We find a good 
place to hide next door. When it sounds like the right time, we jack in 
the box, look nasty and stuff, cocoon them in gaffer tape, then we nick 
their van and swap the gear into a new van and then bring it back here. 
As long as we are all out of our hiding places quickly, it's the last 
thing they'll expect. If Tom and anyone else feels like kicking them 
around a bit I am sure it won't do any harm. A bit of pain never hurt 
any one (thinking about it) if you know what I mean . . . Also, I think 
knives are a good idea, you know, big fuck-off shiny knives, the ones 
that look like they could skin a crocodile. Knives are good because 
they don't make any noise, and the less noise the more we're likely to 
use them. That'll shit 'em up and make us look like pros.

There is a pause as they look at Soap with suspicion.

TOM
Is there something we should know about you, Soap?

BACON
I am not sure what's more worrying, the job or your past.

INT. ED AND BACON'S HOUSE - MORNING

Ed and Bacon, etc, are all mounted up on top of one another looking out 
a crack in the curtain. They are observing Dog's party en route to 
work. They are dressed as kebab shop assistants.

SOAP
Where the fuck are they going? To butcher a sheep? I thought this was a 
robbery.

EDDY
Where did they get those outfits from? Haven't we got some like that, 
Tom?

TOM
Well, not exactly like that.

INT. DOG'S HOUSE (VAN) - MORNING

Dog and troop load up.

INT. SLDANES' SITTING ROOM - MORNING

Cut to Sloanes. They are up and unusually awake. Today is the day to 
move the money so they are comparatively alert. There is lots of 
activity.

WINSTON
You fucking jelly-heads, move it. You have been up for two hours, you 
should have got somewhere by now. The gear and the money has got to be 
out of here before twelve.

The horn blasts.

Who's that? J, don't you dare open the door until you use that cage. I 
am serious, and find out who it is first.

86

INT. SLOANES' FRONT DOOR - DAY

J
(raising his voice for the door)
Hello, can I help you?

PLANK
All right, it's Plank. Is Willie there?

J
No, I'm afraid he's not. He's out at the moment.

PLANK
Well, perhaps you can help?

J
Well, perhaps I can't, Plank, if you know what I mean.

PLANK
Look, could you just open the door so I could talk without shouting?

J
I can't help you, Plank.

PLANK
I think you'll find it is in your interest.

INT SLOANES' SITTING ROOM - DAY

J
Hold on. OK.
(Whispering inside.)
Look Willie, it's Plank outside asking for you, he says it's in our 
interest.

87

WINSTON
I don't care if it's King fucking Kong, he is not coming in here, not 
today.

WILLIAM
Hold on: we are in business and correct me if I am wrong, but that is 
business?

J
Corrected; that's a walking accident that we can do without.

WILLIAM Jesus, he's OK; he knows only to buy weights now, so we are 
looking at least a couple of thou; just one last time.

J
What do you think, Winston?

Pause.

WINSTON
Willy, this is the last time, and don't let him know that you're here, 
otherwise he will be here all day, and get rid of him quick. We have 
work to do.

EXT. SLOANES' STAIRS - DAY

DOG
(frustrated)
What the fuck is going on?

MICK
Do you want me to have a look, Dog?

DOG
No, you silly fucker, stay still.
(Whispering)
What's going on?

PLANK
Come on, I can't wait out here all day.

Starting to get anxious that the whole deal could be off Plank looks 
down the stairs and waves at Dog as some kind of reassurance.

J
(off)
All right, just coming.

J unlocks the door after getting the cage ready. There's an external 
door, and then a small corridor before the cage. J is inside the cage. 
Two, or at a push, three people could fit in this space before they 
would be poking out on the outside world.

INT. SLOANES' CAGE - DAY

PLANK
I thought you were going to leave me out there all day.

J
I didn't know you were a kebab man, Plank.

PLANK
(taking the piss)
Lives and learns doesn't one.

Then devastation slaps him hard.

Keep the gates locked now, do you?

J
Sorry, got to do business like this now; can't be too careful these 
days.

PLANK
I know.
(Suddenly turning very nasty whispering.)
Now shut it. You say a fucking word the right knee goes, another word 
then your left.

J
(confused and believing it's a joke, until he sees the gun.)
What are you doing, Plank?

PLANK
What do you think I am doing? Hold on. What are you doing? Unlock that 
gate. Oi! I said unlock that fucking gate.

J has found it all too much and has passed out with fear, collapsing on 
the floor in an awkward contorted position. Plank is desperately trying 
to find the right key. Things are not going as well as planned. Dog, in 
the meantime, has decided it's time to start the show

EXT. SLOANES' STAIRS - DAY

DOG
 Go! Go! Go! Fucking run, you two.

They all go charging into the open door only to slam straight into 
Plank. The keys go flying out of Plank's hands and through the cage. 
Plank cries with frustration, reaching out with his hand to retrieve 
them. Dog, finding the gate locked, is none too happy They are also 
still exposed to the eyes of the world due to the lack of space between 
the outside door and the inside cage.

90 ~ 91

INT. SLOANES' CAGE - DAY

DOG
(mesmerized}
The fucking gate's shut, you prick.

PLANK
Just hold on, I got the keys.

Having clawed them back with the end of his shotgun.

DOG
(seeing an unconscious man at his feet)
What the fuck did you do to Fauntleroy?

PLANK
(fumbling and panicking)
I didn't touch him, he just passed out.

INT. SLOANES' SITTING ROOM - DAY

WINSTON
J, what's going on out there?
(Realising)
Get the rifle out, Charles. We're being fucked.

INT. SLOANES' FRONT DOOR - DAY

DOG
Get the sodding gate open now, Plank.

Plank is busy fumbling about, not really getting anywhere because of 
the pressure being applied.

PLANK
(trying to convince himself, as much as Dog)
It must be this one.

DOG
Just give me the keys.

The gun with which Plank has been entrusted is pointing straight at 
Dog's groin.

Point your gun in there, dick, not at me.

Mick has unwrapped his gun from his case. Dog turns and looks amazed at 
the size of the weapon.

What the fuck is that?

MICK
It's a bren gun.

DOG
You could have brought something a bit more fucking practical, couldn't 
ya?

Pop! We hear the sound of an air gun pellet hitting the bars.

PLANK
(trying to salvage some credibility)
Don't you stags move or I'll kill the lot of ya.

DOG
(amazed by this stupidity)
Who are you going to kill Plank? There's no one there.

We hear another pop and Plank gets shot in the neck. This 
understarulably sends him into a real panic, thinking this is curtains.

PLANK
(gurgle)
They shot me!

Panic unashamedly exposing itself. Trickles of blood start flowing from 
in-between Plank's fingers.

DOG
(unimpressed)
Well shoot them.

Plank shoots at everything and nothing. Smoke fills the corridor, 
leaving them in a cloud. A bit of coughing goes on, then silence.

JOHN
Jesus Plank, you could have got smokeless cartridges, I can't see a 
bloody thing.

Pop! Another pellet is fired hitting John in the chest.

Ah, Jesus, shit, I've been shot!

DOG
I don't fucking believe this. Could everybody stop getting shot. Sit 
down John, you cock, patch yourself up; it's only a fucking air rifle.

Dog is interrupted by an enormously loud blast of machine-gun fire. Dog 
and the boys panic, cover their ears and hit the floor. After this 
outburst Dog looks up at Mick and sees he is the culprit. Mick looks 
down at Dog expecting a congratulatory nod from Dog; he doesn't get it.

What the fuck was that?

MICK
That was the bren gun!

94 . ~ 95

DOG
If you use that again, you're a dead man, do you understand?

He speaks softly but he is quite shaken. He then raises his voice; he 
has had enough of all this mincing.

Right fellas!

He shouts to the Sloanes while dragging the semi-conscious body of J up 
to use as a shield.

Before I go any further I am going to shoot your mate's toes off!

No sooner said than done; his toes go. The smoke problem repeats itself 
and J faints again, but an unfazed Dog continues.

Now if you want us to be gone in two minutes, open the fucking gate, 
now!

INT. SLOANES' SITTING ROOM - DAY

CHARLES
He'll probably kill us if we do.

WINSTON
Well, J will certainly get it if we don't; he's serious. Look what he 
did to his toes.

DOG
(off)
Right, his leg's going now.

WINSTON
All right, all fucking right, I am coming.
(Turning and whispering)
Willie, he doesn't know you are here, just sort something out, OK.

Willie slinks off with a `like what?' look on his face.

INT. SLOANES' CAGE - DAY

DOG
And all your friends, there's a good lad.

WINSTON
There is only three of us here.

DOG
Do you want me to take his leg off? Where's the fourth?

WINSTON
I mean it, there is only three of us here.

DOG
Plank?

PLANK
(gurgle, gurgle)
Yeah, one of them's out.

DOG
OK, open the gate.

No sooner said than done. Dog hits one straight on Winston's forehead 
with the butt of his gun and drags him to the stairs. 97

INT. SLOANES' SITTING ROOM - DAY DOG

Up boy, up, up.

They reach the top of the stairs.

Tie 'em up John and, Plank, you come with me. Where's the money?

PLANK
There, in those shoe boxes.

Dog opens them. There is nothing in them. If looks could kill Plank 
would be pushing up daisies.

DOG
(gun to the head of Winston)
Where?

WINSTON
Out the back.

DOG
And the weed?

WINSTON
Out the back.

MICK
Point.

WINSTON
With what?

MICK
Your hands, now!

WINSTON
I can't, I am tied up.

98

MICK
Well, well, shake your head or something.

DOG
All right Plank, get Paul out of the van.

This is done on a walky talky.

INT. SLOANES' BACK ROOM - DAY

The door opens. Willie is waiting behind it armed with a machete. He 
turns to his opponent and, eyes shut for Dutch courage, hacks straight 
into Mick's arm. Mick's machine gun goes off and William loses a finger 
as he tries to push the barrel to the side. He starts screaming 
uncontrollably

DOG
(to Plank)
Give us your knife.

Dog is going to put an end to this screaming and is making his way to 
its source. William is silenced through fear of the approaching Dog and 
slumps on the floor in a silenced wreck, holding a bleeding hand.

(the point of the blade resting on William's throat)
Enough! Mick, how you doing?

MICK
How do you think I am doing? He has fucking nearly chopped my arm off.

Dog's attention is diverted as he sees a table full of cash, neatly 
packed and stacked.

PAUL (in doorway visibly shocked
Gordon Bennett! What's been going on in here?

DOG
Shut up, you idiot. You got the bags? Can you get it in?

PAUL
There's a lot here, all right. I don't think we will be able to get 
this all in the van.

DOG
Bollocks, you'll get it in even if you have to do two trips.

EXT. SLOANES' HOUSE - DAY

A traffic warden appears as Paul goes outside to load up.

TRAFFIC WARDEN
You got a ticket already and, if you don't move it now, sir, we will 
move it for you.

PAUL
I'll only be a minute.

TRAFFIC WARDEN
You've already been fifteen.

Paul, realising that persuasion is futile, decides other means are 
necessary to despatch this nuisance. He looks down both sides of the 
street: the coast is clear.

PAUL
Look. Go on, look.

TRAFFIC WARDEN
At what, exactly?

PAUL
My van is half full.

TRAFFIC WARDEN
So?

PAUL
So I've just got to put you in, and I am off.

Having made their way to the rear of the van, Paul opens the back 
doors. Paul smacks the traffic warden on the side of the head. The 
momentum carries the warden into the van, unconscious. Paul has another 
quick look round and Lifts the warden's legs up and pushes him deeper 
into the vehicle.

INT. SLOANES' SITTING ROOM - DAY

PLANK
My neck, Dog.
(Dog shows no sign of pity)
That's the last bag?

DOG
(Turning to Mick.)
How about you? All right?

MICK
I'll be fine when; have dealt with this little shit. Mick grabs the 
machete that was used to disable him and puts down the machine gun.

DOG
Do it quietly.

Gloria, who has been forgotten by the Sloanes and unnoticed by Dog and 
troop, has sat through the whole episode without apparently realising 
the gravity of the situation. She is kick-started into action by the 
sure demise of Willie. The machine gun has been placed not too far away 
from her. She picks it up, and fires it into the already wounded body 
of Mick, who is almost instantaneously transformed into dog meat. 
Gloria, who has found a gear that nobody probably not even herself, 
knew existed, destroys everything she points at. Bodies jump for cover 
and Winston and the rest close their eyes and hope for the best. 
Eventually the gun, which seems to have a limitless supply of lead, 
goes quiet. We cut to close-ups of everybody opening their eyes 
cautiously. Looks of relief come from everyone, not least the Sloanes. 
Dog, who is closest, stands, walks straight up to her and punches her 
on the jaw Gloria is knocked out.

What was that? Where did she come from? That's fucking it. Tie her up. 
We are getting out of here.

EXT. DOG'S HOUSE - DAY

BACON
Eh, bunk us up over the wall.

BACON forces one of the windows open. He looks pleased and beckons the 
others over. They keep in contact with Soap by cellular phones.

INT. DOG'S HOUSE - DAY

EDDY
Everything all right out there, Tom?

TOM
(on phone)
Right as rain.

EDDY
Where the hell are we supposed to hide?

Ed looks into an almost empty room in which they are to find cover. He 
shrugs, and goes to sort himself out a cup of tea.

SOAP
What are you doing, Ed?

EDDY

Do you want one?

SOAP
No I fucking don't! You can't make a cup of tea, Edward.

EDDY
Why not? The whole of the British Empire was built on cups of tea.

SOAP
And look what happened to that.

EDDY
If you think I am going to war without one, you're mistaken, mate.

INT. DOG'S VAN - DAY

Dog turns to admire a full van.

TRAFFIC WARDEN
You won't get away with it.

Dog turns around and sees the tragic warden.

DOG
Paul, what's that?

PAUL
That's a traffic warden.

DOG
(looking straight at Paul)
What's he doing in the van?

Dog and the others look at the tragic warden mercilessly

PAUL
He was about to call the cozzers.

Paul hits him again, sending him back into unconsciousness.

DOG
We will deal with him later.

EXT. DOG'S HOUSE - DAY Tom is on the mobile phone.

TOM
They're here.

INT. DOG'S HOUSE - DAY

Dog opens his door, enters the front room, dumps his two bags down and 
is met by a bleeding Plank (who is grunted at) and John, who is rubbing 
his chest. Dog sighs and turns to get more bags. The action starts. 
It's hard to tell who is who because of the balaclavas. The lads jump 
out of their positions.

BACON
Down, down, get fucking down now'

This is like d??vu. There is no response as the three of them seem 
not to believe what's going on. BACON hits Dog with the butt of his 
gun, establishing who's boss. Dog does down with a thud. Plank hits the 
floor immediately.

EXT. DOG'S HOUSE - DAY

Paul enters, sees trouble, drops his bags and prepares to run. He is 
met by Tom who greets him with a smash round the kneecaps with a lead 
pipe. This has more than the desired effect and Paul has to be dragged 
in screaming by Tom. It all went rather smoothly

EDDY
Tie 'em up, tape 'em up, face and mouth. Keys, I want the keys.

DOG
I'll find you.

BACON
Of course you will, sweetheart. This one, search this one. Ed finds the 
keys without any trouble.

EDDY
I'll meet you in the van when you have finished with handsome there.

INT. DOG'S VAN - DAY

There is silence. For a few seconds all we can hear is the noise of 
their breathing.

107

TOM
Well Jesus, that wasn't so bad, was it?

SOAP
When the bottle in my arse has contracted I'll let you know.

EDDY
Bacon, see what we got.

BACON
Let's have a butcher's. Jesus, there's lots of everything. We've got 
god knows how much of this stinking weed; we've got a shit load of 
cash; and we've got a . . . traffic warden.

TOM
A what?

BACON
A traffic warden. Look, what's this?

He holds up the hat.

TOM
Shit Ed, we've got a traffic warden.

Pause.

BACON
I think he's still alive. He's got claret coming out of him somewhere. 
What did they want with a traffic warden?

EDDY
I dunno, but I don't think we need him. Dump him at the lights.

INT. HATCHET HARRY'S OFFICE - DAY

HATCHET
It's about time you give my young friends a visit, Chris. Tomorrow is 
the day and mum seems to be the word, and I can't have that now, can I, 
Chris?

BIG CHRIS
No Harry, you can't.

INT. DOG'S HOUSE - DAY

Dog struggles free and unravels the tape from his head and gets the 
other three out.

DOG
Dead. Dead. I don't know who they think they could be, for me not to 
find 'em. Of course I'll find 'em. I don't give a flying fucking fish 
who they think they are. I'll kill - fur and feathers, burning wheel 
South African style, kebab 'em, peel 'em, slice 'em and dice ' em, hang 
draw and fucking quarter ' em.

INT. OTHER VAN - NIGHT

Two vans are parked back to back. We see Ed and the boys putting one 
last trunk into the back of the new van.

EDDY
That's it all done, we are off.

SOAP
You think it's a good idea taking it back to yours?

EDDY
There is nowhere else to keep it, and it's the last place they are 
going to look. Anyway the battle's over and the war is won.

Ed passes a handful of grass to Tom.

Tom, take this to Nick, and let's get rid of it, quick.

INT. RORY BREAKER'S OFFICE - NIGHT

Nick has given the weed to Rory for inspection. Lenny has stepped in.

LENNY
It is skunk . . . and it's as good as it gets.

RORY
OK, I'll take it off you; half price.

NICK
I don't think he'll like that. You said three-five a key, that's what 
he wants and you know that's a good price.

RORY BREAKER
It was yesterday I said three and a half grand and today is today, if I 
am not mistaken.

Turns back to the TV.

I'll take it tomorrow for half price. If he wants to move it quick 
he'll take it. Now, I've got another game coming up in a minute so if 
you would be kind enough.

Pointing at the door. Nick exits.

Lenny, take this to Snow White and the three little chemists; they 
should have a gander at this. I want a proper opinion. 110

EXT. SLOANES' HOUSE - NIGHT

Lenny and Nathan, Rory's minders, pull up outside the Sloanes' house to 
have the weed analysed. For the first time it is revealed that Rory 
Breaker owns the Sloanes.

LENNY
Hold on!

NATHAN
What?

LENNY
something's not quite right here. Go in slowly, Nathan.

NATHAN
Fuck you funny man, you go first.

INT. SLOANES' SITTING ROOM - NIGHT

NATHAN
Shit!

Winston is tied up and squirming.

WINSTON
For Christ's sake, get us out.

INT. ED AND BACON'S HOUSE - NIGHT

EDDY
Well, not a bad day's work. That takes care of Harry.

Pushing a massive pile of notes to one side.

SOAP
What's left over?'

TOM
Hold on, give us half a chance to count it.

SOAP
What about all the gear?

BACON
'Ere, have a pull of this.

Passes Ed the joint.

EDDY
I don't want that horrible shit. Give it to Soap. Can we just lock up 
and get drunk now, please?

INT. RORY BREAKER'S OFFICE - NIGHT

We see Winston, Nathan and the torso of Lenny, standing in front of 
Rory Like naughty schoolchildren.

WINSTON
We had the gates up but they stuck a shotgun through. Poor bloody J got 
shot; it was a right mess.

The gravity and reality dawns on Rory.

RORY
It will cost you more than your life's worth if you jest with me.

LENNY
Some girl took one of 'em out, but he's a bit of a mess.

WINSTON
(proudly j
We shot one of them in the throat.

112

RORY
What do you want, a fucking medal? I'll shoot you in the fucking throat 
if I don't get the gear back.

He pauses, rubs his forehead and continues, slightly calmer. You shot 
the one that's in there now?

WINSTON

No, another one.

RORY
This is more like it. So where's he?

WINSTON
They took him with them; he was still alive.

RORY
Well, what did you shoot him with, an air gun?

There is an embarrassed pause and a look of `how did you know?' Rory 
doesn't need an answer and slaps his forehead.

WINSTON
We grow weed, we're not mercenaries.

RORY

You don't say.

There is a pause while Rory searches for the right words. The silence 
is deafening.

LENNY
(stupidly)
Who could it be? Where do we start, Rory?

Rory looks up amazed.

RORY
Mr Breaker! Today my name is Mr Breaker. You think_this is a 
coincidence? Not many, Benny! This white shite steals my goods and then 
thinks it is a good idea to sell it back to me. They got less brains 
than you, Lenny . . . Get Nick cum-bubble round here now if he is 
stupid enough to still be on this planet.

INT. DOG'S HOUSE - NIGHT

Dog has all his boys round.

DOG
I want you to search the house for bugs. I mean I want you to strip it.

JOHN
What is the point in that? Even if it was a bug they would have taken 
it with 'em.

DOG
It is too late for you to start thinking John. It is a possibility and 
that is good enough for me. And after you strip the house, I want you 
to get every thieving slag this side of Ceylon and torture them, badly. 
I want to know who is responsible, otherwise I will hold you 
responsible.

INT. JD'S BAR - NIGHT

All kinds of characters have made an appearance. A game of cards is in 
motion, the forfeit now being alcohol. Barfly Jack the barman is 
sitting at the table. They are already on the road to being comfortably 
comatose.

TOM
Rory Breaker?

114

BARFLY JACK
Yeah, I know Rory.

This next section is subtitled. This is to keep everyone, even those 
familiar with cockney rhyming slang up to speed with the narration, of 
which even Tom is unsure. As with the police scene earlier this is a 
voice-over and we cut to the relevant scenes.

BARFLYJACK
(voice-over)
Rory's got few interests in life; darky music, football, bees and honey 
and kicking the shit out of anyone that interferes with that shortlist. 
A few nights ago Rory's Roger iron rusted, so he has gone to the 
battle-cruiser to watch the end of a football game. Nobody is watching 
the custard so he has turned the channel over. A fat man's north opens 
and he wanders up and turns the Liza over. `Now fuck off and watch it 
somewhere else.' Rory knows claret is imminent, but he doesn't want to 
miss the end of the game; so, calm as a coma, he stands and picks up a 
fire extinguisher and he walks straight past the jam rolls who are 
ready for action, then he plonks it outside the entrance. He then 
orders an Aristotle of the most ping pong oddly in the nuclear sub and 
switches back to his footer. `That's fucking it,' says the man. Rory 
gobs out a mouthful of booze covering fatty; he flicks a flaming match 
into his bird's nest and the man lit up like a leaking gas pipe. Rory, 
unfazed, turned back to watch his game. The flaming man and his chinos 
ran outside to extinguish the flames, and Rory cheered on. His team won 
too, four-nil.

EXT.JD'S BAR - NIGHT

After a while Ed sees Daisy making a sneaky sharp exit and tries to 
pursue her, running out on to the street. Daisy is nowhere to be seen.

115

INT. RORY BREAKER'S OFFICE - DAY

Nick is blissfully ignorant of the situation. He is sitting in front of 
Rory.

RORY
Your one saving grace might be your stupidity.

NICK
(looking quite petrified)
Er.

RORY
Don't fucking er me, Greek boy! How is it that your so-fucking-stupid, 
soon-to-be-dead friends thought they might be able to steal my gear? 
And then sell it back to me? Is this a declaration of war? Is this some 
sort of white cunts' joke that black cunts don't get? 'Cos I am not 
fucking laughing, Nik-ol-as.

NICK
Er.

RORY
There are four interests I have, Nick. Football, music, money, and the 
annihilation of anybody who interferes with that shortlist . . . I know 
you couldn't have known my position because you're not so fucking 
stupid that if you did know, you would turn up here scratching your 
arse, with that `what's going on here' look slapped on your Chevy 
Chase. But what you do know is where these people live.

We look at the white faced Nick. He doesn't open his mouth. The penny 
has dropped.

If you hold anything back, I'll kill you. If you bend the truth, or if 
I think you're bending the truth, I'll kill you. If you forget 
anything, I'll kill you. In fact, you're going to have to work very 
hard to stay alive, Nick. I hope you understand everything

I have said. Because if you don't, I'll kill you. Now, Mr Bubble and 
Squeak. You may now enlighten me.

INT. DOG'S HOUSE - MORNING

Paul, John, and Plank are lined up like naughty schoolchildren in front 
of Dog, who is black-eyed and pissed off:

DOG
So we have a bit of a problem, don't we?

JOHN
Er well, yes we do.

DOG
In fact it is a little more than a bit of a problem, isn't it? You 
could say that in the scale of these things this is the Mount fucking 
Everest of problems, couldn't you? . . . And the reason it is such a 
mon fucking-strosity of a problem is because you don't have the first 
fucking idea who did this to us, do you?

PLANK
Dog, we have been up all night. It's no one round here! We have had 
them all against the wall.

JOHN
If it was a toe rag from the area we would know.

Dog starts slapping his troops round their heads.

DOG
You wouldn't know if it was the next-door fucking neighbours, you 
prick! You find 'em, you hear? And find 'em quick! Now get out and 
start looking! Out! Out!

Dog Loses his temper and throws Plank across the room. Plank's head 
breaks effortlessIy through the wall.

INT. ED AND BACON'S CUPBOARD - MORNING

A dust-covered Plank blinks in confusion as he looks on to a heap of 
recording equipment.

INT. JD'S BAR - DAY

Recovering from the night before.

BACON
Scarface, I have watched Scarface. You want to know how to do a drug 
deal, you watch Scarface!

EDDY
That inspires confidence, that does.

TOM
This guy Rory Breaker can afford to do the deal at the price we are 
selling. It's not worth him giving us trouble; he knows we would be a 
pain in the arse, and who wants a pain in the arse?

SOAP
I would take a pain in the arse for half a million.

TOM
You would take a pain ? the arse full stop.

SOAP
Tom, the fatter you get, the sadder you get.

EDDY
Jesus, would you two stop flirting for one minute . . . After we pay 
Hatchet, this deal puts us up near enough two hundred grand each. Not 
bad for a day's work, I think you will agree.

INT. SPLTT SCREEN. NICK'S HOUSE - DAY

A seventies-style split screen. A very shaky Nick answers his cartoon 
telephone.

DEAN
That's no way to answer the phone.

NICK
Is that you, Dean?

DEAN
Sure is.

NICK
What can I do for you?

DEAN
You know those shotguns I sold ya, well I need 'em back.

NICK
Not likely I am afraid; I don't think I'll be seeing them again.

NICK
I am sure you do, but I don't think you understand; I am not going to

We made a deal for everything inside the cabinet.

BARRY
Inside, out-fuckin'-side. I don't give a shit, you get those guns 
because if you don't . . .

DEAN
Yeah, Bazza, what?

BARRY
You heard of Harry Lonsdale? Otherwise known as Back-you-up with-a-
Hatchet Harry, infamous for his removal of digits?

Dean pauses for a while, a look of concern coming over his face.

Well this is `James Bond need to know' time. They're his! When you 
dance with the devil you wait for the song to stop, know what I mean?

Hatchet has had enough. He grabs the phone from Barry's hand, waving 
the infamous fifteen-inch big black cock in the other hand. Hatchet 
goes on to put the shits up the Scousers.

HATCHET
Do you know who I am? I am split in two; there is me, and there is my 
patience, and patience has gone to the hospital; you are not far 
behind, know what I mean? I mean, find ' em, torture 'em, kill 'em, and 
bring back what belongs to me, because if you don't . . . you are . . . 
bang . . . in trouble.

Hatchet slams the phone down. Dean looks at Gary in horror.

GARY
Who was that?

DEAN
That was Hatchet Horrible Harry.

GARY
Jesus, I have heard about him.

DEAN
We're in the spite. They were his fucking guns that we sold; we gotta 
find 'em.

Dean dials Nick immediately.

No fucking about, Nick; where can I find those guns?

INT. ED AND BACON'S HOUSE - DAY

Dog and boys have made a Large hole in the connecting cupboard wall 
which they have crawled through. Dog is holding a large bag which he 
has found.

JOHN
Dog, I have found the cash!

DOG
The stupid bastards! Count it!

JOHN
Shit, Dog, there's a lot. Don't you want to do this next door?

DOG
We're not going next door until we've flayed these dead men walking. 
Count it out the back. I don't want them seeing you fingering that 
money as soon as they walk in.

JOHN
But...
(interrupts)
Give it us here, you dozy sod. You hide and get the guns ready. Wait 
until they are well in, then give it to 'em.

INT RORY BREAKER'S OFFICE - DAY

Rory Breaker is amassing his troops and preparing to go round to Ed's.

RORY BREAKER
We are going to do a proper decoration job. I want the grey skies of 
London illuminated; I want that house painted red. Winston here is 
coming along, see if he can recognize any of 'em, then we bring what's 
mine back here. Watch out for these fellas; they've got a bit of 
arsenal and they don't mind using it. Now you know what you're doing, 
yes?

EXT. ED AND BACON'S HOUSE - DAY

Big Chris and Little Chris are waiting outside. Dog's gang are waiting 
for Ed's gang inside. Rory's gang are going to Ed's.

122

INT. RORY BREAKER'S VAN - DAY

Six heavy-looking black guys are loading their weapons.

INT. ED AND BACON'S HOUSE - DAY

Dog's gang are also loading their weapons and concealing themselves 
among the furniture. Dog is counting out the money in the side room and 
has the two antique hammer-lock shotguns resting on the table in front 
of him, which were found with the rest of the bounty.

EXT. ED AND BACON'S HOUSE - DAY

Rory's boys stop the van outside Ed's and back up to Ed's front door. 
The rear van door is opened when it is completely flush and Lenny (with 
gun) prepares to do his worst.

INT. ED AND BACON'S HOUSE - DAY

There is a loud bang and the front door disappears. In its place is a 
large black man pointing an even larger machine gun. Nobody seems to be 
at home; it appears to be quite an anti-climax. A long pause follows as 
both gangs don't quite know what to do. Rory's guys jump over the 
machine gun to explore further.

PLANK
(under his breath)
What the fuck is going on here?

Dog's lot are confused as to why these guys appear to have broken into 
their own home, carrying weapons of mass-destruction and looking to use 
them. We cut to a close-up of Plank's pov under the sofa. He can see 
numerous pairs of boots and they are multiplying. At last Plank can't 
take any more; his finger's shaking too much on the trigger. BANG.'

EXT. ED AND BACON'S HOUSE - DAY

We see the windows shattering from the outside as bullets hail through.

INT. ED AND BACON'S BACK ROOM - DAY

Dog, who was counting the spoils in the adjoining room, is more than 
aware of the seriousness of the situation. He quickly closes his 
suitcase of money and grabs the two old guns, opens the adjoining door, 
gets splattered in blood and smoke and quickly closes it. He then 
checks his escape route out of the front window and exits. Dog looks 
quite pleased with himself as he still has the money and his life, and 
is holding the infamous guns in each hand like a Mexican bandit.

EXT. ED AND BACON'S HOUSE - DAY

Big Chris, watching the house, intrigued and interested by all the 
activity, has made his way closer, and low and behold: looks what walks 
straight into him.

BIG CHRIS
Got something here for me, have ya?
(Dog is stunned by this)
Come on, chop chop.

Before Dog has a chance to use the shotguns Chris grabs one in each 
hand and knocks Dog down with a swift headbutt. Dog moans, not knowing 
what day of the week it is. Chris opens the case, sees it's full of 
money, takes the two shotguns, then leaves. Thank you very much.

On reaching the car he gives the case to his son, putting the guns on 
the back seat.

Count that son, and put your seatbelt on.

INT. SCOUSERS' CAR - DAY

DEAN
Follow that car, Gary; he's got the fucking guns.

INT. ED AND BACON'S HOUSE - DAY

Ed's place has been shot to pieces. Only Rory and Winston (in shock) 
seem to be left. Rory is throwing the bags of weed into the back of his 
van, then he kicks over one of the bodies. It's a blood-covered Plank.

RORY BREAKER
This is one of them.

Winston nods in confirmation.

Lucky, that.

Bang' Bang! Plank (to Rory's surprise) still had a loaded gun. Rory and 
Plank despatch each other simultaneously.

INT. ED'S CAR (MOVING) - DAY

Tom, Bacon, Ed and Soap look hung-over Ed is driving. 126

TOM
There's six black cocks sitting on the side of the road. How many beaks 
have they got between them?

SOAP
Six.

TOM
How many wings have they got between them?

SOAP
Twelve.

TOM
How many feet?

SOAP
Er, well, twelve.

TOM
That's right. So how many whiskers has the little white kitten got?

SOAP
How the fuck should I know?

TOM
How come you know so much about black cocks and so little about white 
pussy?]

The end of this joke is interrupted by a van swerving past them, 
dangerously close. The lads lodge a complaint and then they stop 
outside Ed and Bacon's so that they can pick up the money.

* Cut from completed film.

127

EXT. ED AND BACON'S HOUSE - DAY

BACON
What has been going on here?

They look into a smoking, blood-covered house.

SOAP
The money, the gear!

TOM
That's fucked it. What do we do now? No money, no weed; it's all been 
swapped for a pile of corpses.

SOAP
OK, don't panic; let's think about this.

EDDY
Bollocks! You can think about it for as long as you like. I am 
panicking and I am off mate.

INT. HATCHET HARRY'S OFFICE CORRIDOR - DAY

Big Chris is about to walk in to Hatchet's office. The door opens and 
out walks John O'Driscoll with a serious sunburn.

BIG CHRIS
Hello, John. Nice holiday?

JOHN O'DRISCOLL
I won't be seeing you again Chris; I have paid him every last penny.

BIG CHRIS
I am sure you have, no one was accusing you of being dishonest, John.

128

HATCHET
(off)
That you, Chris?

INT. HATCHET HARRY'S OFFICE - DAY

HATCHET
How did you get your hands on these?

He drops a vagina-shaped penis massager, realising that these are the 
guns he has been after. He then tries desperately to conceal his 
excitement.

BIG CHRIS
The boys had 'em. I know you like these things; wondered if you wanted 
them?

HATCHET
Er, yeah, sure, I'll have 'em.

BARRY
Was it any trouble getting the money?

BIG CHRIS
Well, not especially, but they seem to of upset a few characters.

HATCHET
Have you counted the money?

BIG CHRIS
Yeah, it's all there, to the pound.

HATCHET
They were going to pay, then?

BIG CHRIS
It looks like ?, but who knows? The opportunity was there. In my 
experience it is best to take the opportunity if it is there.

HATCHET
Good job, Chris.

Chris exits, pushing his wages into his inside packet. Harry is 
ecstatic about the guns and starts chuckling to himself.

EXT. HATCHET HARRY'S OFFICE - DAY

The Scousers watch Big Chris walk out of Hatchet's empty-handed

DEAN
We gotta get those guns.

GARY
This is dangerous shit, Dean; we don't even know who lives in there.

DEAN
Listen, I don't care who lives in there; all as I know it's got to be 
preferable to death by Hatchet.

GARY
Furry muff, let's go.

EXT. ED'S CAR (STATIC) - DAY

SOAP
I hope this is the right move.

EDDY
It's either that, my old boy's place, and we lose a digit daily. I am 
going to call him.

BACON
As if he'll care.

130

EDDY
He'll care all right. That was going to be his money. Whether he cares 
about us is different. Pass your phone.

BACON
Think about what you're going to say, Ed; we are on thin ice.

INT. HATCHET HARRY'S STAIRCASE - DAY

The two Scousers with guns in hand creep their way up the stairs. 
There's only one door in front of them. Dean gets ready to kick it 
open. Gary leans against the wall and delivers a Professionals-style 
kick.

INT. HATCHET HARRY'S OFFICE - DAY

Harry is in his offtce playing with his guns. The phone rings.

HATCHET
That you, boy?

EDDY
(on phone)
It's Ed, if that's what you mean.

HATCHET
It's pay day, ain't it?

EDDY
(on phone)
I wanted to talk to you about that.

HATCHET
I bet you did. I have got half a million nicker sitting in front of me, 
which means that some poor sod doesn't. You must have upset a few 
people, boy . . . but that isn't really my concern, is it? But what 
does concern me is the guns you had. I want to talk to you about that. 
Get your arse over here now, and I do mean now!

INT. ED'S CAR - DAY

Ed puts the phone down after a pause. His state of shock is obvious to 
the rest of the lads.

BACON
Well?

EDDY
Well what?

TOM
(impatiently)
Well, what did he say?

EDDY
He said he thinks we have paid him, and he wants to talk about those 
guns . . . now.

SOAP
You what? What are you on about?

EDDY
Listen, if he has the guns he might have the money . . . I think we 
should go and see him.

BACON
I think you're a sandwich short of a picnic, mate; you want to start 
making sense.

133

INT. HATCHET HARRY'S OFFICE - DAY

We cut to a time Lapse. Hatchet puts down the phone while resting his 
bum on the front of his desk. He is ecstatic with the guns. He loads 
and plays with them, aiming at imaginary moving birds.

The door is suddenly kicked wide open and, lo and behold, there is a 
Scouser standing in the door. Dean has a thousand ugly thoughts flying 
through his troubled mind, most of which are based an regretting the 
decision to kick this door in: `shit, what the hell is that, and why is 
he holding a shotgun'. Hatchet realizes that the man standing in the 
doorway (who is posed like De Niro in the poster of Taxi Driver, 
holding a gun in each hand) has nor come to deliver the mail. The pair 
are blissfully unaware that employee has met employer. Hatchet Harry 
has effectively contracted his own demise. The pause is eventually 
shattered by reality There is a rush to pull their individual triggers. 
There is a race between the two bullets to reach their prospective 
targets. Both barrels are emptied into Dean's chest. The Scourer is 
airborne by the sheer power of the cartridges. One of Dean's 
bullets,finds its way into Harry's shoulder. Gary can do nothing to 
stop this atrocity. He watches helplessly as his pal flies clean past 
him.

Overtaken by emotion or fear, Gary charges in, gun blazing, and 
proceeds to perforate Hatchet who is now unarmed. Hatchet flies over 
his desk. Gary comes into the room to finish the job and fires one last 
bullet into Hatchet, who is lying on the chair side of his desk. It is 
then revealed that Barry is sitting in his chair behind the door. The 
Scourer can't see Barry and Barry can't see Gary's face. Barry throws 
the hatchet that is sitting next to him in a butcher's block. It hits 
Gary in the back. Gary spins round firing wildly and lodges a bullet in 
Barry's stomach. It is then clear to them both that this has all been a 
terrible mistake.

BARRY/GARY
What are you doing here?

Then both collapse into dead lumps on the floor.

EXT. HATCHET HARRY'S OFFICE ED'S CAR - DAY

EDDY
You and me, Tom.

TOM
What do you mean, me?

They stand outside Hatchet's door and are just about to ring it when 
Tom notices it's open.

INT. HATCHET HARRY'S OFFICE - DAY EDDY

Oh Jesus, not again.

The two pause while they build their confidence. They enter Hatchet 
Harry's room. It's still smoky. There on the table is the money.

TOM
That's it, I am off.

Ed tiptoes over to the bag containing the money.

EDDY
Tom, this is our case.

TOM
. . . What?

EDDY
This is our money, Tom! . . . Now I think we should go.

Tom sees his guns. His eyes widen in surprise.

TOM
I'll meet you in the car. I am taking these guns.

136

EDDY
Tom, don't mess around, let's go.

TOM
I'11 meet you in the car.

EDDY
Tom?

TOM
I'll only be a minute.

EXT. HATCHET HARRY'S OFFICE/CHRIS'S CAR - DAY

BIG CHRIS
A job well done son; we made a few quid out of that one.

As he puts the key in the ignition, there is no reply from his little 
boy

BIG CHRIS
Son?

DOG
Made a few quid, did ya? Now where is it?

We can't see Dog but we can see the sharp side of a knife resting along 
the front of Little Chris's throat. The Dog is Lying down in the back. 
Big Chris assesses the situation.

BIG CHRIS
You all right back there, mate?

DOG
Very fucking funny. Where's what I want?

BIG CHRIS
It's in an office; I have just left it in the office. 137

DOG
Well, you had better go and get it from the office. That's if you want 
to see your son reach his next birthday. Now chop-fuckin'-chop.

BIG CHRIS
All right, furry muff.

Big Chris doesn't seem too bothered by this problem. He shrugs and 
starts the car.

DOG
What are you doing?

BIG CHRIS
Well, it's a five minute walk or a thirty second drive.

DOG
You had better be careful.

Big Chris starts his car up, looks across to make sure that Little 
Chris has got his seatbelt on and pulls out on to the road. He gets 
faster and faster until Dog pokes him in the shoulder with his knife. 
Chris pulls hard to the left and rams into the nearest parked vehicle. 
BANG' Dog goes flying forward, hitting the windscreen.

INT. ED'S CAR (STATIC) OUTSIDE HATCHET HARRY'S OFFICE - DAY

Another time lapse.

SOAP
Well, what's going on?

EDDY
I don't know, but what I do know is that there's no more Harry, which 
means there's no more debt, and if there's no more debt there's no more 
problem, and there's no more problem with our neighbours because they 
are all dead. I think, if I get this right, we haven't done anything 
wrong anyway, which means we are in the clear.

Bang! Big Chris's car hits them straight in the rear. The bag of cash 
goes flying through the car, landing on the dash. The lads are knocked 
unconscious.

INT. CHRIS'S CAR (NOW STATIC) - DAY

Big Chris, having removed the knife from a stunned Dog, proceeds to 
smash his head against the dash and has the most amount of fun in doing 
so.

BIG CHRIS
Never, never, not as long as I can remember has anybody been as rude to 
me as you have.

Dog is being thrown around like a rag doll.

INT. SIDE ROOM TO INTERROGATION ROOM - PRESENT, OPENING SCENE

We are looking through a two-way mirror.

SERG
Don't think I wouldn't like to get rid of you; but before I do, I need 
to know what's going on, Edward.

EDDY
If you think you're in the dark, I am in a black hole, blindfolded.

The camera spins round to see the traffic warden standing with a 
policeman. There is a long pause far consideration. Eventually he 
shakes his head.

TRAFFIC WARDEN
No, that's not one of them.

The policeman then knocks on the door.

INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY

The SERG looks round to see the policeman. They exit and Ed is left on 
his own. After a short pause the door bursts open.

SERG
All right son, you're outta here! And you want to stay outta here.

FADE IN TO BLACK.

FADE IN.

INT. JD'S BAR - NIGHT

All the lads are sitting in the bar. Ed is talking to Tom who is 
interested in whatever he has to say.

EDDY
The traffic warden went to the morgue and recognized Dog and his lot so 
that put us sort of in the clear. They got no case against us because 
there is no evidence against us.

BACON
Apart from those shotguns.

EDDY
And Tom took care of them.

Pause while Tom looks embarrassed about something.

SOAP
You did take care of the guns, didn't you, Tom?

Ed looks at Tom, who looks even more embarrassed.

TOM
I wanted to talk to you about that.

BACON
Well, talk.

TOM
Well not exactly, no; I got 'em sitting in the car, actually; I thought 
we might sell them back to the Greek, but I am having a bit of a 
problem getting hold of him.

BACON

You dippy bastard.

EDDY
The only item that connects us with the crime is sitting in your car 
which is sitting outside?

TOM
We paid seven hundred quid for those guns. They could hardly trace them 
to you, could they?

SOAP
I don't think we will take the risk for seven hundred quid.

EDDY
Tom, go and throw those guns off a bridge.

BACON
And, throw yourself off while you're at it. SOAP

Now, Tom! There is a pause.

ALTOGETHER
Now, Tom!

Tom leaves, looking a little sulky.

EDDY
The silly sod.

Big Chris walks in. He approaches the bar.

BIG CHRIS
JD.

JD
Chris.
(Pause)
You come to collect something, Chris? Should I have something for you?

BIG CHRIS
Nope.

JD
Can I help?

BIG CHRIS
I think I can help you, as it happens.

JD
Yes?

BIG CHRIS
I have got something for ya. Well, for your boy, actually.

JD
Well, I suggest you speak to him, then.

They all look rather shocked. He is carrying their bag and he places it 
on the table, which increases the shock factor.

BIG CHRIS
It seems that Hatchet under-estimated your lot and that seems to have 
cost him . . . I am not going to make the same mistake, am I? I have 
decided to bring your bag back.

Pause. The words you are looking for start with thank you.

EDDY
Thank you.

BIG CHRIS
Now you have presented me with a problem. I don't have an employer any 
more. So I have taken care of myself and my son, and if you think that 
is unfair you just come and pay me a little visit; but you better be 
waving the white flag high and clear, otherwise it will be the last 
little visit you lot ever make . . . That's all I had to say. It's been 
emotional.

Big Chris turns to walk out. The lads stare at the bag and then at each 
other.

EXT. JD'S BAR - NIGHT

Big Chris walks out into the street. We see a shiny new sports car. 
Little Chris is sitting in the passenger seat.

BIG CHRIS
That should take care of that lot. We are now officially in the money-
loaning business, all right, son?

LITTLE CHRIS
All right, Dad.

BIG CHRIS
Well, put your seatbelt on then.

INT. JD'S BAR - NIGHT

Ed goes forward to open the case. The rest are still in shock. Ed opens 
the bag.

EDDY
There's nothing in it!

SOAP
What do you mean?

EDDY
I mean it's fucking empty.

BACON  lunges forward and stares in. He sticks his hand in and extracts 
an A4 envelope. They look puzzled. Ed feels the package and starts to 
tear the top off. As this is done it creates a split screen.

On the other side of the picture, Tom is on a London bridge with the 
car boot open. He looks at the guns with regret and give them one last 
polish. Then he folds the guns up and places them on top of a handrail. 
Simultaneously Ed extracts a Sotherby's brochure on shotguns. They 
still look confused. They turn the brochure upside down and recognize 
the shotguns. Slowly they start to turn the pages.

Torn pushes the shotguns over the top rail: they fall. He starts 
walking but stops for some reason. He retreads his steps and peers 
over; the guns had just fallen on to a shelf.

Ed sees the price of the guns: a series of alarming zooms cut between 
eyes and prices. They panic and reach for their mobile phones.

Tom is climbing over the bridge now and has to hold on to the rail with 
one arm.

Ed starts screaming at the other two that the number is engaged and 
asks them to put their phones down.

Tom now had one hand on the guns and one on the rail. His mobile phone 
starts to ring in his top pocket; he has either to drop the guns or let 
go of the rail to answer the phone.

The shot freezes.

	EXT. TEXAS SCRUB -- DAY

	Two men in shorts and Hawaiian shirts are poking around a 
	sandy section in the middle of scrub flats. SERGEANT CLIFF 
	POTTS is in the f.g., a plant-and-tree guidebook in hand, as 
	SERGEANT "MIKEY" HOGAN works a metal detector over a large, 
	sandy bank in the b.g.  Both are Army career men with a 
	morning off to pursue their hobbies.

				CLIFF
		We got ocotillo, devil's walking 
		stick--what's this stuff--it's that 
		whattayoucallit--horse-crippler.

	Mikey bends to scoop something out of the sand, putting it 
	in a canvas bag slung on his hip.

				MIKEY
		This place is a gold mine.

				CLIFF
		Lead mine.

	MIKEY sees that Cliff is talking, pulls his headset off.

				MIKEY
		What?

				CLIFF
		It's a lead mine.

				MIKEY
		Right.

				CLIFF
		I don't know why I'm talking to you, 
		you've got that thing on your head.

				MIKEY
		You finding lots of cactus and shit?

				CLIFF
		It's not just cactus.  There's the 
		nopals, the yuccas--

				MIKEY
			(Puts headset on)
		Looks like a lot of cactus to me.

				CLIFF
			(Grumbles)
		Man knows a hundred-fifty varieties 
		of beer, he can't tell a poinsettia  
		from a prickly pear.

				MIKEY
			(Troubled)
		Cliff--

				CLIFF
		You live in a place, you should know 
		something about it. Explore--

				MIKEY
		Cliff--

	CU MIKEY

	MIKEY in the f.g. now, looking down at something as he pulls 
	his headset off again--

				MIKEY
		Cliff, you gotta look at this--

	Cliff wearily turns and approaches from the b.g.

				CLIFF
		Don't tell me--Spanish treasure, 
		right?  Pieces of eight from the  
		Coronado expedition--

	He stops by Mikey and looks down, his expression changing

				CLIFF
		Jesus--

	GROUND -- CU BONES

	Sticking out from the sand bank are the SKELETAL BONES of a 
	MAN'S HAND.  There is a ring on one finger.

				MIKEY (O.S.)
		Was Coronado in the Masons?

	EXT. ROAD -- DAY

	A distant cloud of DUST appears on the horizon MUSIC 
	underscores that we are in Texas, and we SUPERIMPOSE the 
	OPENING CREDITS as the dust takes form around an APPROACHING 
	CAR.  The car comes close enough to see it has a County 
	Sheriff's insignia on the side.

	INT. CAR

	We see SAM DEEDS, the Sheriff, driving. Sam is 40, quietly 
	competent to the point of seeming a bit moody. He sees 
	something up ahead.

	MUSIC, CREDITS END as Sam pulls off the road and we see the 
	sergeants standing in the scrub.

	EXT. SCRUB -- DAY -- BONES

	The hand and forearm down to the elbow of the skeleton are 
	visible now.

	WIDER

	Cliff stands looking at the arm with Sam. MIKEY is a few 
	yards behind them, playing with his metal detector. Beyond 
	him we see the Sheriff's car parked.

				SAM
		I was driving back from Apache Wells 
		when they got me on the radio.

				CLIFF
		This was a rifle range way back when. 
		But we figured it isn't Army land 
		anymore, it's your jurisdiction.

				SAM
			(Nods)
		I've got the forensics fella coming 
		down from the Rangers. No way to  
		know how old the body is without 
		some lab work.

				CLIFF
		That ring--

				SAM
		Masons been around a long while.

	Mikey has come up to them, still sweeping with the metal 
	detector.

				SAM
		Treasure hunter?

				CLIFF
			(Apologetic)
		Old bullets.  He uhm-- makes art 
		with them.

	Sam just nods. Mikey frowns, goes down on one knee and 
	scratches something out of the dirt at their feet--

				CLIFF
		The Sheriff says we shouldn't touch 
		anything,

				MIKEY
			(To Sam)
		He can't hear with that rig on-- 
		Mikey!

	Mikey comes up with something, holds it before them. An 
	encrusted piece of metal--

				MIKEY
		What've we got here?

	Sam takes the thing, lays it back down where Mikey found it.

				SAM
		S'posed to leave everything right 
		where we found it. They're real 
		particular about that.

				MIKEY
		The scene of the crime.

				SAM
		No telling yet if there's been a 
		crime.

	Sam frowns down at the piece of metal as he rubs the face of 
	it.

	CU METAL

	Sam's thumb wipes across the face of the encrusted metal. It 
	is roughly star-shaped.

				SAM (O.S.)
		But this country's seen a good number 
		of disagreements over the years.

	INT. HIGH SCHOOL CLASSROOM -- DAY -- TEXAS MAP

	We look at a beautiful old pull-down map of Texas.

				PILAR (O.S.)
		We do the best we can here--

	A teacher in her late 30s, PILAR CRUZ, steps in front of the 
	map and we FOLLOW her across the room, carrying a poster

				PILAR
		--but hey, public education these 
		days is a bit of a battleground.

	Posters hung on the walls beyond her show luminaries from 
	Texas history-- Sam Houston, Stephen Austin, Juan Seguin. A 
	new parent, CELIE PAYNE, stands in the middle of the otherwise 
	empty classroom.

				CELIE
		He went to school on base when we 
		were in Okinawa. It's all--you know--
		kids in the same boat--Army brats.

				PILAR
		His record shows that he's a good 
		student.

				CELIE
		I'm more worried about the social 
		thing. Are therelike--gangs, or...?

	PILAR starts to put the poster up. CELIE moves to hold it in 
	place for her.

				PILAR
		We haven't had any serious violence, 
		if that's what you mean. We've got a 
		pretty lively mix though--you walk 
		into the cafeteria and the Anglo 
		kids are in one section, the Mexican 
		kids in another and the Black kids 
		have a table in the back--thanks--

				CELIE
		So Blacks are--

				PILAR
		They're the smallest group except 
		for a couple Kickapoo kids. Look, 
		you're obviously a concerned parent. 
		Chet has no history of getting into 
		trouble--I'm happy to have him in my 
		class.

	She steps back to see if the poster, an old photo of Geronimo, 
	looks straight. Another teacher, MOLLY sticks her head in 
	the door--

				MOLLY
			(Uncomfortable)
		Pilar, is uhm--is Amado okay?

				PILAR
		Okay? He's not here?

				MOLLY
		No. Is he sick?

				PILAR
			(Mutters)
		He's going to wish he was dead.

	EXT. STREET -- DAY -- CU VAQUERO PICTURE

	On the door of a deluxe pickup truck is an airbrushed picture 
	of a Pancho Villa-looking vaquero with bandoliers crossing 
	his chest and a gun blazing in each hand. We hear LOUD MUSIC--

				AMADO (O.S.)
		Luis! Give me that Phillips-head 
		back--

	WIDER

	A small group of teenage Chicano BOYS hang around the truck 
	in the bed, on the hood, leaning against it. A BOOMBOX placed 
	on top of the cab blasts RANCHA MUSIC out at the neighborhood. 
	Somebody's legs are hanging out the open passenger-side door. 
	The kids suddenly look as a Sheriff's Department car slides 
	into the f.g.  A Deputy Sheriff, TRAVIS, gets out.

	KIDS

	Trying to look tough and unworried as we TRACK across the 
	street toward them. Travis's hand reaches out from behind 
	the camera to flick the MUSIC OFF.

	INT. PICKUP

	AMADO CRUZ, Pilar's 15-year-old son, lies on the front seat 
	installing a compact disc player into the dash slot. He 
	reaches up to the dash, can't find what he wants.

				AMADO
		Somebody hand me the CD player-- 
		damelo pendejos--

	He looks up and we TILT to see Travis leaning in the window,	
	examining the new radio

				TRAVIS
		They come a long way from those old 
		8-track jobs, haven't they?

				AMADO
		Something wrong?

				TRAVIS
			(Waves radio)
		This is stolen property. Alla you 
		fellas are coming down to the station.

	INT. CAFE SANTA BARBARA -- AFTERNOON -- ENRIQUE

	Sweat beads the forehead of a thin, tired-looking recent 
	immigrant, ENRIQUE, as he delivers platters of chile rellenos 
	to a booth. MEXICAN MUSIC plays on a jukebox in the b.g. We 
	HOLD on the booth, where HOLLIS POGUE, in his 60s entertains 
	two GOOD OLD BOYS--

				HOLLIS
		So Buddy walks up to the porch and 
		there's old Fishbait McHenry, cleanin' 
		the dirt out his toenails with a 
		pocketknife--he was the most hygienic 
		of all the McHenrys--

	The breakfast companions are laughing already--

				HOLLIS
		"Fishbait," says Buddy, in that quiet 
		way of his, "What you know about 
		them tires that went missing from 
		markets?" Fishbait thinks for a 
		minute, then he lifts up a loose 
		board from the porch floor and calls 
		down into it, "C'mon out, Pooter, 
		they caught us!"

				FENTON
			(Laughing)
		Buddy Deeds. He had a way.

				HOLLIS
		He known who it was onnacouna the 
		tire tracks in the dirt from the 
		back of the garage to where they 
		loaded up. "Old Fishbait," he says, 
		"never lifted a thing in this world 
		if there was a way he could roll 
		it."

	More laughter--

				FENTON
		Won't be another like him. That boy 
		of his doesn't come near it. You ask 
		me, he's all hat and no cattle

				SAM (O.S.)
		Fellas--

	We WIDEN to see Sam standing by their booth. No telling how 
	long he's been listening, Fenton is embarrassed.

				HOLLIS
		Sam! I was just telling a few about 
		your old man.

				FENTON
		He was a unique individual.

				SAM
		Yeah, he was that.

	We sense a little strain when Sam has to talk about his father--

				HOLLIS
		Big day coming up--I wish we'd have 
		thought of it while he was still 
		living. But he went so unexpected.

				FENTON
		Better late than never. Korean War 
		hero, Sheriff for near thirty years-- 
		Buddy Deeds Memorial P--

				SAM
		I heard there was a bit of a fuss.

				HOLLIS
		Oh, you know, the usual troublemakers. 
		Danny Padilla from the Sentinel, 
		that crowd.

				FENTON
		Every other damn thing in the country 
		is called after Martin Luther King, 
		they can't let our side have one 
		measly park?

				HOLLIS
		King wasn't Mexican, Fenton--

				FENTON
		Bad enough all the street names are 
		in Spanish--

				SAM
		They were here first.

				FENTON
		Then name it after Big Chief 
		Shitinabucket! Whoever that Tonkawa 
		fella was. He had the Mexes beat by 
		centuries.

				HOLLIS
		There was a faction pulling for that 
		boy who was killed in the Gulf War-- 
		Ruben--

				SAM
		--Santiago.

				HOLLIS
		Right. But nobody here ever noticed 
		him till they read his name on the 
		national news--

				FENTON
		They just wanted it to be one of 
		theirs--

				HOLLIS
		That's not the whole story. The 
		Mexicans that know, that remember, 
		understand what Buddy was for their 
		people.  Hell, it was Mercedes over 
		there who swung the deciding vote 
		for him.

	Sam looks to the register where Pilar's mother, MERCEDES 
	CRUZ, whacks rolls of change apart on the counter. She seems 
	to be avoiding looking toward him.

				SAM
		That so?

				HOLLIS
		She put it even at three to three, 
		so as the Mayor I get to cast the 
		tiebreaker. The older generation 
		won't have any problem with it. They 
		remember how Buddy come to be Sheriff, 
		that it was all 'cause he took their 
		part.

				FENTON
		Tell that one, Hollis--

				HOLLIS
		Hell, everybody heard that story a 
		million times.

				SAM
		I'd like to hear it. Your version of 
		it.

	Something about the way Sam says it puts Hollis on guard.

				FENTON
		Go ahead, Hollis.

	CU HOLLIS

	Hollis is hooked into it now--

				HOLLIS
		The two of us were the only deputies 
		back then me and Buddy--it's what--
		'58--

				FENTON (O.S.)
		'57, 1 believe--

				HOLLIS
		And the Sheriff at the time was Big 
		Charley Wade. Charley was one of 
		your old-fashioned bribe-or-bullets 
		kind of Sheriffs, he took a healthy 
		bite out of whatever moved through 
		this county.

	He looks down at the table--

				HOLLIS
		It was in here one night, back  when 
		Jimmy Herrera run the place.   Started 
		right here in this booth.

	We PAN down to the table, The food has changed. The tortillas 
	are in a straw basket instead of plastic. The jukebox changes 
	to ANOTHER SONG and the LIGHT DIMS slightly. A hand with a 
	big Masonic ring on one finger appears to lift a tortilla--
	underneath it lie three ten-dollar bills.  The hand lifts 
	them up and we TILT to see the face of SHERIFF CHARLEY WADE, 
	a big, mean redneck with shrewd eyes. It is 1957--

				WADE
			(Grins)
		This beaner fare doesn't agree with 
		me, but the price sure is right.

	WIDER

	Wade sits across from his young deputies, YOUNG HOLLIS (30s) 
	and BUDDY DEEDS (20s). A chicken-fried steak sits untouched 
	in front of Buddy. Hollis has the anxious look of an errand 
	boy, while Buddy is self-contained and quietly forceful for 
	his age.

				BUDDY
		What's that for?

				WADE
		Jimmy got a kitchen full of wetbacks, 
		most of 'em relatives. People breed 
		like chickens.

				BUDDY
		So?

				WADE
		I roust some muchacho on the street, 
		doesn't have his papers, all he got 
		to say is "Yo trabajo para Jimmy 
		Herrera."

	Wade folds the money and stuffs if in his pocket--

				WADE
		You got to keep the wheels greased, 
		son. Sheriff does his job right, 
		everybody makes out. Now this is 
		gonna be one of your pickups, Buddy. 
		First of the month, just like the 
		rent. Get the car, Hollis.

	Wade and Hollis slide out of the booth to stand.

				BUDDY
		I'm not doing it.

	Hollis stops a few feet away, shocked. Wade just stares down 
	at Buddy.

				WADE
		Come again?

	Buddy looks Wade in the eye, seemingly unafraid.

				BUDDY
		It's your deal. You sweated it out 
		of him, you pick it up.

				WADE
		There's gonna be some left over for 
		you, Buddy. I take care of my boys.

				BUDDY
		That's not the point.

				WADE
		You feeling bad for Jimmy? Have him 
		tell you the size of the mordida 
		they took out of his hide when he 
		run a place on the other side. Those 
		old boys in Ciudad Leon--

				BUDDY
		I'm not picking it up.

				WADE
		You do whatever I say you do or else 
		you put it on the trail, son.

	The CUSTOMERS are all watching now, nervous. Buddy thinks 
	for a moment, not taking his eyes off Wade.

				BUDDY
		How 'bout this--how 'bout you put 
		that shield on this table and  vanish 
		before you end up dead or in jail?

	Wade rests his hand on his pistol.  It is dead silent but 
	for the MUSIC on the box.

				BUDDY
		You ever shoot anybody was looking 
		you in the eye?

				WADE
		Who said anything about shootin' 
		anybody?

	Buddy has his gun out under the table.  He slowly brings it 
	up and lays it flat on the table, not taking his hand off it 
	or his eyes off Wade.

				BUDDY
		Whole different story; isn't it?

				WADE
		You're fired. You're outta the 
		department.

				BUDDY
		There's not a soul in this county 
		isn't sick to death of your bullshit, 
		Charley. You made yourself scarce, 
		you could make a lot of people happy.

				WADE
		You little pissant--

				BUDDY
		Now or later, Charley. You won't 
		have any trouble finding me.

	Wade feels the people around him waiting for a reaction.  He 
	leans close to Buddy to croak in a hoarse whisper.

				WADE
		You're a dead man.

	He turns and nearly bumps into Hollis. He gives the Deputy a 
	shove.

				WADE
		Get the goddamn car. We're going to 
		Roderick's.

	CU BUDDY

	He watches till the screen door shuts behind them, then 
	holsters his gun and begins to saw at the steak as if nothing 
	had happened. He calls softly--

				BUDDY
		Muchacho--mas cerveza por favor.

	He looks up at somebody and we PAN till we see Sam, still 
	standing over the booth, listening. We are back in 1995--

				HOLLIS (O.S.)
		"Mas cerveza por favor."

				FENTON (O.S.)
		That Buddy was a cool breeze.

	We PULL BACK to see Hollis and his buddies at the table, 
	eating their lunches as they listen.

				FENTON
		Charley Wade were known to have put 
		a good number of people in the ground, 
		and your daddy gets eyeball to eyeball 
		with him.

				HOLLIS
		We made our collection at Roderick's 
		place and that was the last anybody 
		seen hide nor hair of him.  He went 
		missing the next day, along with ten 
		thousand dollars in county funds 
		from the safe at the jail.

				SAM
		Never heard from him again?

				HOLLIS
		Not a peep. Buddy run the man out of 
		town.

				FENTON
		Buddy Deeds said a thing, he damn 
		well backed it up. Won't be another 
		like him.

				SAM
		So he arrested all of Jimmy Herrera's 
		people and sent 'em back to the other 
		side?

	Hollis sees what Sam is getting at, grins--

				HOLLIS
		Oh--he come to an accommodation. 
		Money doesn't always need to change 
		hands to keep the wheels turning.

				SAM
		Right.

				HOLLIS
		Look, I know you had some problems 
		with your father, and he and Muriel-- 
		well--

				FENTON
		Your mother was a saint.

				HOLLIS
		--but Buddy Deeds was my salvation.

	Sam nods, speaks softly--

				SAM
		Won't be another like him.

	EXT. ARMY INSTALLATION -- DAY -- CU DEL PAYNE

	COLONEL DELMORE PAYNE (DEL), a very direct, by-the-book Black 
	officer, addresses them. Artillery pieces angle toward the 
	sky behind him--

				DEL
		--it's an honor for me to assume 
		command of this unit, and I look 
		forward to working with all of you.

	OFFICERS Cliff and Mikey, in uniform now, flank SERGEANT 
	PRISCILLA WORTH, a Black woman in her early 40s, as they 
	stand in formation--

				DEL (O.S.)
		I'm sure you're all aware of the 
		Army's decision to close this 
		installation under the Reduction in 
		Force plan. That does not mean, 
		however--

	REVERSE

	We look over the shoulders of assembled OFFICERS and NCOs 
	toward Del.

				DEL
		--that we've been sent here to mark 
		time until we are absorbed by another 
		unit.

	CU DEL

				DEL
		You may have heard rumors that I run 
		a very tight operation. These rumors 
		are not exaggerated.

	INT. SHERIFF'S OFFICE -- AFTERNOON -- BUDDY PHOTO

	We are looking through a magnifying glass at an old photo. 
	Buddy's face is slightly distorted by the glass.

				SECRETARY (O.S.)
		Sam? I got Danny Padilla from the 
		paper for you--

	Sam sits at his desk in the Sheriff's office, looking down 
	at the photo--

				SAM
		Tell him I'll catch him later.

	CU PHOTOGRAPH

	An old photo of the 1957 Sheriff's Department officers on 
	the courthouse steps. Wade, Hollis, Buddy, a few others, all 
	in uniform.

				SECRETARY (O.S.)
		He says he needs to talk to you before 
		the ceremony, Sam.

	Sam puts a magnifying glass over the photo and bends close 
	to look.

				SAM
		Tell him to try me tomorrow.

	EXTREME CU PHOTO -- BADGE

	MAGNIFIED POV of the badge on Wade's chest swims into view. 
	A metal star. We hear the secretary getting rid of the caller.

				SECRETARY (O.S.)
		He thinks you're trying to duck  
		him.

	CU SAM

	Looking at the photo, troubled--

				SAM
			(Mutters)
		He's right.

	EXT. BIG O'S ROADHOUSE -- NIGHT -- NEON SIGN

	We start on a BLINKING SIGN--BIG O'S, then PAN to see a full 
	parking lot outside the low, neon-lit roadhouse. R&B MUSIC 
	blasts from inside.

	EXT. DOORWAY -- CHET

	CHET, a Black kid around 15, stands nervously at the door 
	building up his courage.  He takes a deep breath, plunges 
	in.

	INT. BIG O'S

	We TRACK with Chet, very nervous, as he makes his way through 
	the crowded roadhouse. The customers are all Black, many 
	from the nearby Army post, SHOUTING and LAUGHING over the 
	loud MUSIC. Chet, edgy, is looking for somebody.  He sees...

	CHET'S POV -- OTIS

	Seen through the crush is OTIS "BIG O" PAYNE, a large man in 
	his early 60s, laughing as he stands behind the bar.

	CHET

	He nervously puts his hand under his jacket. A gun? He pushes 
	forward to get a better view.

	CHET'S POV -- OTIS

	Moving in on him. Otis looks over, sees the boy, frowns--

	CHET

	Reaching under his jacket, he pulls out--a photograph. He 
	looks at it--suddenly there is a SCREAM from behind, then 
	GUNSHOTS, patrons diving for the floor.

	Chet whirls around and we WHIP PAN to see a young man, SHADOW, 
	emptying his pistol into RICHIE, a young soldier, as a young 
	woman, ATHENA, screams and tries to pull the gun away. With 
	the last shot, Shadow turns and heads for the door, but is 
	tackled and swarmed by angry men, SHOUTING.

	We PAN to Athena, kneeling over the bleeding, twitching body 
	of Richie--

	CHET

	Chet backs up, horrified. A large hand grasps him on the 
	shoulder from behind. He turns to see Otis standing over 
	him, strangely calm amid the chaos

				OTIS
		You weren't in here tonight, were  
		you?

				CHET
		No sir.

				OTIS
			(Points)
		Go out through the back.

	Chet hurries away.  Otis watches him for a moment, then turns 
	to the mess in his club.

	INT. AUDITORIUM -- NIGHT -- CU ANGLO MOTHER

	An angry woman stands from her auditorium chair--

				ANGLO MOTHER
		You're just tearin' everything  down!  
		Tearin' down our heritage, tearin' 
		down the memory of people that fought 
		and died for this land.

				CHICANO FATHER (O.S.)
		We fought and died for this land, 
		too!

	We WHIP PAN to see another standing parent--

				CHICANO FATHER
		We fought the U.S. Army, the Texas 
		Rangers--

				ANGLO FATHER (O.S.)
		Yeah, but you lost, buddy!

	We WHIP PAN to a man in the rear--

				ANGLO FATHER
		Winners get the bragging rights, 
		that's how it goes.

				PRINCIPAL (O.S.)
		People--people--

	WIDER

	We are in the High School auditorium, a hot-and-heavy teachers-
	and-parents meeting in progress. Pilar sits at the end of a 
	long table facing the agitated parents, taking some heat. 
	DANNY PADILLA, a young, long-haired reporter, sits in the 
	front taking notes, enjoying the show.

				PRINCIPAL
		I think it would be best not to put 
		things in terms of winners and losers--

				ANGLO MOTHER
			(Points at Pilar)
		Well, the way she's teachin' it has 
		got everything switched around. I 
		was on the textbook committee, and 
		her version is not--

				PRINCIPAL
		We think of the textbook as kind of 
		a guide, not an absolute--

				ANGLO MOTHER
		--it is not what we set as the 
		standard! Now you people can believe 
		what you want, but when it comes to 
		teaching our children--

				CHICANO MOTHER
		They're our children, too!

				ANGLO FATHER
		The men who founded this state have 
		a right to have their story--

				DANNY
		The men who founded this state broke 
		from Mexico because they needed 
		slavery to be legal to make a fortune 
		in the cotton business!

				PILAR
		I think that's a bit of an 
		oversimplification--

				ANGLO FATHER
		Are you reporting this meeting or 
		runnin' it, Danny?

				DANNY
		Just adding a little historical 
		perspective--

	REAR OF AUDITORIUM

	PALOMA CRUZ, Pilar's teenage daughter, peeks into the room, 
	then moves down the side toward the stage.

				ANGLO FATHER
		You may call it history, but I call 
		it propaganda. I'm sure they got 
		their own account of the Alamo on 
		the other side, but we're not on the 
		other side, so we're not about to 
		have it taught in our schools!

				PILAR
		There's no reason to be so threatened 
		by this--

	Pilar is trying to stay calm despite her anger.

				PILAR
		I've only been trying to get across 
		some of the complexity of our 
		situation down here--cultures coming 
		together in both negative and positive 
		ways.

				ANGLO MOTHER (O.S.)
		If you mean like music and food and 
		all, I have no problem with that.

	REVERSE

	We shoot past Pilar toward the parents in their seats. PALOMA 
	steps up to whisper to her.

				ANGLO MOTHER
		--but when you start changing who 
		did what to who.

				TEACHER
		We're not changing anything, we're 
		presenting a more complete picture.

				ANGLO MOTHER
		And that's what's got to stop!

	Pilar looks troubled by what she's heard. She shoots a look 
	toward the others at the table, then slips away with Paloma--

				TEACHER
		There's enough ignorance in the world 
		without us encouraging it in the 
		classroom--

				ANGLO MOTHER
		Now who are you calling ignorant?

				PRINCIPAL
		Folks, I know this is a very emotional 
		issue for some of you, but we do 
		have other business to attend to--

				CHICANO FATHER
		We're not going to get some resolution 
		on this?

	CU PRINCIPAL

	Weary--

				PRINCIPAL
		Would you people like to form another 
		committee?

	GROANS from the parents--

	INT. SHERIFF'S OFFICE -- NIGHT -- SHADOW

	Shadow, face bruised, hands cuffed behind him, is pushed in 
	through the door to be booked.

				SHADOW
		I hope the sucker does die, man! 
		Mess with me, that's what you get!

	Sam steps in behind him and meets his Chief Deputy RAY 
	HERNANDEZ, coming from the other direction.

				RAY
		Hospital says the other kid is in 
		bad shape--

				SAM
			(Glances ahead)
		The shooter local?

				RAY
			(Shakes his bead)
		Down from Houston. I think he knew 
		the girl before.

				SAM
		Okay--we'll take a statement from 
		all the GIs before they go back to 
		post. You can get the story from 
		Otis over at the club.

				RAY
		Any poop on the John Doe you found 
		out there today?

				SAM
		Nothin' much. The Rangers put Ben 
		Wetzel on it. Catch you later.

	As Ray steps out, Pilar looking distraught, walks into the 
	station, passing right by Sam without seeing him.

	CU SAM

	Wonders what she's doing there--

	SAM'S POV -- PILAR

	She stands by an unoccupied reception desk, very upset, unable 
	to attract anyone's attention because of the activity around 
	the shooting.  She looks tired and a bit scared under the 
	harsh overhead light.

				SAM (O.S.)
		Pilar.

	PILAR AND SAM

	Pilar looks around. Sam is standing by her. We can tell there 
	is some history between these two.

				SAM
		Something wrong?

				PILAR
		They've got my Amado.

				SAM
		Got him here?

				PILAR
		Somebody called--something about an 
		electronics store.

				SAM
		I'll see what's going on.

	He starts away, stops, comes back--

				SAM
		I was--I was real sorry about Nando. 
		He was a good fella. We haven't talked 
		since.

				PILAR
		We haven't talked since high school.

				SAM
		Yeah. I'll go check on your boy.

	Pilar watches Sam go--

	REAR OF OFFICE

	Travis sits typing away at a word processor as Athena, in 
	tears, gives testimony.

				ATHENA
		--so Richie just didn't say nothin' 
		'cause he didn't want to get into 
		it, see, and the next thing I know 
		there's shots and Richie is down. It 
		happened so fast--

				SAM (O.S.)
		Excuse me--

	We WIDEN to see Sam standing over the desk--

				SAM
		We got some boys you run in earlier 
		today?

				TRAVIS
		Yeah. I pulled the bunch that hangs 
		at Pico Bernal's place. We finally 
		caught them with something.

				SAM
		You got a juvenile with 'ern--Amado 
		Cruz?

	Travis looks at his booking sheets--

				TRAVIS
		Yeah--let's see--the other ones say 
		he wasn't in on the theft, he just 
		knows how to hook things up. We've 
		been trying to contact a parent.

	INT. JAIL HALLWAY

	Sam walks with Amado, who is trying to look defiant--

				SAM
		They tell me you're good at fixing 
		things.

	Nothin--

				SAM
		Your father was a hell of a mechanic.

	Still nothing--

				SAM
		You know, if you figure minimum wage 
		on the time most thieves spend in 
		jail, they could have bought most 
		everything they stole.

				AMADO
		I didn't steal anything.

				SAM
		I didn't say you did. My name is 
		Sam, by the way.

	Amado just gives him a look--

	INT. SHERIFF'S OFFICE

	Sam and AMADO step out into the office, where Pilar stands 
	waiting.

				SAM
		He's all yours.

				PILAR
		Are you okay?

				AMADO
		I don't know what the big deal is.

				PILAR
		You'll find out when I get you home. 
		Thanks, Sam.

				SAM
		No problem.

	Pilar yanks AMADO outside by his arm. She turns to shoot a 
	look back at Sam, then steps out through the glass door.

	CU SAM

	Watching her go--

				SAM
		Any time.

							 FADE OUT:

	EXT. OBSTACLE COURSE -- MORNING -- PIT

	We shoot up from a pit in the ground. WHUMP! WHUMP! WHUMP! 
	Three men leap over, landing on the far side and running 
	away from us.

	MEN

	Del Payne runs with Cliff and Mikey on a pathway along a 
	security fence, the two sergeants struggling to keep up, 
	occasionally vaulting or scaling some mild obstacle.

				MIKEY
		There's not that much down here, 
		Colonel. Big O's is the only place 
		in the county that our African 
		American soldiers are uhm--that they 
		feel comfortable in.

				DEL
		Have we had trouble there before?

				CLIFF
		Since I've been stationed here? A 
		fistfight now and then--

				MIKEY
		We had a kid pass out in the men's 
		room. The town isn't much.

				DEL
		They didn't come for a vacation.

				CLIFF
		Yes sir.

				MIKEY
		You know how it is, Colonel--first 
		time away from home, dealing with 
		new people--I remember my first hitch--

				DEL
		Substance abuse?

				MIKEY
		Well, yeah, but I went through the 
		Program. I haven't had a drink since--

				DEL
		I meant on the post. In general. How 
		are you dealing with it?

				CLIFF
		We throw a urine test at them once a 
		month. Random numbers, maybe a hundred 
		people at a time

				DEL
		Why don't we make it once a week for 
		a while?

				CLIFF
		No problem, sir.

	Del notices bow hard they are breathing--

				DEL
		I sprint the last quarter mile. You 
		gentlemen don't have to keep up if 
		you don't care to.

				MIKEY
		Appreciate it, sir.

	Del accelerates and we HOLD with the sergeants, slowing to a 
	near-walk.

				MIKEY
		Guy cracks walnuts with his asshole.

				CLIFF

		You get the feeling he doesn't want 
		to be here?

	INT. FORENSICS LAB -- VARIOUS SHOTS

	We hear Hank Williams' gospel song "I'll Have a New Body 
	(I'll Have a New Life)" as we see the gathered bones of the 
	skeleton tagged and photographed and measured, impressions 
	made of the dental work in the skull, photographs of the 
	excavation of the body at various stages marked with red 
	grease pencil, the piece of metal laid in a de-tarnishing 
	dish, the ring put under a microscope.

	CU METAL

	MUSIC CONTINUES as we TIGHTEN on the piece of metal, a pair 
	of tongs pulling it from the de-tarnishing solution. It is a 
	star-shaped badge, bearing the words "SHERIFF--RIO COUNTY."

	INT. COUNTRY AND WESTERN BAR -- AFTERNOON

	C&W MUSIC playing, the regulars starting to show up. Sam 
	makes his way to a table where BEN WETZEL, a Texas Ranger, 
	sits with a file of forensic reports.

				BEN
		Sam the Man.

				SAM
		Hey, Ben. Thanks for coming down.

	They shake, Sam sits.

				BEN
		How's business?

				SAM
		Business is booming. Got your drugs, 
		got your illegals--had a shooting 
		the other night at Big O's--Soldier 
		got ventilated.

				BEN
		I hear they're closing that post 
		down.

				SAM
		September '97, that's all she wrote.

				BEN
		Gonna pull a lot of jobs out of this 
		county.

				SAM
		Yeah, we'll have folks swimming over 
		to Mexico to work in the sweatshops.

	Sam looks at the folder of reports.

				SAM
		That the word on our boy?

				BEN
		Yeah, this is Skinny.

				SAM
		Skinny?

				BEN
		We find a body, it's either Skinny 
		or Stinky, depending on how much 
		meat there is on the bones.

				SAM
		Nice job.

				BEN
			(Opens folder)
		Male, 40 to 50 years old, five-foot-
		eleven, chewed tobacco--then we get 
		into the dental records--

				SAM
		Charley Wade.

				BEN
			(Nods)
		That badge--

				SAM
		--it didn't come out of a cereal 
		box.

				BEN
		Yeah.

				SAM
		You know the popular version of how 
		he left town.

				BEN
		Everybody on the border knows that 
		story.

				SAM
		You got a cause of death?

				BEN
		Skull was intact, no soft tissue 
		left--not much to go on.

				SAM
		So he could have gone out to the 
		base, hopped the fence, dug down 
		into the dirt on the old rifle range 
		and had a heart attack.

	Ben smiles, closes the folder--

				BEN
		You uhm--you remember what old Buddy 
		carried for a side arm?

				SAM
		Colt Peacemaker.

				BEN
		A .45--

				SAM
		He swore by it.
			(Ben frowns)
		What?

				BEN
		Just wondering.

				SAM
		So is Buddy on your short list?

				BEN
		If it was some poor mojado, swam 
		across at night, got lost in the 
		scrub and starved out there, we 
		wouldn't go any further. But this is 
		a formerly prominent citizen.

				SAM
		You got to investigate. No question 
		about it.

				BEN
		What I will do is keep names out of 
		it till we got some answers or hit a 
		dead end. You know how the press is 
		with a murder story--even if it's 
		forty years old.

				SAM
		Yeah, it's a pretty cold trail.

	They sit in awkward silence for a moment. Ben feels bad about 
	it.

				BEN
		I remember Charley Wade come to my 
		father's hardware store once when I 
		was a little boy. I'd heard stories 
		how he shot this one, how he shot 
		that one--man winked at me and I 
		peed in my pants.
			(Shakes his head)
		Winked at me.

	INT. CLASSROOM -- DAY

	Pilar stands at the blackboard by her outline of 19th century 
	Texas history.

				PILAR
		Okay, we have the fight against the 
		Spanish with bloody conflict for 
		dozens of years till they're finally 
		defeated in 1821 and Mexican 
		independence is declared. Anglo 
		settlers are invited--

	CU DRAWING

	Somebody making a skillful pencil drawing on the corner of a 
	sheet of lined notebook paper. A bald, muscular shotputter 
	after releasing the shot, his hand large in the f.g.

				PILAR (O.S.)
		--to colonize the area and by the 
		time they begin the movement against 
		Santa Anna they outnumber the Mexicans 
		here by four to one. The war between 
		Mexico--

	CHET

	Drawing intently. He takes the notebook and lays his thumb 
	over the corner.

				PILAR (O.S.)
		and the Anglo forces ends in 1836 
		with the formation of the Texas 
		Republic. Texas joins the United 
		States as a state where slavery is 
		legal in 1845--

	NOTEBOOK

	Chet "flips" the corner of the notebook and the series of 
	drawings he's made form a brief cartoon of the shot-putter 
	blowing his cheeks out and heaving the shot right past us. 
	Extremely well-drawn--

				PILAR (O.S.)
		after the so-called Mexican war and 
		then secedes to join the Confederacy 
		in 1861. The Confederacy is beaten, 
		and the Reformation period here is 
		marked by range wars and race wars--

	PILAR

	Looking out at the class--

				PILAR
		--and all this paralleled by constant 
		battles between both the Mexican and 
		Anglo settlers and the various Indian 
		nations in the area. What are we 
		seeing here? Chet?

	CHET

	Startled, he hides the notebook under his hands --

				CHET
		Uhm--everybody is killing everybody 
		else?

	EXT. LAKE -- DAY -- CU FISHING LURE

	A nasty-looking thing. Only a bass would want to eat this. 
	Hollis leans in to peer at the thing dangling before his 
	face.

	WIDER

	Hollis sits in the swivel chair of a bass boat tied to a 
	dock at the lake, going through his box of lures. Sam appears 
	on the dock and steps down.

				SAM
		I always wondered what you Mayors do 
		when you're not cutting ribbons.

				HOLLIS
		Sam! Hey podner! You caught me playing 
		hooky--

				SAM
			(Looks across lake)
		Floating around out here, playin' 
		hell with them bass--play a little 
		cards, play a little golf, drink 
		some beer--

				HOLLIS
		Sounds great. Where do I sign up?

				SAM
		I haven't been out here for a while.

				HOLLIS
		You go by your old house?

				SAM
		No.

				HOLLIS
		Just as well. The new people just 
		painted it some God-awful color--

				SAM
		We found a body out by the Army base 
		yesterday. Been there for a long 
		time.

	Hollis squints at a rubber lure, rejects it--

				HOLLIS
		Was it Davy Crockett or Jim Bowie?

				SAM
			(Smiles)
		You recall if Charley Wade was a 
		Mason?

				HOLLIS
		Charley? I believe he was. Used to 
		go for lodge meetings over to Laredo. 
		What's he got to do with your body?

				SAM
		All it was wearing was a big old 
		Masonic ring and a Rio County Sheriffs 
		badge.

	Hollis reacts. Sam puts a foot on the gunwale of the boat.

				SAM
		You don't remember anything else 
		from that last night you saw him, do 
		you?

				HOLLIS
		I told the story enough times--hell, 
		we were just in the car, he was 
		stewing about the fight with Buddy 
		while we drove over to Roderick 
		Bledsoe's--

				SAM
		Bledso

				HOLLIS
		He owned the colored roadhouse before 
		Big O--

				SAM
		He still living?

				HOLLIS
		No. I think his widow's still in 
		their place in Darktown, though.
			(Shakes his bead)
		You think it's Charley Wade, huh?

				SAM
		Forensics people are sure of it. You 
		have any idea who might have put him 
		there?

	Hollis makes a great show of considering--

				SAM
		Besides my father, I mean.

				HOLLIS
		There's no call for that, Sam. Fella 
		made himself a pile of enemies over 
		the years.

				SAM
		And Buddy was one of them.

				HOLLIS
		We got that dedication tomorrow. 
		This is a hell of a time to be 
		draggin' up old business.

				SAM
		People have worked this whole big 
		thing up around my father. If it's 
		built on a crime, they deserve to 
		know. Now I understand why you might 
		want to believe he couldn't do it.

				HOLLIS
		And I understand why you might want 
		to think he could.

	This is a low blow, but accurate enough to shake Sam.

				SAM
		Thanks for your time, Hollis.

	Hollis holds up a double handful of lures--dozens of rubber 
	and plastic worms and shiners and frogs and spinners--

				HOLLIS
		Look at all this, would you? My 
		tackle, the boat, all to catch a 
		little old fish just minding its 
		business on the bottom of the lake.

	He gives Sam a look--

				HOLLIS
		Hardly seems worth the effort--does 
		it, Sam? Sam walks away--

	INT. CLASSROOM -- ARMY BASE -- DAY -- CU ATHENA

	Athena stands at attention, trying to keep her composure--

				CLIFF (O.S.)
		So you knew this young man before?

				ATHENA
		From back in Houston. We both come 
		up on Fifth Street.

				PRISCILLA (O.S.)
		Did you know he was going to be there 
		last night?

				ATHENA
		If I had I wouldn't have gone in.

				PRISCILLA (O.S.)
		And you and Private Graves--

				ATHENA
		We were just dancing--

	WIDER

	Cliff leans against a desk, a blackboard covered with radar 
	diagrams behind him. Priscilla sits nearby, both of them 
	focused on Athena.

				PRISCILLA
		We're not running a dating service 
		here.

				ATHENA
		I know that, Sergeant. We were just 
		dancing. There was a bunch of us 
		there. Shadow just come down looking 
		for trouble.

				CLIFF
		It's not our job to get involved in 
		your personal life, but when it 
		interferes with the training here--

				ATHENA
		I'm sorry, Sergeant Major. There 
		wasn't anything I could do. Shadow 
		gets crazy--

	A silence as the sergeant lets her stew for a moment. She 
	works up her courage--

				ATHENA
		Sergeant Major? How is Richie doing? 
		Private Graves?

				CLIFF
		He'll live.

				PRISCILLA
		He'll be transferred to a military 
		hospital as soon as he's stabilized--

				CLIFF
		He'll probably be getting a medical 
		discharge--

				ATHENA
		Out of the Army?

				CLIFF
		He's going to lose a lung. This is 
		not good news for Athena--

				ATHENA
		Will this go on my record?

	Cliff considers for a long moment--

				CLIFF
		If the incident happened the way you 
		say it did, there hasn't been an 
		infraction.

				ATHENA
		Thank you, Sergeant Major.

				CLIFF
		You're dismissed.

				ATHENA
		Thank you, Sergeant Major.

	Athena steps out of the room. Cliff sits on the desk--

				PRISCILLA
		You spoil 'em, Cliff.

				CLIFF
		Hey--she's in a tough situation. I 
		cut her some slack--

				PRISCILLA
		But I'm the one in charge of her 
		sorry ass.

				CLIFF
		She's pulled herself out of a pretty 
		rough neighborhood.

	Crossing to the door--

				PRISCILLA
		And if she isn't careful she's gonna 
		slide right back into it.

	EXT. BLEDSOE HOUSE -- DAY -- ROCKER

	We start on a CU of a rocker creaking back and forth on an 
	old wooden porch. A WOMAN HUMS.

	MINNIE

	MINNIE BLEDSOE, in her 60s, sits on her porch in the old 
	Black section of town, playing with a Gameboy. She has very 
	thick glasses on. Sam walks up to her from his car--

				SAM
		Mrs. Bledsoe?

				MINNIE
		That's me.

				SAM
		I'm Sheriff Deeds--

				MINNIE
		Sheriff Deeds' dead, honey--you just 
		Sheriff junior.

				SAM
			(Smiles)
		Yeah, that's the story of my life.

				MINNIE
		You ever play one of these?

				SAM
		I've seen 'em.

				MINNIE
		Well, don't ever start up on 'em, 
		cause once you do you can't stop. I 
		tell myself I'm gonna play just three 
		little games after breakfast, and 
		here I sit with half the day gone.

				SAM
		You mind if I ask a few questions 
		about your husband? Roderick?

				MINNIE
		I won't say nothing bad about the 
		man, but you can ask away.

				SAM
		He had the club out on the old trail 
		road--

				MINNIE
		We run that twenty-odd years. Give 
		it over to Otis Payne in 1967. April.

				SAM
		So you must remember Sheriff Wade.

				MINNIE
		Not if I can help it.

				SAM
		You had to deal with him in running 
		the club.

				MINNIE
		Them days, you deal with Sheriff 
		Wade or you didn't deal at all. First 
		of the month, every month, he remind 
		you of who you really workin' for.

				SAM
		He squeezed money out of you?

				MINNIE
		Wasn't legal to sell liquor in a 
		glass back then unless you was a 
		club, see. Roderick used to say, 
		"Buy yourself a drink, you get a 
		free membership." But Sheriff Wade, 
		he could shut you down anytime.

				SAM
		And my father?

				MINNIE
		Sheriff Buddy was a different story. 
		Long as Roderick throw his weight 
		the right way on election day, make 
		sure all the colored get out to vote-
		we was called colored back then, if 
		you was polite--maybe throw a barbecue 
		for the right people now and then, 
		things was peaceful. That Sheriff 
		Wade, though, he took an awful big 
		bite.

				SAM
		People didn't complain?

				MINNIE
		Not if they was colored or Meskin. 
		Not if they wanted to keep breathin'.

				SAM
		Do you remember the last time you 
		saw him?

	Minnie thinks, puts down the Gameboy--

				MINNIE
		I seen him in our place the last 
		week before he gone missin'.

	We TRACK in to a close-up of her. R&B MUSIC FADES UP slowly--

				MINNIE
		He used to come in whilst we was in 
		full swing, make people nervous. Had 
		him a smile like the Grim Reaper--

						 DISSOLVE TO:

	INT. ROADHOUSE --

	The joint is crowded, people drinking, talking, laughing, a 
	few dancing, all trying to avoid locking eyes with Sheriff 
	Wade, who sits with his legs stretched out at a table.

	Young Hollis sits by him, smiling uncomfortably. Sax-wailing 
	R&B blasts from the jukebox. YOUNG OTIS, a slick, confident 
	character with straightened hair and a silk shirt on, in his 
	early 20s, stops to talk with a MAN on his way to bring a 
	tray with a couple beers and glasses over.

				MINNIE (V.O.)
		--just sit back with his hand on 
		that big ol' gun and act the kingfish 
		with everybody. Otis Payne had come 
		to work for us by then, and that boy 
		had him some attitude--

	CU WADE

	Watching Young Otis with narrowed eyes--

	CU WADE'S POV -- OTIS

	A man puts a slip of paper in Otis's pocket, pats his back. 
	Otis winks to acknowledge the bet, turns, makes eyes at a 
	PRETTY WOMAN sitting at the bar, who is eyeing him back.  He 
	lays the beers and glasses on the table, starts away.

				WADE
		Pour it.

	OTIS TURNS, CUPS HIS HAND AROUND HIS EAR-

				WADE
		Pour it.

	Expressionless, he starts to pour the beer into Wade's glass. 
	The Sheriff looks up into his face--

				WADE
		I know you?

				YOUNG OTIS
		Name's Otis.

				WADE
		Otis what?

				YOUNG OTIS
		Payne.

				WADE
		One of Cleroe Payne's boys?

				YOUNG OTIS
		Uh-huh.

				WADE
		I sent your Daddy to the farm once.

				YOUNG OTIS
		I know that.

				WADE
		Why you think that was?

	Otis feels people watching.  He doesn't want to lose face--

				YOUNG OTIS
		Some crop needed pickin' and the man 
		was shorthanded.

	A very insolent answer for the time and place--

				WADE
		As I remember it was because he had 
		a sassy mouth on him. Must run in 
		the family--You wouldn't be runnin' 
		numbers out of this club, now, would 
		you, son?

				YOUNG OTIS
		Runnin' numbers illegal.

				WADE
		Runnin' numbers without I know about 
		it is both illegal and unhealthy. 
		You remember that.

	The beer is poured. Otis starts away--

				WADE
		Whoah, son. You're not finished. 
		Pour his.

				YOUNG HOLLIS
		I prefer it in the bottle--

				WADE
		Shut up, Hollis. Pour.

	Otis meets Wade's look now, pours the other beer--

				WADE
		How come you don't took familiar?

				YOUNG OTIS
		Been away. Up to Houston.

				WADE
		Houston, huh? I hear they let you 
		boys run wild up there.

	No response. Wade deliberately pushes the glass away so beer 
	splashes on the table and drips into Hollis's lap--

				WADE
		Aw--look what you done now. Better 
		get something to wipe it up, son.

	Half the people in the room are watching now, the other half 
	moving away to relative safety. Otis tries to keep a lid on 
	his temper, looks around the room--

				YOUNG OTIS
		You spilt it, you wipe it up.

	Wade stands, steely-eyed, and looks at Otis nose to nose--

				WADE
		I told you to do something. Are you 
		gonna hop to it, or are we gonna 
		have a problem?

	Otis is starting to shake, but holds his ground--

				WADE
		Don't want to turn tail in front of 
		your people. I understand.

	He starts to turn away then WHAP! brings the butt of his 
	pistol up under Otis's chin, knocking him to the floor. A 
	woman SCREAMS and Otis, enraged, grabs the chair he has fallen 
	over, starts to get up--but Wade has the pistol levelled at 
	his face--

				WADE
		Come on, Houston, give it a try! 
		Come to Poppa--

	RODERICK is out on the floor now, hands held out in a gesture 
	of peace, as YOUNG MINNIE watches from behind the bar, 
	petrified--

				RODERICK
		Don't mind him, Sheriff. Boy's just 
		a bit slow, is all. He don't mean 
		nothin' by it--

				WADE
		That the problem, son?  You Slow?

				RODERICK
		Otis, apologize to the Sheriff--

	Otis eases the chair down but doesn't say anything--

				RODERICK
		You got him too scared to peep, 
		Sheriff. Maybe if you put that gun 
		up--

				WADE
		You telling me what to do, Roderick?

				RODERICK
		No, Sheriff, I'm just--

	Wade looks around, widens his eyes in mock surprise--

				WADE
		What's this I see? Is that whiskey 
		in them glasses on the Bar? Roderick, 
		I'm gonna have to cite you for a 
		violation of state law--

				RODERICK
		This is a club, Sheriff--you been in 
		here--

				WADE
		And people better clear out of here! 
		Now!

	A few people start for the exit.  Wade swivels and BLAM sends 
	a bullet past Minnie that shatters a crystal decanter behind 
	the bar.  People run for the door. Wade squats down to look 
	Otis in the face--

	CU WADE

				WADE
		You learn how to act your place, 
		son. This idn't Houston.

	He stands and we FOLLOW him toward the bar--

				OTIS (V.O.)
		'Course I was young and full of beans 
		then--

	The camera passes Wade and instead of Minnie there stands 
	Otis, PRESENT DAY, reminiscing. We are back in '95--

				OTIS
		I didn't understand the spot I was 
		putting Roderick in.

				SAM
		And that was the last time you saw 
		him?

	We SHIFT to see Sam sitting where Wade was headed--

				OTIS
		Oh--I think he came in one more time 
		with Hollis and--naw, your Daddy 
		wasn't with them. Made their monthly 
		pickup. Roderick wasn't in so I just 
		kept my mouth good and shut and handed 
		over that envelope.

				SAM
		That was the night he disappeared?

				OTIS
			(Shakes his head)
		Could of been. That was white people's 
		business.

				SAM
		And when my father was Sheriff?

				OTIS
		What about it?

				SAM
		What was your deal with him?

	Otis smiles, chooses his words carefully--

				OTIS
		Buddy was more a part of the big 
		picture--county political machine,  
		chamber of commerce, zoning board if 
		I kept those people happy, he was 
		pretty much on my side.
			(Smiles)
		Whenever somebody thought--they start 
		up another bar for the black  folks, 
		they'd be--how should I put this? 
		They'd be officially discouraged.

				SAM
		He ever accept cash for a favor?

	Otis smiles, looks away to ponder his response--

				OTIS
		I don't recall a prisoner ever died 
		in your father's custody. I don't 
		recall a man in this town--Black, 
		White, Mexican--who'd hesitate a 
		minute before they'd call on Buddy 
		Deeds to solve a problem. More than 
		that I wouldn't like to say.

	INT. CAR -- LATE AFTERNOON

	Pilar drives Amado and her daughter Paloma home--

				AMADO
		If you had your way I wouldn't have 
		any friends.

				PILAR
		Oh, come on, Amado--

				AMADO
		Just 'cause I'm not like Little Miss 
		Honor Roll here--

				PILAR
		Leave your sister out of it.

				AMADO
		You and all of the teachers in this 
		dump--your story's over, so you don't 
		want anybody else to have fun.

	We see on PILAR's face that he has scored--

				PALOMA
		You jerk--

				AMADO
		I'm not talking to you. You don't 
		have any friends.

	PILAR eases the car down San Jacinto street, seeing something 
	on the street and she's tuning her kids' conversation out--

				PALOMA
		Who'd want to be friends with that 
		bunch of pachuco wannabes?

				AMADO
		I don't pretend I came over on the 
		Mayflower--

				PALOMA
		And those stupid girls who hang out 
		with them--

				AMADO
		Just shut up.

	PILAR'S POV -- SAM

	Sam walks on the sidewalk parallel to them, talking with 
	three other MEN--

				PALOMA (O.S.)
		Joanie Orozco's telling the whole 
		school she's like desperately in 
		love with Santo Guerra.

				AMADO (O.S.)
		So?

				PALOMA (O.S.)
		It's pathetic. You can't be 
		desperately in love when you're 14 
		years old.

	INT. PILAR'S CAR

	Pilar is still looking fixedly out the window--

				PALOMA
		Not if you have half a brain in your 
		head.

				PILAR
		Of course you can.

				PALOMA
		What?

				PILAR
		It doesn't have anything to do with 
		being smart.

	EXT. SAN JACINTO STREET -- LATE AFTERNOON

	Danny Padilla is arguing with H.L. BRIGGS, a construction 
	company big shot, and JORGE GUERRA, a Council member in his 
	40s and Sam, as they walk down the sidewalk of the main street--

				JORGE
		What I'm saying is, I don't see the 
		point. You had your chance when the 
		dedication committee was meeting--

				DANNY
		I've got new information--

				H.L.
		It's ancient goddarn history, Danny--

				DANNY
		1963, they dam up the north branch 
		to make Lake Pescadero. A whole little 
		town disappears--

				H.L.
		Squatter town--

				DANNY
		People had been living in Perdido 
		for over a hundred years. Mexicans 
		and Chicanos are deported, evicted, 
		moved forcibly out of their houses 
		by our local hero, Buddy Deeds, and 
		his department--

				JORGE
		There was a bill from the state 
		legislature--

				DANNY
		Families were split apart, a whole 
		community was destroyed--

				H.L.
		They were trespassing, Danny--

				DANNY
		--and who ends up with lakefront 
		property bought for a fraction of 
		the market price? Buddy Deeds, Sheriff 
		of Rio County, and his Chief Deputy, 
		Hollis Pogue.

	They all look at Sam, who has been listening patiently the 
	whole while.  They've reached his office.

				SAM
		You finished?

				DANNY
		Look, I'm not after you, Sam.  I 
		just think people in town ought to 
		know the full story on Buddy Deeds.

				SAM
			(Nods)
		That makes two of us.

	Sam steps into his office, leaving H.L. shaking his head--

				H.L.
		You best be thankful that's the son 
		and not the father. Buddy woulda 
		kicked your ass from here to sundown.

	INT. HALLWAY -- DEL'S HOUSE -- LATE AFTERNOON

	We TRACK down a hallway as Celie walks toward us, calling 
	ahead. Chet stands in the middle of the hall behind her.

				CELIE (O.S.)
		I don't see what the big deal is. Go 
		back over, talk to the man, and bury 
		the hatchet, Del--

	CELIE passes us and Del crosses back in the other direction 
	from behind the camera, carrying boxes of their belongings. 
	We continue our SLOW TRACK forward--

				DEL
		Otis Payne was never embarrassed 
		about a thing in his life.

				CHET
		Dad--

				CELIE (O.S.)
		You were 8 years old when he left--

				DEL
		He didn't leave, he moved three houses 
		down with one of my mother's best 
		friends.

				CHET
		Dad--?

				DEL
		"Hey, Delmore, where's your Daddy?"

	Del disappears into the bedroom at the end of the hall--

				DEL (O.S.)
		Everybody else's business. And 
		everybody loved Big O--

	DEL comes back out, empty-handed--

				DEL
		Big O was always there with a  smile 
		or a loan or a free drink.

				CHET
		Dad, can I talk to you about track?

				CELIE (O.S.)
		People change.

				DEL
		Not that much.

				CHET
		Dad, I talked to the track coach--

				DEL
		I thought we already had this out?  
		Next year, if your grades are high 
		enough--

				CHET
		I have a B average.

				DEL
		How many B-average students do you 
		think they take at West Point?

				CELIE (O.S.)
		We're going to have to see him.

				DEL
		No, we don't.

	Del steps away past us, leaving Chet, defeated--

	INT. CAFE -- NIGHT -- ENRIQUE

	We start on Enrique, talking surreptitiously on the pay phone 
	on the way to the kitchen.

				ENRIQUE
		Sabado por la noche--Is, es el  mas 
		seguero--a cruzar por la  manana y 
		pues tendremos que esperar--[Friday 
		night--Yes, that's the safest--I'll 
		cross in the morning and then we'll 
		have to wait--]

	Mercedes bustles by, snapping her fingers--

				MERCEDES
		Off the phone, by we've got people 
		waiting. Andale!

	We FOLLOW Mercedes back into the kitchen, where she moves 
	through, kibbitzing the operation--

	WAITRESS

	Mercedes stops by a young girl prepping a pork loin to be 
	cooked. She isn't wearing gloves.

				MERCEDES
		Donde estan sus guantes? Tonta! Quiere 
		matar a mis clientes? [Where are 
		your gloves? Stupid! You want to 
		kill my customers?]

	She continues past, shaking her bead, bringing us to Pilar, 
	who is trying to stay out of the way--

				MERCEDES
		These ones coming up are getting 
		stupider every year.

				PILAR
		Maybe you're just getting less 
		patient.

				MERCEDES
		If they're going to survive here, 
		they have to know how to work, Elalco! 
		Adelante! Los clientes esperan!

				PILAR
		Well, you hire illegals--

				MERCEDES
			(Indignant)
		Nobody is illegal in my cafe! They've 
		got green cards, they've got relatives 
		who were born here--if they only had 
		a little common sense I'd be very 
		happy.

				PILAR
		If you spent a little more time 
		training them--

				MERCEDES
		Did you come here to tell me how to 
		run my business?

				PILAR
		No. I was wondering if you'd like to 
		take a trip down south with us. Maybe 
		see where you grew up--

				MERCEDES
		Why would I want to go there?

				PILAR
		Oh, come on--you must be curious how 
		it's changed. Amado is into this big 
		Tejano roots thing and I've never 
		been further than Ciudad Leon--

				MERCEDES
		You want to see Mexicans, open your 
		eyes and look around you. We're up 
		to our ears in them.

	Pilar gives up on the trip. She watches her mother poking at 
	the plates of chips and salsa ready to go out--

				PILAR
		Mami, how old were you when my father--

				MERCEDES
		He was killed.

				PILAR
		Right. When he was killed.

				MERCEDES
		A little older than Paloma is now.

				PILAR
		How come you never got married again?

	Mercedes just glares at her--

				PILAR
		There must have been somebody.

				MERCEDES
			(Mutters)
		I was too busy.

				PILAR
		Nobody's too busy.

				MERCEDES
		Maybe now. It was different back 
		then. I had this place, I was doing 
		all the shopping, all the cooking. 
		What do I need some chulo with grease 
		under his nails to drink up the 
		profit?

				PILAR
			(Pissed off)
		Thank you.

				MERCEDES
		I don't mean Fernando.

				PILAR
		Mami, the first time I brought him 
		home, those were your exact words-- 
		"some chulo with grease under his 
		nails."

				MERCEDES
		I never said that.

				PILAR
		You made it pretty damn clear you 
		thought he was nobody.

				MERCEDES
		I felt that you could do better for 
		yourself--

				PILAR
		What? Become a nun? You didn't want 
		me going out with Anglos--

				MERCEDES
		I never said that. It was just that 
		boy--

				PILAR
		"That boy"--Mami, say his name for 
		chrissakes!

	The employees are staring. Mercedes won't look at her daughter 
	as she steps out of the kitchen, banging into Enrique on his 
	way back in--

				MERCEDES
		You people are stealing my money-- 
		Entiende? Robandome?

	Mercedes is gone. The young girl, pulling plastic gloves on, 
	looks to Pilar.

				GIRL
		Su madre? [Your mother?]

				PILAR
		Si.

	The girl puts her hand on her heart in sympathy--

				GIRL
		Lo siento [My condolences.]

	INT. COUNTRY AND WESTERN BAR -- NIGHT

	A crowded room, C&W MUSIC plays on the box. Sam sits behind 
	a bottle of beer as the bartender, CODY, in his early 50s 
	philosophizes.

				CODY
		Now I'm just as liberal as the next 
		guy--

				SAM
		If the next guy's a redneck.

				CODY
		--but I gotta say I think there's  
		something to this cold climate  
		business. I mean, you go to the beach-
		what do you do? Drink a few beers, 
		wait for a fish to flop up on the 
		sand. Can't build no civilization 
		that way. You got a hard winter 
		coming, though, you got to plan ahead, 
		and that gives your cerebral cortex 
		a workout.

				SAM
		Good deal you were born down here, 
		then.

				CODY
		You joke about it, Sam, but we are 
		in a state of crisis. The lines of 
		demarcation has gotten fuzzy--to run 
		a sucessfull civilization you got to 
		have lines of demarcation between 
		right and wrong, between this one 
		and that one--your Daddy understood 
		that. He was like the whatchacallit--
		the referee for this damn menudo we 
		got down here. He understood how 
		most people don't want their sugar 
		and salt in the same jar.

				SAM
		You mixed drinks bad as you mix 
		metaphors, you be out of a job.

				CODY
		Take that pair over in the corner--

	Sam swivels to look where Cody points--

				CODY
		Place like this, twenty years ago, 
		Buddy woulda been, on them two--

	SAM'S POV -- CORNER BOOTH

	Cliff and Priscilla talk across a table--

				CODY (O.S.)
		--warning. Not 'cause he had it in 
		for the colored

	SAM AND CODY

				CODY
		--but just as a kind of safety tip.

				SAM
		Yeah. I bet he would.

				CODY
		Old Sam stood for somethin', you 
		know? The day that man died they 
		broke the goddamn mold.

	BOOTH -- CLIFF AND PRISCILLA

	Things are obviously more than professional between these 
	two--

				PRISCILLA
		So where does that put us?

				CLIFF
		Well--I don't see what's changed. No -
		PDA's, no necking on the obstacle 
		course.

				PRISCILLA
		Seriously.

				CLIFF
		Seriously, I think we should get 
		married.

				PRISCILLA
		We been through this before--

				CLIFF
		We should just do it.

				PRISCILLA
		And if I get a shot at a promotion 
		somewhere--

				CLIFF
		You could take it--

				PRISCILLA
		It's up or out these days, Cliff. 
		Say I get transferred to a different 
		post--

				CLIFF
		I'd quit the Army for you, if it 
		came to that.

				PRISCILLA
			(Grins)
		Man's gonna retire in two years and 
		he offer to quit. Big goddamn deal.

				SAM (O.S.)
		Excuse me--

	They look up to see Sam standing over them--

				CLIFF
		Sheriff--hi--this is Sergeant--this 
		is Priscilla Worth.

				SAM
		Pleased to meet you.

				CLIFF
		Sheriff Deeds was in on our 
		archeological find yesterday.

				PRISCILLA
		It true they gonna build a shopping 
		mall out there?

				SAM
		If certain people have their way, 
		it's going to be a new jail.

				PRISCILLA
		Damn. Maybe we got in the wrong 
		business. They closin' down military 
		bases left and right, puttin' up 
		jails like 7-11 stores.

				SAM
		Do either of you have any idea when 
		they stopped using that site as a 
		rifle range?

				CLIFF
		They stopped training infantry there 
		in the late '50s. It was just a 
		playground for the jackrabbits till 
		they gave it to the county last year.

				PRISCILLA
		You know who it was they dug up?

				SAM
		Not for sure yet. But I kind of wish 
		they hadn't.

	EXT. CAFE -- NIGHT

	Enrique steps out of the darkened cafe, followed by Mercedes, 
	who locks up. Mercedes steps over to an expensive-looking 
	car--

				ENRIQUE
		Es muy lindo, su coche--

				MERCEDES
		En ingles Enrique. This is the United 
		States. We speak English.

				ENRIQUE
		Is very beautiful, your car.

				MERCEDES
		Good night, Enrique. She slides into 
		the car--

				ENRIQUE
		Buenas noches, Senora Cruz. Enrique 
		walks in the opposite direction--

							FADE OUT

	EXT. BIG O'S ROADHOUSE -- DAY -- CU DEL

	Del, in uniform, approaches the front door of Big O's, not 
	open for business yet. We TIGHTEN as he stops to read a 
	handlettered sign next to it: "BLACK SEMINOLE EXHIBIT REAR 
	ENTRANCE." He steps in--

	INT. ROADHOUSE

	Late-50s R&B plays on the JUKEBOX. Otis stands behind the 
	counter hooking the beer taps up. Del steps in and sits on a 
	stool at the far end of the bar, tense, looking around the 
	place. When Otis sees him, he stops dead. They lock eyes for 
	a moment, then Otis turns to call.

				OTIS
		Carolyn--knock that off for a minute.

	CAROLYN

	CAROLYN SYKES, an attractive woman maybe ten years younger 
	than Otis, pulls the plug from the jukebox near where she's 
	scrubbing bloodstains off the floor. She turns to look at 
	the newcomer--

	BAR

	Del doesn't move to come closer--

				DEL
		Black Seminoles?

				OTIS
			(Shrugs)
		Hobby of mine. Got some artifacts, 
		couple pieces one of your men out at 
		the base made. Free admission.

	Del nods toward where Carolyn is mopping--

				DEL
		That where he was shot?

				OTIS
		That's where he fell.

				DEL
		You get much of that in here?

				OTIS
		It's a bar. People come together, 
		drink, fall in love, fall out of 
		love, air their grudges out--

				DEL
		Deal drugs in the bathroom--

				OTIS
		If I thought it would help I'd put 
		up a sign telling them not to. Right 
		under the one about the employees 
		washing their hands.

	Carolyn has come over by Otis, lugging the bucket and mop--

				OTIS
		This here's Carolyn. Honey, this is 
		my son, Delmore.

				DEL
		Nice to meet you, Ma'am.

	Carolyn nods, shoots a look to Otis--

				CAROLYN
		I'll be in back waiting for that 
		delivery.

	They wail till she is gone to start again--

				OTIS
		So.

				DEL
		So tell me why I shouldn't make this 
		place off-limits.

				OTIS
		This is an official visit, then--

				DEL
		I assume a lot of your business is 
		from our people.

	Otis pulls a tap back and it coughs before squirting beer.

				OTIS
		Your boys out there cooped up 
		together, need somewhere they can 
		let the steam out. If they're Black, 
		there's not but one place in this 
		town they feel welcome. Been that 
		way since before you were born.

				DEL
		We have an enlisted man's club at 
		the post.

				OTIS
		Well, you're the Man out there now, 
		aren't you? It's your call.

				DEL
		That's right.

				OTIS
			(Smiles)
		I been hearing rumors about this new 
		commander coming for a couple weeks 
		now. Boys say they heard he's a real 
		hard case. Spit-and-polish man. Full-
		bird colonel name of Payne, they say-- 
		Bet you never figured you end up 
		back here.

				DEL
		The Army hands you a command, you go 
		wherever it is.

				OTIS
		Right.

				DEL
		I hear things, too.  People call  
		you the Mayor of Darktown.

				OTIS
			(Shrugs)
		Over the years, this is the one place 
		that's always been there. I loan a 
		little money out, settle some 
		arguments. Got a cot in the back- 
		people get afraid to go home they 
		can spend the night. There's not 
		enough of us to run anything in this 
		town- the white people are mostly 
		out on the lake now and the Mexicans 
		hire each other. There's the Holiness 
		Church and there's Big O's place.

				DEL
		And people make their choice--

				OTIS
			(Smiles)
		A lot of 'em choose both. There's 
		not like a borderline between the 
		good people and the bad people--you're 
		not either on one side or the other--

	Del looks away, not wanting to believe this--

				OTIS
			(Softly)
		I gonna meet that family of yours?

				DEL
		Why would you want to do that?

				OTIS
		Because I'm your father.

	Del gives him a dark look and lets the statement hang between 
	them. He gets up and heads for the door--

				DEL
		You'll get official notification 
		when I make my decision. He is out 
		the door--Otis pulls himself a beer 
		as Carolyn steps back out--

				CAROLYN
		So that's him--

				OTIS
		Yeah--that's him. Got two, three 
		thousand people under him out there, 
		you count the civilians.

				CAROLYN
		That must be a laugh a minute.

	EXT. SAN JACINTO STREET -- DAY

	Sam walks down the main street of town. A CROWD is gathering 
	at the other end for the ceremony--

				H.L. (O.S.)
		Sheriff!

	We WIDEN as H.L. and Jorge catch up to him. H.L. slaps Sam 
	on the back--

				H.L.
		Historic occasion, isn't it?

				SAM
		Seems like we have another one every 
		week.

				H.L.
		Jorge and his Chamber of Commerce 
		boys got to keep things hummin'--

				JORGE
		We're building up tourism, Sam--

				SAM
		People come here to catch bass and 
		to get laid at the Boy's Town in 
		Cuidad Leon--

				JORGE
		Sam--

				SAM
		You ought to put up a banner--
		"Frontera, Texas: Gateway to Cut-
		Rate Pussy"--

				H.L.
		That kind of talk doesn't help, Sam.

				SAM
		Rather have that than the ten-foot-
		high catfish statue--

				JORGE
		I got Eddie Richter at the Sentinel 
		to kill that story.

				SAM
		The Perdido thing?

				JORGE
		He agreed it wasn't exactly news--

				SAM
		Danny's gonna be out for blood the 
		next time.

				H.L.
		Which is why we need to talk to you 
		about the new jail--just so we're 
		all on the same page.

				SAM
		We don't need a new jail.

				H.L.
		That's a matter of interpretation--

				SAM
		We're already renting cells to the 
		Feds for their overflow--

				JORGE
		There was a mandate in the last 
		election--

				SAM
		It wouldn't happen to be your 
		construction company gonna get the 
		bid on building this thing, would 
		it, H.L. And Jorge, you wouldn't be 
		thinking about a couple dozen new 
		jobs to dangle in front of the voters--

				H.L.
		Dammit, Sam, the people are concerned 
		about crime--

				SAM
		We need a drug rehab program, we 
		need a new elementary school--

				JORGE
		There isn't money allocated for that. 
		But a jail--

				SAM
		Look, I'm not gonna campaign against 
		your deal here, but if anybody asks 
		me, I got to tell them the truth. We--
		don't--need--a new jail.

				H.L.
		When we backed you--

				SAM
		When you backed me you needed  
		somebody named Deeds to bump the  
		other fella out of office.  Hey,  
		folks--

	Sam and the others smile as they reach the CROWD of 
	townspeople, mostly small business owners and retired people. 
	Photographers from the paper and a local TV news crew wait 
	by a veiled Statue roped off in a little traffic island. 
	Mercedes, dressed to kill, stands waiting next to Hollis 
	with a huge pair of scissors in her hand.

	CU MERCEDES

	Slowly working the blades of the scissors, she looks coldly 
	at Sam--

	CU SAM

	He nods to her as the crowd opens a path for him.

				SAM
		Let's get this thing over with.

	INT. MIKEY'S WORKSHOP -- MORNING

	We start on a two-foot-high statue of a cowboy made from old 
	bullets and shell casings. We PAN past a few others, the 
	poses lifted from Frederic Remington paintings, till we see 
	Mikey, gluing together a work in progress, a Remington book 
	propped open in front of him. Cliff sits at the worktable 
	playing absently with the old bullets spilled out from MIKEY'S 
	bag

				MIKEY
		Never thought I'd see the day a buddy 
		of mine was dating a woman with three 
		up and three down on her shoulder.

				CLIFF
		I think it's beyond what you'd call 
		dating.

				MIKEY
		You going to get married?

				CLIFF
			(Shrugs)
		Maybe.

				MIKEY
		You met her family? They gonna be 
		cool about you being a white guy?

				CLIFF
		Priscilla says they think any woman 
		over 30 who isn't married must be a 
		lesbian. She figures they'll be so 
		relieved I'm a man--

				MIKEY
		Always heartwarming to see a prejudice 
		defeated by a deeper prejudice.  But 
		marriage, man--I did two tours in 
		Southeast Asia and I was married for 
		five years--I couldn't tell you which 
		experience was worse.

	Cliff picks up a slug--

				CLIFF
		Hey, Mikey--

				MIKEY
		I knew she was Japanese going into 
		it, but she didn't tell me the ninja 
		assassin part--

				CLIFF
		Mikey--

				MIKEY
		Her parents acted like I was gonna 
		blow my nose on their curtains--

				CLIFF
		Mikey--

				MIKEY
		If I stayed out past ten with the 
		guys she'd go into her Madame 
		Butterfly routine--

				CLIFF
		Mikey look at this--

				MIKEY
		What--it's a bullet. I'm lousy with 
		bullets here.

				CLIFF
		It's a .45.

				MIKEY
		Yeah?

				CLIFF
		This is the stuff we picked up the 
		other day, right? The rest of this 
		is all .30 caliber--

				MIKEY
		They were using M-1's, yeah--

				CLIFF
		What's it doing on a rifle range?

	MIKEY holds the slug in front of his face--

				MIKEY
		We better call that Sheriff.

	EXT. SAN JACINTO STREET -- DAY

	Hollis is finishing his oration, having put the crowd in a 
	good mood.

				HOLLIS
		Sometime in the early '70s a reporter 
		from a national magazine was talking 
		to the governor of our Lone Star 
		state, and he asked him, "Governor, 
		what's your ideal of what a real 
		Texan ought to be?" Governor said, 
		"That's easy, son- you just go down 
		to Rio County and get a look at 
		Sheriff Buddy Deeds."

	Applause--

	SAM

	Watching the crowd--

	SAM'S POV

	We PAN with his gaze across smiling faces, till he comes to 
	Danny and a couple of Chicano friends, looking grim. We RACK 
	FOCUS beyond them to see Pilar, watching the ceremony from a 
	few yards back--

				HOLLIS (O.S.)
		Thank you. We've got one more person 
		to hear from--

	HOLLIS

				HOLLIS
		--and he's somebody who probably 
		knew Buddy better than any of us, 
		Sam--would you say a few words?

	SAM

	Not thrilled to be called on. He steps forward reluctantly 
	to APPLAUSE--

				SAM
		You folks who remember my father 
		knew him as Sheriff. But at home he 
		was also judge, jury

	He looks to Hollis--

				SAM
		--and executioner.

	LAUGHTER. Sam holds Hollis's eyes for a moment before 
	continuing--

				SAM
		This is a real honor you're doing 
		him today, and if Buddy was around 
		I'm sure his hat size would be gettin' 
		bigger every minute.

	PILAR

	Watching--

				SAM (O.S.)
		I used to come to this park to hide 
		from him. Now that you're putting 
		his name on it--

	SAM

				SAM
		I'll have to find someplace new to 
		duck out.

	More LAUGHTER--

				SAM
		I do appreciate it, and wherever he 
		is, Buddy's puttin' the beer on ice 
		for the bunch of you. Thank you.

	APPLAUSE--

	Sam steps back and Mercedes steps forward with her scissors 
	without looking at him--

				HOLLIS
		And now my fellow Council member and 
		one of Frontera's most respected 
		businesswomen, Mrs. Mercedes Cruz, 
		will do the honors for us.

	MERCEDES

	She freezes, smiling, till the still photographers have gotten 
	their shots, then snips the cord to a pulley system that 
	lets the cloth drop--

	STATUE

	The cloth drops to reveal a bas-relief in brass set in a 
	block of smooth limestone.  A decent likeness of Buddy in 
	uniform, his hand on the shoulder of a small Chicano-looking 
	boy who stands beside him, eyes raised worshipfully.

	APPLAUSE from the gathering--

	SAM

	Watching, a bit removed, as Mercedes shakes hands with Jorge 
	and H.L. and Hollis for the cameras. He overhears a pair of 
	BYSTANDERS who are checking out the statue--

				BYSTANDER 1 (O.S.)
		It does look like old Buddy.

				BYSTANDER 2 (O.S.)
		Runnin that kid in for loiterin'--

	The bystanders LAUGH--Sam steps away, intercepting Mercedes 
	as she steps away--

				SAM
		Nice to see you, Mrs. Cruz.

	Mercedes just looks at him, keeps going. His gaze brings him 
	to Pilar, standing on the sidewalk, watching.

	SAM

	Steps over from the dispersing crowd--

				SAM
		Field trip?

				PILAR
		Lunch hour. My next class isn't till 
		nine-thirty.

				SAM
		Want to take a walk?

	EXT. RIVERSIDE -- DAY

	Sam and PILAR walk together alongside the Rio--

				SAM
		Your mother still doesn't like me.

				PILAR
		I can't name anybody she does like 
		these days.

				SAM
		I see she built a place up here by 
		the river.

				PILAR
		A real palace. She rattles around 
		alone in that thing--

				SAM
		She's done well for herself--on her 
		own and all--

				PILAR
		So she tells me three times a week.

	She looks at him--

				PILAR
		I thought you got through that pretty 
		well.

				SAM
		They cooked the whole thing up without 
		asking me.

				PILAR
		People liked him.

				SAM
		Most people did, yeah.

				PILAR
		I remember him watching me once. 
		When I was little--before you and I--

	She shrugs.

				PILAR
		I was on the playground with all the 
		other kids, but I thought he was 
		only looking at me. I was afraid he 
		was going to arrest me--he had those 
		eyes, you know--

				SAM
		Yeah.

				PILAR
		Weird what you remember.

	They walk in silence a moment--

				SAM
		Your boy, there--

				PILAR
		Amado.

				SAM
		Nice-looking kid.

				PILAR
		He hates me.

				SAM
		No--

				PILAR
		With Paloma, it's more like she pities 
		and tolerates me- totally age-
		appropriate. But Amado--he's--he's 
		never been book-smart. Had a hard 
		time learning to read. Me being a 
		teacher and caring about those things 
		is like an embarrassment--like a 
		betrayal.

				SAM
		Fernando did okay, and he dropped 
		out--

				PILAR
		Fernando wasn't pissed off at 
		everybody. He just wanted to fix 
		their cars.

				SAM
		It might just be the age. I spent my 
		first fifteen years trying to be 
		just like Buddy and the next fifteen 
		trying to give him a heart attack.

	She looks at him--

				PILAR
		So why did you come back here, Sam?

				SAM
		Got divorced, I wasn't gonna work 
		for my father-in-law anymore. The 
		fellas down here said they'd back me--

				PILAR
		You don't want to be Sheriff.

				SAM
		I got to admit it's not what I thought 
		it'd be. Back When Buddy had it--
		hell, I'm just a jailer. Run a 60-
		room hotel with bars on the windows.

				PILAR
		It can happen so sudden, can't it? 
		Being left out on your own.

				SAM
		You've got your mother, your kids--

				PILAR
		They've got me. Different thing.

	They stop at a spot where you can climb down the bank--

				SAM
		Remember this?

	Pilar looks at the spot. She isn't ready to deal with whatever 
	memory it brings back--

				PILAR
		I should get back.

				SAM
		Pilar--

				PILAR
		Looks real bad if the teacher's late 
		for class. It's really nice to talk 
		with you, Sam.

	She waves and walks away, feeling awkward. Sam watches for a 
	minute, then turns and steps down to the bank, He looks at 
	the water.

	RIVER SURFACE

	A little piece of tree bark is tossed onto the water and 
	drifts away with the current. We TILT UP to see YOUNG PILAR 
	tossing bark into the river as YOUNG SAM sits on the bank 
	beside her. They are 14 and 15 years old--It is 1972--

				YOUNG SAM
		You going to tell her?

				YOUNG PILAR
		You going to tell him?

				YOUNG SAM
		He doesn't need to know all my 
		business.

				YOUNG PILAR
		He's gonna find out.

				YOUNG SAM
		So? What's he gonna do, arrest us?

	Young Pilar frowns, tosses more bark--

				YOUNG PILAR
		It's supposed to be some big sin, 
		even if you love each other.

				YOUNG SAM
		You believe that?

	CU YOUNG PILAR

	She turns to look at him--

				YOUNG PILAR
		No.

	We PAN with her gaze to see Sam, PRESENT DAY, sitting on the 
	bank, lost in thought--

				SAM
		Me neither.

	EXT. ARMY POST -- DAY

	Athena walking between buildings, looking a bit out of it. 
	Sergeant Worth cuts into her--

				PRISCILLA
		Private Johnson!

				ATHENA
		Sergeant?

				PRISCILLA
		Report to Dr. Innis at the clinic.

				ATHENA
		I'm feeling okay--

				PRISCILLA
		I'm very happy to hear that, Private. 
		Now you go put some pee-pee in a cup 
		for Dr. Innis and I'll be feeling 
		okay, too.

				ATHENA
			(Reacts)
		You're testing me?

				PRISCILLA
		You and one hundred nineteen other 
		fortunate individuals. Put it in 
		gear.

				ATHENA
		Yes, Sergeant.

	Sergeant Worth watches Athena go, suspicious--

	INT. SHERIFF'S OFFICE -- AFTERNOON

	Ray Hernandez and another DEPUTY guide Shadow back in from 
	the courthouse in handcuffs--

				RAY
		Excellent performance, my friend. 
		The judge was very impressed.

				SHADOW
		You don't need to cuff me.

				RAY
		You been talking so much trash today, 
		you made us think you're a dangerous 
		criminal. Be a good boy, now--

	They guide him past Sam's desk--

				SHADOW
		You're the one who's a good boy. Man 
		say "fetch" and you fetch--

				RAY
		Just doing my job.

				SHADOW
		White man just using you to keep the 
		Black man down.

				RAY
		This isn't Houston, my friend. We 
		pretty much running things now. Our 
		good day has come.

				SHADOW
		You suckers haven't had a good day 
		since the Alamo.

	Ray smiles, pushes him out--

				RAY
		Andale, amigo,

	We HOLD on Sam at his desk, TIGHTENING as he holds the .45 
	slug from the sergeants in front of his eyes--

				SAM
		Lupe? Get me the rangers up in Austin--

	INT. MERCEDES' KITCHEN -- NIGHT -- CU GLASS

	We hear old MEXICAN MUSIC. Ice cubes plunk into a glass.

	WIDER, MERCEDES

	Mercedes, exhausted from a day at the cafe, pours herself a 
	Scotch and soda--

	EXT. BACK PATIO -- NIGHT

	The back LIGHT is flicked on and Mercedes steps out with her 
	drink in hand, the MUSIC audible from inside. She sinks into 
	a recliner. We TIGHTEN as she closes her eyes. Something 
	RUSTLES out In the dark. Mercedes opens her eyes. There is 
	WHISPERING. Mercedes sits up and suddenly two MEN run past 
	the edge of the patio toward the front of the house. Mercedes 
	sighs--

				MERCEDES
		Otra vez los mojados--[Wetbacks  
		again--]

	Mercedes searches to find a portable phone on the patio table, 
	punches a number in--

				MERCEDES
		Hello? Border Patrol?

	EXT. SAM'S HOUSE -- NIGHT

	Sam, out of uniform, stands behind his little house chucking 
	fallen pecans out into the dark, thinking, listening to the 
	night sounds.

	CU SAM

	Working something out in his head. He looks off into the 
	dark and we PAN with his gaze--A MAN steps toward us, barely 
	visible in the darkness. It is Charley Wade--We're in Sam's 
	REVERIE, in 1957--

				WADE
		Who is that? Come out here where I 
		can see you!

	BLAM! A GUNSHOT, and Wade falls to his knees--

				WADE
		You sonofabitch--

	Wade falls on his face. A FLASHLIGHT BEAM flicks ON and plays 
	over his body. We PAN back along the be to see Buddy, 
	holstering his Pistol. He hears something, swings the 
	flashlight up.

	SAM

	We are back in 1995. Sam is blasted in the face with a 
	FLASHLIGHT BEAM--

				PATROLMAN (O.S.)
		Hold it right there! Brazos  arriba! 
		Sam, squinting toward the light to 
		see who it is, raises his hands over 
		his head--

				ZACK (O.S.)
		Get that thing off 'im! He's one of 
		ours--

				SAM
		Zack?

	The FLASHLIGHT BEAM PANS AWAY and ZACK POLLARD, a Border 
	Patrol agent, steps out of the dark to Sam--

				ZACK
		Hey Sam. Sorry 'bout that.

				SAM
		What's up?

				ZACK
		We had about a dozen wets come over 
		just upriver. They ran into one of 
		our posts--it was like a breakshot 
		on a pool table, illegals runnin' 
		every which way.

				SAM
		I haven't seen anybody come by.

				ZACK
		We'll get 'em--
			(Looks around)
		So you livin' out here now?

				SAM
		Yeah. It's quiet--

				ZACK
		I heard about that deal for your 
		father--You must be real proud.

				SAM
		Sure.

				ZACK
		The stories people tell, he was a 
		real colorful fella--

				PATROLMAN (O.S.)
		Zack! We got one!

				ZACK
		Well--back on the clock. You see any 
		of our neighbors from the south, let 
		'em know I'm lookin' for 'em.

				SAM
		'Night--

	Zack steps away.  Sam shakes the pecans still in his band, 
	goes back to chucking them--

	EXT. COURTYARD -- DANCERS

	Older CHICANO COUPLES dance to Mexican Music playing from 
	speakers set up in the apartment complex courtyard.  We TILT 
	UP to see Enrique watching from his window--

	INT. APARTMENT -- NIGHT

	MUSIC still blasting.  Enrique steps away from the window, 
	and sits on the bed of his drab furnished apartment. He goes 
	back to tying knots in a length of clothesline splicing it 
	to another. On the bed beside him are new flashlights and 
	the batteries, still in their packaging. He begins to coil 
	the rope--it is hundreds of feet long.

	EXT. FRONT PORCH, PILAR'S HOUSE -- NIGHT

	Pilar sits on her front Porch, listening to the MUSIC in the 
	distance. A woman singing a MEXICAN LOVE BALLAD. After a 
	while we hear Paloma open the screen door behind her--

				PALOMA (O.S.)
		Mom?

				PILAR
		Yeah?

				PALOMA (O.S.)
		You gonna stay out here?

				PILAR
		For a while.

	A silence. They listen to the RECORD--

				PALOMA (O.S.)
		What's she singing about?

				PILAR
			(Smiles)
		What do you think?

							FADE OUT

	INT. SHERIFF'S OFFICE -- EARLY MORNING

	Sam has been up since dawn, searching through piles of old 
	department records. Papers cover his desk and the chairs 
	he's dragged over next to it. He reads out loud himself from 
	a report in front of him--

				SAM
		First bullet entered beneath the 
		left eye, severing the optical nerve 
		and exiting from top rear of skull 
		causing tissue damage

	DOCUMENTS -- VARIOUS SHOTS

	As Sam reads, we see quick pops of various records-- 
	Certificates of death. An old Sheriff's Department payroll. 
	An autopsy report. Eviction notices.

				SAM (O.S.)
		--and severe cerebral hemorrhaging. 
		Second bullet entered left cheek  
		driving fragment of upper and lower 
		molars into base of skull. Third 
		bullet--

	Real estate transfers. A map of the Proposed Lake Pescadero. 
	Another autopsy report. A FAX COPY of the forensics dental 
	report on Charley Wade. Another autopsy report--

	CU SAM

	Intent as he pores over the paperwork--

	LEGAL PAD

	We TILT DOWN to read various notes Sam has written--Reynaldo 
	Garcia killed by Shf Wade--3/49 Hollis Kinney hired by Shf 
	Dep.--9/51 Lucas Johnson k. by Shf Wade--7/53 Horace Gaines 
	k. by Shf Wade--1/54 Santiago Huerta k. by Shf Wade--4/54 
	Rifle range closed--9/56 Eladio Cruz k. by Shf Wade--12/56 
	Buddy Deeds hired by Shf Dep.--2/57 Shf Wade disappears--
	3/57 $10,000 cnty funds missing Buddy Deeds new Shf

	We come to Sam's hand, writing, when it clears we can read 
	the last entry--

	Mercedes Cruz hired as cook, Rio Co. jail--4/57 ?????

	CU SAM

	Trying to put it all together.

	PETE ZAYAS, a skinny, older man in trustee's coveralls, 
	wanders in, emptying the trash baskets in the front office--

				PETE
		Morning, Sheriff.

				SAM
		Hey, Pete. How's it going?

				PETE
		Time marches on.

				SAM
		How much you got left?

				PETE
		Three months.

				SAM
		You stop growing that loco weed at 
		your place, you'd see a lot more 
		daylight.

				PETE
		It was for personal consumption.

				SAM
		You're going to smoke an acre and a 
		half of marijuana?

				PETE
		I got a bad stomach. It helps me 
		digest.

	Pete dumps out the basket by Sam--

				PETE
		Your father never bothered me about 
		it. Leastways not till the drug people 
		got on his back in the late '60s.

				SAM
		I thought he busted you a couple 
		times.

				PETE
		Different charge. I had a still. 
		Made my own mescal.

	Sam looks up at him.

				PETE
		That's how I ruined my stomach.

				SAM
			(Smiles)
		I'm surprised he bothered with it.

				PETE
		He was afraid I was going to poison 
		somebody. Your father tried to do 
		good for people--

				SAM
		So I've heard--

				PETE
		And your mother was a saint. That 
		summer I built the patio at your 
		house? She made me lunch every day.

				SAM
		Well, you were working there--

				PETE
		It could have just been a box lunch 
		from the jail.

	Sam looks up again, troubled.

				SAM
		You built our patio while you  were 
		on the county?

				PETE
		Out in the fresh air, nice gringo 
		lady making you pies--who's gonna 
		sit back in a little jail cell all 
		day? Sheriff Buddy, man. Como el no 
		hay dos. And after that cabron Charley 
		Wade--

				SAM
		I've heard Wade was a bit tough on 
		the Mexicans--

				PETE
		He murdered Eladio Cruz. That tough 
		enough for you?

				SAM
		Murdered him?

				PETE
		Chucho Montoya saw it with his own 
		eyes. Shot him in cold blood.

	EXT. SAN JACINTO STREET -- MORNING

	Ray Hernandez, heading in to work, comes upon Sam getting 
	into his car--

				RAY
		You're out early.

				SAM
		Yeah.

				RAY
		Haven't seen much of you at the jail 
		lately.

				SAM
		I been working on a few things.

				RAY
		Uh-huh.

				SAM
		I'm going over to the other side.

				RAY
			(Concerned)
		The Republicans?

				SAM
		No--to Mexico. I've got to talk to 
		somebody.

				RAY
		They got telephones.

				SAM
		Gotta be in person.

				RAY
		Oh.

	An awkward silence. Sam sits into the driver's seal and Ray 
	leans down to talk--

				RAY
		Sam? I--the Committee--you know Jorge 
		and H.L. and all--they asked me--

				SAM
		They want you to stand for Sheriff 
		next election.

				RAY
		Yeah.

				SAM
		You'd do a good job.

				RAY
		How 'bout you?

				SAM
		Don't know if I'll still want it.

				RAY
		I didn't want to be going around 
		your back.

				SAM
		I appreciate you telling me.

	Sam looks at his Chief Deputy--

				SAM
		You think we need a new jail?

				RAY
		Well, it's a complicated issue--

	Sam smiles, turns the engine on--

				SAM
		Yeah, Ray, you'd be a hell of a 
		Sheriff.

	EXT. SCHOOL -- MORNING

	Pilar sits with Amado on the football field bleachers before 
	school starts--

				PILAR
		I'm only going to have you for two 
		more years. If you decide not to go 
		on to college--

				AMADO
		I can't take any more school.

				PILAR
		--you're going to be on your own.

				AMADO
		So?

				PILAR
		So I'm worried about you. I don't 
		want you to end up in jail like your 
		friends.

				AMADO
		They're not going to jail.

				PILAR
		Don't try to con me, Amado. You knew 
		how they got all those things.

				AMADO
		Just some rich Anglo out on the lake. 
		Don't even live here all year.

				PILAR
		That makes it okay?

				AMADO
		They stole our land--

				PILAR
		Save your breath. That line doesn't 
		cut it with me.

	A silence. Amado sulks.

				PILAR
		How do you think you're going to 
		make a living?

				AMADO
		I can fix cars.

				PILAR
		You can fix old cars. Mr. Washburn 
		told me that the cars they're making 
		now are all computerized--

				AMADO
		You think I can't learn that?

				PILAR
		I think you can learn whatever you 
		want to. I just don't see you doing 
		it. If you want to settle for--

				AMADO
		I'm not settling for anything. I 
		like cars, it's just not a move up 
		the ladder to you, so you think it's 
		a waste.

				PILAR
		That isn't true.

				AMADO
		Oh, come on--you and Grandma think 
		anybody who works with their hands 
		is a peasant. When Dad--

				PILAR
		If you grew up to he anywhere near 
		as good a man as your father was, I 
		would be happy! I would be thrilled.

	They look, at each other for a long moment.

				AMADO
		It's my life. If I want to fuck it 
		up, that's my business.

				PILAR
			(Nods)
		I said pretty much the same thing to 
		my mother when I was your age.

				AMADO
		And what did she do?

				PILAR
		Two years at hard labor, Our Lady of 
		Perpetual Help.

				AMADO
		Catholic school, nasty.

	Pilar is nearly in tears.

				PILAR
		Honey, I think you're smart and you're 
		good and I love you. So don't act 
		like an idiot, all right?

	EXT. BORDER CROSSING -- DAY

	We see Sam's car roll through the "express lane" as other 
	cars in both directions stop by the inspection booths. Sam 
	drives across the bridge over the Rio--

	EXT. STREETS -- CIUDAD LEON -- VARIOUS SHOTS

	Sam drives slowly through the sprawling, more populous town 
	on the other side.  Lots of the streets are unpaved.  We PAN 
	with the car till we HOLD on ANSELMA, a country girl of 15, 
	aimlessly walking the streets--

	EXT. LLANTERIA (TIRE REPAIR SHOP) -- DAY

	We watch a KID about Amado's age pulling a tire off its rim 
	to put a patch on it--

				CHUCHO (O.S.)
		Over here we don't throw everything 
		away like you gringos do.

	CHUCHO AND SAM

	CHUCHO MONTOYA, in his mid-50s, stands by Sam drinking a 
	Coke as they watch the kid work.

				CHUCHO
		Recycling, right? We invented that. 
		The government doesn't have to tell 
		people to do it.

				SAM
		You own this place?

				CHUCHO
		This place, the one across the street, 
		four other ones around Ciudad Leon-- 
		soy el Rey de las Llantas. King of 
		the Tires. Lots of your people rollin' 
		back over that bridge on my rubber.

				SAM
			(Nods)
		You lived in the States for a while?

				CHUCHO
		Fifteen years in El Paso.

				SAM
		Made some money, came back here--

				CHUCHO
		Something like that.

				SAM
		You ever know a fella named Eladio 
		Cruz?

	CHUCHO smiles, draws a line in the dirt with his heel--

				CHUCHO
		You the sheriff of Rio County, right? 
		Un jefe muy respetado. Step over 
		this line.

	Sam obliges--

				CHUCHO
		Ay, que milagro! You're not the 
		Sheriff of nothing anymore- just 
		some tejano with a lot of questions 
		I don't have to answer.

	Sam smiles, plays with the line with his toe--

				CHUCHO
		Bird flying south-you think he sees 
		that line? Rattlesnake, javelina--
		whatever you got--halfway across 
		that line they don't start thinking 
		different. So why should a man?

				SAM
		Your government always been pretty 
		happy to have that line. The 
		question's just been where to draw 
		it

	CU CHUCHO

				CHUCHO
		My government can go fuck itself, 
		and so can yours. I'm talking about 
		people here--men. Mi amigo Eladio 
		Cruz is giving some friends of his a 
		lift in his camion one day--

	We PAN from CHUCHO to the FLAT TIRE on a battered old pickup 
	truck--

				CHUCHO (V.O.)
		--but because he's on one side of 
		this invisible line and not the other, 
		they got to hide in the back like 
		criminals--

	Eladio CRUZ, young and good-looking, squats into the shot to 
	examine the tire, jack in hand. It Is 1956--

				CHUCHO (V.O.)
		And because over there he's just 
		another Mex bracero, any man with a 
		badge is his jefe--

	CONJUNTO MUSIC comes from the truck RADIO. YOUNG CHUCHO steps 
	past Eladio--

				ELADIO
		Donde vas, Chucho, Tienes que quedar 
		escondido! [Shit, CHUCHO you got to 
		stay hidden!]

				YOUNG CHUCHO
		Voy a romper las rinones si no hago 
		pipi--[I'm gonna bust my kidneys if 
		I don't pee--]

	We TRACK back with Young CHUCHO to see we are at the side of 
	a dirt road on the scrubby flatland near the border. Eladio's 
	battered pickup truck has wood-slat sides and a canvas top. 
	Eladio begins to undo the nuts on the flat tire as Young 
	CHUCHO climbs down into a dry creek bed to relieve himself--

				YOUNG CHUCHO
		Los demas son tan espantados que 
		prefieran mojar sus pantalones. [The 
		other guys are so scared they'd rather 
		wet their pants.]

	CHUCHO tightens as he sees something, ducks down--

				YOUNG CHUCHO
		Mira, Eladio [Look!]

	We PAN to see the Sheriff's car approaching in a cloud of 
	DUST--

				ELADIO
			(Calling from where 
			he lies changing the 
			tire)
		Muchachos! Escondases! [Boys! Hide 
		yourselves!]

	INT. REAR OF TRUCK

	Eight illegal WORKERS hear this and lie down, pulling a canvas 
	tarp over themselves. We hear the CAR STOP behind them--

	EXT. ARROYO -- CU CHUCHO

	He makes the sign of the cross as he presses his back against 
	the dirt of the arroyo--

	ROAD

	Sheriff Wade and Deputy Hollis get out of their car and start 
	toward Eladio--

	ELADIO

	He stands, takes a deep breath--Wade steps up to him with 
	his hard-eyed smile--

				WADE
		Hola, amgio. Problemas de llanta? 
		[Hey, friend. Tire problems?]

				ELADIO
		No hay de que. Tengo otra. [No  
		problem, I've got another.]

				WADE
		What's in the back?

	EXT. TRUCK

	Young Hollis strolls around the truck as if he's considering 
	buying it.  He reaches in and flicks the RADIO OFF--

				ELADIO
		Not much, jefe. Some watermelons.

				WADE
		I heard somebody been haulin' wets 
		on this road.

				ELADIO
		I haven't seen anybody doing that.

				WADE
		This same person been bragging all 
		over the county how he don't have to 
		cut that big gringo Sheriff in on it--
		he can run his own operation 'thout 
		any help. Como se llama, amigo?

				ELADIO
		Eladio Cruz.

				WADE
		You know this road got a bad 
		reputation, Eladio--

	ARROYO -- CHUCHO

	Young CHUCHO pecks over the edge to see what's happening.

				ELADIO
		Reputation?

				WADE
		Bandidos, Injuns--

	CLOSER -- MEN

	Hollis wanders over to stand by Wade--

				WADE
		There's many an unfortunate soul 
		been ambushed out on this stretch. 
		Hope you're carrying some protection.

				ELADIO
		Protection?

				WADE
		You carryin' a firearm, son?  Don't 
		lie to me now.

				ELADIO
		Si--tengo escopeto--just a shotgun--

				WADE
		Just a shotgun, huh? Better let me 
		take a look at that.

	ELADIO opens the truck door and digs under the seat. Wade 
	winks to Hollis, then turns and BLAM! shoots ELADIO through 
	the head. Hollis jumps back startled and horrified--

				YOUNG HOLLIS
		Oh no--oh Jesus--oh my Lord--

				WADE
		Little greaser sonofabitch been 
		running a goddarn bus service. Think 
		he can make a fool out of Charley 
		Wade! Get them wets outta the back, 
		Hollis, see what we've got--

	CU CHUCHO

	Squatting in a ball to make himself as small as possible, 
	eyes covered with his hands.

				YOUNG HOLLIS (O.S.)
		You killed him--

				WADE (O.S.)
		You got a talent for statin' the 
		obvious, son Muchachos! Venga 
		afuera!Brazos arribas! [Come on out! 
		Hands up!]

	Young CHUCHO hears FOOTSTEPS approaching. We PAN as he looks-- 
	a man's BOOTS appear at the top of the arroyo. We TILT UP to 
	see a Sheriff, BACKLIT, then CRANE to see it is Sam, back in 
	the PRESENT looking over the site, troubled. His car sits on 
	the empty road behind him. He frowns, turns to go--

	EXT. PARK -- DAY -- PLAQUE

	Somebody has spray-painted "PERDIDO!" over the plaque of 
	Buddy and the little boy--

				HOLLIS (O.S.)
		Hooligans--

	WIDER

	Hollis and a couple of MEN from the Public Work Department 
	look at the damage.

				HOLLIS
		It happens again, we build a fence 
		around it.

	INT. CAFE -- DAY

	Enrique steels himself, trying to cover his nerves. We CROSS 
	with him to a booth.

				ZACK
		Podemos ganar muchas batallas pero 
		la guerra ya es perdido--[We can win 
		a lot of battles but the war's already 
		been lost--]

	Zack and another BORDER PATROLMAN look up at him--

	CU ENRIQUE

	Eyes glued to his notepad--

				ENRIQUE
		You wan' something to drink?

	EXT. ROADSIDE STAND -- DAY -- CU CATTLE SKULL

	A Georgia O'Keefe-looking cattle skull sits on a pedestal 
	against the Western sky--

				WESLEY (O.S.)
		The longhorns go for ten times the 
		price--

	We WIDEN as the skull is lifted by WESLEY BIRDSONG, a Native 
	American man in his 70s who wears extremely thick glasses. 
	Sam tags along as the old man rearranges the display of Texas 
	curios laid out in front of his trailer. Empty scrubland 
	surrounds them.

				WESLEY
		--but longhorns are hard to come by 
		these days.

				SAM
		You sell much out here?

				WESLEY
		How am I gonna sell things if nobody 
		comes by? This stretch of road runs 
		between Nowheres and Nothin' Much.

				SAM
		Hell of a spot to put a business.

				WESLEY
		But you don't see much competition, 
		do you?

	He winks at Sam, picks up a wooden radio carved to resemble 
	the Alamo--

				WESLEY
		These things used to sell like 
		hotcakes. Now, if it can't play those 
		discs, they won't look at it.

	He puts the radio on, looks out at the emptiness around--

				WESLEY
		I like it here. Once I tried going 
		onto that reservation to live. 
		Couldn't take the politics. Damn 
		Indian'll drive you crazy with that, 
		Now your father--this wasn't what he 
		had in mind at all. He come out of 
		Korea, he had this Chevy with too 
		much engine in it. He'd come roarin' 
		up and down this road all hours of 
		the day and night,looking for somebody 
		to race.

	He lifts a jar with a leathery brown thing in it--

				WESLEY
		Buffalo chips. Fella in Santa Fe 
		told me he sells these as fast as 
		the buffalo can squeeze 'em out.

				SAM
		So when did Buddy leave?

				WESLEY
		For Frontera? Hell, I can't remember 
		dates no more. I do recall it was 
		after an affair of the heart had 
		gone sour on him. He almost took 
		some poor fella's head off at the 
		Legion in Arroyo Grande, and figured 
		it was time to move on.

				SAM
		You think he killed anybody in Korea?

				WESLEY
		They don't hand those medals out for 
		hidin'in your foxhole. Would you buy 
		this?

				SAM
		No--

				WESLEY
		Me neither.

	He searches for something among the curios--

				WESLEY
		If he hadn't found that Deputy job, 
		I believe Buddy might've gone down 
		the other path, got into some serious 
		trouble. Settled him right down. 
		That and your mother. 'Course he had 
		that other one later.

				SAM
		Another woman?

				WESLEY
		Your mother wasn't one to get chased 
		off her patch. Half the damn county 
		knew and nobody thought the worse of 
		her for seein' it through.

				SAM
		You know who it was?

				WESLEY
		The other one? Hell, at my age, every 
		time you learn a new name you got to 
		forget an old one. Your head's all 
		crowded up--here it is--

	Wesley stretches out a four-foot rattlesnake skin, rattles 
	still attached--

				WESLEY
		This big fella was sleepin' in a 
		crate at Cisco's junkyard right when 
		I looked to see what was in it. Jumped 
		up at my face--scared me so bad I 
		killed him without thinkin'.

	He shakes the rattles at Sam--

				WESLEY
		Gotta be careful where you're pokin'--
		who knows what you'll find.

	INT. SCHOOL HALLWAY -- DAY

	PILAR talks with Molly as they near the administration office--

				PILAR
		I don't think you can take it 
		personally--

				MOLLY
		I'd like to see them spend a day 
		pulling 14-year-olds off of each 
		other--I should get combat pay--

		See you, Molly.

	INT. OFFICE

	PILAR crosses past the principal's secretary, MARISOL--

				MARISOL
		Steve called for you.

				PILAR
		Steve?

				MARISOL
		Steve. Board of Education Steve who 
		likes you? He goes for us hot-blooded 
		Mexican girls, I can tell.

				PILAR
		Spanish, please. My mother would 
		have a heart attack.

				MARISOL
		Your mother's family is Spanish?

				PILAR
		Sure, they go back to Cortez. When 
		he rode by, they were squatting in a 
		hut cooking hamsters for dinner.

				MARISOL
		You got to be interested in somebody. 
		All you do is work.

				PILAR
		All my mother does is work. That's 
		how you get to be Spanish.

				MARISOL
		How 'bout the Sheriff?

				PILAR
		The Sheriff.

				MARISOL
		The old-high-school-heartthrob 
		Sheriff. I thought you were crazy 
		about each other. He's available, 
		you're available--

				PILAR
		I'm unmarried. I'm not available.

				MARISOL
		You told me one time it was true 
		love.

	PILAR takes the pile of mimeos and mail from her slot and 
	turns to go--

				PILAR
			(Mutters)
		Nobody stays in love for twenty-three 
		years.

	EXT. DRIVE-IN MOVIE -- NIGHT

	It is 1972. An early-'70s cheezy action picture (Filipino 
	women-in-chains or biker flick is playing. We TILT DOWN to a 
	man's BOOTS crunching across the gravel of the parking area. 
	Now and then, the man turns a FLASHLIGHT BEAM on a license 
	plate. The cars are all pre-'72, lots of pickups, and the 
	patrons are almost all TEENAGERS. Some have turned their 
	pickups around to sit on the tailgate and watch, while others 
	have set lawn furniture out to sit on. We TILT UP slightly 
	to see the glint of a Rio County Sheriff's badge pinned on 
	the man's shirt. He meets a DEPUTY coming in the other 
	direction. Both train their FLASHLIGHTS on the license of 
	the car we see in the b.g. between them.  We TILT and RACK 
	to see that nobody is visible through the window--

				BUDDY (O.S.)
		Let's go.

	We FOLLOW Buddy up to the driver's side of the car as the 
	Deputy goes to the passenger side. We PAN with Buddy's hand 
	down to the door handle--he grabs it, flings it open--the 
	overhead LIGHT flicks ON and there lie YOUNG SAM and PILAR, 
	teenagers, half their clothes off and just about to close 
	the deal. PILAR SCREAMS and the Deputy throws the door open 
	by their heads--

				BUDDY
		Goddammit!

	Buddy grabs Sam's ankles and yanks him out of the car onto 
	the ground as the Deputy awkwardly pulls PILAR, out the other 
	side--

				YOUNG SAM
		What the hell are you doing? You 
		fucking asshole!

				BUDDY
		How old is that girl? Goddammit, 
		where's your goddam sense?

				YOUNG PILAR (O.S.)
		Let me go!  Pendejo!

				YOUNG HOLLIS (O.S.)
		Come on now, Missy, get your clothes 
		in order--

	Sam is trying to kick and punch at his father, pausing in 
	between to pull his pants up. People are BOOING and HONKING 
	their HORNS all around--

				YOUNG SAM
		You got no fuckin' right! You stay 
		out of my fuckin' life!

				BUDDY
		Gimme the keys--gimme the goddamn 
		car keys, son--

				YOUNG HOLLIS (O.S.)
		What am I s'posed to do with her, 
		Buddy?

				BUDDY
		You drive her home and tell her mother 
		where we found her--

				YOUNG PILAR (O.S.)
		Sam!

	The kids are dragged forward into the HEADLIGHTS that are 
	being turned on to see what the ruckus is. Both are crying, 
	struggling--

				YOUNG SAM
		You leave her the fuck alone!

				BUDDY
		You just shut that filthy mouth, 
		son. I'll deal with you when we get 
		home--

				YOUNG PILAR
		Please, don't tell my mother! She's 
		gonna kill me!

	They step closer into the glaring HEADLIGHTS which WHITE OUT 
	the scene, then FADE.

	EXT. RUINED DRIVE-IN -- DUSK

	It is DUSK, PRESENT DAY. Our eyes readjust to see Sam, 
	standing by his car in the lot of the long-abandoned drive-
	in. The ruined screen rises in the b.g.

	CU SAM

	Remembering. MUSIC BEGINS as he gets back into the car, pulls 
	away.

	EXT. HIGH SCHOOL -- NIGHT

	MUSIC CONTINUES as Sam's car pulls into the high school lot. 
	He looks up toward the school--

	EXT. WINDOW, PILAR, -- SAM'S POV

	MUSIC CONTINUES. We can see PILAR, through the lighted window 
	of her classroom, preparing something on the blackboard--

	INT. CAR

	MUSIC ENDS as Sam leans back to wait--

	EXT. PARKING LOT

	PILAR digs in her bag for her car keys as she makes her way 
	across the lot. She sees something, slows, reacting, then 
	brings us to Sam in his car. He has parked head-to-foot next 
	to hers. They look at each other for a long moment

				PILAR
			(Softly)
		Follow me.

	EXT. MAIN STREET -- NIGHT

	Nothing stirring. Pilar's car appears, closely followed by 
	Sam's. The cafe has closed for the night.

	INT. CAFE -- NIGHT

	Sam and Pilar sit on chairs next to each other, facing the 
	window, talking softly. The STREETLIGHT shining through the 
	letters in the front window makes patterns on their faces

				PILAR
		We thought we were something, didn't 
		we?

				SAM
		Yeah.

				PILAR
		I look at my kids in school--tenth, 
		eleventh graders. That's who we were. 
		Children.

				SAM
		Yeah.

				PILAR
		I mean what did we know about 
		anything?

				SAM
		Nothing.

	Pilar looks at him--

				PILAR
		When Nando died--it was so sudden--I 
		was kind of in shock for awhile.   
		Then I woke up and there was the 
		whole rest of my life and I didn't 
		have any idea what to do with it.

				SAM
		You know the other day, you asked 
		why I came back?

				PILAR
		Yeah?

				SAM
		I came back 'cause you were here.

	PILAR nods. She gets up and we FOLLOW her across the dark 
	room to the jukebox. She looks at the selections--

				PILAR
		My mother hasn't changed the songs 
		since I was 10.

	She puts in a quarter, punches some numbers. A Mexican BALLAD 
	comes on. She crosses back to Sam, holds her hand out. He 
	stands to greet her. They slow-dance in the empty cafe--

	INT. SAM'S APARTMENT -- BEDROOM

	Sam and Pilar finish making love. They lie beside each other, 
	shaking a little--

				PILAR
		Wow.

				SAM
		Yeah.

				PILAR
		How come it feels the same?

				SAM
		I don't know. It just feels good. 
		Always did.

				PILAR
		So what are we gonna do about this?

				SAM
		More, I hope.

	PILAR smiles, looks around the room--

				PILAR
		How long have you lived here?

				SAM
		Two years.

				PILAR
		There's nothing on the walls. No 
		pictures--

				SAM
		Don't have kids. Other pictures--I 
		don't know--it's nothing I want to 
		look back on.

				PILAR
		Like your story is over.

				SAM
		I've felt that way, yeah.

	Sbe puts her head on his cbest--

				PILAR
		It isn't. Not by a long shot. He 
		holds her and they lie silently for 
		a moment--

				SAM
		Pilar--

				PILAR
		Yeah?

				SAM
		What was your father's name?

				PILAR
		Eladio. Eladio. Cruz.

							 FADE OUT:

	EXT. PILAR'S HOUSE -- MORNING

	Paloma sits on the top step of the porch, reading teen 
	magazines. PILAR steps out behind her, dressed casually, and 
	squints at the day--

				PALOMA
		She finally got in--

				PILAR
		It's Saturday.

				PALOMA
		You got in late last night.

				PILAR
		Yeah. I had uhm--school business.

	Paloma gives her a look, then holds a fashion page up for 
	her to see--

				PALOMA
		Can I get this?

				PILAR
		Nobody really wears that stuff, 
		Paloma.

				PALOMA
		I could name five girls at school 
		who have one just like it--

				PILAR
		Enough with the clothes--

				PALOMA
		Just 'cause you went to Catholic 
		school and wore a uniform.

				PILAR
		I only went for my last two years.

				PALOMA
		How come?

				PILAR
		Oh, my mother wanted to keep me away 
		from away from boys.

	PILAR steps out into the sun--

				PALOMA
		Did it work?

	INT. CAFE -- MORNING

	Hollis is sitting alone in a booth, working on some heuvos 
	rancheros.  Sam slides in across from him--

				SAM
		Morning, Hollis.

				HOLLIS
		Sam! Quite a do the other day. It 
		meant a lot to folks that you said 
		something.

				SAM
		You thought any more about our murder?

				HOLLIS
		We have a murder?

				SAM
		Charley Wade.

				HOLLIS
		I wish I could tell you I remembered 
		something new, but I can't.

				SAM
		I got an idea what happened.

				HOLLIS
		Do you?

				SAM
		I think somewhere between Roderick 
		Bledsoe's club and his house, Wade 
		ran into Buddy Deeds. I think Buddy 
		put a bullet in him, waited for him 
		to die, threw him in the trunk of 
		the Sheriff's car and drove him out 
		by the Army post, I think he buried 
		him under four feet of sand and never 
		looked back.

	Hollis sits back to look Sam in the eye--

				HOLLIS
		You lived in the man's house what--
		seventeen, eighteen years? And you 
		didn't get to know him any better 
		than that?

				SAM
		I got to go see somebody in San 
		Antonio today. Your memory gets any 
		better, I'll be back tonight.

	Sam stands and walks away. We HOLD on Hollis, his appetite 
	gone--

	EXT. BIG O'S -- MORNING

	Chet steps around to the side entrance--

	INT. BLACK SEMINOLE EXHIBIT -- DAY -- CU STATUE

	We start on a statue of a BUFFALO SOLDIER made from spent 
	bullets and shell casings, then PAN to another, then WIDEN 
	to see Chet as he pokes his head in, the BELL of the door 
	ringing.  He steps in cautiously, looking around the room. 
	On the walls there are photo-blowups, some artifacts, 
	handlettered information on cardboard. Chet stops to look up 
	at a picture of a barechested Black man with a couple of 
	feathers stuck in his headband

				OTIS (O.S.)
		That's John Horse.

	Chet turns to see Otis standing back by, the door from the 
	bar--

				OTIS
		Spanish in Florida called him Juan 
		Caballo. John Horse.

				CHET
			(Looks at picture)
		He a Black man or an Indian?

				OTIS
			(Steps in)
		Both.

	Otis crosses to the poker table, begins to clean up--

				OTIS
		He was part of the Seminole Nation, 
		got pushed down into the Everglades  
		in pioneer days. African people who 
		run off from the slaveholders hooked 
		up with them, married up, had 
		children. When the Spanish give up 
		Florida, the U.S.Army come down to 
		move all them Indian peoples off to 
		Oklahoma--

				CHET
		The Trail of Tears.

				OTIS
			(Smiles)
		They teaching that now?  Good. Only 
		a couple of 'em held out--this man, 
		John Horse, and his friend Wild Cat, 
		and a fella name of Osceola. Army 
		put all of them in prison and Osceola 
		died, but them other two escaped and 
		put together a fighting band and 
		held out another ten, fifteen years. 
		Beat Zach Taylor and a thousand troops 
		at Lake Okeechobee.

				CHET
		So they stayed in Florida?

				OTIS
		They got tired of fighting, went to 
		the Indian Territories for a while. 
		But the slave-raiders were on 'em 
		even there, and one night they packed 
		up and nearly the whole band rode 
		down to Mexico. Crossed at Eagle 
		Pass.

	They move on to some photos of very African-looking people 
	dressed in beautiful Seminole clothing--

				OTIS
		Men worked for Santa Anna down there, 
		waited out the Civil War. The land 
		wasn't much to feed people on, so in 
		1870 they come north and put up at 
		Fort Duncan and the men joined up 
		what was called the Seminole Negro 
		Indian Scouts. Best trackers either 
		side of the border. Bandits, rustlers, 
		Texas rednecks, Kiowa, Comanche--

				CHET
		They fought against the Indians?

				OTIS
		Same as they done in Mexico.

				CHET
		But they were Indians themselves.

				OTIS
		They were in the Army. Like your 
		father.

				CHET
			(Surprised)
		You know who I am?

				OTIS
		I got a pretty good guess.

				CHET
		That guy who got shot--

				OTIS
		You didn't go telling your father 
		you were here?

				CHET
		Are you kidding? And face a court-
		martial?

				OTIS
			(Smiles)
		He's a pretty tough old man, huh?

				CHET
		No sports if I don't keep a B average, 
		no TV on school nights, no PDA's--

				OTIS
		PDA?

				CHET
		Public Display of Affection. Every 
		time he moves up a rank, it's like 
		he's got to tighten the screws a 
		little more--

				OTIS
		Well--

				CHET
		I mean, just 'cause he didn't--you 
		know--

				OTIS
		Didn't have a father?

				CHET
			(Shrugs)
		He's still pissed off about it.

				OTIS
		When you're his age you'll still be 
		pissed off about him.

	Chet nods, looks around--

				CHET
		So how come you got into all this?

				OTIS
		These are our people. There were 
		Paynes in Florida, Oklahoma, Piedras 
		Negras--couple of 'em won the whatsit--
		Congressional Medal Of Honor--

				CHET
		So I'm part-Indian?

				OTIS
		By blood you are. But blood only 
		means what you let it.

				CHET
		My father says the day you're  born 
		you start from scratch, no breaks 
		and no excuses, and you got to pull 
		yourself up on your own.

				OTIS
			(Sad)
		Well, he's living proof of that, 
		son. Living proof.

	INT. DEL'S OFFICE -- DAY

	Athena stands at attention as Del sits at his desk, reviewing 
	her record. He lets her stand for a long time before speaking--

				DEL
		Private Johnson, are you unhappy in 
		the Army?

				ATHENA
		No, sir--

				DEL
		Then how would you explain the fact 
		that out of one hundred twenty people 
		we tested, you're the only one who 
		came up positive for drugs?

				ATHENA
		I'm sorry, sir.

				DEL
		When you were given the opportunity 
		to enlist, a kind of contract was 
		agreed upon. I think the Army has 
		honored its part of that agreement.

				ATHENA
		Yes, sir--

				DEL
		Do you believe in what we're doing 
		here, Private Johnson?

				ATHENA
		I-I can do the job, sir.

				DEL
		You don't sound too enthusiastic.

				ATHENA
		I am, sir.

				DEL
		What exactly do you think your job 
		is, Private?

				ATHENA
		Follow orders. Do whatever they say.

				DEL
		Who's "they"?

				ATHENA
		The--the officers.

				DEL
		And that's the job? Nothing about 
		serving your country?

	Athena is confused, hesitates to speak--

				DEL
		These aren't trick questions, Private. 
		You'll be given an Article 15 and be 
		going into the ADCAP Program one way 
		or the other. What happens after 
		that is up to you. I'm just trying 
		to understand how somebody like you 
		thinks.

	Silence--

				DEL
		Well?

				ATHENA
			(Hesitant)
		You really want to know, sir?

				DEL
		Please.

				ATHENA
		It's their country. This is one of 
		the best deals they offer.

	Del knows he asked for it, but doesn't like the answer--

				DEL
		How do you think I got to be a 
		colonel?

				ATHENA
		Work hard, be good at your job. Sir. 
		Do whatever they tell you.

				DEL
		Do whatever they tell you--

				ATHENA
		I mean, follow orders, sir.

				DEL
		With your attitude, Private, I'm 
		surprised you want to stay in the 
		service.

				ATHENA
		I do, sir.

				DEL
		Because it's a job?

				ATHENA
			(Struggling)
		Outside it's--it's such a mess--it's--

				DEL
		Chaos.

	Athena is sure she's overstepped her rank--

				DEL
		Why do you think they let us in on 
		the "deal"?

				ATHENA
		They got people to fight. Arabs, 
		yellow people, whatever. Might as 
		well use us.

				DEL
		Do you think you've been discriminated 
		against on this post?

				ATHENA
		No, sir. Not at all.

				DEL
		Any serious problems with your 
		sergeant or your fellow soldiers?

				ATHENA
		No, sir. They all been real straight 
		with me.

	Del stands, thinking, trying not to bullshit her--

				DEL
		It works like this, Private--every 
		soldier in a war doesn't have to 
		believe in what he's fighting for.  
		Most of them fight just to back up 
		the soldiers in their squad--you try 
		not to get them killed, try not to 
		get them extra duty, try not to 
		embarrass yourself in front of them.

	He is right in her face now--

				DEL
		Why don't you start with that?

				ATHENA
		Yes, sir.

				DEL
		You're dismissed, Private.

				ATHENA
		Thank you, sir.

	Athena salutes, steps out. Del looks out the window, troubled 
	by the encounter.

	EXT. KINCAID HOUSE -- DAY

	Sam's car is parked on the street in front of an expensive-
	looking house in a tree-lined neighborhood--

	INT. LIVING ROOM

	Sam's ex-wife, BUNNY KINCAID, shuffles across her living 
	room in slippers, crossing to turn off a big-screen TV playing 
	football highlights. Bunny wears shorts, a Houston Oilers 
	sweatshirt and a Dallas Cowboys cap. The living room is like 
	a sports museum-- signed footballs, team posters, a bookcase 
	filled with tapes of Texas pro and college football games--

				BUNNY
		The Longhorns gonna kick some serious 
		butt this Saturday, you just watch. 
		We got a kid at tailback from down 
		your way--outta El Indio--

				SAM (O.S.)
		That's in Maverick County.

	She brings us to Sam, sitting uncomfortably, beneath a full-
	sized blowup of Tony Dorsett hurdling a tackler--

				BUNNY
		Oh. Right. And you're in--?

				SAM
		Rio. BUNNY Right. This kid, Hosea 
		Brown? Does tire 40 in 3.4, soft 
		hands, lateral movement--the whole 
		package. Only a sophomore--

				SAM
		You still going to all the home games?

				BUNNY
		Well, Daddy's got his box at the 
		stadium, of course, and I'll fly to 
		the Cowboy away games when they're 
		in the Conference. Then there's the 
		high school on Friday' nights. West 
		Side got a boy 6'6", 310, moves like 
		a cat. High school, we're talkin'. 
		Guess how much he can bench-press?

				SAM
		Bunny, you--uhm--you on that same 
		medication?

				BUNNY
		Do I seem jumpy?

				SAM
		No, you look good. I was just 
		wondering.

				BUNNY
		Last year was awful rough--Mama 
		passing on and the whole business 
		with O.J.--I mean it's not like it 
		was Don Meredith or Roger Staubach 
		or one of our own boys, but it really 
		knocked me for a loop--

				SAM
		You look good--

				BUNNY
		--and that squeaker the Aggies dropped 
		to Oklahoma-sonofabitch stepped in 
		some lucky shit before he kicked 
		that goal--

				SAM
		Yeah, well--

				BUNNY
		--they hadn't pulled me off that 
		woman I would have jerked a knot in 
		her.

				SAM
		You were in a fight--

				BUNNY
		Daddy calls it an "altercation." How 
		you doing, Sam? You look skinny.

				SAM
		Same weight I always was.

				BUNNY
		You look awful good in that uniform, 
		though.

				SAM
		Best part of the job.

				BUNNY
		Daddy hired a pinhead to take your 
		job. He says so himself. Says "Even 
		my son-in-law was better than this 
		pinhead I got now".

				SAM
		Bunny, is that stuff I left in the 
		garage still there?

				BUNNY
		Least he never called me that. With 
		me, it was always "high-strung." "My 
		Bunny might have done something with 
		her life, she wasn't so high-strung." 
		Or "tightly wound," that was another 
		one. You seeing anyone?

				SAM
		No. You?

				BUNNY
		Yeah. Sort of. Daddy rounds 'em up. 
		You aren't talking about money, their 
		beady little eyes go dead.

				SAM
		You didn't--uhm--you didn't have one 
		of your fires, did you? The stuff I 
		left in the garage--some of it was 
		my father's--

				BUNNY
		You watch the draft this year? 'Course 
		you didn't, idiot question. They try 
		to make it dramatic, like there's 
		some big surprise who picks who in 
		the first round? Only they been 
		working it over with their experts 
		and their computers for months. 
		Doctor's reports, highlight reels, 
		coaches' evaluations, psychological 
		profiles--hell, I wouldn't be 
		surprised if they collected stool 
		samples on these boys, have 'em 
		analyzed. All this stuff to pick a 
		football player for your squad. 
		Compared to that, what you know about 
		the person you get married to don't 
		amount to diddly, does it?

				SAM
		Suppose not.

				BUNNY
		You kind of bought yourself a pig in 
		a poke, didn't you, Sam? All that 
		time we were first seeing each other 
		you didn't know I was tightly wound--

				SAM
		It wasn't just you, Bunny.

				BUNNY
		No, it wasn't, was it? You didn't 
		exactly throw yourself into it heart 
		and soul, did you?

	She looks at him for an uncomfortably long moment--

				BUNNY
		Your shit's still in the garage if 
		that's what you came for.

	Sam nods, stands. Bunny is in tears--

				BUNNY
		350 pounds.

				SAM
		What?

				BUNNY
		This boy from West Side, plays tackle 
		both ways. Bench-presses 350 pounds. 
		You imagine having that much weight 
		on top of you? Pushing down? Be hard 
		to breathe. Hard to swallow.

				SAM
		I think they have another fella there 
		to keep it off your chest. A spotter.

				BUNNY
		"I only got my little girl now," he 
		says, "she's my lifeline." Then he 
		tells me I can't be in the box anymore 
		if I can't control myself. Sonofabitch 
		don't even watch the damn game, just 
		sits there drinking with his bidness 
		friends, look up at the TV now and 
		then. I do better to sit in the cheap 
		seats with some real football people.

				SAM
			(Edging out)
		You look good, Bunny. It's nice to 
		see you.

				BUNNY
			(Smiles)
		Thanks. I like it when you say that, 
		Sam.

	looking for--

	CLOSER

	Sam pulls out an old holster, a sheaf of real estate and 
	insurance forms, a couple of old paperback Zane Grey westerns. 
	He pulls out a cracked leather pouch, turns it over--letters 
	fall out. He examines an envelope--no stamp or postmark--
	pulls a letter out, reads--

				SAM
		"Dearest Buddy--"

	He puts the letter down for a moment, thinks. He needs to 
	know. He picks the letter up again, reads.

	INT. OTIS'S HOUSE -- EVENING

	Carolyn crosses the living room to answer the RING at the 
	front door.  Del stands there--

				CAROLYN
		Hey, it's the General.

				DEL
		Colonel. Is uhm--is Otis in?

				CAROLYN
		Come on in--

				DEL
		If it's too late--

				CAROLYN
		Come on in.

	Del enters the house as if walking into an AMBUSH--

	INT. OTIS'S LIVING ROOM -- EVENING

	Carolyn sits back in the couch, drink in hand, checking Del 
	out--

				CAROLYN
		Otis sittin' up with some people at 
		the club. I don't think he'll be 
		long.

	CU DEL

	Uncomfortable, sitting at the edge of an easy chair. He looks 
	at a mounted magazine photo of Otis smiling as he pours hot 
	sauce on a rack of ribs--

				CAROLYN
		His hot sauce recipe won a contest 
		last year. They sellin' it far away 
		as San Antonio. He got a lot of 
		talent, your father.

	Del squirm a bit at the word "father"--

				DEL
		You've been in this house for a while?

				CAROLYN
		I been here with him eight years 
		now. He built it when he was with 
		Leora.

				DEL
		I never met her.

				CAROLYN
		There was a bunch of 'em You never 
		met. Me neither.

	Del looks around the living room--

				CAROLYN
		Let me show you around--

	INT. DEN -- PHOTOGRAPH

	A blowup of a photo of a squad of Buffalo Soldiers is mounted 
	on the wall--

				CAROLYN (O.S.)
		He got into all this cowboys and 
		Indians stuff awhile back. Spend 
		half his time pokin' around in the 
		library way up to Austin.

	CU DEL

	He looks at something below --

	DEL'S POV -- CLIPPINGS

	We PAN slowly over laminated newspaper clippings mounted 
	behind a picture of young Del in a track uniform, holding a 
	vaulting pole. The clippings are about Del making honor rolls, 
	winning a Silver Star in Vietnam, graduating from Officer 
	Candidate School, being named head of this and that in the 
	Army--

				CAROLYN (O.S.)
		Kind of like a shrine, isn't it?

	DEL, CAROLYN

	Carolyn stands behind, watching Del's face as he looks at 
	the stuff--

				DEL
		Where'd he get all this?

				CAROLYN
		Your mother got a brother--Alphonse--

				DEL
		Uncle Al--

				CAROLYN
		Otis stood on good terms with the 
		man. Whenever you do something makes 
		the news, he sends it on. When they 
		made you General, Otis just about 
		drove away all our customers going 
		on about it.

				DEL
		I'm a colonel.

				CAROLYN
		Yeah, I know--Man made me memorize 
		the whole damn Army chain of command 
		before he'd marry me. So this is a 
		big deal, commander and  all?

				DEL
		It's a small post and they're phasing 
		it out in two years, but I moved up 
		in rank and--well, a command is a 
		command.

				CAROLYN
		Otis went on like you were that guy 
		who won the Gulf War. Colin whatsit.

				DEL
		My mother said he never asked about--

				CAROLYN
		He never asked her.

	It's a bit too much for Del--

				DEL
		Listen, I uh--tell him I came by. 
		Thanks--

	We HOLD on Carolyn as he hurries out. She salutes--

				CAROLYN
		Catch you later, Colonel.

	EXT. RIVER -- NIGHT

	PEOPLE, crouching low, wade across the river toward us. When 
	he gets close enough to us, we recognize Enrique, nervously 
	leading a group of Mexican men, women and children to the 
	U.S. side. They are spaced out in the dark, loosely holding 
	the line Enrique made in one hand and holding their bundles 
	high away from the water with the other. Enrique turns as he 
	hears a WOMAN'S CRY.  The line goes slack, then NESTOR steps 
	out of the darkness to join him--

				ENRIQUE
		Que Paso? [What happened?]

				NESTOR
		Anselma cayo en las rocas. Creo que 
		la pierna ha sido root--[Anselma 
		felt on the rocks. I think her leg's 
		broken--]

	Two men struggle forward supporting Anselma, trying to hold 
	her leg out straight in front of her. She is in a lot of 
	pain--

				NESTOR
		No podemos alcanzar el camion llevando 
		a ella. Hay lugar para esconderla? 
		[We can't reach the truck if we're 
		carrying her. Is there somewhere to 
		hide her?]

	Enrique thinks, trying not to panic, as the others come up 
	around him--

				ENRIQUE
		Conozco solamente una persona con 
		casa--[I only know one person with a 
		house--]

				ANSELMA
			(In pain)
		Esta lejos? [Is it far?]

	EXT. PATIO -- NIGHT

	Mercedes sits on her recliner, drink in hand. An old RECORD 
	plays from inside. She is startled by the voice from the 
	dark--

				ENRIQUE (O.S.)
		Senora Cruz?

				MERCEDES
			(Standing)
		Quien es? [Who is it?]

				ENRIQUE
		Soy yo, Enrique! No tiene miedo-- 
		[It's me, Enrique. Don't be afraid]

	Enrique steps out into the light. His pants are wet and he's 
	scared--

				MERCEDES
		What are you doing out there? Are 
		you crazy?

				ENRIQUE
		Hay pasado un accidente muy grave-- 
		[There's been a bad accident--]

				MERCEDES
		In English, Enrique. We're in the 
		United States--

				ENRIQUE
		I have some friends who have had a 
		accident--

				MERCEDES
		You have somebody else out there?

				ENRIQUE
		We was by the river? And I hear my 
		friend callin' for help, and I look 
		and she has falling in the water--

				MERCEDES
		Don't tell me lies, Enrique. Que 
		paso?

				ENRIQUE
		We was crossin' the river--

	Nestor appears in the light now, supporting Anselma, who 
	hops awkwardly to move forward--

				MERCEDES
		Enrique! Quienes son estos? How could 
		you bring them here?

				ENRIQUE
		They need help. Jaime, Anselma-- 
		esta es mi jefa--

				NESTOR
		Senora--

				MERCEDES
		I'll call the Border Patrol, they'll 
		get her to the hospital.

				ENRIQUE
		No! No puede hacer esto--[You can't 
		do that--]

				MERCEDES
		You think you're doing these people 
		a favor? What are they going to do? 
		Either they get on welfare or they 
		become criminals--

				ENRIQUE
		No es la verdad--[That isn't true--]

				NESTOR
		Con permiso, Senora, la muchacha 
		tiene mucho dolor--[Please, Senora, 
		the girl is in a lot of pain--]

	Mercedes grudgingly indicates the lounge chair--

				MERCEDES
		Sientase. [Sit.]

				NESTOR
		Es muy amable. [You're very kind.]

	He and Enrique help Anselma into the chair. The Girl looks 
	up at Mercedes, frightened--

				ANSELMA
		Ayudanos, Senora, por favor no podemos 
		regresar--[Help us, Senora, please. 
		We can't go back]

	Mercedes looks at ANSELMA disapprovingly. The girl can't be 
	more than 14--

				MERCEDES
		This girl is a friend of yours?

				ENRIQUE
		Es mi novia. [She's my girlfriend.]

				MERCEDES
		I thought you were married!

				ENRIQUE
		I am marry to the cousin of a friend--
		but only to be able to live here. 
		This is the mother of my child--

				MERCEDES
		This girl has a child?

				ENRIQUE
		We have a daughter.

				MERCEDES
			(Scornful)
		Tipico.

	EXT. HOUSE -- NIGHT

	Sam stands at the front door of a house on the lake, banging 
	on the door--

				SAM
		Hollis? You in there? Hollis?

	EXT. RIVER -- NIGHT

	Moonlight kicks off the surface of the water.  We hear 
	SPLASHING, the frightened VOICE of a young woman--

				YOUNG MERCEDES (O.S.)
		Donde esta? Estoy perdido--[Where 
		are you? I'm lost--]

				ELADIO (O.S., DISTANT)
		Aqui! [Here!]

	The girl flounders into the shot, wet and scared. Young 
	Mercedes, a teenager not unlike ANSELMA is wading thigh-deep 
	in the Rio, lost, scared--

				YOUNG MERCEDES
		No puedo ver la orilla! [I can't see 
		the bank!]

				ELADIO (O.S.)
		Aqui! Venga por aqui! [Over here! 
		Come this way!]

	Mercedes struggles toward the voice and suddenly a young man 
	becomes visible, standing in the water, holding his band out 
	for her, ELADIO--

				YOUNG MERCEDES
		Vi a Rosaria arastrado para el  
		corriente--[I saw Rosaria taken away 
		by the current--]

				ELADIO
		No te molestas. Tenemos a ella. [Don't 
		worry. We've got her.]

	He takes her arm, pulls her toward the far shore--

				ELADIO
		Como se llama? [What's your name?]

				YOUNG MERCEDES
		Mercedes Gonzales Ruiz.

				ELADIO
			(Smiles)
		Me llama Eladio Cruz--Bienvenido a 
		Tejas. [Welcome to Texas.]

						 DISSOLVE TO:

	EXT. MERCEDES' HOUSE -- MERCEDES

	Mercedes is lost in thought as she recalls. She steps into 
	the light by the carport. Enrique and Nestor are propping 
	Anselma's leg up on pillows in the back of Mercedes' old 
	station wagon--

				MERCEDES
		Rapidamente! Everybody in the world 
		is going to see!

				ENRIQUE
		Donde vamos? [Where are we going?]

				MERCEDES
		A casa de Porfirio Zayas. He used to 
		be a doctor on the other side.  
		Gunshot wounds, fixing babies--if 
		you can pay he can handle it.

				ENRIQUE
		Senora, anything it costs, I can 
		work--

				MERCEDES
		Don't worry about it. He owes me 
		some favors.

	Enrique turns to ANSELMA still frightened in the rear of the	
	station wagon--

				ENRIQUE
		Seas tranquila, mija.
			(Nods to Mercedes)
		Estamos en las manos de Senora Cruz. 
		[Just relax, honey. We're in the 
		hands of Senora Cruz.]

	Mercedes starts the car--

				MERCEDES
		In English, Enrique. In English--

	INT. DEL'S HOUSE -- DINING  ROOM

	Del steps in. Chet sits at the table, drawing a cartoon in 
	panels. Del looks over his shoulder for a moment--

	CARTOON

	A tank rolling over barbed wire, cannon and machine gun 
	blasting away--

				DEL (O.S.)
		Homework?

	DEL AND CHET

				CHET
		I finished that. I'm just messing 
		around.

				DEL
		Tanks, huh?

				CHET
		You got to be in the Army, you might 
		as well have something slick to drive.

				DEL
		So you're going into the Army?

	Chet looks at him, not in a good mood, then goes back to his	
	drawing--

				CHET
		That's the general plan, isn't it?

	Del watches for a long moment, thinking--

				DEL
			(Softly)
		That's up to you.

	Chet looks at his father again. All this is news to him--

				DEL
		The Army isn't for everybody.

	Chet can't quite believe he is hearing this. Del crosses to 
	the refrigerator--

				DEL
		Not that I don't think you'd be good 
		at it, but--you know--I wouldn't be 
		disappointed if you decided to do 
		something else with your life.

				CHET
		You wouldn't?

				DEL
		No.

	Chet nods, begins to play again, considering the 
	possibilities. Del is making an effort and he doesn't have 
	much practice--

				DEL
		How's your room shaping up?

				CHET
		Fine. I'm pretty much moved in.

				DEL
		Good.

	An awkward silence--

				CHET
			(Tentative)
		Are we going to ever see your father?

				DEL
		My father.

				CHET
		Yeah. He lives here, right?

				DEL
		He does.

	Del pulls some food out, watching Chet as he draws--

				DEL
		Maybe we'll clean that thing out 
		back up, have a barbecue next weekend. 
		We could invite him and his wife 
		over.

				CHET
		Cool.

	Chet flips the page of his sketchbook--

				CHET
		He makes his own sauce.

	EXT. PARKING LOT, BIG O'S -- NIGHT

	The neon's off, but there are a couple cars in the lot and a 
	light within. Sam pulls into the lot, steps out, approaches 
	the door--

	INT. CLUB

	The door opens. The place is empty now except for Otis, 
	standing behind the bar, deep in conversation with Hollis, 
	sitting on a stool. Both swivel to look around guiltily as 
	they hear Sam step in--

	REVERSE

	Sam walks in slowly, crossing the floor to bring us back to 
	the two men--

				SAM
		Fellas.

				HOLLIS
		Hey, Sam.

				SAM
		Open late.

				OTIS
		I'm not open. We were just talking.

				SAM
		Hollis probably told you we found 
		Charley Wade.

				OTIS
		Yeah. How about that? People start 
		digging holes in this county, there's 
		no telling what'll come up.

	He sits a few stools away from Hollis--

				SAM
		You two saw it, didn't you? You two 
		saw it when Buddy killed him.

	Hollis and 0tis look at each other--

				SAM
		Imonna find out one way or the other.

				HOLLIS
		Your father had the finest sense of 
		justice of any man I ever met--

				SAM
		Yeah, and my mother was a saint. For 
		fifteen years the whole damn town 
		knew he had another woman on the 
		side. Stole ten thousand dollars to 
		set her up in business. But hell, 
		what's that? You got a problem?  
		Buddy'll fix it. Facing some time in 
		jail? Buddy'll knock half of it off--
		if you do what he says, when he says. 
		You got some business that's not 
		exactly legal? Talk to Buddy--

				HOLLIS
		Buddy Deeds--

				SAM
		Buddy Deeds was a murderer.

	He looks at the two older men for a long moment--

				SAM
		That night in the cafe--he didn't 
		stay long after you left, did he, 
		Hollis? Maybe he decided he'd gone 
		too far with Wade, maybe he figured 
		he better not wait for the Sheriff 
		to get behind him. So he stepped out 
		to see if he could catch up--and you 
		were here at the club that night, 
		weren't you, O?

	Otis sighs, begins to speak softly--

				OTIS
		I was here.

	CU OTIS

	He turns to look toward the door as he reminisces, and we 
	PAN away with his gaze--

				OTIS (O.S.)
		I'd been running a game on the side 
		after hours craps, draw poker on the 
		weekends. Roderick didn't know about 
		it. More important, Charley Wade 
		didn't know about it, 'cause I didn't 
		want to cut him in. I suppose I'd 
		been drinking some, and I was pretty 
		full of myself in those days--but 
		hell, I just didn't expect the man 
		so early--

	Sheriff Wade and Young Hollis step in the door and we are 
	back in 1957. BLUES HARMONICA FADES UP, wailing from the 
	jukebox. They stop and look at the place--

	THEIR POV -- CLUB

	MUSIC CONTINUES. The club is empty, dark. A LIGHT shines 
	from the back room.

	INT. BACK ROOM

	MUSIC CONTINUES. Smoke fills the air and Young Otis sits 
	back laughing, a large pile of money on the table in front 
	of him. The other four BLACK MEN at the table aren't doing 
	so well. One by one they all look up past the camera to the 
	door--

	CU OTIS

	MUSIC CONTINUES. Young Otis doesn't see at first, engaged in 
	dealing the cards. Finally, he senses the presence, looks up--

	WADE AND HOLLIS -- YOUNG O'S POV

	MUSIC CONTINUES. Wade stands over the table in the f.g., 
	Young Hollis hanging back in the doorway. Wade is smiling 
	his cold smile, cursing--

	CU YOUNG OTIS

	MUSIC CONTINUES. Trying to look unimpressed--

	EXTREME CU WADE'S EYES

	Cold and unblinking. MUSIC CONTINUES--

	EXTREME CU WADE'S MOUTH

	Twisted in a snarl as he curses. MUSIC CONTINUES--

	MEN, TABLE

	MUSIC CONTINUES. We shoot past Wade's body as the other men 
	step away from the table, grab their hats, and hurry out the 
	side door. Young Otis is left sitting at the table. Wade 
	starts walking toward him--

	CU YOUNG OTIS

	MUSIC CONTINUES. His eyes following as Wade comes to stand 
	over him--

	WADE, YOUNG OTIS

	MUSIC CONTINUES. Wade grabs the table and violently jerks it 
	over onto Young Otis, cards and money flying--

	YOUNG HOLLIS

	MUSIC CONTINUES. Watching squeamishly as Wade goes to work 
	on young Otis, the overhead light swinging wildly--

	INT. BARROOM

	MUSIC CONTINUES. Young Otis is hurled out of the back room, 
	face bruised and bleeding. Wade follows, then Young Hollis--

	CLOSER

	MUSIC CONTINUES.

	CLOSER

	Wade puts his gun next to Young Otis's ear, cursing at him. 
	Young Otis gets to his feet, goes behind the bar--

	BAR COUNTER

	MUSIC CONTINUES. Young Otis slaps an envelope full of cash 
	onto the counter--

	WADE

	MUSIC CONTINUES. He waves his pistol, indicating something 
	behind Otis--

	INT. BAR

	MUSIC CONTINUES. We shoot past Wade at the counter as Otis 
	turns and reaches for a cigar box on the shelf behind--

	CIGAR BOX

	MUSIC CONTINUES. Lying open, an old pistol inside of it. 
	Young Otis reaches--

	CU YOUNG HOLLIS

	MUSIC CONTINUES. Frowning as he senses something wrong--

	WADE

	MUSIC CONTINUES. Wade levels his gun at Young Otis's back, 
	then turns to wink at Hollis like he did before he shot Eladio--

	WADE'S HAND

	MUSIC CONTINUES. Finger closing around the trigger of the 
	.45--

	HOLLIS

	MUSIC CONTINUES. Mouth open in horror--

	WADE

	MUSIC CONTINUES. Eyes burning as he aims--

	BUDDY

	MUSIC CONTINUES. Stepping in the door, seeing, CALLS OUT--

	YOUNG OTIS

	MUSIC CONTINUES. Turning to see Buddy--

	WADE

	BLAM! THWAP! A bullet plows through his neck, knocking him 
	back against the bar.

	MUSIC CONTINUES. His gun falls from his hand--

	YOUNG OTIS

	Horrified, splattered with the Sheriff's blood. MUSIC 
	CONTINUES--

	BAR COUNTER

	MUSIC CONTINUES. Twenty-dollar bills have spilled out of the 
	envelope and are soaking up blood--

	CU BUDDY

	Calm and hard-eyed. MUSIC CONTINUES. As he steps forward, we 
	see his pistol is still in its holster. He reaches out and 
	takes the .45 from Young Hollis's shaking hand, looks him in 
	the eye till Hollis looks back, then looks toward Young Otis--

	We PAN with his gaze to a CLOSE-UP of Otis, back in the 
	PRESENT. The MUSIC FADES--

				OTIS
		Sheriff Charley had some real big 
		friends in politics then, and if the 
		truth come out it wasn't going to go 
		easy on Hollis.
			(He shrugs)
		I don't know why I trusted Buddy 
		with it--don't know why he trusted 
		me. The first time I ever talked 
		with him was right there, and then 
		with a dead white man leakin' blood 
		on the floor between us. He could 
		charm the scales off a rattler, Buddy 
		Deeds.

	WIDER

	This isn't what Sam was expecting. Hollis watches his face--

				HOLLIS
		The three of us cleaned up and took 
		him to the post and put him under. 
		Can't say I was much help.

				SAM
		And the ten thousand?

				HOLLIS
		Widow's benefits. He figured it would 
		make the disappearance look better, 
		and that Mexican gal was just scrapin' 
		by after Charley killed her man. 
		They didn't get hooked up till late--

				OTIS
		Time went on, people liked the story 
		that we told better than anything 
		the truth might have been.

	Sam swivels around on his seat to took at the spot where 
	Charley fell. He has a lot of information to deal with--

				HOLLIS
		What's the call, Sam?

	Sam rolls it over in his mind before answering--

				SAM
		Don't think the Rangers are likely 
		to find out any more than they  
		already have.

				HOLLIS
		Word gets out who that body was, 
		people are gonna think Buddy done 
		it.

	Sam gets up--

				SAM
		Buddy's a goddamn legend. He can 
		handle it.

	He heads for the door--

				SAM
		'Night, fellas.

	Hollis and Otis watch him go--

							 FADE OUT:

	EXT. DRIVE-IN, WIDE SHOT -- MORNING

	We see Sam sitting on the hood of his car parked in the 
	deserted drive-in lot, staring up at the ruined screen. 
	Pilar's car rolls in, parks beside him--

	CLOSER

	Pilar gets out, kisses Sam, sits by him on the hood--

				PILAR
		When's the picture start?

	Sam looks at her for a moment--

				SAM
		You gonna tell your mother we been 
		seeing each other?

				PILAR
		She'll figure it out sooner or later. 
		I don't have to ask permission 
		anymore, if that's what you mean.

				SAM
		You have any idea when your father 
		died? Eladio?

				PILAR
			(Shrugs)
		Couple months before I was born--

				SAM
		Try a year and a half. He bands her 
		an old snapshot. PILAR looks at it--

	CU PHOTO

	Buddy and Young Mercedes on the lake. Buddy with his shirt 
	off on one end of a sailboat, Mercedes in a bathing suit, 
	both smiling for the camera--

	SAM AND PILAR

	Pilar hands the photo back to him, tries to be calm--

				PILAR
		I've never seen my mother in a  
		bathing suit before.  Didn't know 
		she owned one.

				SAM
		Buddy bought the cafe for her with 
		money he took from the county.    
		Pilar looks away, struggling not to 
		cry--

				PILAR
		They can't pull this on me. It isn't 
		fair--I don't believe this--

				SAM
		He paid the hospital bill when you 
		were born. Your mom always calls you 
		"our beautiful daughter" in the 
		letters she wrote to him.

				PILAR
		From the first time I saw you at 
		school--all those years we were 
		married to other people I always 
		felt like we were connected.

				SAM
		I remember thinking you were the one 
		part of my life Buddy didn't have a 
		piece of--

	A silence, both of them wondering what the next move should 
	be--

				PILAR
		So that's it? You're not going to 
		want to be with me anymore?

	Sam knows what he feels but doesn't have the words--

				PILAR
		I'm not having any more children. 
		After Amado, I had some complications-- 
		I can't get pregnant again, if that's 
		what the rule is about--

				SAM
		If I met you for the first time today, 
		I'd still want to be with you.

	It is what Pilar needed to hear--

				PILAR
		We start from scratch--

				SAM
		Yeah--

				PILAR
		Everything that went before, all 
		that stuff, that history--the hell 
		with it, right?

	PILAR takes Sam's hand, kisses him--

				PILAR
		Forget the Alamo.

	WIDE SHOT, DRIVE-IN

	Sam and Pilar sit by each other holding hands, looking at 
	the empty screen--

	MUSIC, ROLL CREDITS

	EXT. TEXAS SCRUB -- DAY

	Two men in shorts and Hawaiian shirts are poking around a 
	sandy section in the middle of scrub flats. SERGEANT CLIFF 
	POTTS is in the f.g., a plant-and-tree guidebook in hand, as 
	SERGEANT "MIKEY" HOGAN works a metal detector over a large, 
	sandy bank in the b.g.  Both are Army career men with a 
	morning off to pursue their hobbies.

				CLIFF
		We got ocotillo, devil's walking 
		stick--what's this stuff--it's that 
		whattayoucallit--horse-crippler.

	Mikey bends to scoop something out of the sand, putting it 
	in a canvas bag slung on his hip.

				MIKEY
		This place is a gold mine.

				CLIFF
		Lead mine.

	MIKEY sees that Cliff is talking, pulls his headset off.

				MIKEY
		What?

				CLIFF
		It's a lead mine.

				MIKEY
		Right.

				CLIFF
		I don't know why I'm talking to you, 
		you've got that thing on your head.

				MIKEY
		You finding lots of cactus and shit?

				CLIFF
		It's not just cactus.  There's the 
		nopals, the yuccas--

				MIKEY
			(Puts headset on)
		Looks like a lot of cactus to me.

				CLIFF
			(Grumbles)
		Man knows a hundred-fifty varieties 
		of beer, he can't tell a poinsettia  
		from a prickly pear.

				MIKEY
			(Troubled)
		Cliff--

				CLIFF
		You live in a place, you should know 
		something about it. Explore--

				MIKEY
		Cliff--

	CU MIKEY

	MIKEY in the f.g. now, looking down at something as he pulls 
	his headset off again--

				MIKEY
		Cliff, you gotta look at this--

	Cliff wearily turns and approaches from the b.g.

				CLIFF
		Don't tell me--Spanish treasure, 
		right?  Pieces of eight from the  
		Coronado expedition--

	He stops by Mikey and looks down, his expression changing

				CLIFF
		Jesus--

	GROUND -- CU BONES

	Sticking out from the sand bank are the SKELETAL BONES of a 
	MAN'S HAND.  There is a ring on one finger.

				MIKEY (O.S.)
		Was Coronado in the Masons?

	EXT. ROAD -- DAY

	A distant cloud of DUST appears on the horizon MUSIC 
	underscores that we are in Texas, and we SUPERIMPOSE the 
	OPENING CREDITS as the dust takes form around an APPROACHING 
	CAR.  The car comes close enough to see it has a County 
	Sheriff's insignia on the side.

	INT. CAR

	We see SAM DEEDS, the Sheriff, driving. Sam is 40, quietly 
	competent to the point of seeming a bit moody. He sees 
	something up ahead.

	MUSIC, CREDITS END as Sam pulls off the road and we see the 
	sergeants standing in the scrub.

	EXT. SCRUB -- DAY -- BONES

	The hand and forearm down to the elbow of the skeleton are 
	visible now.

	WIDER

	Cliff stands looking at the arm with Sam. MIKEY is a few 
	yards behind them, playing with his metal detector. Beyond 
	him we see the Sheriff's car parked.

				SAM
		I was driving back from Apache Wells 
		when they got me on the radio.

				CLIFF
		This was a rifle range way back when. 
		But we figured it isn't Army land 
		anymore, it's your jurisdiction.

				SAM
			(Nods)
		I've got the forensics fella coming 
		down from the Rangers. No way to  
		know how old the body is without 
		some lab work.

				CLIFF
		That ring--

				SAM
		Masons been around a long while.

	Mikey has come up to them, still sweeping with the metal 
	detector.

				SAM
		Treasure hunter?

				CLIFF
			(Apologetic)
		Old bullets.  He uhm-- makes art 
		with them.

	Sam just nods. Mikey frowns, goes down on one knee and 
	scratches something out of the dirt at their feet--

				CLIFF
		The Sheriff says we shouldn't touch 
		anything,

				MIKEY
			(To Sam)
		He can't hear with that rig on-- 
		Mikey!

	Mikey comes up with something, holds it before them. An 
	encrusted piece of metal--

				MIKEY
		What've we got here?

	Sam takes the thing, lays it back down where Mikey found it.

				SAM
		S'posed to leave everything right 
		where we found it. They're real 
		particular about that.

				MIKEY
		The scene of the crime.

				SAM
		No telling yet if there's been a 
		crime.

	Sam frowns down at the piece of metal as he rubs the face of 
	it.

	CU METAL

	Sam's thumb wipes across the face of the encrusted metal. It 
	is roughly star-shaped.

				SAM (O.S.)
		But this country's seen a good number 
		of disagreements over the years.

	INT. HIGH SCHOOL CLASSROOM -- DAY -- TEXAS MAP

	We look at a beautiful old pull-down map of Texas.

				PILAR (O.S.)
		We do the best we can here--

	A teacher in her late 30s, PILAR CRUZ, steps in front of the 
	map and we FOLLOW her across the room, carrying a poster

				PILAR
		--but hey, public education these 
		days is a bit of a battleground.

	Posters hung on the walls beyond her show luminaries from 
	Texas history-- Sam Houston, Stephen Austin, Juan Seguin. A 
	new parent, CELIE PAYNE, stands in the middle of the otherwise 
	empty classroom.

				CELIE
		He went to school on base when we 
		were in Okinawa. It's all--you know--
		kids in the same boat--Army brats.

				PILAR
		His record shows that he's a good 
		student.

				CELIE
		I'm more worried about the social 
		thing. Are therelike--gangs, or...?

	PILAR starts to put the poster up. CELIE moves to hold it in 
	place for her.

				PILAR
		We haven't had any serious violence, 
		if that's what you mean. We've got a 
		pretty lively mix though--you walk 
		into the cafeteria and the Anglo 
		kids are in one section, the Mexican 
		kids in another and the Black kids 
		have a table in the back--thanks--

				CELIE
		So Blacks are--

				PILAR
		They're the smallest group except 
		for a couple Kickapoo kids. Look, 
		you're obviously a concerned parent. 
		Chet has no history of getting into 
		trouble--I'm happy to have him in my 
		class.

	She steps back to see if the poster, an old photo of Geronimo, 
	looks straight. Another teacher, MOLLY sticks her head in 
	the door--

				MOLLY
			(Uncomfortable)
		Pilar, is uhm--is Amado okay?

				PILAR
		Okay? He's not here?

				MOLLY
		No. Is he sick?

				PILAR
			(Mutters)
		He's going to wish he was dead.

	EXT. STREET -- DAY -- CU VAQUERO PICTURE

	On the door of a deluxe pickup truck is an airbrushed picture 
	of a Pancho Villa-looking vaquero with bandoliers crossing 
	his chest and a gun blazing in each hand. We hear LOUD MUSIC--

				AMADO (O.S.)
		Luis! Give me that Phillips-head 
		back--

	WIDER

	A small group of teenage Chicano BOYS hang around the truck 
	in the bed, on the hood, leaning against it. A BOOMBOX placed 
	on top of the cab blasts RANCHA MUSIC out at the neighborhood. 
	Somebody's legs are hanging out the open passenger-side door. 
	The kids suddenly look as a Sheriff's Department car slides 
	into the f.g.  A Deputy Sheriff, TRAVIS, gets out.

	KIDS

	Trying to look tough and unworried as we TRACK across the 
	street toward them. Travis's hand reaches out from behind 
	the camera to flick the MUSIC OFF.

	INT. PICKUP

	AMADO CRUZ, Pilar's 15-year-old son, lies on the front seat 
	installing a compact disc player into the dash slot. He 
	reaches up to the dash, can't find what he wants.

				AMADO
		Somebody hand me the CD player-- 
		damelo pendejos--

	He looks up and we TILT to see Travis leaning in the window,	
	examining the new radio

				TRAVIS
		They come a long way from those old 
		8-track jobs, haven't they?

				AMADO
		Something wrong?

				TRAVIS
			(Waves radio)
		This is stolen property. Alla you 
		fellas are coming down to the station.

	INT. CAFE SANTA BARBARA -- AFTERNOON -- ENRIQUE

	Sweat beads the forehead of a thin, tired-looking recent 
	immigrant, ENRIQUE, as he delivers platters of chile rellenos 
	to a booth. MEXICAN MUSIC plays on a jukebox in the b.g. We 
	HOLD on the booth, where HOLLIS POGUE, in his 60s entertains 
	two GOOD OLD BOYS--

				HOLLIS
		So Buddy walks up to the porch and 
		there's old Fishbait McHenry, cleanin' 
		the dirt out his toenails with a 
		pocketknife--he was the most hygienic 
		of all the McHenrys--

	The breakfast companions are laughing already--

				HOLLIS
		"Fishbait," says Buddy, in that quiet 
		way of his, "What you know about 
		them tires that went missing from 
		markets?" Fishbait thinks for a 
		minute, then he lifts up a loose 
		board from the porch floor and calls 
		down into it, "C'mon out, Pooter, 
		they caught us!"

				FENTON
			(Laughing)
		Buddy Deeds. He had a way.

				HOLLIS
		He known who it was onnacouna the 
		tire tracks in the dirt from the 
		back of the garage to where they 
		loaded up. "Old Fishbait," he says, 
		"never lifted a thing in this world 
		if there was a way he could roll 
		it."

	More laughter--

				FENTON
		Won't be another like him. That boy 
		of his doesn't come near it. You ask 
		me, he's all hat and no cattle

				SAM (O.S.)
		Fellas--

	We WIDEN to see Sam standing by their booth. No telling how 
	long he's been listening, Fenton is embarrassed.

				HOLLIS
		Sam! I was just telling a few about 
		your old man.

				FENTON
		He was a unique individual.

				SAM
		Yeah, he was that.

	We sense a little strain when Sam has to talk about his father--

				HOLLIS
		Big day coming up--I wish we'd have 
		thought of it while he was still 
		living. But he went so unexpected.

				FENTON
		Better late than never. Korean War 
		hero, Sheriff for near thirty years-- 
		Buddy Deeds Memorial P--

				SAM
		I heard there was a bit of a fuss.

				HOLLIS
		Oh, you know, the usual troublemakers. 
		Danny Padilla from the Sentinel, 
		that crowd.

				FENTON
		Every other damn thing in the country 
		is called after Martin Luther King, 
		they can't let our side have one 
		measly park?

				HOLLIS
		King wasn't Mexican, Fenton--

				FENTON
		Bad enough all the street names are 
		in Spanish--

				SAM
		They were here first.

				FENTON
		Then name it after Big Chief 
		Shitinabucket! Whoever that Tonkawa 
		fella was. He had the Mexes beat by 
		centuries.

				HOLLIS
		There was a faction pulling for that 
		boy who was killed in the Gulf War-- 
		Ruben--

				SAM
		--Santiago.

				HOLLIS
		Right. But nobody here ever noticed 
		him till they read his name on the 
		national news--

				FENTON
		They just wanted it to be one of 
		theirs--

				HOLLIS
		That's not the whole story. The 
		Mexicans that know, that remember, 
		understand what Buddy was for their 
		people.  Hell, it was Mercedes over 
		there who swung the deciding vote 
		for him.

	Sam looks to the register where Pilar's mother, MERCEDES 
	CRUZ, whacks rolls of change apart on the counter. She seems 
	to be avoiding looking toward him.

				SAM
		That so?

				HOLLIS
		She put it even at three to three, 
		so as the Mayor I get to cast the 
		tiebreaker. The older generation 
		won't have any problem with it. They 
		remember how Buddy come to be Sheriff, 
		that it was all 'cause he took their 
		part.

				FENTON
		Tell that one, Hollis--

				HOLLIS
		Hell, everybody heard that story a 
		million times.

				SAM
		I'd like to hear it. Your version of 
		it.

	Something about the way Sam says it puts Hollis on guard.

				FENTON
		Go ahead, Hollis.

	CU HOLLIS

	Hollis is hooked into it now--

				HOLLIS
		The two of us were the only deputies 
		back then me and Buddy--it's what--
		'58--

				FENTON (O.S.)
		'57, 1 believe--

				HOLLIS
		And the Sheriff at the time was Big 
		Charley Wade. Charley was one of 
		your old-fashioned bribe-or-bullets 
		kind of Sheriffs, he took a healthy 
		bite out of whatever moved through 
		this county.

	He looks down at the table--

				HOLLIS
		It was in here one night, back  when 
		Jimmy Herrera run the place.   Started 
		right here in this booth.

	We PAN down to the table, The food has changed. The tortillas 
	are in a straw basket instead of plastic. The jukebox changes 
	to ANOTHER SONG and the LIGHT DIMS slightly. A hand with a 
	big Masonic ring on one finger appears to lift a tortilla--
	underneath it lie three ten-dollar bills.  The hand lifts 
	them up and we TILT to see the face of SHERIFF CHARLEY WADE, 
	a big, mean redneck with shrewd eyes. It is 1957--

				WADE
			(Grins)
		This beaner fare doesn't agree with 
		me, but the price sure is right.

	WIDER

	Wade sits across from his young deputies, YOUNG HOLLIS (30s) 
	and BUDDY DEEDS (20s). A chicken-fried steak sits untouched 
	in front of Buddy. Hollis has the anxious look of an errand 
	boy, while Buddy is self-contained and quietly forceful for 
	his age.

				BUDDY
		What's that for?

				WADE
		Jimmy got a kitchen full of wetbacks, 
		most of 'em relatives. People breed 
		like chickens.

				BUDDY
		So?

				WADE
		I roust some muchacho on the street, 
		doesn't have his papers, all he got 
		to say is "Yo trabajo para Jimmy 
		Herrera."

	Wade folds the money and stuffs if in his pocket--

				WADE
		You got to keep the wheels greased, 
		son. Sheriff does his job right, 
		everybody makes out. Now this is 
		gonna be one of your pickups, Buddy. 
		First of the month, just like the 
		rent. Get the car, Hollis.

	Wade and Hollis slide out of the booth to stand.

				BUDDY
		I'm not doing it.

	Hollis stops a few feet away, shocked. Wade just stares down 
	at Buddy.

				WADE
		Come again?

	Buddy looks Wade in the eye, seemingly unafraid.

				BUDDY
		It's your deal. You sweated it out 
		of him, you pick it up.

				WADE
		There's gonna be some left over for 
		you, Buddy. I take care of my boys.

				BUDDY
		That's not the point.

				WADE
		You feeling bad for Jimmy? Have him 
		tell you the size of the mordida 
		they took out of his hide when he 
		run a place on the other side. Those 
		old boys in Ciudad Leon--

				BUDDY
		I'm not picking it up.

				WADE
		You do whatever I say you do or else 
		you put it on the trail, son.

	The CUSTOMERS are all watching now, nervous. Buddy thinks 
	for a moment, not taking his eyes off Wade.

				BUDDY
		How 'bout this--how 'bout you put 
		that shield on this table and  vanish 
		before you end up dead or in jail?

	Wade rests his hand on his pistol.  It is dead silent but 
	for the MUSIC on the box.

				BUDDY
		You ever shoot anybody was looking 
		you in the eye?

				WADE
		Who said anything about shootin' 
		anybody?

	Buddy has his gun out under the table.  He slowly brings it 
	up and lays it flat on the table, not taking his hand off it 
	or his eyes off Wade.

				BUDDY
		Whole different story; isn't it?

				WADE
		You're fired. You're outta the 
		department.

				BUDDY
		There's not a soul in this county 
		isn't sick to death of your bullshit, 
		Charley. You made yourself scarce, 
		you could make a lot of people happy.

				WADE
		You little pissant--

				BUDDY
		Now or later, Charley. You won't 
		have any trouble finding me.

	Wade feels the people around him waiting for a reaction.  He 
	leans close to Buddy to croak in a hoarse whisper.

				WADE
		You're a dead man.

	He turns and nearly bumps into Hollis. He gives the Deputy a 
	shove.

				WADE
		Get the goddamn car. We're going to 
		Roderick's.

	CU BUDDY

	He watches till the screen door shuts behind them, then 
	holsters his gun and begins to saw at the steak as if nothing 
	had happened. He calls softly--

				BUDDY
		Muchacho--mas cerveza por favor.

	He looks up at somebody and we PAN till we see Sam, still 
	standing over the booth, listening. We are back in 1995--

				HOLLIS (O.S.)
		"Mas cerveza por favor."

				FENTON (O.S.)
		That Buddy was a cool breeze.

	We PULL BACK to see Hollis and his buddies at the table, 
	eating their lunches as they listen.

				FENTON
		Charley Wade were known to have put 
		a good number of people in the ground, 
		and your daddy gets eyeball to eyeball 
		with him.

				HOLLIS
		We made our collection at Roderick's 
		place and that was the last anybody 
		seen hide nor hair of him.  He went 
		missing the next day, along with ten 
		thousand dollars in county funds 
		from the safe at the jail.

				SAM
		Never heard from him again?

				HOLLIS
		Not a peep. Buddy run the man out of 
		town.

				FENTON
		Buddy Deeds said a thing, he damn 
		well backed it up. Won't be another 
		like him.

				SAM
		So he arrested all of Jimmy Herrera's 
		people and sent 'em back to the other 
		side?

	Hollis sees what Sam is getting at, grins--

				HOLLIS
		Oh--he come to an accommodation. 
		Money doesn't always need to change 
		hands to keep the wheels turning.

				SAM
		Right.

				HOLLIS
		Look, I know you had some problems 
		with your father, and he and Muriel-- 
		well--

				FENTON
		Your mother was a saint.

				HOLLIS
		--but Buddy Deeds was my salvation.

	Sam nods, speaks softly--

				SAM
		Won't be another like him.

	EXT. ARMY INSTALLATION -- DAY -- CU DEL PAYNE

	COLONEL DELMORE PAYNE (DEL), a very direct, by-the-book Black 
	officer, addresses them. Artillery pieces angle toward the 
	sky behind him--

				DEL
		--it's an honor for me to assume 
		command of this unit, and I look 
		forward to working with all of you.

	OFFICERS Cliff and Mikey, in uniform now, flank SERGEANT 
	PRISCILLA WORTH, a Black woman in her early 40s, as they 
	stand in formation--

				DEL (O.S.)
		I'm sure you're all aware of the 
		Army's decision to close this 
		installation under the Reduction in 
		Force plan. That does not mean, 
		however--

	REVERSE

	We look over the shoulders of assembled OFFICERS and NCOs 
	toward Del.

				DEL
		--that we've been sent here to mark 
		time until we are absorbed by another 
		unit.

	CU DEL

				DEL
		You may have heard rumors that I run 
		a very tight operation. These rumors 
		are not exaggerated.

	INT. SHERIFF'S OFFICE -- AFTERNOON -- BUDDY PHOTO

	We are looking through a magnifying glass at an old photo. 
	Buddy's face is slightly distorted by the glass.

				SECRETARY (O.S.)
		Sam? I got Danny Padilla from the 
		paper for you--

	Sam sits at his desk in the Sheriff's office, looking down 
	at the photo--

				SAM
		Tell him I'll catch him later.

	CU PHOTOGRAPH

	An old photo of the 1957 Sheriff's Department officers on 
	the courthouse steps. Wade, Hollis, Buddy, a few others, all 
	in uniform.

				SECRETARY (O.S.)
		He says he needs to talk to you before 
		the ceremony, Sam.

	Sam puts a magnifying glass over the photo and bends close 
	to look.

				SAM
		Tell him to try me tomorrow.

	EXTREME CU PHOTO -- BADGE

	MAGNIFIED POV of the badge on Wade's chest swims into view. 
	A metal star. We hear the secretary getting rid of the caller.

				SECRETARY (O.S.)
		He thinks you're trying to duck  
		him.

	CU SAM

	Looking at the photo, troubled--

				SAM
			(Mutters)
		He's right.

	EXT. BIG O'S ROADHOUSE -- NIGHT -- NEON SIGN

	We start on a BLINKING SIGN--BIG O'S, then PAN to see a full 
	parking lot outside the low, neon-lit roadhouse. R&B MUSIC 
	blasts from inside.

	EXT. DOORWAY -- CHET

	CHET, a Black kid around 15, stands nervously at the door 
	building up his courage.  He takes a deep breath, plunges 
	in.

	INT. BIG O'S

	We TRACK with Chet, very nervous, as he makes his way through 
	the crowded roadhouse. The customers are all Black, many 
	from the nearby Army post, SHOUTING and LAUGHING over the 
	loud MUSIC. Chet, edgy, is looking for somebody.  He sees...

	CHET'S POV -- OTIS

	Seen through the crush is OTIS "BIG O" PAYNE, a large man in 
	his early 60s, laughing as he stands behind the bar.

	CHET

	He nervously puts his hand under his jacket. A gun? He pushes 
	forward to get a better view.

	CHET'S POV -- OTIS

	Moving in on him. Otis looks over, sees the boy, frowns--

	CHET

	Reaching under his jacket, he pulls out--a photograph. He 
	looks at it--suddenly there is a SCREAM from behind, then 
	GUNSHOTS, patrons diving for the floor.

	Chet whirls around and we WHIP PAN to see a young man, SHADOW, 
	emptying his pistol into RICHIE, a young soldier, as a young 
	woman, ATHENA, screams and tries to pull the gun away. With 
	the last shot, Shadow turns and heads for the door, but is 
	tackled and swarmed by angry men, SHOUTING.

	We PAN to Athena, kneeling over the bleeding, twitching body 
	of Richie--

	CHET

	Chet backs up, horrified. A large hand grasps him on the 
	shoulder from behind. He turns to see Otis standing over 
	him, strangely calm amid the chaos

				OTIS
		You weren't in here tonight, were  
		you?

				CHET
		No sir.

				OTIS
			(Points)
		Go out through the back.

	Chet hurries away.  Otis watches him for a moment, then turns 
	to the mess in his club.

	INT. AUDITORIUM -- NIGHT -- CU ANGLO MOTHER

	An angry woman stands from her auditorium chair--

				ANGLO MOTHER
		You're just tearin' everything  down!  
		Tearin' down our heritage, tearin' 
		down the memory of people that fought 
		and died for this land.

				CHICANO FATHER (O.S.)
		We fought and died for this land, 
		too!

	We WHIP PAN to see another standing parent--

				CHICANO FATHER
		We fought the U.S. Army, the Texas 
		Rangers--

				ANGLO FATHER (O.S.)
		Yeah, but you lost, buddy!

	We WHIP PAN to a man in the rear--

				ANGLO FATHER
		Winners get the bragging rights, 
		that's how it goes.

				PRINCIPAL (O.S.)
		People--people--

	WIDER

	We are in the High School auditorium, a hot-and-heavy teachers-
	and-parents meeting in progress. Pilar sits at the end of a 
	long table facing the agitated parents, taking some heat. 
	DANNY PADILLA, a young, long-haired reporter, sits in the 
	front taking notes, enjoying the show.

				PRINCIPAL
		I think it would be best not to put 
		things in terms of winners and losers--

				ANGLO MOTHER
			(Points at Pilar)
		Well, the way she's teachin' it has 
		got everything switched around. I 
		was on the textbook committee, and 
		her version is not--

				PRINCIPAL
		We think of the textbook as kind of 
		a guide, not an absolute--

				ANGLO MOTHER
		--it is not what we set as the 
		standard! Now you people can believe 
		what you want, but when it comes to 
		teaching our children--

				CHICANO MOTHER
		They're our children, too!

				ANGLO FATHER
		The men who founded this state have 
		a right to have their story--

				DANNY
		The men who founded this state broke 
		from Mexico because they needed 
		slavery to be legal to make a fortune 
		in the cotton business!

				PILAR
		I think that's a bit of an 
		oversimplification--

				ANGLO FATHER
		Are you reporting this meeting or 
		runnin' it, Danny?

				DANNY
		Just adding a little historical 
		perspective--

	REAR OF AUDITORIUM

	PALOMA CRUZ, Pilar's teenage daughter, peeks into the room, 
	then moves down the side toward the stage.

				ANGLO FATHER
		You may call it history, but I call 
		it propaganda. I'm sure they got 
		their own account of the Alamo on 
		the other side, but we're not on the 
		other side, so we're not about to 
		have it taught in our schools!

				PILAR
		There's no reason to be so threatened 
		by this--

	Pilar is trying to stay calm despite her anger.

				PILAR
		I've only been trying to get across 
		some of the complexity of our 
		situation down here--cultures coming 
		together in both negative and positive 
		ways.

				ANGLO MOTHER (O.S.)
		If you mean like music and food and 
		all, I have no problem with that.

	REVERSE

	We shoot past Pilar toward the parents in their seats. PALOMA 
	steps up to whisper to her.

				ANGLO MOTHER
		--but when you start changing who 
		did what to who.

				TEACHER
		We're not changing anything, we're 
		presenting a more complete picture.

				ANGLO MOTHER
		And that's what's got to stop!

	Pilar looks troubled by what she's heard. She shoots a look 
	toward the others at the table, then slips away with Paloma--

				TEACHER
		There's enough ignorance in the world 
		without us encouraging it in the 
		classroom--

				ANGLO MOTHER
		Now who are you calling ignorant?

				PRINCIPAL
		Folks, I know this is a very emotional 
		issue for some of you, but we do 
		have other business to attend to--

				CHICANO FATHER
		We're not going to get some resolution 
		on this?

	CU PRINCIPAL

	Weary--

				PRINCIPAL
		Would you people like to form another 
		committee?

	GROANS from the parents--

	INT. SHERIFF'S OFFICE -- NIGHT -- SHADOW

	Shadow, face bruised, hands cuffed behind him, is pushed in 
	through the door to be booked.

				SHADOW
		I hope the sucker does die, man! 
		Mess with me, that's what you get!

	Sam steps in behind him and meets his Chief Deputy RAY 
	HERNANDEZ, coming from the other direction.

				RAY
		Hospital says the other kid is in 
		bad shape--

				SAM
			(Glances ahead)
		The shooter local?

				RAY
			(Shakes his bead)
		Down from Houston. I think he knew 
		the girl before.

				SAM
		Okay--we'll take a statement from 
		all the GIs before they go back to 
		post. You can get the story from 
		Otis over at the club.

				RAY
		Any poop on the John Doe you found 
		out there today?

				SAM
		Nothin' much. The Rangers put Ben 
		Wetzel on it. Catch you later.

	As Ray steps out, Pilar looking distraught, walks into the 
	station, passing right by Sam without seeing him.

	CU SAM

	Wonders what she's doing there--

	SAM'S POV -- PILAR

	She stands by an unoccupied reception desk, very upset, unable 
	to attract anyone's attention because of the activity around 
	the shooting.  She looks tired and a bit scared under the 
	harsh overhead light.

				SAM (O.S.)
		Pilar.

	PILAR AND SAM

	Pilar looks around. Sam is standing by her. We can tell there 
	is some history between these two.

				SAM
		Something wrong?

				PILAR
		They've got my Amado.

				SAM
		Got him here?

				PILAR
		Somebody called--something about an 
		electronics store.

				SAM
		I'll see what's going on.

	He starts away, stops, comes back--

				SAM
		I was--I was real sorry about Nando. 
		He was a good fella. We haven't talked 
		since.

				PILAR
		We haven't talked since high school.

				SAM
		Yeah. I'll go check on your boy.

	Pilar watches Sam go--

	REAR OF OFFICE

	Travis sits typing away at a word processor as Athena, in 
	tears, gives testimony.

				ATHENA
		--so Richie just didn't say nothin' 
		'cause he didn't want to get into 
		it, see, and the next thing I know 
		there's shots and Richie is down. It 
		happened so fast--

				SAM (O.S.)
		Excuse me--

	We WIDEN to see Sam standing over the desk--

				SAM
		We got some boys you run in earlier 
		today?

				TRAVIS
		Yeah. I pulled the bunch that hangs 
		at Pico Bernal's place. We finally 
		caught them with something.

				SAM
		You got a juvenile with 'ern--Amado 
		Cruz?

	Travis looks at his booking sheets--

				TRAVIS
		Yeah--let's see--the other ones say 
		he wasn't in on the theft, he just 
		knows how to hook things up. We've 
		been trying to contact a parent.

	INT. JAIL HALLWAY

	Sam walks with Amado, who is trying to look defiant--

				SAM
		They tell me you're good at fixing 
		things.

	Nothin--

				SAM
		Your father was a hell of a mechanic.

	Still nothing--

				SAM
		You know, if you figure minimum wage 
		on the time most thieves spend in 
		jail, they could have bought most 
		everything they stole.

				AMADO
		I didn't steal anything.

				SAM
		I didn't say you did. My name is 
		Sam, by the way.

	Amado just gives him a look--

	INT. SHERIFF'S OFFICE

	Sam and AMADO step out into the office, where Pilar stands 
	waiting.

				SAM
		He's all yours.

				PILAR
		Are you okay?

				AMADO
		I don't know what the big deal is.

				PILAR
		You'll find out when I get you home. 
		Thanks, Sam.

				SAM
		No problem.

	Pilar yanks AMADO outside by his arm. She turns to shoot a 
	look back at Sam, then steps out through the glass door.

	CU SAM

	Watching her go--

				SAM
		Any time.

							 FADE OUT:

	EXT. OBSTACLE COURSE -- MORNING -- PIT

	We shoot up from a pit in the ground. WHUMP! WHUMP! WHUMP! 
	Three men leap over, landing on the far side and running 
	away from us.

	MEN

	Del Payne runs with Cliff and Mikey on a pathway along a 
	security fence, the two sergeants struggling to keep up, 
	occasionally vaulting or scaling some mild obstacle.

				MIKEY
		There's not that much down here, 
		Colonel. Big O's is the only place 
		in the county that our African 
		American soldiers are uhm--that they 
		feel comfortable in.

				DEL
		Have we had trouble there before?

				CLIFF
		Since I've been stationed here? A 
		fistfight now and then--

				MIKEY
		We had a kid pass out in the men's 
		room. The town isn't much.

				DEL
		They didn't come for a vacation.

				CLIFF
		Yes sir.

				MIKEY
		You know how it is, Colonel--first 
		time away from home, dealing with 
		new people--I remember my first hitch--

				DEL
		Substance abuse?

				MIKEY
		Well, yeah, but I went through the 
		Program. I haven't had a drink since--

				DEL
		I meant on the post. In general. How 
		are you dealing with it?

				CLIFF
		We throw a urine test at them once a 
		month. Random numbers, maybe a hundred 
		people at a time

				DEL
		Why don't we make it once a week for 
		a while?

				CLIFF
		No problem, sir.

	Del notices bow hard they are breathing--

				DEL
		I sprint the last quarter mile. You 
		gentlemen don't have to keep up if 
		you don't care to.

				MIKEY
		Appreciate it, sir.

	Del accelerates and we HOLD with the sergeants, slowing to a 
	near-walk.

				MIKEY
		Guy cracks walnuts with his asshole.

				CLIFF
			(Grins)
		You get the feeling he doesn't want 
		to be here?

	INT. FORENSICS LAB -- VARIOUS SHOTS

	We hear Hank Williams' gospel song "I'll Have a New Body 
	(I'll Have a New Life)" as we see the gathered bones of the 
	skeleton tagged and photographed and measured, impressions 
	made of the dental work in the skull, photographs of the 
	excavation of the body at various stages marked with red 
	grease pencil, the piece of metal laid in a de-tarnishing 
	dish, the ring put under a microscope.

	CU METAL

	MUSIC CONTINUES as we TIGHTEN on the piece of metal, a pair 
	of tongs pulling it from the de-tarnishing solution. It is a 
	star-shaped badge, bearing the words "SHERIFF--RIO COUNTY."

	INT. COUNTRY AND WESTERN BAR -- AFTERNOON

	C&W MUSIC playing, the regulars starting to show up. Sam 
	makes his way to a table where BEN WETZEL, a Texas Ranger, 
	sits with a file of forensic reports.

				BEN
		Sam the Man.

				SAM
		Hey, Ben. Thanks for coming down.

	They shake, Sam sits.

				BEN
		How's business?

				SAM
		Business is booming. Got your drugs, 
		got your illegals--had a shooting 
		the other night at Big O's--Soldier 
		got ventilated.

				BEN
		I hear they're closing that post 
		down.

				SAM
		September '97, that's all she wrote.

				BEN
		Gonna pull a lot of jobs out of this 
		county.

				SAM
		Yeah, we'll have folks swimming over 
		to Mexico to work in the sweatshops.

	Sam looks at the folder of reports.

				SAM
		That the word on our boy?

				BEN
		Yeah, this is Skinny.

				SAM
		Skinny?

				BEN
		We find a body, it's either Skinny 
		or Stinky, depending on how much 
		meat there is on the bones.

				SAM
		Nice job.

				BEN
			(Opens folder)
		Male, 40 to 50 years old, five-foot-
		eleven, chewed tobacco--then we get 
		into the dental records--

				SAM
		Charley Wade.

				BEN
			(Nods)
		That badge--

				SAM
		--it didn't come out of a cereal 
		box.

				BEN
		Yeah.

				SAM
		You know the popular version of how 
		he left town.

				BEN
		Everybody on the border knows that 
		story.

				SAM
		You got a cause of death?

				BEN
		Skull was intact, no soft tissue 
		left--not much to go on.

				SAM
		So he could have gone out to the 
		base, hopped the fence, dug down 
		into the dirt on the old rifle range 
		and had a heart attack.

	Ben smiles, closes the folder--

				BEN
		You uhm--you remember what old Buddy 
		carried for a side arm?

				SAM
		Colt Peacemaker.

				BEN
		A .45--

				SAM
		He swore by it.
			(Ben frowns)
		What?

				BEN
		Just wondering.

				SAM
		So is Buddy on your short list?

				BEN
		If it was some poor mojado, swam 
		across at night, got lost in the 
		scrub and starved out there, we 
		wouldn't go any further. But this is 
		a formerly prominent citizen.

				SAM
		You got to investigate. No question 
		about it.

				BEN
		What I will do is keep names out of 
		it till we got some answers or hit a 
		dead end. You know how the press is 
		with a murder story--even if it's 
		forty years old.

				SAM
		Yeah, it's a pretty cold trail.

	They sit in awkward silence for a moment. Ben feels bad about 
	it.

				BEN
		I remember Charley Wade come to my 
		father's hardware store once when I 
		was a little boy. I'd heard stories 
		how he shot this one, how he shot 
		that one--man winked at me and I 
		peed in my pants.
			(Shakes his head)
		Winked at me.

	INT. CLASSROOM -- DAY

	Pilar stands at the blackboard by her outline of 19th century 
	Texas history.

				PILAR
		Okay, we have the fight against the 
		Spanish with bloody conflict for 
		dozens of years till they're finally 
		defeated in 1821 and Mexican 
		independence is declared. Anglo 
		settlers are invited--

	CU DRAWING

	Somebody making a skillful pencil drawing on the corner of a 
	sheet of lined notebook paper. A bald, muscular shotputter 
	after releasing the shot, his hand large in the f.g.

				PILAR (O.S.)
		--to colonize the area and by the 
		time they begin the movement against 
		Santa Anna they outnumber the Mexicans 
		here by four to one. The war between 
		Mexico--

	CHET

	Drawing intently. He takes the notebook and lays his thumb 
	over the corner.

				PILAR (O.S.)
		and the Anglo forces ends in 1836 
		with the formation of the Texas 
		Republic. Texas joins the United 
		States as a state where slavery is 
		legal in 1845--

	NOTEBOOK

	Chet "flips" the corner of the notebook and the series of 
	drawings he's made form a brief cartoon of the shot-putter 
	blowing his cheeks out and heaving the shot right past us. 
	Extremely well-drawn--

				PILAR (O.S.)
		after the so-called Mexican war and 
		then secedes to join the Confederacy 
		in 1861. The Confederacy is beaten, 
		and the Reformation period here is 
		marked by range wars and race wars--

	PILAR

	Looking out at the class--

				PILAR
		--and all this paralleled by constant 
		battles between both the Mexican and 
		Anglo settlers and the various Indian 
		nations in the area. What are we 
		seeing here? Chet?

	CHET

	Startled, he hides the notebook under his hands --

				CHET
		Uhm--everybody is killing everybody 
		else?

	EXT. LAKE -- DAY -- CU FISHING LURE

	A nasty-looking thing. Only a bass would want to eat this. 
	Hollis leans in to peer at the thing dangling before his 
	face.

	WIDER

	Hollis sits in the swivel chair of a bass boat tied to a 
	dock at the lake, going through his box of lures. Sam appears 
	on the dock and steps down.

				SAM
		I always wondered what you Mayors do 
		when you're not cutting ribbons.

				HOLLIS
		Sam! Hey podner! You caught me playing 
		hooky--

				SAM
			(Looks across lake)
		Floating around out here, playin' 
		hell with them bass--play a little 
		cards, play a little golf, drink 
		some beer--

				HOLLIS
		Sounds great. Where do I sign up?

				SAM
		I haven't been out here for a while.

				HOLLIS
		You go by your old house?

				SAM
		No.

				HOLLIS
		Just as well. The new people just 
		painted it some God-awful color--

				SAM
		We found a body out by the Army base 
		yesterday. Been there for a long 
		time.

	Hollis squints at a rubber lure, rejects it--

				HOLLIS
		Was it Davy Crockett or Jim Bowie?

				SAM
			(Smiles)
		You recall if Charley Wade was a 
		Mason?

				HOLLIS
		Charley? I believe he was. Used to 
		go for lodge meetings over to Laredo. 
		What's he got to do with your body?

				SAM
		All it was wearing was a big old 
		Masonic ring and a Rio County Sheriffs 
		badge.

	Hollis reacts. Sam puts a foot on the gunwale of the boat.

				SAM
		You don't remember anything else 
		from that last night you saw him, do 
		you?

				HOLLIS
		I told the story enough times--hell, 
		we were just in the car, he was 
		stewing about the fight with Buddy 
		while we drove over to Roderick 
		Bledsoe's--

				SAM
		Bledso

				HOLLIS
		He owned the colored roadhouse before 
		Big O--

				SAM
		He still living?

				HOLLIS
		No. I think his widow's still in 
		their place in Darktown, though.
			(Shakes his bead)
		You think it's Charley Wade, huh?

				SAM
		Forensics people are sure of it. You 
		have any idea who might have put him 
		there?

	Hollis makes a great show of considering--

				SAM
		Besides my father, I mean.

				HOLLIS
		There's no call for that, Sam. Fella 
		made himself a pile of enemies over 
		the years.

				SAM
		And Buddy was one of them.

				HOLLIS
		We got that dedication tomorrow. 
		This is a hell of a time to be 
		draggin' up old business.

				SAM
		People have worked this whole big 
		thing up around my father. If it's 
		built on a crime, they deserve to 
		know. Now I understand why you might 
		want to believe he couldn't do it.

				HOLLIS
		And I understand why you might want 
		to think he could.

	This is a low blow, but accurate enough to shake Sam.

				SAM
		Thanks for your time, Hollis.

	Hollis holds up a double handful of lures--dozens of rubber 
	and plastic worms and shiners and frogs and spinners--

				HOLLIS
		Look at all this, would you? My 
		tackle, the boat, all to catch a 
		little old fish just minding its 
		business on the bottom of the lake.

	He gives Sam a look--

				HOLLIS
		Hardly seems worth the effort--does 
		it, Sam? Sam walks away--

	INT. CLASSROOM -- ARMY BASE -- DAY -- CU ATHENA

	Athena stands at attention, trying to keep her composure--

				CLIFF (O.S.)
		So you knew this young man before?

				ATHENA
		From back in Houston. We both come 
		up on Fifth Street.

				PRISCILLA (O.S.)
		Did you know he was going to be there 
		last night?

				ATHENA
		If I had I wouldn't have gone in.

				PRISCILLA (O.S.)
		And you and Private Graves--

				ATHENA
		We were just dancing--

	WIDER

	Cliff leans against a desk, a blackboard covered with radar 
	diagrams behind him. Priscilla sits nearby, both of them 
	focused on Athena.

				PRISCILLA
		We're not running a dating service 
		here.

				ATHENA
		I know that, Sergeant. We were just 
		dancing. There was a bunch of us 
		there. Shadow just come down looking 
		for trouble.

				CLIFF
		It's not our job to get involved in 
		your personal life, but when it 
		interferes with the training here--

				ATHENA
		I'm sorry, Sergeant Major. There 
		wasn't anything I could do. Shadow 
		gets crazy--

	A silence as the sergeant lets her stew for a moment. She 
	works up her courage--

				ATHENA
		Sergeant Major? How is Richie doing? 
		Private Graves?

				CLIFF
		He'll live.

				PRISCILLA
		He'll be transferred to a military 
		hospital as soon as he's stabilized--

				CLIFF
		He'll probably be getting a medical 
		discharge--

				ATHENA
		Out of the Army?

				CLIFF
		He's going to lose a lung. This is 
		not good news for Athena--

				ATHENA
		Will this go on my record?

	Cliff considers for a long moment--

				CLIFF
		If the incident happened the way you 
		say it did, there hasn't been an 
		infraction.

				ATHENA
		Thank you, Sergeant Major.

				CLIFF
		You're dismissed.

				ATHENA
		Thank you, Sergeant Major.

	Athena steps out of the room. Cliff sits on the desk--

				PRISCILLA
		You spoil 'em, Cliff.

				CLIFF
		Hey--she's in a tough situation. I 
		cut her some slack--

				PRISCILLA
		But I'm the one in charge of her 
		sorry ass.

				CLIFF
		She's pulled herself out of a pretty 
		rough neighborhood.

	Crossing to the door--

				PRISCILLA
		And if she isn't careful she's gonna 
		slide right back into it.

	EXT. BLEDSOE HOUSE -- DAY -- ROCKER

	We start on a CU of a rocker creaking back and forth on an 
	old wooden porch. A WOMAN HUMS.

	MINNIE

	MINNIE BLEDSOE, in her 60s, sits on her porch in the old 
	Black section of town, playing with a Gameboy. She has very 
	thick glasses on. Sam walks up to her from his car--

				SAM
		Mrs. Bledsoe?

				MINNIE
		That's me.

				SAM
		I'm Sheriff Deeds--

				MINNIE
		Sheriff Deeds' dead, honey--you just 
		Sheriff junior.

				SAM
			(Smiles)
		Yeah, that's the story of my life.

				MINNIE
		You ever play one of these?

				SAM
		I've seen 'em.

				MINNIE
		Well, don't ever start up on 'em, 
		cause once you do you can't stop. I 
		tell myself I'm gonna play just three 
		little games after breakfast, and 
		here I sit with half the day gone.

				SAM
		You mind if I ask a few questions 
		about your husband? Roderick?

				MINNIE
		I won't say nothing bad about the 
		man, but you can ask away.

				SAM
		He had the club out on the old trail 
		road--

				MINNIE
		We run that twenty-odd years. Give 
		it over to Otis Payne in 1967. April.

				SAM
		So you must remember Sheriff Wade.

				MINNIE
		Not if I can help it.

				SAM
		You had to deal with him in running 
		the club.

				MINNIE
		Them days, you deal with Sheriff 
		Wade or you didn't deal at all. First 
		of the month, every month, he remind 
		you of who you really workin' for.

				SAM
		He squeezed money out of you?

				MINNIE
		Wasn't legal to sell liquor in a 
		glass back then unless you was a 
		club, see. Roderick used to say, 
		"Buy yourself a drink, you get a 
		free membership." But Sheriff Wade, 
		he could shut you down anytime.

				SAM
		And my father?

				MINNIE
		Sheriff Buddy was a different story. 
		Long as Roderick throw his weight 
		the right way on election day, make 
		sure all the colored get out to vote-
		we was called colored back then, if 
		you was polite--maybe throw a barbecue 
		for the right people now and then, 
		things was peaceful. That Sheriff 
		Wade, though, he took an awful big 
		bite.

				SAM
		People didn't complain?

				MINNIE
		Not if they was colored or Meskin. 
		Not if they wanted to keep breathin'.

				SAM
		Do you remember the last time you 
		saw him?

	Minnie thinks, puts down the Gameboy--

				MINNIE
		I seen him in our place the last 
		week before he gone missin'.

	We TRACK in to a close-up of her. R&B MUSIC FADES UP slowly--

				MINNIE
		He used to come in whilst we was in 
		full swing, make people nervous. Had 
		him a smile like the Grim Reaper--

						 DISSOLVE TO:

	INT. ROADHOUSE --

	The joint is crowded, people drinking, talking, laughing, a 
	few dancing, all trying to avoid locking eyes with Sheriff 
	Wade, who sits with his legs stretched out at a table.

	Young Hollis sits by him, smiling uncomfortably. Sax-wailing 
	R&B blasts from the jukebox. YOUNG OTIS, a slick, confident 
	character with straightened hair and a silk shirt on, in his 
	early 20s, stops to talk with a MAN on his way to bring a 
	tray with a couple beers and glasses over.

				MINNIE (V.O.)
		--just sit back with his hand on 
		that big ol' gun and act the kingfish 
		with everybody. Otis Payne had come 
		to work for us by then, and that boy 
		had him some attitude--

	CU WADE

	Watching Young Otis with narrowed eyes--

	CU WADE'S POV -- OTIS

	A man puts a slip of paper in Otis's pocket, pats his back. 
	Otis winks to acknowledge the bet, turns, makes eyes at a 
	PRETTY WOMAN sitting at the bar, who is eyeing him back.  He 
	lays the beers and glasses on the table, starts away.

				WADE
		Pour it.

	OTIS TURNS, CUPS HIS HAND AROUND HIS EAR-

				WADE
		Pour it.

	Expressionless, he starts to pour the beer into Wade's glass. 
	The Sheriff looks up into his face--

				WADE
		I know you?

				YOUNG OTIS
		Name's Otis.

				WADE
		Otis what?

				YOUNG OTIS
		Payne.

				WADE
		One of Cleroe Payne's boys?

				YOUNG OTIS
		Uh-huh.

				WADE
		I sent your Daddy to the farm once.

				YOUNG OTIS
		I know that.

				WADE
		Why you think that was?

	Otis feels people watching.  He doesn't want to lose face--

				YOUNG OTIS
		Some crop needed pickin' and the man 
		was shorthanded.

	A very insolent answer for the time and place--

				WADE
		As I remember it was because he had 
		a sassy mouth on him. Must run in 
		the family--You wouldn't be runnin' 
		numbers out of this club, now, would 
		you, son?

				YOUNG OTIS
		Runnin' numbers illegal.

				WADE
		Runnin' numbers without I know about 
		it is both illegal and unhealthy. 
		You remember that.

	The beer is poured. Otis starts away--

				WADE
		Whoah, son. You're not finished. 
		Pour his.

				YOUNG HOLLIS
		I prefer it in the bottle--

				WADE
		Shut up, Hollis. Pour.

	Otis meets Wade's look now, pours the other beer--

				WADE
		How come you don't took familiar?

				YOUNG OTIS
		Been away. Up to Houston.

				WADE
		Houston, huh? I hear they let you 
		boys run wild up there.

	No response. Wade deliberately pushes the glass away so beer 
	splashes on the table and drips into Hollis's lap--

				WADE
		Aw--look what you done now. Better 
		get something to wipe it up, son.

	Half the people in the room are watching now, the other half 
	moving away to relative safety. Otis tries to keep a lid on 
	his temper, looks around the room--

				YOUNG OTIS
		You spilt it, you wipe it up.

	Wade stands, steely-eyed, and looks at Otis nose to nose--

				WADE
		I told you to do something. Are you 
		gonna hop to it, or are we gonna 
		have a problem?

	Otis is starting to shake, but holds his ground--

				WADE
		Don't want to turn tail in front of 
		your people. I understand.

	He starts to turn away then WHAP! brings the butt of his 
	pistol up under Otis's chin, knocking him to the floor. A 
	woman SCREAMS and Otis, enraged, grabs the chair he has fallen 
	over, starts to get up--but Wade has the pistol levelled at 
	his face--

				WADE
		Come on, Houston, give it a try! 
		Come to Poppa--

	RODERICK is out on the floor now, hands held out in a gesture 
	of peace, as YOUNG MINNIE watches from behind the bar, 
	petrified--

				RODERICK
		Don't mind him, Sheriff. Boy's just 
		a bit slow, is all. He don't mean 
		nothin' by it--

				WADE
		That the problem, son?  You Slow?

				RODERICK
		Otis, apologize to the Sheriff--

	Otis eases the chair down but doesn't say anything--

				RODERICK
		You got him too scared to peep, 
		Sheriff. Maybe if you put that gun 
		up--

				WADE
		You telling me what to do, Roderick?

				RODERICK
		No, Sheriff, I'm just--

	Wade looks around, widens his eyes in mock surprise--

				WADE
		What's this I see? Is that whiskey 
		in them glasses on the Bar? Roderick, 
		I'm gonna have to cite you for a 
		violation of state law--

				RODERICK
		This is a club, Sheriff--you been in 
		here--

				WADE
		And people better clear out of here! 
		Now!

	A few people start for the exit.  Wade swivels and BLAM sends 
	a bullet past Minnie that shatters a crystal decanter behind 
	the bar.  People run for the door. Wade squats down to look 
	Otis in the face--

	CU WADE

				WADE
		You learn how to act your place, 
		son. This idn't Houston.

	He stands and we FOLLOW him toward the bar--

				OTIS (V.O.)
		'Course I was young and full of beans 
		then--

	The camera passes Wade and instead of Minnie there stands 
	Otis, PRESENT DAY, reminiscing. We are back in '95--

				OTIS
		I didn't understand the spot I was 
		putting Roderick in.

				SAM
		And that was the last time you saw 
		him?

	We SHIFT to see Sam sitting where Wade was headed--

				OTIS
		Oh--I think he came in one more time 
		with Hollis and--naw, your Daddy 
		wasn't with them. Made their monthly 
		pickup. Roderick wasn't in so I just 
		kept my mouth good and shut and handed 
		over that envelope.

				SAM
		That was the night he disappeared?

				OTIS
			(Shakes his head)
		Could of been. That was white people's 
		business.

				SAM
		And when my father was Sheriff?

				OTIS
		What about it?

				SAM
		What was your deal with him?

	Otis smiles, chooses his words carefully--

				OTIS
		Buddy was more a part of the big 
		picture--county political machine,  
		chamber of commerce, zoning board if 
		I kept those people happy, he was 
		pretty much on my side.
			(Smiles)
		Whenever somebody thought--they start 
		up another bar for the black  folks, 
		they'd be--how should I put this? 
		They'd be officially discouraged.

				SAM
		He ever accept cash for a favor?

	Otis smiles, looks away to ponder his response--

				OTIS
		I don't recall a prisoner ever died 
		in your father's custody. I don't 
		recall a man in this town--Black, 
		White, Mexican--who'd hesitate a 
		minute before they'd call on Buddy 
		Deeds to solve a problem. More than 
		that I wouldn't like to say.

	INT. CAR -- LATE AFTERNOON

	Pilar drives Amado and her daughter Paloma home--

				AMADO
		If you had your way I wouldn't have 
		any friends.

				PILAR
		Oh, come on, Amado--

				AMADO
		Just 'cause I'm not like Little Miss 
		Honor Roll here--

				PILAR
		Leave your sister out of it.

				AMADO
		You and all of the teachers in this 
		dump--your story's over, so you don't 
		want anybody else to have fun.

	We see on PILAR's face that he has scored--

				PALOMA
		You jerk--

				AMADO
		I'm not talking to you. You don't 
		have any friends.

	PILAR eases the car down San Jacinto street, seeing something 
	on the street and she's tuning her kids' conversation out--

				PALOMA
		Who'd want to be friends with that 
		bunch of pachuco wannabes?

				AMADO
		I don't pretend I came over on the 
		Mayflower--

				PALOMA
		And those stupid girls who hang out 
		with them--

				AMADO
		Just shut up.

	PILAR'S POV -- SAM

	Sam walks on the sidewalk parallel to them, talking with 
	three other MEN--

				PALOMA (O.S.)
		Joanie Orozco's telling the whole 
		school she's like desperately in 
		love with Santo Guerra.

				AMADO (O.S.)
		So?

				PALOMA (O.S.)
		It's pathetic. You can't be 
		desperately in love when you're 14 
		years old.

	INT. PILAR'S CAR

	Pilar is still looking fixedly out the window--

				PALOMA
		Not if you have half a brain in your 
		head.

				PILAR
		Of course you can.

				PALOMA
		What?

				PILAR
		It doesn't have anything to do with 
		being smart.

	EXT. SAN JACINTO STREET -- LATE AFTERNOON

	Danny Padilla is arguing with H.L. BRIGGS, a construction 
	company big shot, and JORGE GUERRA, a Council member in his 
	40s and Sam, as they walk down the sidewalk of the main street--

				JORGE
		What I'm saying is, I don't see the 
		point. You had your chance when the 
		dedication committee was meeting--

				DANNY
		I've got new information--

				H.L.
		It's ancient goddarn history, Danny--

				DANNY
		1963, they dam up the north branch 
		to make Lake Pescadero. A whole little 
		town disappears--

				H.L.
		Squatter town--

				DANNY
		People had been living in Perdido 
		for over a hundred years. Mexicans 
		and Chicanos are deported, evicted, 
		moved forcibly out of their houses 
		by our local hero, Buddy Deeds, and 
		his department--

				JORGE
		There was a bill from the state 
		legislature--

				DANNY
		Families were split apart, a whole 
		community was destroyed--

				H.L.
		They were trespassing, Danny--

				DANNY
		--and who ends up with lakefront 
		property bought for a fraction of 
		the market price? Buddy Deeds, Sheriff 
		of Rio County, and his Chief Deputy, 
		Hollis Pogue.

	They all look at Sam, who has been listening patiently the 
	whole while.  They've reached his office.

				SAM
		You finished?

				DANNY
		Look, I'm not after you, Sam.  I 
		just think people in town ought to 
		know the full story on Buddy Deeds.

				SAM
			(Nods)
		That makes two of us.

	Sam steps into his office, leaving H.L. shaking his head--

				H.L.
		You best be thankful that's the son 
		and not the father. Buddy woulda 
		kicked your ass from here to sundown.

	INT. HALLWAY -- DEL'S HOUSE -- LATE AFTERNOON

	We TRACK down a hallway as Celie walks toward us, calling 
	ahead. Chet stands in the middle of the hall behind her.

				CELIE (O.S.)
		I don't see what the big deal is. Go 
		back over, talk to the man, and bury 
		the hatchet, Del--

	CELIE passes us and Del crosses back in the other direction 
	from behind the camera, carrying boxes of their belongings. 
	We continue our SLOW TRACK forward--

				DEL
		Otis Payne was never embarrassed 
		about a thing in his life.

				CHET
		Dad--

				CELIE (O.S.)
		You were 8 years old when he left--

				DEL
		He didn't leave, he moved three houses 
		down with one of my mother's best 
		friends.

				CHET
		Dad--?

				DEL
		"Hey, Delmore, where's your Daddy?"

	Del disappears into the bedroom at the end of the hall--

				DEL (O.S.)
		Everybody else's business. And 
		everybody loved Big O--

	DEL comes back out, empty-handed--

				DEL
		Big O was always there with a  smile 
		or a loan or a free drink.

				CHET
		Dad, can I talk to you about track?

				CELIE (O.S.)
		People change.

				DEL
		Not that much.

				CHET
		Dad, I talked to the track coach--

				DEL
		I thought we already had this out?  
		Next year, if your grades are high 
		enough--

				CHET
		I have a B average.

				DEL
		How many B-average students do you 
		think they take at West Point?

				CELIE (O.S.)
		We're going to have to see him.

				DEL
		No, we don't.

	Del steps away past us, leaving Chet, defeated--

	INT. CAFE -- NIGHT -- ENRIQUE

	We start on Enrique, talking surreptitiously on the pay phone 
	on the way to the kitchen.

				ENRIQUE
		Sabado por la noche--Is, es el  mas 
		seguero--a cruzar por la  manana y 
		pues tendremos que esperar--[Friday 
		night--Yes, that's the safest--I'll 
		cross in the morning and then we'll 
		have to wait--]

	Mercedes bustles by, snapping her fingers--

				MERCEDES
		Off the phone, by we've got people 
		waiting. Andale!

	We FOLLOW Mercedes back into the kitchen, where she moves 
	through, kibbitzing the operation--

	WAITRESS

	Mercedes stops by a young girl prepping a pork loin to be 
	cooked. She isn't wearing gloves.

				MERCEDES
		Donde estan sus guantes? Tonta! Quiere 
		matar a mis clientes? [Where are 
		your gloves? Stupid! You want to 
		kill my customers?]

	She continues past, shaking her bead, bringing us to Pilar, 
	who is trying to stay out of the way--

				MERCEDES
		These ones coming up are getting 
		stupider every year.

				PILAR
		Maybe you're just getting less 
		patient.

				MERCEDES
		If they're going to survive here, 
		they have to know how to work, Elalco! 
		Adelante! Los clientes esperan!

				PILAR
		Well, you hire illegals--

				MERCEDES
			(Indignant)
		Nobody is illegal in my cafe! They've 
		got green cards, they've got relatives 
		who were born here--if they only had 
		a little common sense I'd be very 
		happy.

				PILAR
		If you spent a little more time 
		training them--

				MERCEDES
		Did you come here to tell me how to 
		run my business?

				PILAR
		No. I was wondering if you'd like to 
		take a trip down south with us. Maybe 
		see where you grew up--

				MERCEDES
		Why would I want to go there?

				PILAR
		Oh, come on--you must be curious how 
		it's changed. Amado is into this big 
		Tejano roots thing and I've never 
		been further than Ciudad Leon--

				MERCEDES
		You want to see Mexicans, open your 
		eyes and look around you. We're up 
		to our ears in them.

	Pilar gives up on the trip. She watches her mother poking at 
	the plates of chips and salsa ready to go out--

				PILAR
		Mami, how old were you when my father--

				MERCEDES
		He was killed.

				PILAR
		Right. When he was killed.

				MERCEDES
		A little older than Paloma is now.

				PILAR
		How come you never got married again?

	Mercedes just glares at her--

				PILAR
		There must have been somebody.

				MERCEDES
			(Mutters)
		I was too busy.

				PILAR
		Nobody's too busy.

				MERCEDES
		Maybe now. It was different back 
		then. I had this place, I was doing 
		all the shopping, all the cooking. 
		What do I need some chulo with grease 
		under his nails to drink up the 
		profit?

				PILAR
			(Pissed off)
		Thank you.

				MERCEDES
		I don't mean Fernando.

				PILAR
		Mami, the first time I brought him 
		home, those were your exact words-- 
		"some chulo with grease under his 
		nails."

				MERCEDES
		I never said that.

				PILAR
		You made it pretty damn clear you 
		thought he was nobody.

				MERCEDES
		I felt that you could do better for 
		yourself--

				PILAR
		What? Become a nun? You didn't want 
		me going out with Anglos--

				MERCEDES
		I never said that. It was just that 
		boy--

				PILAR
		"That boy"--Mami, say his name for 
		chrissakes!

	The employees are staring. Mercedes won't look at her daughter 
	as she steps out of the kitchen, banging into Enrique on his 
	way back in--

				MERCEDES
		You people are stealing my money-- 
		Entiende? Robandome?

	Mercedes is gone. The young girl, pulling plastic gloves on, 
	looks to Pilar.

				GIRL
		Su madre? [Your mother?]

				PILAR
		Si.

	The girl puts her hand on her heart in sympathy--

				GIRL
		Lo siento [My condolences.]

	INT. COUNTRY AND WESTERN BAR -- NIGHT

	A crowded room, C&W MUSIC plays on the box. Sam sits behind 
	a bottle of beer as the bartender, CODY, in his early 50s 
	philosophizes.

				CODY
		Now I'm just as liberal as the next 
		guy--

				SAM
		If the next guy's a redneck.

				CODY
		--but I gotta say I think there's  
		something to this cold climate  
		business. I mean, you go to the beach-
		what do you do? Drink a few beers, 
		wait for a fish to flop up on the 
		sand. Can't build no civilization 
		that way. You got a hard winter 
		coming, though, you got to plan ahead, 
		and that gives your cerebral cortex 
		a workout.

				SAM
		Good deal you were born down here, 
		then.

				CODY
		You joke about it, Sam, but we are 
		in a state of crisis. The lines of 
		demarcation has gotten fuzzy--to run 
		a sucessfull civilization you got to 
		have lines of demarcation between 
		right and wrong, between this one 
		and that one--your Daddy understood 
		that. He was like the whatchacallit--
		the referee for this damn menudo we 
		got down here. He understood how 
		most people don't want their sugar 
		and salt in the same jar.

				SAM
		You mixed drinks bad as you mix 
		metaphors, you be out of a job.

				CODY
		Take that pair over in the corner--

	Sam swivels to look where Cody points--

				CODY
		Place like this, twenty years ago, 
		Buddy woulda been, on them two--

	SAM'S POV -- CORNER BOOTH

	Cliff and Priscilla talk across a table--

				CODY (O.S.)
		--warning. Not 'cause he had it in 
		for the colored

	SAM AND CODY

				CODY
		--but just as a kind of safety tip.

				SAM
		Yeah. I bet he would.

				CODY
		Old Sam stood for somethin', you 
		know? The day that man died they 
		broke the goddamn mold.

	BOOTH -- CLIFF AND PRISCILLA

	Things are obviously more than professional between these 
	two--

				PRISCILLA
		So where does that put us?

				CLIFF
		Well--I don't see what's changed. No -
		PDA's, no necking on the obstacle 
		course.

				PRISCILLA
		Seriously.

				CLIFF
		Seriously, I think we should get 
		married.

				PRISCILLA
		We been through this before--

				CLIFF
		We should just do it.

				PRISCILLA
		And if I get a shot at a promotion 
		somewhere--

				CLIFF
		You could take it--

				PRISCILLA
		It's up or out these days, Cliff. 
		Say I get transferred to a different 
		post--

				CLIFF
		I'd quit the Army for you, if it 
		came to that.

				PRISCILLA
			(Grins)
		Man's gonna retire in two years and 
		he offer to quit. Big goddamn deal.

				SAM (O.S.)
		Excuse me--

	They look up to see Sam standing over them--

				CLIFF
		Sheriff--hi--this is Sergeant--this 
		is Priscilla Worth.

				SAM
		Pleased to meet you.

				CLIFF
		Sheriff Deeds was in on our 
		archeological find yesterday.

				PRISCILLA
		It true they gonna build a shopping 
		mall out there?

				SAM
		If certain people have their way, 
		it's going to be a new jail.

				PRISCILLA
		Damn. Maybe we got in the wrong 
		business. They closin' down military 
		bases left and right, puttin' up 
		jails like 7-11 stores.

				SAM
		Do either of you have any idea when 
		they stopped using that site as a 
		rifle range?

				CLIFF
		They stopped training infantry there 
		in the late '50s. It was just a 
		playground for the jackrabbits till 
		they gave it to the county last year.

				PRISCILLA
		You know who it was they dug up?

				SAM
		Not for sure yet. But I kind of wish 
		they hadn't.

	EXT. CAFE -- NIGHT

	Enrique steps out of the darkened cafe, followed by Mercedes, 
	who locks up. Mercedes steps over to an expensive-looking 
	car--

				ENRIQUE
		Es muy lindo, su coche--

				MERCEDES
		En ingles Enrique. This is the United 
		States. We speak English.

				ENRIQUE
		Is very beautiful, your car.

				MERCEDES
		Good night, Enrique. She slides into 
		the car--

				ENRIQUE
		Buenas noches, Senora Cruz. Enrique 
		walks in the opposite direction--

							FADE OUT

	EXT. BIG O'S ROADHOUSE -- DAY -- CU DEL

	Del, in uniform, approaches the front door of Big O's, not 
	open for business yet. We TIGHTEN as he stops to read a 
	handlettered sign next to it: "BLACK SEMINOLE EXHIBIT REAR 
	ENTRANCE." He steps in--

	INT. ROADHOUSE

	Late-50s R&B plays on the JUKEBOX. Otis stands behind the 
	counter hooking the beer taps up. Del steps in and sits on a 
	stool at the far end of the bar, tense, looking around the 
	place. When Otis sees him, he stops dead. They lock eyes for 
	a moment, then Otis turns to call.

				OTIS
		Carolyn--knock that off for a minute.

	CAROLYN

	CAROLYN SYKES, an attractive woman maybe ten years younger 
	than Otis, pulls the plug from the jukebox near where she's 
	scrubbing bloodstains off the floor. She turns to look at 
	the newcomer--

	BAR

	Del doesn't move to come closer--

				DEL
		Black Seminoles?

				OTIS
			(Shrugs)
		Hobby of mine. Got some artifacts, 
		couple pieces one of your men out at 
		the base made. Free admission.

	Del nods toward where Carolyn is mopping--

				DEL
		That where he was shot?

				OTIS
		That's where he fell.

				DEL
		You get much of that in here?

				OTIS
		It's a bar. People come together, 
		drink, fall in love, fall out of 
		love, air their grudges out--

				DEL
		Deal drugs in the bathroom--

				OTIS
		If I thought it would help I'd put 
		up a sign telling them not to. Right 
		under the one about the employees 
		washing their hands.

	Carolyn has come over by Otis, lugging the bucket and mop--

				OTIS
		This here's Carolyn. Honey, this is 
		my son, Delmore.

				DEL
		Nice to meet you, Ma'am.

	Carolyn nods, shoots a look to Otis--

				CAROLYN
		I'll be in back waiting for that 
		delivery.

	They wail till she is gone to start again--

				OTIS
		So.

				DEL
		So tell me why I shouldn't make this 
		place off-limits.

				OTIS
		This is an official visit, then--

				DEL
		I assume a lot of your business is 
		from our people.

	Otis pulls a tap back and it coughs before squirting beer.

				OTIS
		Your boys out there cooped up 
		together, need somewhere they can 
		let the steam out. If they're Black, 
		there's not but one place in this 
		town they feel welcome. Been that 
		way since before you were born.

				DEL
		We have an enlisted man's club at 
		the post.

				OTIS
		Well, you're the Man out there now, 
		aren't you? It's your call.

				DEL
		That's right.

				OTIS
			(Smiles)
		I been hearing rumors about this new 
		commander coming for a couple weeks 
		now. Boys say they heard he's a real 
		hard case. Spit-and-polish man. Full-
		bird colonel name of Payne, they say-- 
		Bet you never figured you end up 
		back here.

				DEL
		The Army hands you a command, you go 
		wherever it is.

				OTIS
		Right.

				DEL
		I hear things, too.  People call  
		you the Mayor of Darktown.

				OTIS
			(Shrugs)
		Over the years, this is the one place 
		that's always been there. I loan a 
		little money out, settle some 
		arguments. Got a cot in the back- 
		people get afraid to go home they 
		can spend the night. There's not 
		enough of us to run anything in this 
		town- the white people are mostly 
		out on the lake now and the Mexicans 
		hire each other. There's the Holiness 
		Church and there's Big O's place.

				DEL
		And people make their choice--

				OTIS
			(Smiles)
		A lot of 'em choose both. There's 
		not like a borderline between the 
		good people and the bad people--you're 
		not either on one side or the other--

	Del looks away, not wanting to believe this--

				OTIS
			(Softly)
		I gonna meet that family of yours?

				DEL
		Why would you want to do that?

				OTIS
		Because I'm your father.

	Del gives him a dark look and lets the statement hang between 
	them. He gets up and heads for the door--

				DEL
		You'll get official notification 
		when I make my decision. He is out 
		the door--Otis pulls himself a beer 
		as Carolyn steps back out--

				CAROLYN
		So that's him--

				OTIS
		Yeah--that's him. Got two, three 
		thousand people under him out there, 
		you count the civilians.

				CAROLYN
		That must be a laugh a minute.

	EXT. SAN JACINTO STREET -- DAY

	Sam walks down the main street of town. A CROWD is gathering 
	at the other end for the ceremony--

				H.L. (O.S.)
		Sheriff!

	We WIDEN as H.L. and Jorge catch up to him. H.L. slaps Sam 
	on the back--

				H.L.
		Historic occasion, isn't it?

				SAM
		Seems like we have another one every 
		week.

				H.L.
		Jorge and his Chamber of Commerce 
		boys got to keep things hummin'--

				JORGE
		We're building up tourism, Sam--

				SAM
		People come here to catch bass and 
		to get laid at the Boy's Town in 
		Cuidad Leon--

				JORGE
		Sam--

				SAM
		You ought to put up a banner--
		"Frontera, Texas: Gateway to Cut-
		Rate Pussy"--

				H.L.
		That kind of talk doesn't help, Sam.

				SAM
		Rather have that than the ten-foot-
		high catfish statue--

				JORGE
		I got Eddie Richter at the Sentinel 
		to kill that story.

				SAM
		The Perdido thing?

				JORGE
		He agreed it wasn't exactly news--

				SAM
		Danny's gonna be out for blood the 
		next time.

				H.L.
		Which is why we need to talk to you 
		about the new jail--just so we're 
		all on the same page.

				SAM
		We don't need a new jail.

				H.L.
		That's a matter of interpretation--

				SAM
		We're already renting cells to the 
		Feds for their overflow--

				JORGE
		There was a mandate in the last 
		election--

				SAM
		It wouldn't happen to be your 
		construction company gonna get the 
		bid on building this thing, would 
		it, H.L. And Jorge, you wouldn't be 
		thinking about a couple dozen new 
		jobs to dangle in front of the voters--

				H.L.
		Dammit, Sam, the people are concerned 
		about crime--

				SAM
		We need a drug rehab program, we 
		need a new elementary school--

				JORGE
		There isn't money allocated for that. 
		But a jail--

				SAM
		Look, I'm not gonna campaign against 
		your deal here, but if anybody asks 
		me, I got to tell them the truth. We--
		don't--need--a new jail.

				H.L.
		When we backed you--

				SAM
		When you backed me you needed  
		somebody named Deeds to bump the  
		other fella out of office.  Hey,  
		folks--

	Sam and the others smile as they reach the CROWD of 
	townspeople, mostly small business owners and retired people. 
	Photographers from the paper and a local TV news crew wait 
	by a veiled Statue roped off in a little traffic island. 
	Mercedes, dressed to kill, stands waiting next to Hollis 
	with a huge pair of scissors in her hand.

	CU MERCEDES

	Slowly working the blades of the scissors, she looks coldly 
	at Sam--

	CU SAM

	He nods to her as the crowd opens a path for him.

				SAM
		Let's get this thing over with.

	INT. MIKEY'S WORKSHOP -- MORNING

	We start on a two-foot-high statue of a cowboy made from old 
	bullets and shell casings. We PAN past a few others, the 
	poses lifted from Frederic Remington paintings, till we see 
	Mikey, gluing together a work in progress, a Remington book 
	propped open in front of him. Cliff sits at the worktable 
	playing absently with the old bullets spilled out from MIKEY'S 
	bag

				MIKEY
		Never thought I'd see the day a buddy 
		of mine was dating a woman with three 
		up and three down on her shoulder.

				CLIFF
		I think it's beyond what you'd call 
		dating.

				MIKEY
		You going to get married?

				CLIFF
			(Shrugs)
		Maybe.

				MIKEY
		You met her family? They gonna be 
		cool about you being a white guy?

				CLIFF
		Priscilla says they think any woman 
		over 30 who isn't married must be a 
		lesbian. She figures they'll be so 
		relieved I'm a man--

				MIKEY
		Always heartwarming to see a prejudice 
		defeated by a deeper prejudice.  But 
		marriage, man--I did two tours in 
		Southeast Asia and I was married for 
		five years--I couldn't tell you which 
		experience was worse.

	Cliff picks up a slug--

				CLIFF
		Hey, Mikey--

				MIKEY
		I knew she was Japanese going into 
		it, but she didn't tell me the ninja 
		assassin part--

				CLIFF
		Mikey--

				MIKEY
		Her parents acted like I was gonna 
		blow my nose on their curtains--

				CLIFF
		Mikey--

				MIKEY
		If I stayed out past ten with the 
		guys she'd go into her Madame 
		Butterfly routine--

				CLIFF
		Mikey look at this--

				MIKEY
		What--it's a bullet. I'm lousy with 
		bullets here.

				CLIFF
		It's a .45.

				MIKEY
		Yeah?

				CLIFF
		This is the stuff we picked up the 
		other day, right? The rest of this 
		is all .30 caliber--

				MIKEY
		They were using M-1's, yeah--

				CLIFF
		What's it doing on a rifle range?

	MIKEY holds the slug in front of his face--

				MIKEY
		We better call that Sheriff.

	EXT. SAN JACINTO STREET -- DAY

	Hollis is finishing his oration, having put the crowd in a 
	good mood.

				HOLLIS
		Sometime in the early '70s a reporter 
		from a national magazine was talking 
		to the governor of our Lone Star 
		state, and he asked him, "Governor, 
		what's your ideal of what a real 
		Texan ought to be?" Governor said, 
		"That's easy, son- you just go down 
		to Rio County and get a look at 
		Sheriff Buddy Deeds."

	Applause--

	SAM

	Watching the crowd--

	SAM'S POV

	We PAN with his gaze across smiling faces, till he comes to 
	Danny and a couple of Chicano friends, looking grim. We RACK 
	FOCUS beyond them to see Pilar, watching the ceremony from a 
	few yards back--

				HOLLIS (O.S.)
		Thank you. We've got one more person 
		to hear from--

	HOLLIS

				HOLLIS
		--and he's somebody who probably 
		knew Buddy better than any of us, 
		Sam--would you say a few words?

	SAM

	Not thrilled to be called on. He steps forward reluctantly 
	to APPLAUSE--

				SAM
		You folks who remember my father 
		knew him as Sheriff. But at home he 
		was also judge, jury

	He looks to Hollis--

				SAM
		--and executioner.

	LAUGHTER. Sam holds Hollis's eyes for a moment before 
	continuing--

				SAM
		This is a real honor you're doing 
		him today, and if Buddy was around 
		I'm sure his hat size would be gettin' 
		bigger every minute.

	PILAR

	Watching--

				SAM (O.S.)
		I used to come to this park to hide 
		from him. Now that you're putting 
		his name on it--

	SAM

				SAM
		I'll have to find someplace new to 
		duck out.

	More LAUGHTER--

				SAM
		I do appreciate it, and wherever he 
		is, Buddy's puttin' the beer on ice 
		for the bunch of you. Thank you.

	APPLAUSE--

	Sam steps back and Mercedes steps forward with her scissors 
	without looking at him--

				HOLLIS
		And now my fellow Council member and 
		one of Frontera's most respected 
		businesswomen, Mrs. Mercedes Cruz, 
		will do the honors for us.

	MERCEDES

	She freezes, smiling, till the still photographers have gotten 
	their shots, then snips the cord to a pulley system that 
	lets the cloth drop--

	STATUE

	The cloth drops to reveal a bas-relief in brass set in a 
	block of smooth limestone.  A decent likeness of Buddy in 
	uniform, his hand on the shoulder of a small Chicano-looking 
	boy who stands beside him, eyes raised worshipfully.

	APPLAUSE from the gathering--

	SAM

	Watching, a bit removed, as Mercedes shakes hands with Jorge 
	and H.L. and Hollis for the cameras. He overhears a pair of 
	BYSTANDERS who are checking out the statue--

				BYSTANDER 1 (O.S.)
		It does look like old Buddy.

				BYSTANDER 2 (O.S.)
		Runnin that kid in for loiterin'--

	The bystanders LAUGH--Sam steps away, intercepting Mercedes 
	as she steps away--

				SAM
		Nice to see you, Mrs. Cruz.

	Mercedes just looks at him, keeps going. His gaze brings him 
	to Pilar, standing on the sidewalk, watching.

	SAM

	Steps over from the dispersing crowd--

				SAM
		Field trip?

				PILAR
		Lunch hour. My next class isn't till 
		nine-thirty.

				SAM
		Want to take a walk?

	EXT. RIVERSIDE -- DAY

	Sam and PILAR walk together alongside the Rio--

				SAM
		Your mother still doesn't like me.

				PILAR
		I can't name anybody she does like 
		these days.

				SAM
		I see she built a place up here by 
		the river.

				PILAR
		A real palace. She rattles around 
		alone in that thing--

				SAM
		She's done well for herself--on her 
		own and all--

				PILAR
		So she tells me three times a week.

	She looks at him--

				PILAR
		I thought you got through that pretty 
		well.

				SAM
		They cooked the whole thing up without 
		asking me.

				PILAR
		People liked him.

				SAM
		Most people did, yeah.

				PILAR
		I remember him watching me once. 
		When I was little--before you and I--

	She shrugs.

				PILAR
		I was on the playground with all the 
		other kids, but I thought he was 
		only looking at me. I was afraid he 
		was going to arrest me--he had those 
		eyes, you know--

				SAM
		Yeah.

				PILAR
		Weird what you remember.

	They walk in silence a moment--

				SAM
		Your boy, there--

				PILAR
		Amado.

				SAM
		Nice-looking kid.

				PILAR
		He hates me.

				SAM
		No--

				PILAR
		With Paloma, it's more like she pities 
		and tolerates me- totally age-
		appropriate. But Amado--he's--he's 
		never been book-smart. Had a hard 
		time learning to read. Me being a 
		teacher and caring about those things 
		is like an embarrassment--like a 
		betrayal.

				SAM
		Fernando did okay, and he dropped 
		out--

				PILAR
		Fernando wasn't pissed off at 
		everybody. He just wanted to fix 
		their cars.

				SAM
		It might just be the age. I spent my 
		first fifteen years trying to be 
		just like Buddy and the next fifteen 
		trying to give him a heart attack.

	She looks at him--

				PILAR
		So why did you come back here, Sam?

				SAM
		Got divorced, I wasn't gonna work 
		for my father-in-law anymore. The 
		fellas down here said they'd back me--

				PILAR
		You don't want to be Sheriff.

				SAM
		I got to admit it's not what I thought 
		it'd be. Back When Buddy had it--
		hell, I'm just a jailer. Run a 60-
		room hotel with bars on the windows.

				PILAR
		It can happen so sudden, can't it? 
		Being left out on your own.

				SAM
		You've got your mother, your kids--

				PILAR
		They've got me. Different thing.

	They stop at a spot where you can climb down the bank--

				SAM
		Remember this?

	Pilar looks at the spot. She isn't ready to deal with whatever 
	memory it brings back--

				PILAR
		I should get back.

				SAM
		Pilar--

				PILAR
		Looks real bad if the teacher's late 
		for class. It's really nice to talk 
		with you, Sam.

	She waves and walks away, feeling awkward. Sam watches for a 
	minute, then turns and steps down to the bank, He looks at 
	the water.

	RIVER SURFACE

	A little piece of tree bark is tossed onto the water and 
	drifts away with the current. We TILT UP to see YOUNG PILAR 
	tossing bark into the river as YOUNG SAM sits on the bank 
	beside her. They are 14 and 15 years old--It is 1972--

				YOUNG SAM
		You going to tell her?

				YOUNG PILAR
		You going to tell him?

				YOUNG SAM
		He doesn't need to know all my 
		business.

				YOUNG PILAR
		He's gonna find out.

				YOUNG SAM
		So? What's he gonna do, arrest us?

	Young Pilar frowns, tosses more bark--

				YOUNG PILAR
		It's supposed to be some big sin, 
		even if you love each other.

				YOUNG SAM
		You believe that?

	CU YOUNG PILAR

	She turns to look at him--

				YOUNG PILAR
		No.

	We PAN with her gaze to see Sam, PRESENT DAY, sitting on the 
	bank, lost in thought--

				SAM
		Me neither.

	EXT. ARMY POST -- DAY

	Athena walking between buildings, looking a bit out of it. 
	Sergeant Worth cuts into her--

				PRISCILLA
		Private Johnson!

				ATHENA
		Sergeant?

				PRISCILLA
		Report to Dr. Innis at the clinic.

				ATHENA
		I'm feeling okay--

				PRISCILLA
		I'm very happy to hear that, Private. 
		Now you go put some pee-pee in a cup 
		for Dr. Innis and I'll be feeling 
		okay, too.

				ATHENA
			(Reacts)
		You're testing me?

				PRISCILLA
		You and one hundred nineteen other 
		fortunate individuals. Put it in 
		gear.

				ATHENA
		Yes, Sergeant.

	Sergeant Worth watches Athena go, suspicious--

	INT. SHERIFF'S OFFICE -- AFTERNOON

	Ray Hernandez and another DEPUTY guide Shadow back in from 
	the courthouse in handcuffs--

				RAY
		Excellent performance, my friend. 
		The judge was very impressed.

				SHADOW
		You don't need to cuff me.

				RAY
		You been talking so much trash today, 
		you made us think you're a dangerous 
		criminal. Be a good boy, now--

	They guide him past Sam's desk--

				SHADOW
		You're the one who's a good boy. Man 
		say "fetch" and you fetch--

				RAY
		Just doing my job.

				SHADOW
		White man just using you to keep the 
		Black man down.

				RAY
		This isn't Houston, my friend. We 
		pretty much running things now. Our 
		good day has come.

				SHADOW
		You suckers haven't had a good day 
		since the Alamo.

	Ray smiles, pushes him out--

				RAY
		Andale, amigo,

	We HOLD on Sam at his desk, TIGHTENING as he holds the .45 
	slug from the sergeants in front of his eyes--

				SAM
		Lupe? Get me the rangers up in Austin--

	INT. MERCEDES' KITCHEN -- NIGHT -- CU GLASS

	We hear old MEXICAN MUSIC. Ice cubes plunk into a glass.

	WIDER, MERCEDES

	Mercedes, exhausted from a day at the cafe, pours herself a 
	Scotch and soda--

	EXT. BACK PATIO -- NIGHT

	The back LIGHT is flicked on and Mercedes steps out with her 
	drink in hand, the MUSIC audible from inside. She sinks into 
	a recliner. We TIGHTEN as she closes her eyes. Something 
	RUSTLES out In the dark. Mercedes opens her eyes. There is 
	WHISPERING. Mercedes sits up and suddenly two MEN run past 
	the edge of the patio toward the front of the house. Mercedes 
	sighs--

				MERCEDES
		Otra vez los mojados--[Wetbacks  
		again--]

	Mercedes searches to find a portable phone on the patio table, 
	punches a number in--

				MERCEDES
		Hello? Border Patrol?

	EXT. SAM'S HOUSE -- NIGHT

	Sam, out of uniform, stands behind his little house chucking 
	fallen pecans out into the dark, thinking, listening to the 
	night sounds.

	CU SAM

	Working something out in his head. He looks off into the 
	dark and we PAN with his gaze--A MAN steps toward us, barely 
	visible in the darkness. It is Charley Wade--We're in Sam's 
	REVERIE, in 1957--

				WADE
		Who is that? Come out here where I 
		can see you!

	BLAM! A GUNSHOT, and Wade falls to his knees--

				WADE
		You sonofabitch--

	Wade falls on his face. A FLASHLIGHT BEAM flicks ON and plays 
	over his body. We PAN back along the be to see Buddy, 
	holstering his Pistol. He hears something, swings the 
	flashlight up.

	SAM

	We are back in 1995. Sam is blasted in the face with a 
	FLASHLIGHT BEAM--

				PATROLMAN (O.S.)
		Hold it right there! Brazos  arriba! 
		Sam, squinting toward the light to 
		see who it is, raises his hands over 
		his head--

				ZACK (O.S.)
		Get that thing off 'im! He's one of 
		ours--

				SAM
		Zack?

	The FLASHLIGHT BEAM PANS AWAY and ZACK POLLARD, a Border 
	Patrol agent, steps out of the dark to Sam--

				ZACK
		Hey Sam. Sorry 'bout that.

				SAM
		What's up?

				ZACK
		We had about a dozen wets come over 
		just upriver. They ran into one of 
		our posts--it was like a breakshot 
		on a pool table, illegals runnin' 
		every which way.

				SAM
		I haven't seen anybody come by.

				ZACK
		We'll get 'em--
			(Looks around)
		So you livin' out here now?

				SAM
		Yeah. It's quiet--

				ZACK
		I heard about that deal for your 
		father--You must be real proud.

				SAM
		Sure.

				ZACK
		The stories people tell, he was a 
		real colorful fella--

				PATROLMAN (O.S.)
		Zack! We got one!

				ZACK
		Well--back on the clock. You see any 
		of our neighbors from the south, let 
		'em know I'm lookin' for 'em.

				SAM
		'Night--

	Zack steps away.  Sam shakes the pecans still in his band, 
	goes back to chucking them--

	EXT. COURTYARD -- DANCERS

	Older CHICANO COUPLES dance to Mexican Music playing from 
	speakers set up in the apartment complex courtyard.  We TILT 
	UP to see Enrique watching from his window--

	INT. APARTMENT -- NIGHT

	MUSIC still blasting.  Enrique steps away from the window, 
	and sits on the bed of his drab furnished apartment. He goes 
	back to tying knots in a length of clothesline splicing it 
	to another. On the bed beside him are new flashlights and 
	the batteries, still in their packaging. He begins to coil 
	the rope--it is hundreds of feet long.

	EXT. FRONT PORCH, PILAR'S HOUSE -- NIGHT

	Pilar sits on her front Porch, listening to the MUSIC in the 
	distance. A woman singing a MEXICAN LOVE BALLAD. After a 
	while we hear Paloma open the screen door behind her--

				PALOMA (O.S.)
		Mom?

				PILAR
		Yeah?

				PALOMA (O.S.)
		You gonna stay out here?

				PILAR
		For a while.

	A silence. They listen to the RECORD--

				PALOMA (O.S.)
		What's she singing about?

				PILAR
			(Smiles)
		What do you think?

							FADE OUT

	INT. SHERIFF'S OFFICE -- EARLY MORNING

	Sam has been up since dawn, searching through piles of old 
	department records. Papers cover his desk and the chairs 
	he's dragged over next to it. He reads out loud himself from 
	a report in front of him--

				SAM
		First bullet entered beneath the 
		left eye, severing the optical nerve 
		and exiting from top rear of skull 
		causing tissue damage

	DOCUMENTS -- VARIOUS SHOTS

	As Sam reads, we see quick pops of various records-- 
	Certificates of death. An old Sheriff's Department payroll. 
	An autopsy report. Eviction notices.

				SAM (O.S.)
		--and severe cerebral hemorrhaging. 
		Second bullet entered left cheek  
		driving fragment of upper and lower 
		molars into base of skull. Third 
		bullet--

	Real estate transfers. A map of the Proposed Lake Pescadero. 
	Another autopsy report. A FAX COPY of the forensics dental 
	report on Charley Wade. Another autopsy report--

	CU SAM

	Intent as he pores over the paperwork--

	LEGAL PAD

	We TILT DOWN to read various notes Sam has written--Reynaldo 
	Garcia killed by Shf Wade--3/49 Hollis Kinney hired by Shf 
	Dep.--9/51 Lucas Johnson k. by Shf Wade--7/53 Horace Gaines 
	k. by Shf Wade--1/54 Santiago Huerta k. by Shf Wade--4/54 
	Rifle range closed--9/56 Eladio Cruz k. by Shf Wade--12/56 
	Buddy Deeds hired by Shf Dep.--2/57 Shf Wade disappears--
	3/57 $10,000 cnty funds missing Buddy Deeds new Shf

	We come to Sam's hand, writing, when it clears we can read 
	the last entry--

	Mercedes Cruz hired as cook, Rio Co. jail--4/57 ?????

	CU SAM

	Trying to put it all together.

	PETE ZAYAS, a skinny, older man in trustee's coveralls, 
	wanders in, emptying the trash baskets in the front office--

				PETE
		Morning, Sheriff.

				SAM
		Hey, Pete. How's it going?

				PETE
		Time marches on.

				SAM
		How much you got left?

				PETE
		Three months.

				SAM
		You stop growing that loco weed at 
		your place, you'd see a lot more 
		daylight.

				PETE
		It was for personal consumption.

				SAM
		You're going to smoke an acre and a 
		half of marijuana?

				PETE
		I got a bad stomach. It helps me 
		digest.

	Pete dumps out the basket by Sam--

				PETE
		Your father never bothered me about 
		it. Leastways not till the drug people 
		got on his back in the late '60s.

				SAM
		I thought he busted you a couple 
		times.

				PETE
		Different charge. I had a still. 
		Made my own mescal.

	Sam looks up at him.

				PETE
		That's how I ruined my stomach.

				SAM
			(Smiles)
		I'm surprised he bothered with it.

				PETE
		He was afraid I was going to poison 
		somebody. Your father tried to do 
		good for people--

				SAM
		So I've heard--

				PETE
		And your mother was a saint. That 
		summer I built the patio at your 
		house? She made me lunch every day.

				SAM
		Well, you were working there--

				PETE
		It could have just been a box lunch 
		from the jail.

	Sam looks up again, troubled.

				SAM
		You built our patio while you  were 
		on the county?

				PETE
		Out in the fresh air, nice gringo 
		lady making you pies--who's gonna 
		sit back in a little jail cell all 
		day? Sheriff Buddy, man. Como el no 
		hay dos. And after that cabron Charley 
		Wade--

				SAM
		I've heard Wade was a bit tough on 
		the Mexicans--

				PETE
		He murdered Eladio Cruz. That tough 
		enough for you?

				SAM
		Murdered him?

				PETE
		Chucho Montoya saw it with his own 
		eyes. Shot him in cold blood.

	EXT. SAN JACINTO STREET -- MORNING

	Ray Hernandez, heading in to work, comes upon Sam getting 
	into his car--

				RAY
		You're out early.

				SAM
		Yeah.

				RAY
		Haven't seen much of you at the jail 
		lately.

				SAM
		I been working on a few things.

				RAY
		Uh-huh.

				SAM
		I'm going over to the other side.

				RAY
			(Concerned)
		The Republicans?

				SAM
		No--to Mexico. I've got to talk to 
		somebody.

				RAY
		They got telephones.

				SAM
		Gotta be in person.

				RAY
		Oh.

	An awkward silence. Sam sits into the driver's seal and Ray 
	leans down to talk--

				RAY
		Sam? I--the Committee--you know Jorge 
		and H.L. and all--they asked me--

				SAM
		They want you to stand for Sheriff 
		next election.

				RAY
		Yeah.

				SAM
		You'd do a good job.

				RAY
		How 'bout you?

				SAM
		Don't know if I'll still want it.

				RAY
		I didn't want to be going around 
		your back.

				SAM
		I appreciate you telling me.

	Sam looks at his Chief Deputy--

				SAM
		You think we need a new jail?

				RAY
		Well, it's a complicated issue--

	Sam smiles, turns the engine on--

				SAM
		Yeah, Ray, you'd be a hell of a 
		Sheriff.

	EXT. SCHOOL -- MORNING

	Pilar sits with Amado on the football field bleachers before 
	school starts--

				PILAR
		I'm only going to have you for two 
		more years. If you decide not to go 
		on to college--

				AMADO
		I can't take any more school.

				PILAR
		--you're going to be on your own.

				AMADO
		So?

				PILAR
		So I'm worried about you. I don't 
		want you to end up in jail like your 
		friends.

				AMADO
		They're not going to jail.

				PILAR
		Don't try to con me, Amado. You knew 
		how they got all those things.

				AMADO
		Just some rich Anglo out on the lake. 
		Don't even live here all year.

				PILAR
		That makes it okay?

				AMADO
		They stole our land--

				PILAR
		Save your breath. That line doesn't 
		cut it with me.

	A silence. Amado sulks.

				PILAR
		How do you think you're going to 
		make a living?

				AMADO
		I can fix cars.

				PILAR
		You can fix old cars. Mr. Washburn 
		told me that the cars they're making 
		now are all computerized--

				AMADO
		You think I can't learn that?

				PILAR
		I think you can learn whatever you 
		want to. I just don't see you doing 
		it. If you want to settle for--

				AMADO
		I'm not settling for anything. I 
		like cars, it's just not a move up 
		the ladder to you, so you think it's 
		a waste.

				PILAR
		That isn't true.

				AMADO
		Oh, come on--you and Grandma think 
		anybody who works with their hands 
		is a peasant. When Dad--

				PILAR
		If you grew up to he anywhere near 
		as good a man as your father was, I 
		would be happy! I would be thrilled.

	They look, at each other for a long moment.

				AMADO
		It's my life. If I want to fuck it 
		up, that's my business.

				PILAR
			(Nods)
		I said pretty much the same thing to 
		my mother when I was your age.

				AMADO
		And what did she do?

				PILAR
		Two years at hard labor, Our Lady of 
		Perpetual Help.

				AMADO
		Catholic school, nasty.

	Pilar is nearly in tears.

				PILAR
		Honey, I think you're smart and you're 
		good and I love you. So don't act 
		like an idiot, all right?

	EXT. BORDER CROSSING -- DAY

	We see Sam's car roll through the "express lane" as other 
	cars in both directions stop by the inspection booths. Sam 
	drives across the bridge over the Rio--

	EXT. STREETS -- CIUDAD LEON -- VARIOUS SHOTS

	Sam drives slowly through the sprawling, more populous town 
	on the other side.  Lots of the streets are unpaved.  We PAN 
	with the car till we HOLD on ANSELMA, a country girl of 15, 
	aimlessly walking the streets--

	EXT. LLANTERIA (TIRE REPAIR SHOP) -- DAY

	We watch a KID about Amado's age pulling a tire off its rim 
	to put a patch on it--

				CHUCHO (O.S.)
		Over here we don't throw everything 
		away like you gringos do.

	CHUCHO AND SAM

	CHUCHO MONTOYA, in his mid-50s, stands by Sam drinking a 
	Coke as they watch the kid work.

				CHUCHO
		Recycling, right? We invented that. 
		The government doesn't have to tell 
		people to do it.

				SAM
		You own this place?

				CHUCHO
		This place, the one across the street, 
		four other ones around Ciudad Leon-- 
		soy el Rey de las Llantas. King of 
		the Tires. Lots of your people rollin' 
		back over that bridge on my rubber.

				SAM
			(Nods)
		You lived in the States for a while?

				CHUCHO
		Fifteen years in El Paso.

				SAM
		Made some money, came back here--

				CHUCHO
		Something like that.

				SAM
		You ever know a fella named Eladio 
		Cruz?

	CHUCHO smiles, draws a line in the dirt with his heel--

				CHUCHO
		You the sheriff of Rio County, right? 
		Un jefe muy respetado. Step over 
		this line.

	Sam obliges--

				CHUCHO
		Ay, que milagro! You're not the 
		Sheriff of nothing anymore- just 
		some tejano with a lot of questions 
		I don't have to answer.

	Sam smiles, plays with the line with his toe--

				CHUCHO
		Bird flying south-you think he sees 
		that line? Rattlesnake, javelina--
		whatever you got--halfway across 
		that line they don't start thinking 
		different. So why should a man?

				SAM
		Your government always been pretty 
		happy to have that line. The 
		question's just been where to draw 
		it

	CU CHUCHO

				CHUCHO
		My government can go fuck itself, 
		and so can yours. I'm talking about 
		people here--men. Mi amigo Eladio 
		Cruz is giving some friends of his a 
		lift in his camion one day--

	We PAN from CHUCHO to the FLAT TIRE on a battered old pickup 
	truck--

				CHUCHO (V.O.)
		--but because he's on one side of 
		this invisible line and not the other, 
		they got to hide in the back like 
		criminals--

	Eladio CRUZ, young and good-looking, squats into the shot to 
	examine the tire, jack in hand. It Is 1956--

				CHUCHO (V.O.)
		And because over there he's just 
		another Mex bracero, any man with a 
		badge is his jefe--

	CONJUNTO MUSIC comes from the truck RADIO. YOUNG CHUCHO steps 
	past Eladio--

				ELADIO
		Donde vas, Chucho, Tienes que quedar 
		escondido! [Shit, CHUCHO you got to 
		stay hidden!]

				YOUNG CHUCHO
		Voy a romper las rinones si no hago 
		pipi--[I'm gonna bust my kidneys if 
		I don't pee--]

	We TRACK back with Young CHUCHO to see we are at the side of 
	a dirt road on the scrubby flatland near the border. Eladio's 
	battered pickup truck has wood-slat sides and a canvas top. 
	Eladio begins to undo the nuts on the flat tire as Young 
	CHUCHO climbs down into a dry creek bed to relieve himself--

				YOUNG CHUCHO
		Los demas son tan espantados que 
		prefieran mojar sus pantalones. [The 
		other guys are so scared they'd rather 
		wet their pants.]

	CHUCHO tightens as he sees something, ducks down--

				YOUNG CHUCHO
		Mira, Eladio [Look!]

	We PAN to see the Sheriff's car approaching in a cloud of 
	DUST--

				ELADIO
			(Calling from where 
			he lies changing the 
			tire)
		Muchachos! Escondases! [Boys! Hide 
		yourselves!]

	INT. REAR OF TRUCK

	Eight illegal WORKERS hear this and lie down, pulling a canvas 
	tarp over themselves. We hear the CAR STOP behind them--

	EXT. ARROYO -- CU CHUCHO

	He makes the sign of the cross as he presses his back against 
	the dirt of the arroyo--

	ROAD

	Sheriff Wade and Deputy Hollis get out of their car and start 
	toward Eladio--

	ELADIO

	He stands, takes a deep breath--Wade steps up to him with 
	his hard-eyed smile--

				WADE
		Hola, amgio. Problemas de llanta? 
		[Hey, friend. Tire problems?]

				ELADIO
		No hay de que. Tengo otra. [No  
		problem, I've got another.]

				WADE
		What's in the back?

	EXT. TRUCK

	Young Hollis strolls around the truck as if he's considering 
	buying it.  He reaches in and flicks the RADIO OFF--

				ELADIO
		Not much, jefe. Some watermelons.

				WADE
		I heard somebody been haulin' wets 
		on this road.

				ELADIO
		I haven't seen anybody doing that.

				WADE
		This same person been bragging all 
		over the county how he don't have to 
		cut that big gringo Sheriff in on it--
		he can run his own operation 'thout 
		any help. Como se llama, amigo?

				ELADIO
		Eladio Cruz.

				WADE
		You know this road got a bad 
		reputation, Eladio--

	ARROYO -- CHUCHO

	Young CHUCHO pecks over the edge to see what's happening.

				ELADIO
		Reputation?

				WADE
		Bandidos, Injuns--

	CLOSER -- MEN

	Hollis wanders over to stand by Wade--

				WADE
		There's many an unfortunate soul 
		been ambushed out on this stretch. 
		Hope you're carrying some protection.

				ELADIO
		Protection?

				WADE
		You carryin' a firearm, son?  Don't 
		lie to me now.

				ELADIO
		Si--tengo escopeto--just a shotgun--

				WADE
		Just a shotgun, huh? Better let me 
		take a look at that.

	ELADIO opens the truck door and digs under the seat. Wade 
	winks to Hollis, then turns and BLAM! shoots ELADIO through 
	the head. Hollis jumps back startled and horrified--

				YOUNG HOLLIS
		Oh no--oh Jesus--oh my Lord--

				WADE
		Little greaser sonofabitch been 
		running a goddarn bus service. Think 
		he can make a fool out of Charley 
		Wade! Get them wets outta the back, 
		Hollis, see what we've got--

	CU CHUCHO

	Squatting in a ball to make himself as small as possible, 
	eyes covered with his hands.

				YOUNG HOLLIS (O.S.)
		You killed him--

				WADE (O.S.)
		You got a talent for statin' the 
		obvious, son Muchachos! Venga 
		afuera!Brazos arribas! [Come on out! 
		Hands up!]

	Young CHUCHO hears FOOTSTEPS approaching. We PAN as he looks-- 
	a man's BOOTS appear at the top of the arroyo. We TILT UP to 
	see a Sheriff, BACKLIT, then CRANE to see it is Sam, back in 
	the PRESENT looking over the site, troubled. His car sits on 
	the empty road behind him. He frowns, turns to go--

	EXT. PARK -- DAY -- PLAQUE

	Somebody has spray-painted "PERDIDO!" over the plaque of 
	Buddy and the little boy--

				HOLLIS (O.S.)
		Hooligans--

	WIDER

	Hollis and a couple of MEN from the Public Work Department 
	look at the damage.

				HOLLIS
		It happens again, we build a fence 
		around it.

	INT. CAFE -- DAY

	Enrique steels himself, trying to cover his nerves. We CROSS 
	with him to a booth.

				ZACK
		Podemos ganar muchas batallas pero 
		la guerra ya es perdido--[We can win 
		a lot of battles but the war's already 
		been lost--]

	Zack and another BORDER PATROLMAN look up at him--

	CU ENRIQUE

	Eyes glued to his notepad--

				ENRIQUE
		You wan' something to drink?

	EXT. ROADSIDE STAND -- DAY -- CU CATTLE SKULL

	A Georgia O'Keefe-looking cattle skull sits on a pedestal 
	against the Western sky--

				WESLEY (O.S.)
		The longhorns go for ten times the 
		price--

	We WIDEN as the skull is lifted by WESLEY BIRDSONG, a Native 
	American man in his 70s who wears extremely thick glasses. 
	Sam tags along as the old man rearranges the display of Texas 
	curios laid out in front of his trailer. Empty scrubland 
	surrounds them.

				WESLEY
		--but longhorns are hard to come by 
		these days.

				SAM
		You sell much out here?

				WESLEY
		How am I gonna sell things if nobody 
		comes by? This stretch of road runs 
		between Nowheres and Nothin' Much.

				SAM
		Hell of a spot to put a business.

				WESLEY
		But you don't see much competition, 
		do you?

	He winks at Sam, picks up a wooden radio carved to resemble 
	the Alamo--

				WESLEY
		These things used to sell like 
		hotcakes. Now, if it can't play those 
		discs, they won't look at it.

	He puts the radio on, looks out at the emptiness around--

				WESLEY
		I like it here. Once I tried going 
		onto that reservation to live. 
		Couldn't take the politics. Damn 
		Indian'll drive you crazy with that, 
		Now your father--this wasn't what he 
		had in mind at all. He come out of 
		Korea, he had this Chevy with too 
		much engine in it. He'd come roarin' 
		up and down this road all hours of 
		the day and night,looking for somebody 
		to race.

	He lifts a jar with a leathery brown thing in it--

				WESLEY
		Buffalo chips. Fella in Santa Fe 
		told me he sells these as fast as 
		the buffalo can squeeze 'em out.

				SAM
		So when did Buddy leave?

				WESLEY
		For Frontera? Hell, I can't remember 
		dates no more. I do recall it was 
		after an affair of the heart had 
		gone sour on him. He almost took 
		some poor fella's head off at the 
		Legion in Arroyo Grande, and figured 
		it was time to move on.

				SAM
		You think he killed anybody in Korea?

				WESLEY
		They don't hand those medals out for 
		hidin'in your foxhole. Would you buy 
		this?

				SAM
		No--

				WESLEY
		Me neither.

	He searches for something among the curios--

				WESLEY
		If he hadn't found that Deputy job, 
		I believe Buddy might've gone down 
		the other path, got into some serious 
		trouble. Settled him right down. 
		That and your mother. 'Course he had 
		that other one later.

				SAM
		Another woman?

				WESLEY
		Your mother wasn't one to get chased 
		off her patch. Half the damn county 
		knew and nobody thought the worse of 
		her for seein' it through.

				SAM
		You know who it was?

				WESLEY
		The other one? Hell, at my age, every 
		time you learn a new name you got to 
		forget an old one. Your head's all 
		crowded up--here it is--

	Wesley stretches out a four-foot rattlesnake skin, rattles 
	still attached--

				WESLEY
		This big fella was sleepin' in a 
		crate at Cisco's junkyard right when 
		I looked to see what was in it. Jumped 
		up at my face--scared me so bad I 
		killed him without thinkin'.

	He shakes the rattles at Sam--

				WESLEY
		Gotta be careful where you're pokin'--
		who knows what you'll find.

	INT. SCHOOL HALLWAY -- DAY

	PILAR talks with Molly as they near the administration office--

				PILAR
		I don't think you can take it 
		personally--

				MOLLY
		I'd like to see them spend a day 
		pulling 14-year-olds off of each 
		other--I should get combat pay--

				PILAR
		I have new respect for some of my 
		kids, meeting the parents they've  
		been dealt--

	Molly keeps going as Pilar ducks into the office--

				PILAR
		See you, Molly.

	INT. OFFICE

	PILAR crosses past the principal's secretary, MARISOL--

				MARISOL
		Steve called for you.

				PILAR
		Steve?

				MARISOL
		Steve. Board of Education Steve who 
		likes you? He goes for us hot-blooded 
		Mexican girls, I can tell.

				PILAR
		Spanish, please. My mother would 
		have a heart attack.

				MARISOL
		Your mother's family is Spanish?

				PILAR
		Sure, they go back to Cortez. When 
		he rode by, they were squatting in a 
		hut cooking hamsters for dinner.

				MARISOL
		You got to be interested in somebody. 
		All you do is work.

				PILAR
		All my mother does is work. That's 
		how you get to be Spanish.

				MARISOL
		How 'bout the Sheriff?

				PILAR
		The Sheriff.

				MARISOL
		The old-high-school-heartthrob 
		Sheriff. I thought you were crazy 
		about each other. He's available, 
		you're available--

				PILAR
		I'm unmarried. I'm not available.

				MARISOL
		You told me one time it was true 
		love.

	PILAR takes the pile of mimeos and mail from her slot and 
	turns to go--

				PILAR
			(Mutters)
		Nobody stays in love for twenty-three 
		years.

	EXT. DRIVE-IN MOVIE -- NIGHT

	It is 1972. An early-'70s cheezy action picture (Filipino 
	women-in-chains or biker flick is playing. We TILT DOWN to a 
	man's BOOTS crunching across the gravel of the parking area. 
	Now and then, the man turns a FLASHLIGHT BEAM on a license 
	plate. The cars are all pre-'72, lots of pickups, and the 
	patrons are almost all TEENAGERS. Some have turned their 
	pickups around to sit on the tailgate and watch, while others 
	have set lawn furniture out to sit on. We TILT UP slightly 
	to see the glint of a Rio County Sheriff's badge pinned on 
	the man's shirt. He meets a DEPUTY coming in the other 
	direction. Both train their FLASHLIGHTS on the license of 
	the car we see in the b.g. between them.  We TILT and RACK 
	to see that nobody is visible through the window--

				BUDDY (O.S.)
		Let's go.

	We FOLLOW Buddy up to the driver's side of the car as the 
	Deputy goes to the passenger side. We PAN with Buddy's hand 
	down to the door handle--he grabs it, flings it open--the 
	overhead LIGHT flicks ON and there lie YOUNG SAM and PILAR, 
	teenagers, half their clothes off and just about to close 
	the deal. PILAR SCREAMS and the Deputy throws the door open 
	by their heads--

				BUDDY
		Goddammit!

	Buddy grabs Sam's ankles and yanks him out of the car onto 
	the ground as the Deputy awkwardly pulls PILAR, out the other 
	side--

				YOUNG SAM
		What the hell are you doing? You 
		fucking asshole!

				BUDDY
		How old is that girl? Goddammit, 
		where's your goddam sense?

				YOUNG PILAR (O.S.)
		Let me go!  Pendejo!

				YOUNG HOLLIS (O.S.)
		Come on now, Missy, get your clothes 
		in order--

	Sam is trying to kick and punch at his father, pausing in 
	between to pull his pants up. People are BOOING and HONKING 
	their HORNS all around--

				YOUNG SAM
		You got no fuckin' right! You stay 
		out of my fuckin' life!

				BUDDY
		Gimme the keys--gimme the goddamn 
		car keys, son--

				YOUNG HOLLIS (O.S.)
		What am I s'posed to do with her, 
		Buddy?

				BUDDY
		You drive her home and tell her mother 
		where we found her--

				YOUNG PILAR (O.S.)
		Sam!

	The kids are dragged forward into the HEADLIGHTS that are 
	being turned on to see what the ruckus is. Both are crying, 
	struggling--

				YOUNG SAM
		You leave her the fuck alone!

				BUDDY
		You just shut that filthy mouth, 
		son. I'll deal with you when we get 
		home--

				YOUNG PILAR
		Please, don't tell my mother! She's 
		gonna kill me!

	They step closer into the glaring HEADLIGHTS which WHITE OUT 
	the scene, then FADE.

	EXT. RUINED DRIVE-IN -- DUSK

	It is DUSK, PRESENT DAY. Our eyes readjust to see Sam, 
	standing by his car in the lot of the long-abandoned drive-
	in. The ruined screen rises in the b.g.

	CU SAM

	Remembering. MUSIC BEGINS as he gets back into the car, pulls 
	away.

	MARQUEE -- DUSK

	MUSIC CONTINUES as the car cruises out past the old marquee, 
	a few letters still jumbled on it, several bullet holes around 
	them.

	INT. CAR

	MUSIC CONTINUES as Sam drives, thinking--

	MUSIC CONTINUES as the car crosses the scrubland back toward 
	town. DUSK turns to NIGHT--

	EXT. PILAR'S HOUSE -- NIGHT

	MUSIC CONTINUES as Sam cruises past Pilar's house. The car 
	is not in the driveway: Paloma hangs out with a couple FRIENDS 
	under the porch light, laughing--

	EXT. HIGH SCHOOL -- NIGHT

	MUSIC CONTINUES as Sam's car pulls into the high school lot. 
	He looks up toward the school--

	EXT. WINDOW, PILAR, -- SAM'S POV

	MUSIC CONTINUES. We can see PILAR, through the lighted window 
	of her classroom, preparing something on the blackboard--

	INT. CAR

	MUSIC ENDS as Sam leans back to wait--

	EXT. PARKING LOT

	PILAR digs in her bag for her car keys as she makes her way 
	across the lot. She sees something, slows, reacting, then 
	brings us to Sam in his car. He has parked head-to-foot next 
	to hers. They look at each other for a long moment

				PILAR
			(Softly)
		Follow me.

	EXT. MAIN STREET -- NIGHT

	Nothing stirring. Pilar's car appears, closely followed by 
	Sam's. The cafe has closed for the night.

	INT. CAFE -- NIGHT

	Sam and Pilar sit on chairs next to each other, facing the 
	window, talking softly. The STREETLIGHT shining through the 
	letters in the front window makes patterns on their faces

				PILAR
		We thought we were something, didn't 
		we?

				SAM
		Yeah.

				PILAR
		I look at my kids in school--tenth, 
		eleventh graders. That's who we were. 
		Children.

				SAM
		Yeah.

				PILAR
		I mean what did we know about 
		anything?

				SAM
		Nothing.

	Pilar looks at him--

				PILAR
		When Nando died--it was so sudden--I 
		was kind of in shock for awhile.   
		Then I woke up and there was the 
		whole rest of my life and I didn't 
		have any idea what to do with it.

				SAM
		You know the other day, you asked 
		why I came back?

				PILAR
		Yeah?

				SAM
		I came back 'cause you were here.

	PILAR nods. She gets up and we FOLLOW her across the dark 
	room to the jukebox. She looks at the selections--

				PILAR
		My mother hasn't changed the songs 
		since I was 10.

	She puts in a quarter, punches some numbers. A Mexican BALLAD 
	comes on. She crosses back to Sam, holds her hand out. He 
	stands to greet her. They slow-dance in the empty cafe--

	INT. SAM'S APARTMENT -- BEDROOM

	Sam and Pilar finish making love. They lie beside each other, 
	shaking a little--

				PILAR
		Wow.

				SAM
		Yeah.

				PILAR
		How come it feels the same?

				SAM
		I don't know. It just feels good. 
		Always did.

				PILAR
		So what are we gonna do about this?

				SAM
		More, I hope.

	PILAR smiles, looks around the room--

				PILAR
		How long have you lived here?

				SAM
		Two years.

				PILAR
		There's nothing on the walls. No 
		pictures--

				SAM
		Don't have kids. Other pictures--I 
		don't know--it's nothing I want to 
		look back on.

				PILAR
		Like your story is over.

				SAM
		I've felt that way, yeah.

	Sbe puts her head on his cbest--

				PILAR
		It isn't. Not by a long shot. He 
		holds her and they lie silently for 
		a moment--

				SAM
		Pilar--

				PILAR
		Yeah?

				SAM
		What was your father's name?

				PILAR
		Eladio. Eladio. Cruz.

							 FADE OUT:

	EXT. PILAR'S HOUSE -- MORNING

	Paloma sits on the top step of the porch, reading teen 
	magazines. PILAR steps out behind her, dressed casually, and 
	squints at the day--

				PALOMA
		She finally got in--

				PILAR
		It's Saturday.

				PALOMA
		You got in late last night.

				PILAR
		Yeah. I had uhm--school business.

	Paloma gives her a look, then holds a fashion page up for 
	her to see--

				PALOMA
		Can I get this?

				PILAR
		Nobody really wears that stuff, 
		Paloma.

				PALOMA
		I could name five girls at school 
		who have one just like it--

				PILAR
		Enough with the clothes--

				PALOMA
		Just 'cause you went to Catholic 
		school and wore a uniform.

				PILAR
		I only went for my last two years.

				PALOMA
		How come?

				PILAR
		Oh, my mother wanted to keep me away 
		from away from boys.

	PILAR steps out into the sun--

				PALOMA
		Did it work?

	INT. CAFE -- MORNING

	Hollis is sitting alone in a booth, working on some heuvos 
	rancheros.  Sam slides in across from him--

				SAM
		Morning, Hollis.

				HOLLIS
		Sam! Quite a do the other day. It 
		meant a lot to folks that you said 
		something.

				SAM
		You thought any more about our murder?

				HOLLIS
		We have a murder?

				SAM
		Charley Wade.

				HOLLIS
		I wish I could tell you I remembered 
		something new, but I can't.

				SAM
		I got an idea what happened.

				HOLLIS
		Do you?

				SAM
		I think somewhere between Roderick 
		Bledsoe's club and his house, Wade 
		ran into Buddy Deeds. I think Buddy 
		put a bullet in him, waited for him 
		to die, threw him in the trunk of 
		the Sheriff's car and drove him out 
		by the Army post, I think he buried 
		him under four feet of sand and never 
		looked back.

	Hollis sits back to look Sam in the eye--

				HOLLIS
		You lived in the man's house what--
		seventeen, eighteen years? And you 
		didn't get to know him any better 
		than that?

				SAM
		I got to go see somebody in San 
		Antonio today. Your memory gets any 
		better, I'll be back tonight.

	Sam stands and walks away. We HOLD on Hollis, his appetite 
	gone--

	EXT. BIG O'S -- MORNING

	Chet steps around to the side entrance--

	INT. BLACK SEMINOLE EXHIBIT -- DAY -- CU STATUE

	We start on a statue of a BUFFALO SOLDIER made from spent 
	bullets and shell casings, then PAN to another, then WIDEN 
	to see Chet as he pokes his head in, the BELL of the door 
	ringing.  He steps in cautiously, looking around the room. 
	On the walls there are photo-blowups, some artifacts, 
	handlettered information on cardboard. Chet stops to look up 
	at a picture of a barechested Black man with a couple of 
	feathers stuck in his headband

				OTIS (O.S.)
		That's John Horse.

	Chet turns to see Otis standing back by, the door from the 
	bar--

				OTIS
		Spanish in Florida called him Juan 
		Caballo. John Horse.

				CHET
			(Looks at picture)
		He a Black man or an Indian?

				OTIS
			(Steps in)
		Both.

	Otis crosses to the poker table, begins to clean up--

				OTIS
		He was part of the Seminole Nation, 
		got pushed down into the Everglades  
		in pioneer days. African people who 
		run off from the slaveholders hooked 
		up with them, married up, had 
		children. When the Spanish give up 
		Florida, the U.S.Army come down to 
		move all them Indian peoples off to 
		Oklahoma--

				CHET
		The Trail of Tears.

				OTIS
			(Smiles)
		They teaching that now?  Good. Only 
		a couple of 'em held out--this man, 
		John Horse, and his friend Wild Cat, 
		and a fella name of Osceola. Army 
		put all of them in prison and Osceola 
		died, but them other two escaped and 
		put together a fighting band and 
		held out another ten, fifteen years. 
		Beat Zach Taylor and a thousand troops 
		at Lake Okeechobee.

				CHET
		So they stayed in Florida?

				OTIS
		They got tired of fighting, went to 
		the Indian Territories for a while. 
		But the slave-raiders were on 'em 
		even there, and one night they packed 
		up and nearly the whole band rode 
		down to Mexico. Crossed at Eagle 
		Pass.

	They move on to some photos of very African-looking people 
	dressed in beautiful Seminole clothing--

				OTIS
		Men worked for Santa Anna down there, 
		waited out the Civil War. The land 
		wasn't much to feed people on, so in 
		1870 they come north and put up at 
		Fort Duncan and the men joined up 
		what was called the Seminole Negro 
		Indian Scouts. Best trackers either 
		side of the border. Bandits, rustlers, 
		Texas rednecks, Kiowa, Comanche--

				CHET
		They fought against the Indians?

				OTIS
		Same as they done in Mexico.

				CHET
		But they were Indians themselves.

				OTIS
		They were in the Army. Like your 
		father.

				CHET
			(Surprised)
		You know who I am?

				OTIS
		I got a pretty good guess.

				CHET
		That guy who got shot--

				OTIS
		You didn't go telling your father 
		you were here?

				CHET
		Are you kidding? And face a court-
		martial?

				OTIS
			(Smiles)
		He's a pretty tough old man, huh?

				CHET
		No sports if I don't keep a B average, 
		no TV on school nights, no PDA's--

				OTIS
		PDA?

				CHET
		Public Display of Affection. Every 
		time he moves up a rank, it's like 
		he's got to tighten the screws a 
		little more--

				OTIS
		Well--

				CHET
		I mean, just 'cause he didn't--you 
		know--

				OTIS
		Didn't have a father?

				CHET
			(Shrugs)
		He's still pissed off about it.

				OTIS
		When you're his age you'll still be 
		pissed off about him.

	Chet nods, looks around--

				CHET
		So how come you got into all this?

				OTIS
		These are our people. There were 
		Paynes in Florida, Oklahoma, Piedras 
		Negras--couple of 'em won the whatsit--
		Congressional Medal Of Honor--

				CHET
		So I'm part-Indian?

				OTIS
		By blood you are. But blood only 
		means what you let it.

				CHET
		My father says the day you're  born 
		you start from scratch, no breaks 
		and no excuses, and you got to pull 
		yourself up on your own.

				OTIS
			(Sad)
		Well, he's living proof of that, 
		son. Living proof.

	INT. DEL'S OFFICE -- DAY

	Athena stands at attention as Del sits at his desk, reviewing 
	her record. He lets her stand for a long time before speaking--

				DEL
		Private Johnson, are you unhappy in 
		the Army?

				ATHENA
		No, sir--

				DEL
		Then how would you explain the fact 
		that out of one hundred twenty people 
		we tested, you're the only one who 
		came up positive for drugs?

				ATHENA
		I'm sorry, sir.

				DEL
		When you were given the opportunity 
		to enlist, a kind of contract was 
		agreed upon. I think the Army has 
		honored its part of that agreement.

				ATHENA
		Yes, sir--

				DEL
		Do you believe in what we're doing 
		here, Private Johnson?

				ATHENA
		I-I can do the job, sir.

				DEL
		You don't sound too enthusiastic.

				ATHENA
		I am, sir.

				DEL
		What exactly do you think your job 
		is, Private?

				ATHENA
		Follow orders. Do whatever they say.

				DEL
		Who's "they"?

				ATHENA
		The--the officers.

				DEL
		And that's the job? Nothing about 
		serving your country?

	Athena is confused, hesitates to speak--

				DEL
		These aren't trick questions, Private. 
		You'll be given an Article 15 and be 
		going into the ADCAP Program one way 
		or the other. What happens after 
		that is up to you. I'm just trying 
		to understand how somebody like you 
		thinks.

	Silence--

				DEL
		Well?

				ATHENA
			(Hesitant)
		You really want to know, sir?

				DEL
		Please.

				ATHENA
		It's their country. This is one of 
		the best deals they offer.

	Del knows he asked for it, but doesn't like the answer--

				DEL
		How do you think I got to be a 
		colonel?

				ATHENA
		Work hard, be good at your job. Sir. 
		Do whatever they tell you.

				DEL
		Do whatever they tell you--

				ATHENA
		I mean, follow orders, sir.

				DEL
		With your attitude, Private, I'm 
		surprised you want to stay in the 
		service.

				ATHENA
		I do, sir.

				DEL
		Because it's a job?

				ATHENA
			(Struggling)
		Outside it's--it's such a mess--it's--

				DEL
		Chaos.

	Athena is sure she's overstepped her rank--

				DEL
		Why do you think they let us in on 
		the "deal"?

				ATHENA
		They got people to fight. Arabs, 
		yellow people, whatever. Might as 
		well use us.

				DEL
		Do you think you've been discriminated 
		against on this post?

				ATHENA
		No, sir. Not at all.

				DEL
		Any serious problems with your 
		sergeant or your fellow soldiers?

				ATHENA
		No, sir. They all been real straight 
		with me.

	Del stands, thinking, trying not to bullshit her--

				DEL
		It works like this, Private--every 
		soldier in a war doesn't have to 
		believe in what he's fighting for.  
		Most of them fight just to back up 
		the soldiers in their squad--you try 
		not to get them killed, try not to 
		get them extra duty, try not to 
		embarrass yourself in front of them.

	He is right in her face now--

				DEL
		Why don't you start with that?

				ATHENA
		Yes, sir.

				DEL
		You're dismissed, Private.

				ATHENA
		Thank you, sir.

	Athena salutes, steps out. Del looks out the window, troubled 
	by the encounter.

	INT. LIVING ROOM

	Sam's ex-wife, BUNNY KINCAID, shuffles across her living 
	room in slippers, crossing to turn off a big-screen TV playing 
	football highlights. Bunny wears shorts, a Houston Oilers 
	sweatshirt and a Dallas Cowboys cap. The living room is like 
	a sports museum-- signed footballs, team posters, a bookcase 
	filled with tapes of Texas pro and college football games--

				BUNNY
		The Longhorns gonna kick some serious 
		butt this Saturday, you just watch. 
		We got a kid at tailback from down 
		your way--outta El Indio--

				SAM (O.S.)
		That's in Maverick County.

	She brings us to Sam, sitting uncomfortably, beneath a full-
	sized blowup of Tony Dorsett hurdling a tackler--

				BUNNY
		Oh. Right. And you're in--?

				SAM
		Rio. BUNNY Right. This kid, Hosea 
		Brown? Does tire 40 in 3.4, soft 
		hands, lateral movement--the whole 
		package. Only a sophomore--

				SAM
		You still going to all the home games?

				BUNNY
		Well, Daddy's got his box at the 
		stadium, of course, and I'll fly to 
		the Cowboy away games when they're 
		in the Conference. Then there's the 
		high school on Friday' nights. West 
		Side got a boy 6'6", 310, moves like 
		a cat. High school, we're talkin'. 
		Guess how much he can bench-press?

				SAM
		Bunny, you--uhm--you on that same 
		medication?

				BUNNY
		Do I seem jumpy?

				SAM
		No, you look good. I was just 
		wondering.

				BUNNY
		Last year was awful rough--Mama 
		passing on and the whole business 
		with O.J.--I mean it's not like it 
		was Don Meredith or Roger Staubach 
		or one of our own boys, but it really 
		knocked me for a loop--

				SAM
		You look good--

				BUNNY
		--and that squeaker the Aggies dropped 
		to Oklahoma-sonofabitch stepped in 
		some lucky shit before he kicked 
		that goal--

				SAM
		Yeah, well--

				BUNNY
		--they hadn't pulled me off that 
		woman I would have jerked a knot in 
		her.

				SAM
		You were in a fight--

				BUNNY
		Daddy calls it an "altercation." How 
		you doing, Sam? You look skinny.

				SAM
		Same weight I always was.

				BUNNY
		You look awful good in that uniform, 
		though.

				SAM
		Best part of the job.

				BUNNY
		Daddy hired a pinhead to take your 
		job. He says so himself. Says "Even 
		my son-in-law was better than this 
		pinhead I got now".

				SAM
		Bunny, is that stuff I left in the 
		garage still there?

				BUNNY
		Least he never called me that. With 
		me, it was always "high-strung." "My 
		Bunny might have done something with 
		her life, she wasn't so high-strung." 
		Or "tightly wound," that was another 
		one. You seeing anyone?

				SAM
		No. You?

				BUNNY
		Yeah. Sort of. Daddy rounds 'em up. 
		You aren't talking about money, their 
		beady little eyes go dead.

				SAM
		You didn't--uhm--you didn't have one 
		of your fires, did you? The stuff I 
		left in the garage--some of it was 
		my father's--

				BUNNY
		You watch the draft this year? 'Course 
		you didn't, idiot question. They try 
		to make it dramatic, like there's 
		some big surprise who picks who in 
		the first round? Only they been 
		working it over with their experts 
		and their computers for months. 
		Doctor's reports, highlight reels, 
		coaches' evaluations, psychological 
		profiles--hell, I wouldn't be 
		surprised if they collected stool 
		samples on these boys, have 'em 
		analyzed. All this stuff to pick a 
		football player for your squad. 
		Compared to that, what you know about 
		the person you get married to don't 
		amount to diddly, does it?

				SAM
		Suppose not.

				BUNNY
		You kind of bought yourself a pig in 
		a poke, didn't you, Sam? All that 
		time we were first seeing each other 
		you didn't know I was tightly wound--

				SAM
		It wasn't just you, Bunny.

				BUNNY
		No, it wasn't, was it? You didn't 
		exactly throw yourself into it heart 
		and soul, did you?

	She looks at him for an uncomfortably long moment--

				BUNNY
		Your shit's still in the garage if 
		that's what you came for.

	Sam nods, stands. Bunny is in tears--

				BUNNY
		350 pounds.

				SAM
		What?

				BUNNY
		This boy from West Side, plays tackle 
		both ways. Bench-presses 350 pounds. 
		You imagine having that much weight 
		on top of you? Pushing down? Be hard 
		to breathe. Hard to swallow.

				SAM
		I think they have another fella there 
		to keep it off your chest. A spotter.

				BUNNY
		"I only got my little girl now," he 
		says, "she's my lifeline." Then he 
		tells me I can't be in the box anymore 
		if I can't control myself. Sonofabitch 
		don't even watch the damn game, just 
		sits there drinking with his bidness 
		friends, look up at the TV now and 
		then. I do better to sit in the cheap 
		seats with some real football people.

				SAM
			(Edging out)
		You look good, Bunny. It's nice to 
		see you.

				BUNNY
			(Smiles)
		Thanks. I like it when you say that, 
		Sam.

	EXT. STREET -- CIUDAD LEON

	Enrique looks nervously over his shoulder before stepping 
	into a funky apartment building. We TILT up to the second 
	floor balcony, where a LITTLE BOY is watching the street--

	INT. APARTMENT

	There are eight PEOPLE not including the little boy on the 
	balcony. All are securing their possessions--rolling things 
	in blankets, filling shopping bags and grain sacks. Enrique 
	steps in--

				ENRIQUE
		Todos estamos? [Everybody here?]

	Anselma reaches up from the floor to take his hand--

				ANSELMA
		Van a disparar a nosotros? [Are they 
		going to shoot at us?]

				ENRIQUE
		Nadie nos veran. Seramos invisibles. 
		Nobody's going to see us. We'll be 
		invisible.]

	INT. GARAGE -- KINCAID HOUSE -- DAY

	A mess. We start on a campaign poster with Sam's face on it 
	and the legend--"ONE GOOD DEEDS DESERVES ANOTHER--VOTE SAM 
	DEEDS FOR COUNTY SHERIFF". We PAN to see Sam, who has been 
	digging through piles of old junk, set down the box he was 
	looking for--

	CLOSER

	Sam pulls out an old holster, a sheaf of real estate and 
	insurance forms, a couple of old paperback Zane Grey westerns. 
	He pulls out a cracked leather pouch, turns it over--letters 
	fall out. He examines an envelope--no stamp or postmark--
	pulls a letter out, reads--

				SAM
		"Dearest Buddy--"

	He puts the letter down for a moment, thinks. He needs to 
	know. He picks the letter up again, reads.

	INT. OTIS'S HOUSE -- EVENING

	Carolyn crosses the living room to answer the RING at the 
	front door.  Del stands there--

				CAROLYN
		Hey, it's the General.

				DEL
		Colonel. Is uhm--is Otis in?

				CAROLYN
		Come on in--

				DEL
		If it's too late--

				CAROLYN
		Come on in.

	Del enters the house as if walking into an AMBUSH--

	INT. OTIS'S LIVING ROOM -- EVENING

	Carolyn sits back in the couch, drink in hand, checking Del 
	out--

				CAROLYN
		Otis sittin' up with some people at 
		the club. I don't think he'll be 
		long.

	CU DEL

	Uncomfortable, sitting at the edge of an easy chair. He looks 
	at a mounted magazine photo of Otis smiling as he pours hot 
	sauce on a rack of ribs--

				CAROLYN
		His hot sauce recipe won a contest 
		last year. They sellin' it far away 
		as San Antonio. He got a lot of 
		talent, your father.

	Del squirm a bit at the word "father"--

				DEL
		You've been in this house for a while?

				CAROLYN
		I been here with him eight years 
		now. He built it when he was with 
		Leora.

				DEL
		I never met her.

				CAROLYN
		There was a bunch of 'em You never 
		met. Me neither.

	Del looks around the living room--

				CAROLYN
		Let me show you around--

	INT. DEN -- PHOTOGRAPH

	A blowup of a photo of a squad of Buffalo Soldiers is mounted 
	on the wall--

				CAROLYN (O.S.)
		He got into all this cowboys and 
		Indians stuff awhile back. Spend 
		half his time pokin' around in the 
		library way up to Austin.

	CU DEL

	He looks at something below --

	DEL'S POV -- CLIPPINGS

	We PAN slowly over laminated newspaper clippings mounted 
	behind a picture of young Del in a track uniform, holding a 
	vaulting pole. The clippings are about Del making honor rolls, 
	winning a Silver Star in Vietnam, graduating from Officer 
	Candidate School, being named head of this and that in the 
	Army--

				CAROLYN (O.S.)
		Kind of like a shrine, isn't it?

	DEL, CAROLYN

	Carolyn stands behind, watching Del's face as he looks at 
	the stuff--

				DEL
		Where'd he get all this?

				CAROLYN
		Your mother got a brother--Alphonse--

				DEL
		Uncle Al--

				CAROLYN
		Otis stood on good terms with the 
		man. Whenever you do something makes 
		the news, he sends it on. When they 
		made you General, Otis just about 
		drove away all our customers going 
		on about it.

				DEL
		I'm a colonel.

				CAROLYN
		Yeah, I know--Man made me memorize 
		the whole damn Army chain of command 
		before he'd marry me. So this is a 
		big deal, commander and  all?

				DEL
		It's a small post and they're phasing 
		it out in two years, but I moved up 
		in rank and--well, a command is a 
		command.

				CAROLYN
		Otis went on like you were that guy 
		who won the Gulf War. Colin whatsit.

				DEL
		My mother said he never asked about--

				CAROLYN
		He never asked her.

	It's a bit too much for Del--

				DEL
		Listen, I uh--tell him I came by. 
		Thanks--

	We HOLD on Carolyn as he hurries out. She salutes--

				CAROLYN
		Catch you later, Colonel.

	EXT. RIVER -- NIGHT

	PEOPLE, crouching low, wade across the river toward us. When 
	he gets close enough to us, we recognize Enrique, nervously 
	leading a group of Mexican men, women and children to the 
	U.S. side. They are spaced out in the dark, loosely holding 
	the line Enrique made in one hand and holding their bundles 
	high away from the water with the other. Enrique turns as he 
	hears a WOMAN'S CRY.  The line goes slack, then NESTOR steps 
	out of the darkness to join him--

				ENRIQUE
		Que Paso? [What happened?]

				NESTOR
		Anselma cayo en las rocas. Creo que 
		la pierna ha sido root--[Anselma 
		felt on the rocks. I think her leg's 
		broken--]

	Two men struggle forward supporting Anselma, trying to hold 
	her leg out straight in front of her. She is in a lot of 
	pain--

				NESTOR
		No podemos alcanzar el camion llevando 
		a ella. Hay lugar para esconderla? 
		[We can't reach the truck if we're 
		carrying her. Is there somewhere to 
		hide her?]

	Enrique thinks, trying not to panic, as the others come up 
	around him--

				ENRIQUE
		Conozco solamente una persona con 
		casa--[I only know one person with a 
		house--]

				ANSELMA
			(In pain)
		Esta lejos? [Is it far?]

	EXT. PATIO -- NIGHT

	Mercedes sits on her recliner, drink in hand. An old RECORD 
	plays from inside. She is startled by the voice from the 
	dark--

				ENRIQUE (O.S.)
		Senora Cruz?

				MERCEDES
			(Standing)
		Quien es? [Who is it?]

				ENRIQUE
		Soy yo, Enrique! No tiene miedo-- 
		[It's me, Enrique. Don't be afraid]

	Enrique steps out into the light. His pants are wet and he's 
	scared--

				MERCEDES
		What are you doing out there? Are 
		you crazy?

				ENRIQUE
		Hay pasado un accidente muy grave-- 
		[There's been a bad accident--]

				MERCEDES
		In English, Enrique. We're in the 
		United States--

				ENRIQUE
		I have some friends who have had a 
		accident--

				MERCEDES
		You have somebody else out there?

				ENRIQUE
		We was by the river? And I hear my 
		friend callin' for help, and I look 
		and she has falling in the water--

				MERCEDES
		Don't tell me lies, Enrique. Que 
		paso?

				ENRIQUE
		We was crossin' the river--

	Nestor appears in the light now, supporting Anselma, who 
	hops awkwardly to move forward--

				MERCEDES
		Enrique! Quienes son estos? How could 
		you bring them here?

				ENRIQUE
		They need help. Jaime, Anselma-- 
		esta es mi jefa--

				NESTOR
		Senora--

				MERCEDES
		I'll call the Border Patrol, they'll 
		get her to the hospital.

				ENRIQUE
		No! No puede hacer esto--[You can't 
		do that--]

				MERCEDES
		You think you're doing these people 
		a favor? What are they going to do? 
		Either they get on welfare or they 
		become criminals--

				ENRIQUE
		No es la verdad--[That isn't true--]

				NESTOR
		Con permiso, Senora, la muchacha 
		tiene mucho dolor--[Please, Senora, 
		the girl is in a lot of pain--]

	Mercedes grudgingly indicates the lounge chair--

				MERCEDES
		Sientase. [Sit.]

				NESTOR
		Es muy amable. [You're very kind.]

	He and Enrique help Anselma into the chair. The Girl looks 
	up at Mercedes, frightened--

				ANSELMA
		Ayudanos, Senora, por favor no podemos 
		regresar--[Help us, Senora, please. 
		We can't go back]

	Mercedes looks at ANSELMA disapprovingly. The girl can't be 
	more than 14--

				MERCEDES
		This girl is a friend of yours?

				ENRIQUE
		Es mi novia. [She's my girlfriend.]

				MERCEDES
		I thought you were married!

				ENRIQUE
		I am marry to the cousin of a friend--
		but only to be able to live here. 
		This is the mother of my child--

				MERCEDES
		This girl has a child?

				ENRIQUE
		We have a daughter.

				MERCEDES
			(Scornful)
		Tipico.

	EXT. HOUSE -- NIGHT

	Sam stands at the front door of a house on the lake, banging 
	on the door--

				SAM
		Hollis? You in there? Hollis?

	EXT. RIVER -- NIGHT

	Moonlight kicks off the surface of the water.  We hear 
	SPLASHING, the frightened VOICE of a young woman--

				YOUNG MERCEDES (O.S.)
		Donde esta? Estoy perdido--[Where 
		are you? I'm lost--]

				ELADIO (O.S., DISTANT)
		Aqui! [Here!]

	The girl flounders into the shot, wet and scared. Young 
	Mercedes, a teenager not unlike ANSELMA is wading thigh-deep 
	in the Rio, lost, scared--

				YOUNG MERCEDES
		No puedo ver la orilla! [I can't see 
		the bank!]

				ELADIO (O.S.)
		Aqui! Venga por aqui! [Over here! 
		Come this way!]

	Mercedes struggles toward the voice and suddenly a young man 
	becomes visible, standing in the water, holding his band out 
	for her, ELADIO--

				YOUNG MERCEDES
		Vi a Rosaria arastrado para el  
		corriente--[I saw Rosaria taken away 
		by the current--]

				ELADIO
		No te molestas. Tenemos a ella. [Don't 
		worry. We've got her.]

	He takes her arm, pulls her toward the far shore--

				ELADIO
		Como se llama? [What's your name?]

				YOUNG MERCEDES
		Mercedes Gonzales Ruiz.

				ELADIO
			(Smiles)
		Me llama Eladio Cruz--Bienvenido a 
		Tejas. [Welcome to Texas.]

						 DISSOLVE TO:

	EXT. MERCEDES' HOUSE -- MERCEDES

	Mercedes is lost in thought as she recalls. She steps into 
	the light by the carport. Enrique and Nestor are propping 
	Anselma's leg up on pillows in the back of Mercedes' old 
	station wagon--

				MERCEDES
		Rapidamente! Everybody in the world 
		is going to see!

				ENRIQUE
		Donde vamos? [Where are we going?]

				MERCEDES
		A casa de Porfirio Zayas. He used to 
		be a doctor on the other side.  
		Gunshot wounds, fixing babies--if 
		you can pay he can handle it.

				ENRIQUE
		Senora, anything it costs, I can 
		work--

				MERCEDES
		Don't worry about it. He owes me 
		some favors.

	Enrique turns to ANSELMA still frightened in the rear of the	
	station wagon--

				ENRIQUE
		Seas tranquila, mija.
			(Nods to Mercedes)
		Estamos en las manos de Senora Cruz. 
		[Just relax, honey. We're in the 
		hands of Senora Cruz.]

	Mercedes starts the car--

				MERCEDES
		In English, Enrique. In English--

	INT. DEL'S HOUSE -- DINING  ROOM

	Del steps in. Chet sits at the table, drawing a cartoon in 
	panels. Del looks over his shoulder for a moment--

	CARTOON

	A tank rolling over barbed wire, cannon and machine gun 
	blasting away--

				DEL (O.S.)
		Homework?

	DEL AND CHET

				CHET
		I finished that. I'm just messing 
		around.

				DEL
		Tanks, huh?

				CHET
		You got to be in the Army, you might 
		as well have something slick to drive.

				DEL
		So you're going into the Army?

	Chet looks at him, not in a good mood, then goes back to his	
	drawing--

				CHET
		That's the general plan, isn't it?

	Del watches for a long moment, thinking--

				DEL
			(Softly)
		That's up to you.

	Chet looks at his father again. All this is news to him--

				DEL
		The Army isn't for everybody.

	Chet can't quite believe he is hearing this. Del crosses to 
	the refrigerator--

				DEL
		Not that I don't think you'd be good 
		at it, but--you know--I wouldn't be 
		disappointed if you decided to do 
		something else with your life.

				CHET
		You wouldn't?

				DEL
		No.

	Chet nods, begins to play again, considering the 
	possibilities. Del is making an effort and he doesn't have 
	much practice--

				DEL
		How's your room shaping up?

				CHET
		Fine. I'm pretty much moved in.

				DEL
		Good.

	An awkward silence--

				CHET
			(Tentative)
		Are we going to ever see your father?

				DEL
		My father.

				CHET
		Yeah. He lives here, right?

				DEL
		He does.

	Del pulls some food out, watching Chet as he draws--

				DEL
		Maybe we'll clean that thing out 
		back up, have a barbecue next weekend. 
		We could invite him and his wife 
		over.

				CHET
		Cool.

	Chet flips the page of his sketchbook--

				CHET
		He makes his own sauce.

	EXT. PARKING LOT, BIG O'S -- NIGHT

	The neon's off, but there are a couple cars in the lot and a 
	light within. Sam pulls into the lot, steps out, approaches 
	the door--

	INT. CLUB

	The door opens. The place is empty now except for Otis, 
	standing behind the bar, deep in conversation with Hollis, 
	sitting on a stool. Both swivel to look around guiltily as 
	they hear Sam step in--

	REVERSE

	Sam walks in slowly, crossing the floor to bring us back to 
	the two men--

				SAM
		Fellas.

				HOLLIS
		Hey, Sam.

				SAM
		Open late.

				OTIS
		I'm not open. We were just talking.

				SAM
		Hollis probably told you we found 
		Charley Wade.

				OTIS
		Yeah. How about that? People start 
		digging holes in this county, there's 
		no telling what'll come up.

	He sits a few stools away from Hollis--

				SAM
		You two saw it, didn't you? You two 
		saw it when Buddy killed him.

	Hollis and 0tis look at each other--

				SAM
		Imonna find out one way or the other.

				HOLLIS
		Your father had the finest sense of 
		justice of any man I ever met--

				SAM
		Yeah, and my mother was a saint. For 
		fifteen years the whole damn town 
		knew he had another woman on the 
		side. Stole ten thousand dollars to 
		set her up in business. But hell, 
		what's that? You got a problem?  
		Buddy'll fix it. Facing some time in 
		jail? Buddy'll knock half of it off--
		if you do what he says, when he says. 
		You got some business that's not 
		exactly legal? Talk to Buddy--

				HOLLIS
		Buddy Deeds--

				SAM
		Buddy Deeds was a murderer.

	He looks at the two older men for a long moment--

				SAM
		That night in the cafe--he didn't 
		stay long after you left, did he, 
		Hollis? Maybe he decided he'd gone 
		too far with Wade, maybe he figured 
		he better not wait for the Sheriff 
		to get behind him. So he stepped out 
		to see if he could catch up--and you 
		were here at the club that night, 
		weren't you, O?

	Otis sighs, begins to speak softly--

				OTIS
		I was here.

	CU OTIS

	He turns to look toward the door as he reminisces, and we 
	PAN away with his gaze--

				OTIS (O.S.)
		I'd been running a game on the side 
		after hours craps, draw poker on the 
		weekends. Roderick didn't know about 
		it. More important, Charley Wade 
		didn't know about it, 'cause I didn't 
		want to cut him in. I suppose I'd 
		been drinking some, and I was pretty 
		full of myself in those days--but 
		hell, I just didn't expect the man 
		so early--

	Sheriff Wade and Young Hollis step in the door and we are 
	back in 1957. BLUES HARMONICA FADES UP, wailing from the 
	jukebox. They stop and look at the place--

	THEIR POV -- CLUB

	MUSIC CONTINUES. The club is empty, dark. A LIGHT shines 
	from the back room.

	INT. BACK ROOM

	MUSIC CONTINUES. Smoke fills the air and Young Otis sits 
	back laughing, a large pile of money on the table in front 
	of him. The other four BLACK MEN at the table aren't doing 
	so well. One by one they all look up past the camera to the 
	door--

	CU OTIS

	MUSIC CONTINUES. Young Otis doesn't see at first, engaged in 
	dealing the cards. Finally, he senses the presence, looks up--

	WADE AND HOLLIS -- YOUNG O'S POV

	MUSIC CONTINUES. Wade stands over the table in the f.g., 
	Young Hollis hanging back in the doorway. Wade is smiling 
	his cold smile, cursing--

	CU YOUNG OTIS

	MUSIC CONTINUES. Trying to look unimpressed--

	EXTREME CU WADE'S EYES

	Cold and unblinking. MUSIC CONTINUES--

	EXTREME CU WADE'S MOUTH

	Twisted in a snarl as he curses. MUSIC CONTINUES--

	MEN, TABLE

	MUSIC CONTINUES. We shoot past Wade's body as the other men 
	step away from the table, grab their hats, and hurry out the 
	side door. Young Otis is left sitting at the table. Wade 
	starts walking toward him--

	CU YOUNG OTIS

	MUSIC CONTINUES. His eyes following as Wade comes to stand 
	over him--

	WADE, YOUNG OTIS

	MUSIC CONTINUES. Wade grabs the table and violently jerks it 
	over onto Young Otis, cards and money flying--

	YOUNG HOLLIS

	MUSIC CONTINUES. Watching squeamishly as Wade goes to work 
	on young Otis, the overhead light swinging wildly--

	INT. BARROOM

	MUSIC CONTINUES. Young Otis is hurled out of the back room, 
	face bruised and bleeding. Wade follows, then Young Hollis--

	CLOSER

	MUSIC CONTINUES.

	CLOSER

	Wade puts his gun next to Young Otis's ear, cursing at him. 
	Young Otis gets to his feet, goes behind the bar--

	BAR COUNTER

	MUSIC CONTINUES. Young Otis slaps an envelope full of cash 
	onto the counter--

	WADE

	MUSIC CONTINUES. He waves his pistol, indicating something 
	behind Otis--

	INT. BAR

	MUSIC CONTINUES. We shoot past Wade at the counter as Otis 
	turns and reaches for a cigar box on the shelf behind--

	CIGAR BOX

	MUSIC CONTINUES. Lying open, an old pistol inside of it. 
	Young Otis reaches--

	CU YOUNG HOLLIS

	MUSIC CONTINUES. Frowning as he senses something wrong--

	WADE

	MUSIC CONTINUES. Wade levels his gun at Young Otis's back, 
	then turns to wink at Hollis like he did before he shot Eladio--

	WADE'S HAND

	MUSIC CONTINUES. Finger closing around the trigger of the 
	.45--

	HOLLIS

	MUSIC CONTINUES. Mouth open in horror--

	WADE

	MUSIC CONTINUES. Eyes burning as he aims--

	BUDDY

	MUSIC CONTINUES. Stepping in the door, seeing, CALLS OUT--

	YOUNG OTIS

	MUSIC CONTINUES. Turning to see Buddy--

	WADE

	BLAM! THWAP! A bullet plows through his neck, knocking him 
	back against the bar.

	MUSIC CONTINUES. His gun falls from his hand--

	YOUNG OTIS

	Horrified, splattered with the Sheriff's blood. MUSIC 
	CONTINUES--

	BAR COUNTER

	MUSIC CONTINUES. Twenty-dollar bills have spilled out of the 
	envelope and are soaking up blood--

	CU BUDDY

	Calm and hard-eyed. MUSIC CONTINUES. As he steps forward, we 
	see his pistol is still in its holster. He reaches out and 
	takes the .45 from Young Hollis's shaking hand, looks him in 
	the eye till Hollis looks back, then looks toward Young Otis--

	We PAN with his gaze to a CLOSE-UP of Otis, back in the 
	PRESENT. The MUSIC FADES--

				OTIS
		Sheriff Charley had some real big 
		friends in politics then, and if the 
		truth come out it wasn't going to go 
		easy on Hollis.
			(He shrugs)
		I don't know why I trusted Buddy 
		with it--don't know why he trusted 
		me. The first time I ever talked 
		with him was right there, and then 
		with a dead white man leakin' blood 
		on the floor between us. He could 
		charm the scales off a rattler, Buddy 
		Deeds.

	WIDER

	This isn't what Sam was expecting. Hollis watches his face--

				HOLLIS
		The three of us cleaned up and took 
		him to the post and put him under. 
		Can't say I was much help.

				SAM
		And the ten thousand?

				HOLLIS
		Widow's benefits. He figured it would 
		make the disappearance look better, 
		and that Mexican gal was just scrapin' 
		by after Charley killed her man. 
		They didn't get hooked up till late--

				OTIS
		Time went on, people liked the story 
		that we told better than anything 
		the truth might have been.

	Sam swivels around on his seat to took at the spot where 
	Charley fell. He has a lot of information to deal with--

				HOLLIS
		What's the call, Sam?

	Sam rolls it over in his mind before answering--

				SAM
		Don't think the Rangers are likely 
		to find out any more than they  
		already have.

				HOLLIS
		Word gets out who that body was, 
		people are gonna think Buddy done 
		it.

	Sam gets up--

				SAM
		Buddy's a goddamn legend. He can 
		handle it.

	He heads for the door--

				SAM
		'Night, fellas.

	Hollis and Otis watch him go--

							 FADE OUT:

	EXT. DRIVE-IN, WIDE SHOT -- MORNING

	We see Sam sitting on the hood of his car parked in the 
	deserted drive-in lot, staring up at the ruined screen. 
	Pilar's car rolls in, parks beside him--

	CLOSER

	Pilar gets out, kisses Sam, sits by him on the hood--

				PILAR
		When's the picture start?

	Sam looks at her for a moment--

				SAM
		You gonna tell your mother we been 
		seeing each other?

				PILAR
		She'll figure it out sooner or later. 
		I don't have to ask permission 
		anymore, if that's what you mean.

				SAM
		You have any idea when your father 
		died? Eladio?

				PILAR
			(Shrugs)
		Couple months before I was born--

				SAM
		Try a year and a half. He bands her 
		an old snapshot. PILAR looks at it--

	CU PHOTO

	Buddy and Young Mercedes on the lake. Buddy with his shirt 
	off on one end of a sailboat, Mercedes in a bathing suit, 
	both smiling for the camera--

	SAM AND PILAR

	Pilar hands the photo back to him, tries to be calm--

				PILAR
		I've never seen my mother in a  
		bathing suit before.  Didn't know 
		she owned one.

				SAM
		Buddy bought the cafe for her with 
		money he took from the county.    
		Pilar looks away, struggling not to 
		cry--

				PILAR
		They can't pull this on me. It isn't 
		fair--I don't believe this--

				SAM
		He paid the hospital bill when you 
		were born. Your mom always calls you 
		"our beautiful daughter" in the 
		letters she wrote to him.

				PILAR
		From the first time I saw you at 
		school--all those years we were 
		married to other people I always 
		felt like we were connected.

				SAM
		I remember thinking you were the one 
		part of my life Buddy didn't have a 
		piece of--

	A silence, both of them wondering what the next move should 
	be--

				PILAR
		So that's it? You're not going to 
		want to be with me anymore?

	Sam knows what he feels but doesn't have the words--

				PILAR
		I'm not having any more children. 
		After Amado, I had some complications-- 
		I can't get pregnant again, if that's 
		what the rule is about--

				SAM
		If I met you for the first time today, 
		I'd still want to be with you.

	It is what Pilar needed to hear--

				PILAR
		We start from scratch--

				SAM
		Yeah--

				PILAR
		Everything that went before, all 
		that stuff, that history--the hell 
		with it, right?

	PILAR takes Sam's hand, kisses him--

				PILAR
		Forget the Alamo.

	WIDE SHOT, DRIVE-IN

	Sam and Pilar sit by each other holding hands, looking at 
	the empty screen--

	MUSIC, ROLL CREDITS

                                   Rian Johnson

                       

                         

                                                     Production draft

          EXT. EDGE OF CORN FIELDS - DAY

          A pocket watch. Open. Ticking. Swinging from a chain.
          Held by a young man named JOE in a clearing beside a Kansas
          corn field. Sky pregnant with rain.
          Waiting. He checks the watch, removes his earbud headphones,
          stands.
          Without much ceremony a BLOODIED MAN in a suit appears from
          thin air, kneeling before the young man. Hands and feet
          tied. Burlap sack over his head. Muffled screams, gagged.
          With no hesitation Joe raises a squat gun and blows the man
          apart with a single cough of a shot.

                         LATER
          Joe loads the corpse into the flatbed of his truck.
          Cuts open the back of the body's jacket, revealing FOUR bars
          of gold taped to the dead man's back. Joe takes them.

          EXT. INDUSTRIAL PLANT - DAY

          Massive, in the middle of nowhere. Black smoke.

          JOE (V.O.)
          Time travel has not yet been
          invented. But twenty five years
          from now it will be. Once the
          technology exists, it will be
          relatively cheap and available to
          the public at large. And so. It
          will be instantly outlawed, used
          only in secret by the largest
          criminal organizations. And then
          only for a very specific purpose.
          Joe drives up and parks his truck, removes the wrapped corpse
          from the flatbed.

          JOE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
          It's nearly impossible to dispose
          of a body in the future. I'm told.
          Tagging techniques, whatnot. So
          when these future criminal
          organizations in the future need
          someone gone, they use specialized
          assassins in our present, called
          loopers.

          INT. INDUSTRIAL PLANT - DAY

          Cavernous and empty. Joe carries the body to an iron hatch,
          opens it, and dumps him in.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          2.

          JOE (V.O.)
          And so. Thirty years from now. My
          employers in the future nab the
          target, they zap him back to me,
          their looper. And I do the
          necessaries. So the target has
          vanished from the future, and I've
          just disposed of a body that
          technically does not exist. Clean.
          The body slides down a long chute. Vanishes in a little
          flare of angry red fire.

          EXT. DINER - DAY

          A sidecar roadside diner in the middle of nowhere. Joe's
          truck in front.

          INT. DINER

          Nearly empty, Joe at a booth listening to headphones. A
          waitress sets down coffee.
          Her bright red name tag: BEATRIX.

                         BEATRIX
          Bon jour, Joe.

                         JOE
          Bon jour, Beatrix.

                         BEATRIX
          How's the French?

                         JOE
          Slow. How's the coffee?

                         BEATRIX
          Burnt.
          Cream in the coffee. White clouds boil deep down.

          EXT. FARMLAND ROAD - DAY

          Joe's truck zooms from the flat fields towards a mid sized
          city on the horizon.

          INT. PAWN SHOP - DAY

          Grungy, heavily fortified. Joe enters and puts his gun in a
          basket labeled âLOOPERS - BLUNDERBUSSESâ
          Slips down a narrow passage, which ends at a steel wall with
          a protruding duct taped camera and microphone.

                         JOE
          Two, Jedd.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          3.
          Joe fishes the two gold bars from his jacket.
          A small narrow slot slides open in the wall, and gnarled old
          hands take the gold bars. It slides shut again.
          In the background the front door to the pawn shop dings open.
          The slot slides open and Jedd's hands push a wad of cash.
          Joe pockets it, and backs around Dale, another Looper.

                         DALE
          Hey Joe. Be at the Belle tonight?

                         JOE
          Yup.
          Dale hands four gold bars through the slot as Joe retrieves
          his gun and exits.

                         DALE
          Four, Jedd.

          INT. JOE'S APARTMENT - AFTERNOON

          High ceilings, big clean windows overlooking a sooty city.
          Joe finishes smoothing out an oriental rug and scoots a
          coffee table in place over it.
          Puts a bebop LP on a turntable.

                         LATER
          On the bed, shooting at the ceiling with his fingers.

                         JOE
          Bon jour, mademoiselle. Bang!

          INT. CAR GARAGE - EVENING

          Suit-and-tie Joe pulls a tarp off a cherried-out 1992 Mazda
          Miata. Lingers over it. His baby.

          EXT. CITY STREETS - EARLY EVENING

          Joe drives through the sooty city streets. A muted beep, and
          he fishes a matchbook sized screen from his pocket.

                         JOE
          Yeah Seth? Yeah. Ok.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          4.

          EXT. STREET CORNER - EARLY EVENING

          A young looper named SETH on the side of the road, kneeling
          beside a motorcycle without wheels called a SLAT BIKE. He
          kicks it in frustration.
          A VAGRANT approaches and SETH pulls a gun, identical to
          Joe's.

                         SETH
          Walk around! Around, I'm not
          kidding. Wide around, ya shit.
          The vagrant crosses the street. Joe pulls up.

                         JOE
          Seth.

                         SETH
          Hi Joe.

                         JOE
          That's new.
          Seth kicks the bike.

                         SETH
          Thanks. Goddamn thing. You going
          to the Belle?

          EXT. DRIVING THROUGH THE CITY STREETS

          Seth and Joe.

                         JOE
          Slat Bikes are all junk. Stick
          with rubber on the road.

                         SETH
          Yeah but Gat Men pull up in them,
          they get respect.

                         JOE
          They get respect cause they run the
          town. How much did that thing set
          you back? How much?
          Seth holds a quarter idly in his palm.

                         SETH
          I was gonna pull up in it.
          Tonight. Heads or tails, call it
          in the air.
          The coin lifts, floats several inches in the air, quivering.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          5.

                         JOE
          Congratulations. You're pulling up
          with me instead.
          Joe notices the floating quarter.

                         JOE (CONT'D)
          And don't, if we're going in, don't
          do that.

                         SETH
          Chicks dig TKs.

                         JOE
          It's tacky, don't do it.
          Seth catches the quarter, sullen.

          JOE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
          When the TK mutation started
          appearing in the general populace
          it was on every magazine - âNext
          Step in Evolution, what's next.â
          Everyone got tested. But turns out
          this was it, and now it's just a
          bunch of assholes thinking they're
          blowing your mind by floating
          quarters.

          EXT. LA BELLE AURORE - NIGHT

          A shitty but bright nightclub in the heart of the city.
          Flashy people shiver behind a velvet rope, huge black cars,
          big rollers in odd suits swept in by the bouncers.
          All trying very hard to be big time.

          JOE (V.O.)
          Big heads. Small potatoes.
          Drives past, revving the engine.

          EXT. PARKING LOT

          Down the street. Joe tosses the keys to an attendant.

          EXT. LA BELLE AURORE SIDE ENTRANCE

          A dingy stage door in back of the building. Joe and Seth
          ring a buzzer, smile for a camera, and the door opens.

          INT. COAT CHECK

          A long dark hallway leads to a tiny antechamber with a coat
          check room used for guns. BIG CRAIG leans out of it, and
          stops the two.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          6.

                         BIG CRAIG
          No loopers in the club on
          Wednesdays, Joe. Gat men only.
          Seth backs towards the door, Joe stops him.

                         JOE
          We'll stick backstage, just meeting
          up. In and out.

                         BIG CRAIG
          Packing your blunderbusses?

                         JOE
          Hardly. Right Seth?

                         SETH
          Hardly. I'm with Joe.
          Big Craig pats them down, waves them in.

          INT. BACKSTAGE

          A claustrophobic maze of twisty halls and passages.
          DANGEROUS MEN and half naked SHOW GIRLS weave through.
          Joe expertly navigates the turns, going someplace. Seth
          struggles to keep up.

                         SETH
          So are we - hey -
          Joe has vanished. Seth stops meekly, butted by passing men.

          INT. BORDELLO ENTRANCE

          An ornate parlor, LACY WOMEN entertaining men. A velvet
          curtained doorway leads to back rooms.
          Joe lingers by the entrance, watching one girl in particular,
          SUZIE. Bold dark eye makeup. A BIG MAN leads her off
          through the curtains. Joe's eyes drop. Pained.
          A fat MADAME doesn't look up from her ledger.

                         MADAME
          No loopers on Wednesday, Joe. Gat
          Men only.

                         JOE
          So I've read.
          He ducks out.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          7.

          INT. BACKSTAGE

          Joe plods. Dale, the Looper from the pawn shop, passes fast.
          Curious, Joe follows. They pass Seth, who tails after them.

                         SETH
          Hey, Joe. We leaving? Cuz, what-
          Joe?
          And Seth loses them again, butted back by passing men.

          INT. STEEP STAIRS

          A starkly lit steep stairwell leads down. Five or six young
          loopers gather at the top. Joe and Dale join them.

                         JOE
          What?

                         DALE
          Zach. In there right now, with
          Abe.
          Dale makes a quarter float above his palm. Joe rolls his
          eyes.

                         JOE
          For what?

                         DALE
          He closed his loop.
          This lands heavily on Joe.

                         JOE
          No shit?
          The door at the bottom of the stairs opens, and ZACH, another
          looper, steps out. An OLDER MAN'S HAND pats his shoulder
          then retracts into the door.
          The loopers watch him in awe.

          JOE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
          There's a reason we're called
          loopers.

          EXT. ABANDONED LOT - DAY (FLASHBACK)

          Zach stands waiting, checking his wristwatch, gun in hand.
          Obviously performing a similar ritual to Joe's.

          JOE (V.O.)
          Time travel in the future is so
          illegal, that when we sign up for
          this job we agree to a very
          specific proviso.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          8.
          Zach raises his gun.

          JOE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
          If our employers in the future get
          busted up by the law, their first
          priority is going to be erasing any
          trace of their relationship with us
          ever existing.
          A flash of light, and a HOG TIED MAN with a sack over his
          head kneels in front of Zach.
          Zach fires, and the man's chest explodes.

          JOE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
          So. If they're busted, and if
          we're still alive 30 years from
          now, they'll find our older self
          and zap him back to us, like any
          other job.
          Zach rips open the back of the corpse's jacket, revealing
          several dozen gold bars taped to his back.

          JOE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
          This is called closing your loop.
          Zach freezes. Looks at the shape of the corpse's face
          through the sack.

          JOE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
          And you get paid out a mythic
          amount of money, and you get a
          handshake and get released from
          your contract. Enjoy the next 30
          years.

          INT. STEEP STAIRS

          Zach reaches the top of the stairs, a grin on his face.

          JOE (V.O.)
          This job doesn't tend to attract
          the most forward thinking people.

                         ZACH
          So are we celebrating?
          At the bottom of the stairs, a skinny young thug in ratty
          jeans. This is KID BLUE.

                         KID BLUE
          No loopers on fucking Wednesdays!
          The loopers collectively flip him off.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          9.

                         ZACH
          Suck one, kid!

          INT. LA BELLE AURORE CLUB - NIGHT

          Lurid and very loud mixture of a dance club and cabaret. One
          by one the LOOPERS emerge from side exits, sneaking in.
          Paupers at the feast.

          INT. LA BELLE AURORE BATHROOM - NIGHT

          Joe and several other Loopers pass around an EYE DROPPER.
          Pupils slacken. The drug spins him into a slurred revelry.

          INT. LA BELLE AURORE CLUB

          Joe staggers out on the dance floor. Miles high.

          EXT. LA BELLE AURORE - NIGHT

          Joe and the loopers are kicked out by burly GAT MEN, followed
          by Kid Blue, pointing and yelling at them. The loopers laugh
          their asses off.

          EXT. CITY STREETS - NIGHT

          Joe's Miata screams through the abandoned city streets,
          racing with several other loopers in trucks and sports cars.

          IN THE CAR
          Jammed with Seth and Loopers, Joe at the wheel. Still so
          high. Suddenly one of the Loopers SHOUTS -- Joe slams the

                         BRAKES

          EXT. VAGRANT VILLAGE - NIGHT

          Screaming to a halt just shy of a malnourished BEGGAR KID.
          Caught in the headlights. Behind him, a miserable vagrant
          village in a field.

          IN THE CAR
          Joe stares at the kid, frozen. A moment. Then spins the
          wheel, peels out. The Loopers hoot and shout. Joe's Miata
          screams along the dirt road bordering the vagrant village,
          whizzing past open fires and dirty huddled families.
          JOE'S FACE - serene and focused. Going somewhere.

          EXT. SETH'S APARTMENT - DAWN

          Joe drops Seth off at his building with its bright red
          garage.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          10.

                         JOE
          Sell that goddamn slat bike back.
          That's a lot of stupid money.

                         SETH
          I got stupid money.
          Seth holds his hand under fuzzy dice hanging from Joe's
          mirror, and they spin.

                         JOE
          Alright.
          Seth stumbles toward his door, checks his pants.

                         SETH
          I think I did something. You know
          what? TKs are special. Fuck you.

                         JOE
          Hey Seth.
          Seth slumps against the car.

                         JOE (CONT'D)
          Alright, Zach. What's his payout,
          30? 40? If that? That's not
          going to last you 30 years. And it
          won't get you overseas.

                         SETH
          Overseas...

                         JOE
          So in five, ten years you're back
          to riding the rails, or worse
          you're like Kid Blue, working as a
          gat man, wagging your dick at
          loopers and roughing up shop clerks
          for payoff money.

                         SETH
          Fuckin Kid Blue.

                         JOE
          Save a little something. Alright?
          Cause that'll be yours, and then
          you've got yours and that's all
          that matters, your life is your
          own.

                         SETH
          I gots mine you gots yours. I wish
          I was smart like you. Saint Joe.
          Seth pats Joe's cheek, and waddles off towards his apartment.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          11.

          INT. JOE'S APARTMENT - MORNING

          An alarm wakes Joe, red-eyed.

          INT. JOE'S APARTMENT ENTRYWAY - MORNING

          In his bathrobe, Joe checks his apartment mailbox. A slip of
          folded paper inside, with â14:30â handwritten on it.

          INT. JOE'S APARTMENT

          Dressed now, Joe double-checks his french book for a phrase
          and heads out.

          EXT. FARMLAND ROAD - DAY

          Joe's truck zooms away from the city, into corn fields.

          EXT. CORN FIELD

          Joe's pocket watch at 2:29, ticking away.
          A hog-tied MAN with a sack on his head appears before Joe.
          Shoots the man in the chest, without hesitation.

          INT. DINER - DAY

          Joe sits at a booth, the waitress Beatrix brings his coffee.

                         BEATRIX
          Bon jour Joe.

                         JOE
          Ravi de te voir, Beatrix.

                         BEATRIX
          Ooh la la.

          INT. PAWN SHOP BACK ROOM - DAY

          JEDD, 70s and knarled, sits in a tiny closet of a work room.
          Following a BUZZ, Joe appears on a fuzzy monitor, standing in
          the hall.

          JOE (OVER SPEAKER)
          Two, Jedd.
          Jedd opens a slot and takes two gold bars from Joe, then
          hands him out a small stack of cash.
          Marks in a notebook Joe's name, the date and the number â2'.
          All the other transactions have the number â4'.

          INT. JOE'S APARTMENT

          Joe smooths out the oriental rug.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          12.

          INT. LA BELLE AURORE CLUB - NIGHT

          Joe drinks with Dale, watches a group of Loopers celebrating
          at another table.

                         DALE
          What's that, fourth loop closed
          this month?
          Dale casually makes a fork float above his palm, lifting his
          eyebrows at passing ladies.

                         JOE
          Fourth.
          On the stage, flinging her legs with a line of can-can
          dancers, is Suzie. The girl Joe watched in the bordello. As
          her dance ends Joe stands and goes backstage.

          INT. BACKSTAGE

          Suzie weaves towards her dressing room. Joe catches her.

                         SUZIE
          Hey.

                         JOE
          You working a shift tonight?

                         SUZIE
          Yeah.

                         (REALIZES)
          Yeah, but one of the gat men bought
          me out already. For the night.

                         JOE
          Oh.

                         SUZIE
          Sweetie. I gotta work.
          She leaves him watching her go.
          He turns - sees Kid Blue leaning in the shadows. He's seen
          this whole exchange. The Kid smirks.

          INT. LA BELLE AURORE CLUB

          Joe bursts back into the club with a vengeance.

          INT. JOE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - LATER

          Joe staggers in. Not doing so hot.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          13.

          INT. JOE'S BATHROOM - NIGHT

          Looks at himself in the mirror. Eyes red as candy. He pops
          open a hidden drawer next to his medicine cabinet, pulls out
          an eye dropper and puts one in each.

          INT. JOE'S APARTMENT - LATER THAT NIGHT

          A harsh POUNDING.
          Joe, flopped on the bed, stirs. Then wakes with a jump,
          shaky on his feet.
          Goes to the door. A screen shows nobody in the hall outside.
          Still punch-drunk, Joe listens. POUND POUND POUND. The
          window. Joe slides it open. Seth tumbles in off the fire
          escape.

                         JOE
          Jesus, Seth.

                         SETH
          They're gonna be here any minute,
          are they here?

                         JOE
          No, they're not here. Who?

                         SETH
          Christ. Joe. Christ.
          Joe's eyes focus a bit, he tunes in to the situation. Turns
          the apartment lights off.

                         SETH (CONT'D)
          (re: the lights)
          What are you doing? Right. Smart.

                         JOE
          Seth, sit down here.
          CRASH! Seth knocks something over in the dark. Joe opens
          the fridge, pale light. Seth sits at the kitchen table.

                         SETH
          Late to my own funeral. Mom always
          said...

                         JOE
          Tell me now.

                         SETH
          Christ, Joe. Late to my own
          goddamn funeral. Can you help me?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          14.

                         JOE
          Seth, what did you do?

                         SETH
          You can protect me a little, right?
          Just so they don't... jeez. Oh
          jeez. This is like a nightmare.
          This is a nightmare.

          JOE (V.O.)
          I knew then what he did so I don't
          know why I asked.

                         JOE (CONT'D)
          What did you do?
          Seth lifts his eyes to Joe.

                         SETH
          He was singing.

          EXT. CORN FIELD - DAY (FLASHBACK)

          FLASH: a hog-tied man with a sack over his head appears.
          Singing.
          Seth, with his gun raised, hesitates.

          SETH (V.O.)
          Through the gag and mask, but I
          could hear the tune. Deep
          memories, my mom in a dark room,
          singing. Back warm and safe, when
          I coulda still been good. And once
          I knew it was him... Joe I
          couldn't. I couldn't. I had to
          see.
          Seth pulls the sack off the man's head.

          INT. JOE'S APARTMENT


                         SETH
          Joe I can't even tell you. Looking
          in his eyes. I had to let him
          talk, then. I don't even remember
          the words, but I remember believing
          every one of them, or not even
          believing, but submitting. I've
          never felt that small before. I've
          never felt that happy. He told me.
          I remember, there's a new holy
          terror boss-man in the future, and
          he's closing all the loops. The
          Rainmaker, they call him. He told
          me.

                         SETH (CONT'D)
          Then he wanted a cigarette and I
          untied him, and he gives me this
          look. And he just starts running.

          EXT. CORN FIELD - DAY (FLASHBACK)

          Seth standing with his gun in his limp arm, receding behind
          us as we run away.

          SETH (V.O.)
          And I had my blunderbuss so I know
          he's got about fifteen strides till
          he's out of my range. And they
          come and go, and I just watch him
          till he's gone.

          INT. JOE'S APARTMENT

          Seth breaks down crying.

          JOE (V.O.)
          This is called letting your loop
          run. It's not a good thing.

                         SETH
          What do I do? You're the only
          friend I got Joe you gotta help me

                         JOE
          You fucking idiot coming here.
          Seth, sucker punched.

          JOE (CONT'D)
          You can't be here, I'll give you a
          little money but you gotta

          Joe? A little - where am I gonna -

          You hop a freight train, you beat
          it the hell out
          POUND POUND POUND. On the door this time. Seth makes a sound
          like he's going to die, Joe closes the fridge, hisses

                         JOE (CONT'D)
          Shut up. Don't move.
          Goes to the door. Two GAT MEN and Kid Blue stand outside.

                         KID BLUE
          Open up Joe!
          (to the gat man)
          Watch the window.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          16.
          Joe spins from the door. Considers briefly.

                         JOE
          I can't do anything for you Seth.
          Seth crumples to his knees, grasping Joe's hand.

                         SETH
          No! You gotta hide me! Joe, hide
          me, please Christ please Joe please
          hide me tell em something to buy
          time and I'll leave please-

          POUND POUND POUND.

                         JOE
          Hold on!
          Watching Seth, Joe's face breaks in a moment of decision. He
          flips the lights on, and briskly pulls back his oriental rug.
          A FLOOR SAFE with a touch pad. He enters a code, opens it.
          Wide and deeper than you'd expect, lined with gold bars. Big
          enough for a man. Seth scrambles in.
          Joe takes one last look at Seth's frightened, grateful face,
          framed by the gold bars, then closes the safe and smooths the
          oriental rug.
          POUND POUND POUND- Joe opens the door.
          Kid Blue storms in, his gun drawn, sweeping through the
          apartment with over-eager purpose.
          One gat man stays outside, the other casually sits at Joe's
          kitchen table. Kid Blue gets in Joe's face.

                         KID BLUE
          That took awhile.

                         JOE
          You think it's easy looking this
          good?

                         KID BLUE
          Tye's going to watch your apartment
          while we go have a talk with Abe.
          Joe grabs a jacket.

                         JOE
          There's coffee in the tin.

                         TYE

          Kid Blue leads Joe down the stairs and into the door at their
          base.

          INT. WAITING ROOM

          Dingy with a few benches. In one wall three steep stairs
          lead to a high door. Kid Blue knocks. Muffled voice from

                         WITHIN:

          ABE (O.S.)
          Two minutes.

                         LATER
          Joe and Kid Blue on benches, facing each other. The Kid
          stares daggers and spins his gun. Joe tries his best not to
          engage.

                         KID BLUE
          You know why they call that pea
          shooter a blunderbuss? Cuz it's
          impossible to hit anything farther
          than 15 feet, and impossible to
          miss anything closer. A gun for
          fuck up turkeys. Not like a gat.
          A gat has range. Accuracy.
          His gun spinning gets fancier. His gun meaner looking than
          Joe's blunderbuss, long and slim and chrome.

                         JOE
          Alright, cut it out Kid. You're
          gonna blow your foot off again.
          The Kid almost snaps back, but then grins.

                         KID BLUE
          You're right, it'd be real easy for
          it to accidentally go off.
          He clicks the safety off. Joe shifts uncomfortably.

                         JOE
          C'mon.

                         KID BLUE
          Don't disrespect a gat man, Looper.
          Joe stifles a chuckle.
          In a flash, the Kid stands and pistol-whips him across the
          face. Joe falls back. The Kid raises his gun at Joe.
          Frozen in that tableau a moment, the Kid savors his victory.
          Lowers his gun.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          18.

          ABE (O.S.)
          What the hell is going on out there-
          The high door swings open fast, SMACKING Kid Blue hard on the
          side of the head. His gun goes off, firing into the wall.
          Out of nowhere three gat men burst into the room, guns drawn.
          ABE, a sallow man in his 50s, appears in the high doorway.

                         KID BLUE
          S'alright, s'alright.
          Humiliated, the Kid tries to stand, but falls over again.
          After a moment everyone realizes what's happened, and the
          tension breaks.

                         ABE
          Alright. Joe.
          Joe climbs into the doorway. Kid Blue stands shakily.

                         ABE (CONT'D)
          You didn't shoot your other foot
          off, didja kid?
          The door closes, and the gat men laugh at the Kid.

          INT. ABE'S OFFICE

          Cluttered, with a big desk. Joe sits, Abe hands him a
          handkerchief for the ugly gash on his cheek.

                         ABE
          My great grandfather always told my
          grandfather, men's like spiders.
          It's the little ones you gotta be
          careful of.

                         JOE
          Dunno I agree with that.

                         ABE
          Oh yeah? Well. What the fuck did
          my great grandfather know.

          JOE (V.O.)
          This man is from the future. He
          was sent back here by the mob, a
          one way ticket, to run the Loopers.
          That's low effort even for Abe, so
          to pass the time he recruited some
          real muscle, the Gat Men. Now he
          runs the city. Any other city,
          that'd be impressive.
          Abe settles in his chair. Regards Joe.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          19.

                         ABE
          How can you kids stand those
          chokers? This, the cravats.

                         JOE
          Ties.

                         ABE
          Ridiculous. You're aware we don't
          have a dress code.

                         JOE

                         (SHRUGS)
          Fashion.

                         ABE
          You know, you don't know, the
          movies you're dressing like were
          copying other movies. Goddamn 20th
          century affectations, do something
          new. Put a glowing thing around
          your neck or use... rubberized..
          (waves at Joe's suit)
          Be new.

                         JOE
          Okay.
          A beat of silence.

                         JOE (CONT'D)
          Well it was nice chatting with you
          Abe.

                         ABE
          I do like you, Joe. But we're sure
          enough Seth paid you a visit we're
          gonna hafta do something about
          this.

                         JOE
          Seth?

                         ABE
          You're expecting we're gonna break
          your fingers with a hammer or
          something awful, and I'm going to
          diffuse that tension right now,
          that isn't going to happen. What's
          going to happen is, I'm going to
          talk for a little, not even that
          long, then you're gonna give up
          your friend.

                         JOE
          My friend Seth? I'm confused.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          20.

                         ABE
          Well then I'll talk a little. You
          know you were the youngest looper I
          ever hired? You looked goddamn
          ridiculous they said, the
          blunderbuss up to here on you. But
          I remember they brought you in, I
          forget what it was for,

                         JOE
          Watch shop.

                         ABE
          That's yeah, you had rolled one of
          our fronts, a watch shop. And they
          had you, your arms pinned, this
          kid. Like an animal. But you
          looked at me, your hair stuck to
          half your face so just this one eye
          looking at me. And I thought
          what's this kid lived through, what
          he had taken away from him. What's
          he lost. And I could see, like
          seeing it happen clear as seeing
          it, the bad path in front of you,
          the bad version of your life. Like
          a vision I saw it happen, you
          turning bad. So I cleaned you up
          and put a gun in your hand. I gave
          you something that was yours.

                         JOE
          You know I'm grateful, Abe.
          Genuine. But Abe shakes his hands, not where he's going.

                         ABE
          I gave you something that was
          yours. And I remember that kid,
          and I think when you ask yourself
          you ask who would I sacrifice for
          what's mine, I think Seth is deep
          and cozy inside that circle.
          Pause. Both their eyes go to a hammer sitting on the desk.

                         ABE (CONT'D)
          That hammer's there for something
          else later, that's not, it's a bad
          coincidence.

                         JOE
          Okay.

                         ABE
          Show you how much I know you, I'm
          not even gonna break you, just set
          you back a ways.

                         (MORE)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          21.

                         ABE (CONT'D)
          We know you've been stashing half
          your bars. Which is smart. You
          give up Seth, or you give us half
          your stash. For Seth.
          Joe holds Abe's gaze for a moment, then his eyes drop and
          it's over.

                         JOE
          Will you kill him?

                         ABE
          No. Would be too cataclysmic a
          change to the future. What we'll
          do is dangerous in that regard, but
          not as dangerous as killing him,
          and not by twice as having him run
          free.

                         (BEAT)
          Joe I let him run more than a few
          days, the boys in the future get
          nervous, then bing! my replacement
          shows up. With a gun. So we'll do
          what we have to do.
          Silence.

                         JOE
          Floor safe, beneath the rug. 6742.
          One of the gat men quietly exits.

                         ABE
          It's the little ones that get you.

          INT. WAITING ROOM

          Abe leads Joe out, past gat men and Kid Blue, smirking again.

                         ABE
          Why don't you kill an hour, Joe.
          On the house.
          After Joe exits, Abe and Kid exchange looks.

          ABE (CONT'D)
          Call the doc.

          INT. BORDELLO ENTRANCE

          Joe slumps in. Several girls, none of them Suzie.

                         MADAME
          Suzie's just getting off. Doubt
          she's up for it.
          He pushes through the velvet curtained door.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          22.

          INT. BLACK HALLWAY

          A large gat man pushes past Joe.
          At the end of the hall, Suzie leans in a doorway smoking a
          cigarette. Not sexy, just tired. She sees Joe, and is about
          to say no. But she sees Joe's eyes, and doesn't.
          Exhaling a plume of smoke, she withdraws into her doorway.
          Joe follows. Through her smoke.

          INT. SUZIE'S BEDROOM - LATER

          Suzie naked at the mirror. She goes to Joe, lying on the
          bed, distant.

                         JOE
          I can't remember my mother's face.
          I remember her touching my hair.
          Like this.
          He takes Suzie's hand strokes it over his hair. She smiles
          briefly, tired, then takes her hand away and puts drops in
          his eyes.

                         JOE (CONT'D)
          Do you want to go overseas?

                         SUZIE
          Do I want to go overseas? With
          you? Now?

                         JOE
          Soon, maybe.

                         SUZIE
          Baby that's sweet. You're a sweet
          boy. You gotta be careful, it's
          easy to think you know someone once
          you been like this. What's in here
          is services rendered.

                         JOE
          Is that how it aughta be?

                         SUZIE
          What, in nature?

                         (BEAT)
          You know I get this a lot.
          Especially young guys. I must have
          wife eyes or something.
          His face clouds.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          23.

          INT. JOE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

          Joe gets home. Empty, quiet. Everything in place. He goes
          to the rug, pulls it aside. Opens the safe.
          All the gold, and nothing else. One bar juts from the side,
          knocked out of place.
          He pushes it back, and when he lifts his fingers they have a
          bright smear of fresh red blood.

          EXT. CITY OUTSKIRTS - NIGHT

          A hunched figure sprints through an abandoned lot towards a
          train yard.
          It is a 55 YEAR OLD SETH. He limps up to a razor-wire fence
          bordering the train yard.
          Surveys the sharp wire, rips the lining from his jacket and
          wraps first his left hand then his right.
          But stops.
          On the palm of his right hand, a WEATHERED SCAR. Clearly
          carved in the shape of an arrow, pointing down to his wrist.
          Old Seth squints at it, confused. He pulls back his sleeve,
          revealing his clean bare forearm.
          Then his face changes.
          Because his arm is no longer bare. Suddenly, out of nowhere,
          more intricate scarring has appeared down its length.
          The scars spell out clearly: âBE AT 75 WIRE STREET IN 15

                         MINUTESÂ
          Old Seth's breath returns, jagged. He pulls his sleeve up
          and hoists himself up the fence, climbing fast.
          He reaches the top, gets a good grasp on the wire to hoist
          himself over... and stops again.
          His right hand is missing a finger. The ring finger is just
          gone, its stump worn with age.
          Old Seth stares. And now his middle finger is gone as well.
          A freight train whistle moans. The cars, open and inviting,
          leading out of town. Behind him, the city.
          Terror and indecision seizes his chest, so much so that it
          takes a moment for him to realize the sound of his breathing
          has changed to a ragged whistle.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          24.
          He lifts his hand, now with just two fingers, to his face...
          and the smooth scarred hole where his nose used to be.

          EXT. CITY STREETS

          The train yard far in the distance. Old Seth RUNNING back
          into town.
          He looks down at his right hand, fingerless now but for his
          thumb.
          He speeds up, desperate. Cuts through an alley. And has no
          right hand, just a stump.

                         OLD SETH
          No no no no no!
          A bell-like DING. Old Seth spins, sees a WEDDING BAND lying
          on the sidewalk.
          He picks it up with the four remaining fingers on his left
          hand, stuffs it in his pocket, sobbing.
          Bursts out of the alleyway, limping now, straight into the
          street and into the headlights of an oncoming car.
          The car screeches to a halt, and its harsh white light shows
          Old Seth's missing right ear, and deep scars down his face.

          IN THE CAR
          Old Seth throws open the drivers side door and throws out the
          DRIVER. Jams on the gas.
          Speeding through the streets, hands slipping on the wheel.
          His pant leg crumples. Empty boot tangling with the pedals.

          EXT. WIRE STREET

          The car hits a pole.
          Out climbs what's left of Old Seth, his face mangled, missing
          a foot, one arm gone to the elbow.
          Street sign - WIRE STREET. The numbers, 45.
          He runs. Howling, missing his tongue. Arm totally gone.
          Then falls as his leg goes to the knees. And he's crawling,
          an animal form, bellowing wordlessly.
          Makes it to an iron street-side door. 75. And with his one
          arm, slams it.
          Slumps against it, heaving. After a long moment it swings
          open.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          25.
          With no hesitation, a BLAST from the darkened doorway, and
          Old Seth's head mists open. He slumps to the pavement.
          Kid Blue steps from the doorway, drags the body inside.
          Deep in the dark doorway we glimpse a DOCTOR in a surgical
          frock smeared with bright red blood. The door SLAMS.

          INT. JOE'S APARTMENT - MORNING

          Joe wakes with a start.

          EXT. CORN FIELD

          Joe's pocket watch at 2:29, ticking away. He takes his
          stance. Earbud headphones, the drone of French lessons.
          A hog-tied MAN with a sack on his head appears kneeling
          before Joe. Joe raises his gun without hesitation and shoots
          the man in the chest.
          Walks to the body, flips it. The man's hands, tied and
          purplish. Joe hesitates. Puts his hand next to them.
          Similar.
          He flips the man onto his back, stares long and hard at the
          shape of the man's face under the cloth sack.
          Tears it off. An older Asian man's face, frozen in terror.
          Joe smirks, the spell broken. His face hardens.

          INT. PLANT - DAY

          Joe watches the Asian man's body slide down the hatch and
          vanish in a puff of distant fire.

                         BEGIN MONTAGE:
          1. Joe in the club, drinking, watching more loopers
          celebrate.
          2. Joe in the field, he shoots a hog-tied man.
          3. Joe in his floor safe, setting more gold bars.
          4. Joe in the field, BANG.
          5. Joe in the club, watching Suzie with her red hair.
          6. Joe in the field, BANG.
          7. In the plant, a body sliding into the fire.
          8. Joe in the field, BANG. BANG. BANG. His face more
          determined with each shot.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          26.

          EXT. CORN FIELD - DAY

          Our montage comes to an end suddenly and all is silent.
          Joe in the corn field, in his stance, ready to draw.
          But nothing happens. Silence. Joe checks his watch,
          confused.
          2:30 and change. Waits. Watching the blank space where the
          man is supposed to appear.
          Hand on his gun. Breathing shallow. Something is wrong.
          2:32. An eternity. Then, there he is.
          But different. Not kneeling. On his side, so he flops over
          and has to straighten himself. The man's hands are UNTIED.
          Holy shit.
          Joe raises his gun, scared. Time slows. Finger tightens on
          the trigger.
          Then he sees: the man has NO SACK ON HIS HEAD. And the face
          that stares back at Joe is his own.
          57 YEAR OLD JOE. His eyes fixed on Joe.
          And for just one split second, Joe's face slackens, and his
          finger eases on the trigger.
          It's all the hesitation Old Joe needs. He throws his body
          into a spin.
          Joe snaps out of it, and PULLS THE TRIGGER.
          The shot catches Old Joe square in the back, and the impact
          blows him forward. But instead of blood beneath his torn
          jacket's back, we see the layered gold bars spill out. They
          caught the blast.
          In what seems like one fluid motion Old Joe's fingers grab
          one of the bars, he spins again, throwing handfuls of dirt
          and the bar back towards Joe.
          Joe flinches, again just for a moment, and when his eyes
          focus again and his arm steadies the gun it's too late.
          Old Joe is on top of him, with a heavy blow knocking the gun
          aside, and with an even heavier one swinging down on Joe's
          head, a fist and then

          THE CORN FIELD, HOURS LATER
          Joe wakes. Blood caked on his face. Headphones beside him,
          still squawking French lessons. Sits up.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          27.

                         JOE
          Oh god.
          Gold bars scattered in the dirt. But no Old Joe. And no
          truck. Joe staggers to his feet, shaky. Head thick. But
          realizing.

                         JOE (CONT'D)
          Late to my own funeral.

          EXT. FARMLAND ROAD - LATE AFTERNOON

          Joe runs, shaky, towards town. Fishes his phone-device from
          his pocket, chucks it.

          EXT. JOE'S APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT

          Across the street, Joe huddles behind a car, breathing hard.
          Looks up at his lit window. Debating.

          INT. JOE'S APARTMENT HALLWAY

          Joe walks silently towards his apartment door.
          It is ajar. He hesitates. Knows he shouldn't.

          INT. JOE'S APARTMENT

          Holding his breath, Joe edges in. It's ravaged, torn to
          pieces. The floor safe is open, about half the gold bars
          missing. But the apartment seems empty.
          Exhaling, Joe works quickly. Knocks a tile aside, pulls a
          wad of cash from the wall. A heavy jacket from the closet.
          Eyes dart around the room - what else? But too late --
          footsteps in the hallway. Joe ducks into the bathroom just
          as Kid Blue and a TALL GAT MAN enter the apartment.

          INT. JOE'S BATHROOM

          Joe crouches. Outside, Kid Blue piles the man's arms full of
          gold bars.

          KID BLUE (O.S.)
          That's twenty four there. I'm
          keeping count.

          TALL GAT MAN (O.S.)
          Uh huh.

          KID BLUE (O.S.)
          Two more trips should do it.
          Joe gently lifts himself off his haunches.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          28.

          INT. JOE'S APARTMENT

          The Tall Gat Man exits, Kid Blue stays crouched over the
          floor safe hefting out bars, his back to the bathroom. In
          the distance, a GUNSHOT. Kid Blue's head perks up.
          CREAK! From the bathroom. Quick as lightning, the Kid draws
          his gat and spins - but Joe is already upon him, full sprint.
          SLAM! Joe tackles the Kid backwards. But while Joe uses his
          momentum to leap over the OPEN FLOOR SAFE, the Kid tumbles
          back into it, vanishing inside with a painful thud.
          Joe scrambles to a stop, lifts the heavy safe trap door and
          SLAMS it down - just as the Kid's hand grasps the open edge.
          With a sickening CRACK, the trap door closes on the Kid's
          fingers.
          A bellowing howl, his fingers withdraw, and the safe door
          clicks shut. The ELECTRIC BOX rigged to the code pad to
          crack it clatters off, and whirrrr, CLICK. Locked. Joe,
          panting, goes on hands and knees to the safe door and shouts
          clear and earnest:

                         JOE
          Kid listen Kid. I'm sorry. Tell
          Abe I'm going to fix this. Tell
          him keep my bars safe cause I swear
          to god I'm going to fix this, I'm
          going to find my loop and I'm gonna
          kill him. Tell Abe-
          CRACK CRACK! The wood paneled floor above the safe door
          splinters upwards with gunshots, and a chunk of Joe's right
          ear explodes.
          More blood than you'd think spills down his neck, Joe falls
          back. Three more shots - CRACK CRACK CRACK! And now
          footsteps running down the hall.
          Joe on his feet, slipping in his own blood, sprints across
          the apartment. The TALL GAT MAN appears in the doorway,
          shooting blindly at Joe, chunks of wall and plaster exploding
          as Joe doesn't stop but JUMPS OUT THE WINDOW.

          EXT. JOE'S APARTMENT WINDOW - NIGHT

          5 floors up, Joe leaps out, hits the fire escape, bullets
          shattering the window. Blind with blood, ears ringing, Joe
          barrels down the fire escape. A confused blur of iron steps,
          slipping and scrambling down, but now the tall gat man is out
          the window and shooting down at him.
          Somehow Joe slips and rolls, grabs at thin air, falling -
          three stories at least, falling.
          When he hits the ground the world goes away.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         OLD JOE

                         

                         

                         

                         

          29.

          EXT. CORN FIELD - DAY

          We abruptly CUT ON to a very familiar scene.
          Young Joe stands alone in the corn field, in his stance,
          ready to draw. But nothing happens. Silence. Joe checks
          his watch, confused. 2:30 and change.
          This is exactly the scene where Old Joe appears, being
          replayed before our eyes. But when Old Joe does APPEAR, it's
          different: his hands are tied, his head covered with a sack.
          And something very different happens:
          Joe raises his gun and without hesitation PULLS THE TRIGGER.
          Old Joe's chest explodes. He falls dead.
          Joe approaches the body, and slows. Sensing something. He
          pulls off the sack. The face of his older self. Old Joe.
          He flips him over. Gold bars CLINK beneath a bloody jacket.
          Joe has closed his loop.

          INT. LA BELLE AURORE CLUB - NIGHT

          The other LOOPERS buy Joe drinks and cheer him, celebrating.

          INT. JOE'S APARTMENT - MORNING

          His belongings in boxes. Joe unloads the GOLD BARS from the
          trap door.

          EXT. CARGO SHIP DECK - DAY

          Out at sea. Joe, bundled against the cold, leans on a
          railing, eagerly watching the horizon.

          INT. PARIS APARTMENT - DAY

          Joe smoking in window of an empty apartment, half unpacked.

          EXT. PARIS STREETS - DAY

          Joe walking the city streets, breathing deep. Alive.

          INT. PARIS BODEGA - NIGHT

          Joe picks up a bottle of beer.
          Several FRENCH GANGSTERS in suits shake down the OWNER of the
          shop for money from the register. One holds a gun in the
          owner's face.
          Joe ignores them, walks out.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          30.

          INT. PARIS CLUB - NIGHT

          Loud and dark. Joe shotguns eye drops right out in the open,
          dances like a madman.

          INT. PARIS APARTMENT - DAY

          Joe's apartment, unpacked and lived in. Joe smokes.
          In a NOOK behind a wall panel - stacks of CASH.

          EXT. PARIS STREETS - DAY

          Cloudy and cold. Joe wanders alone. Buffeted by strangers.

          EXT. PARIS CLUB - NIGHT

          Music pumping, Joe deadened at a table, in another world.
          Beside him a YOUNG PUNK makes a glass float using his TK
          power, then shatters the glass. Red liquid goes everywhere.

          INT. PARIS APARTMENT - DAY

          Joe takes money from the stacks in the nook, which have grown
          drastically low.
          LATER - sets a hypo down in the ashtray.

          INT. PARIS BODEGA - DAY

          A GUN in the face of the shop's OWNER. Held by Joe. Several
          years older now, in his mid thirties.
          Dressed in a suit, surrounded by fellow GANGSTERS. Now part
          of their gang.

          EXT. PARIS STREETS - NIGHT

          A shoot-out between rival gangs. Joe's guns blaze.
          A remorseless killer. Blasting away, cold and skillful.
          Smashing up shops that won't pay protection. He's muscle.

          INT. PARIS GANG HEADQUARTERS

          A dingy dark hallway. Distant thumping bass indicates it's
          maybe behind a club.
          The hall is lined with French Gangster, all similarly
          dressed. Reminiscent of the Gat Men. It takes us a moment
          to recognize Joe among them.
          In his EARLY 40s now. His face a hard weathered mask. A
          soldier. (Note - it is here we transition from the actor
          playing Young Joe to the one playing Old Joe.)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          31.

          EXT. PARIS STREETS - DAY

          Snow on the ground.

          INT. PARIS CLUB - NIGHT

          Old Joe high as a kite, in an all out brawl. Punched to the
          ground. Laughing his ass off.
          A bar fight blossoms in slow motion all around.
          Old Joe looks up, sees the woman who will be his WIFE for the
          first time. Long red hair (reminiscent of but NOT Suzie.) In
          a green dress. She flees the fighting, towards the exit.

          âSORTIE.â
          Transfixed and high, Old Joe follows her. Puts his hand on
          her shoulder. She turns, looks him over. Flips him off.
          Leaves. Old Joe watches her go. In love.

          INT. PARIS CAFE - DAY

          Old Joe hits on his future Wife, she tells him to fuck off.

          INT. PARIS BEDROOM - DAY

          Old Joe in bed with his future Wife. They kiss.

          EXT. PARIS STREETS - DAY

          Old Joe shoots up a storefront with his gang.

          INT. PARIS APARTMENT - DAY

          Old Joe's future wife yells at him, holding his gun holsters
          accusingly. She throws them across the room.
          LATER - He holds her in bed, both of them troubled.

          INT. CAR - DAY

          Old Joe driving. Deep in thought. His future Wife beside
          him, her hand on his. He hits the brakes.

          EXT. FRENCH BEACH / HIGHWAY - CONTINUOUS

          The car screeches to a halt on a beach side road. Old Joe
          gets out, runs across the beach to the water, pulling his gun
          out of its holster. He fires it out to sea till its empty,
          then throws the gun into the ocean.
          He runs back to his Wife, standing on the beach. They kiss.
          They fall to the sand, and kiss.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          32.

          EXT. FRENCH COUNTRYSIDE - DAY

          A cottage in the country.

          INT. FRENCH COTTAGE BEDROOM - NIGHT

          Old Joe sweats and shudders out his drug addiction. His Wife
          tends to him.

          EXT. FRENCH COTTAGE - SUNSET - YEARS LATER

          Old Joe in his mid 50s, his Wife lying on a hammock with him,
          reading. Hands lazily entwined. A good life.

          INT. FRENCH COTTAGE KITCHEN - MORNING - A WEEK LATER

          The Wife cuts vegetables. Headlines (in French) scroll
          across a small floating screen, against images of
          destruction. âGangland Terror Spreads, Who is The Rainmakerâ
          She turns it off.

          INT. FRENCH BEDROOM - MORNING

          Lazy, dust motes hanging in the sunlight through the windows.
          Old Joe in bed, in his late 50s.
          His Wife walks through, says something inconsequential, puts
          her hand on his foot. Draws it away, fingers sliding off
          gently. And is gone.
          We stay with Old Joe. His deep breath. The sun warming the
          sheets. Running water from the kitchen.
          His eyes focus on his hand. Written in faded ink on the palm
          is a number we do not recognize: 07153902935.
          A long moment.
          With all the violence in the world, the cottage's green front
          door is KICKED OPEN.
          Joe runs out of the bedroom half dressed, and GANGSTERS grab
          him, taking him down with a rifle butt to the head.
          His Wife is dragged from the kitchen screaming.

          EXT. COTTAGE - CONTINUOUS

          Dark cars parked out front. We watch the quiet facade for a
          moment too long, violence that we don't want to think about
          happening inside.
          Then the door BURSTS open and Gangsters drag Joe out, sobbing
          thrashing and bleeding from his head.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          33.

          INT. BASEMENT - DAY

          Concrete, nondescript. The Gangsters carry Joe in, now hog
          tied. Put a sack over his head.
          Lead him towards a machine, an iron monstrosity with a hatch.
          One of the men taps his watch - hurry. Another man pulls a
          large lever, and the machine hums, warming up.
          Joe's face, covered with the sack. Breathing. Remembering:
          flashes of his WIFE, screaming.
          Then Joe LUNGES and somehow his hands are loose, he PUNCHES
          one man, tears off the sack, PUNCHES another man, a flurry
          and then it's over. He stands among a pile of broken men.
          Slowly takes stock. Looks at the exit. Looks at the faded
          number on his blood-smeared hand.
          A million things in his mind. But just one choice. The
          machine hums angrily. Ready.

          INT. TIME MACHINE - CONTINUOUS

          Like an iron coffin. Old Joe climbs inside. Braces himself.
          Closes the hatch behind him.
          Flash and crack and he is sent.

          EXT. CORN FIELD - DAY

          And appears in front of his younger self.
          The scene now plays out as it did the first time. Joe
          hesitates, Old Joe gets the upper hand, knocks him out.
          Old Joe looks around, gets his bearings. Stares at his
          younger self a moment. Then goes to the truck.

          EXT. HIGHWAY - DUSK

          Old Joe drives the truck into the city.

          INT. BODEGA - NIGHT

          Cramped. Old Joe walks in quickly, gets aspirin, wrapped
          sandwiches, bandages, big bottles of water. Removes his torn
          jacket, dumps it.
          At the register, the CLERK bags everything up. Old Joe pulls
          the blunderbuss on the clerk.

                         OLD JOE
          And your jacket.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          34.

          EXT. ALLEYWAY - NIGHT

          Wearing the clerk's jacket, Old Joe takes four aspirin.
          Holds his head a minute, rocking gently.

          EXT. JOE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

          On the street outside the building. Old Joe approaches,
          watching the window high above. Weighing his options.
          He scans the street. Spots an ARMORED VAN in the alleyway.
          Movement from behind it - Kid Blue and the Tall Gat Man
          loading their bars in the back.

                         OLD JOE
          Shit.
          Old Joe turns to go, but STOPS when his eye catches movement
          between parked cars.
          It's Joe. Young Joe, hid between the cars, looking up at the
          apartment building weighing his options.

          OLD JOE (CONT'D)

                         (SOTTO)
          Don't do it. Idiot. Don't do it.
          After a moment Joe dashes across the street and into the
          building. Old Joe stays still a moment, watching him go.
          Ducks into shadows as Kid Blue and the Tall Gat Man step from
          the alleyway, wiping their hands.

                         KID BLUE
          Two more trips.
          They enter the building.
          Old Joe takes a breath, then casually walks down the
          sidewalk, past the alleyway, scoping the Armored Van. A GAT
          MAN DRIVER in the driver's seat.

          INT. ARMORED VAN

          The Gat Man Driver watches Old Joe disappear from view.
          Suspicious, he uncovers a GAT on the seat beside him.
          When he looks back up Old Joe stands in his headlights,
          blunderbuss raised. BANG! The windshield shatters, the Gat
          Man Driver is torn apart.
          Old Joe runs up, flings open the door, digs through the
          bloody mess frantically, finding the GAT.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          35.

          EXT. JOE'S APARTMENT

          Old Joe dashes out onto the street as gunfire cracks from the
          high apartment window. Sharp eyes will notice that Old Joe's
          right ear is now clipped off, an old wound.
          He dashes towards the apartment door, gun in hand, but stops
          when the window five stories above shatters with gunfire.
          Old Joe backs up, and sees Joe scrambling down the fire
          escape as the TALL GAT MAN fires down at him.
          Old Joe takes expert aim with the gat, and fires three shots
          upwards. The Tall Gat Man's gunfire stops.
          Joe slips on the fire escape, falls two stories and lands on
          the hood of a parked car.
          Old Joe goes to him, checks his pulse.
          Behind them the TALL GAT MAN hits the sidewalk with a SPLAT.
          Old Joe goes to the tall gat man's remains, picks another gat
          out of them, and goes back to Joe's inert body on the car
          hood.

                         OLD JOE
          Stupid little shit.
          He lifts him in his arms.

          EXT. CITY OUTSKIRTS - NIGHT

          Joe wakes slowly, pained. Lying alone in an abandoned lot on
          the outskirts of town.
          Slowly he takes stock of himself. Nothing broken. A tight
          bandage on his ear.
          A mournful train whistle, and he turns. Through a chain link
          fence, the train yard. He was put here for a reason.
          A man and a young boy in rags hop onto an empty cargo car,
          heading out of town. Joe watches the boy, his eyes angry.
          Stands shakily. And walks away from the train yard.
          Something like a HELICOPTER sweeps overhead, a spotlight
          zigzagging the area. Joe ducks into shadows, heading towards
          the city.

          INT. LA BELLE AURORE BACKSTAGE

          A swarm of activity, Gat Men rushing in and out.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          36.

                         ABE (PRE-LAP)
          He ain't dumb like the last, we
          gotta get lucky now. Cover the
          roads out of town. Sweep the
          streets, pull in his social circle,
          pound the pavement.

          INT. ABE'S DEN

          Map spread on a table. Gat men gathered around Abe.

                         GAT MAN 3
          He'll hop a train. Fast and
          untraceable.

                         ABE
          Maybe. Sweep the train yard.
          Every second that passes is bad,
          go.

          INT. ABE'S OFFICE

          Kid Blue slumps in a chair, holding a rag to a wound on his
          head. Eyes wet from crying. Abe storms in.

                         ABE
          Stupid little shit.

                         KID BLUE
          I can't hear you
          Abe leans in next to his ear and shouts

                         ABE
          Well that's what happens when you
          fire a gat in a steel box you
          stupid little shit.

                         KID BLUE
          I can fix this. I can find him.

                         ABE
          Go home and let the grown ups work.
          Kid Blue.

          EXT. CITY STREETS - NIGHT

          More helicopters sweep the streets, searchlights blazing.
          Cars with Gat Men circle slowly, shining spotlights
          themselves.
          Joe leaps from the shadows, ducks behind a dumpster. Barely
          avoiding the light. He won't last long out here.

                         JOE
          Where would I go if I were me.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          37.
          He sprints into an alleyway, but Gat Men are coming down the
          other side with flashlights.
          Goes back the way he came, turns a corner.

          EXT. SETH'S APARTMENT

          Joe finds himself in front of a familiar BRIGHT RED GARAGE.
          Seth's apartment. Three stories up, Seth's darkened window.
          He looks up at it, hesitant but desperate.

          INT. PUBLIC LIBRARY - NIGHT

          A window shatters inward, punched through by a wrapped fist.
          A big reading hall, empty and dark. The broken window opens,
          Old Joe slides in. Weaves his way past the reading tables,
          finds what he's looking for at a desk.
          A suspended sheet of thin plastic turns out to be a computer.
          Checking his hand, he inputs the number. Navigates menus and
          windows, information flashing, searching.

          EXT. LA BELLE AURORE - NIGHT

          Gat Men in cars and helicopters patrol the streets.
          Kid Blue sits on the curb, smoking a cigarette. Seething at
          his bandaged hand. Deep in thought. His eyes lift. An
          idea.

          EXT. SETH'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

          The familiar red garage. And three stories up, Seth's lit
          window.
          Kid Blue pulls a small caliber gun from a holster concealed
          on his boot, enters the building.

          INT. PUBLIC LIBRARY - NIGHT

          Old Joe finishes printing several large documents that look
          like maps. He folds them up, pockets them.
          Dashes to the window, starts to heft himself up - And stops.
          On his hand, a smooth aged scar. Of an arrow. Pointing to
          his wrist.
          Old Joe's breath catches. He pulls down his sleeve,
          revealing âBâ then âEâ
          Then âA then âTâ... He bares his arm, reading the entire
          message.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          38.

          INT. SETH'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

          The peephole screen on the inside of Seth's apartment door.
          Kid Blue manipulating a device, a shower of sparks blows the
          screen out momentarily, and the door swings open.
          Kid Blue storms in, his gun drawn, sweeping through the
          apartment with over-eager purpose.
          Empty. He deflates. Thinks.
          Goes to the peephole screen, touches it and a menu comes up.
          A little manipulating, and the image is rewinding.
          An empty hall, scanning back half an hour. Then: young Joe.
          Kid Blue stops scanning, hits âPLAY'. Joe feels around the
          door jam, retrieves a key, and enters the apartment.
          Kid Blue exhales. Well Joe was here.
          Taps the screen again, it goes back to a live feed, and he's
          about to step away when his eye catches something.
          He pushes a square on the screen, and the view changes. To a
          live feed from a camera in the ceiling of the apartment.
          Excited, Kid rewinds this half an hour.
          On the screen: Joe enters the apartment. Rifles around a
          little, then sits at the table. Head in his hands. Staring
          into space.
          Then goes to a kitchen drawer, opens it, gets something.
          Goes to the front door, takes something off the wall, briskly
          exits.
          Kid Blue stops the screen.
          He goes and sits where Joe sat. Stares where Joe stared.
          The kitchen counter. A blender, sink. Can labeled âCOFFEE.â
          Kid goes to the kitchen drawer Joe opened, pulls it open.
          It's full of knives.
          Kid goes finally to the door, looks at the wall. A small
          rack for keys, several hanging and one empty hook.
          Kid Blue stares into space, trying to put these pieces
          together. Lights a cigarette.

          EXT. CORN FIELD - DAWN - ESTABLISHING

          The sun rises over a flat endless field of corn stalks.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          39.

          EXT. CORN FIELD

          We push forward through the green stalks at a brisk pace.
          They part before us, endless, hypnotic.

          INT. BEDROOM - MORNING - FLASHBACK

          The same from the previous flashback.
          Old Joe in bed, half asleep. A woman's arm under his neck.
          It slips away, and he kisses its wrist. Comfort, warmth.
          The woman, leaving. Her hand touches and slides off his
          foot, moving away.

          EXT. DINER - EARLY MORNING

          Old Joe emerges from the corn fields bordering the sidecar
          roadside diner. Fumbles in his jacket, dry-swallows four
          aspirin. Regains his footing. Walks around the diner
          cautiously.
          Parked in back behind a dumpster, SETH'S SLAT BIKE.

          INT. DINER

          Joe sits at a booth. Old Joe enters, steps up slowly, sits.
          A moment of silence.
          Along with his ear, Joe's hand and arm are now wrapped in
          bloodied bandages. Joe's eyes go to Old Joe's arm. Old Joe
          pulls his sleeve back and shows him the scar spelling

          âBEATRIX.â
          Beatrix the waitress steps up breezily.

                         BEATRIX
          Coffee?

                         OLD JOE
          Please. Black. And water.

                         BEATRIX
          Anything else?

                         OLD JOE

                         (TO JOE)
          Are we eating?

                         JOE
          I ordered something.

                         OLD JOE
          Steak and eggs, rare and scrambled.

                         BEATRIX
          Two steak & eggs coming up.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          40.
          She goes. Another pause.

                         OLD JOE
          We're not going to talk about time
          travel.

                         JOE
          ...ok.

                         OLD JOE
          Must hurt.
          His arm.

                         JOE
          Yeah. Didn't know if you'd

                         REMEMBER HER

                         OLD JOE
          I put it together. Clever.

                         (BEAT)
          Do I get the scar when you're cut,
          or when the knife is on its way
          down and it's inevitable that
          you're going to be cut?

                         JOE
          I'm not cutting myself again to-

                         OLD JOE
          I'm not asking you to.

                         JOE
          It's an interesting question, I've
          just lost a lot of blood today.

                         OLD JOE
          You know there's another girl here
          on weekends.

                         JOE

                         (REALIZES)
          Sue.

                         OLD JOE
          Well. Have fun explaining who
          âBeatrix' is for the next thirty
          years.
          Beatrix sets Old Joe's black coffee next to Joe's white.

          OLD JOE (CONT'D)
          How's the French coming?

                         JOE
          Good.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          41.

                         OLD JOE
          (fast in French,

                         SUBTITLED)
          I know you have a gun between your
          legs.
          Joe's face registers obvious incomprehension.

          OLD JOE (CONT'D)
          No? Well you'll get there
          eventually. Obviously.

                         JOE
          I don't care what you're here for,
          whatever you think you're going to
          get from me. More time or whatever
          you want. I can't let you walk
          away from this diner alive.
          Because the next 30 years of my

                         LIFE-

          OLD JOE JOE
          I'm sorry to cut off - sorry -are mine they're not yours
          to cut off this spiel you've they're not yours anymore you
          been practicing all night, can say anything you want but
          but I need you to need you to you're not walking outta here
          listen. Listen. alive

                         OLD JOE
          You know what the voice of god
          sounds like? See now good you're
          confused now but you're listening.
          I hope the voice of god sounds like
          an old man speaking French. Old
          men speaking French sound like
          primeval trees in a strong wind,
          just irrefutable. Wise, strong,
          gentle, all these things in
          harmony, complimentary. At once.
          Old men speaking French. Young men
          speaking French sound, without
          exception, like weenies. Fact.
          You ever hear a Frenchman under 40
          try to sound threatening? It's
          hilarious. English is a tight t-
          shirt, flatters the young. Rat a
          tat tat. French is a double
          breasted suit. Young man can put
          it on, but it always feels like
          he's putting something on. Some
          things, you just need the years.
          It's my favorite language.

                         JOE
          I've got a life ahead of me that's
          mine and I'm not giving it up for
          you or anybody

                         

                         

                         

                         

          42.

                         OLD JOE
          Well you know what you have to do
          then why don't you take your little
          gun out from between your knees and
          do it. One in the head, two in the
          heart. Boy. It's all âanybodyâ
          and âneverâ and then you show up
          here and think you can talk me into
          dying. Well bullshit we both know
          you're not going to kill me.
          Christ you ordered eggs.
          Old Joe downs two aspirin. Takes a breath.

          OLD JOE (CONT'D)
          I know why you couldn't pull that
          trigger. When you're tasked to do
          the unthinkable, your mind, it'll
          do anything it can to stop you.
          Only way is you gotta know why
          you're doing it, in your bones, so
          you can say it out loud to someone
          without apologizing. Or you gotta
          cut yourself off, go numb. But
          that'll kill you, down the line.

                         (BEAT)
          It's hard to make eye contact with
          you. It's too strange.

                         JOE
          Your face looks backwards.

                         OLD JOE
          Yeah, that helps actually. That
          little twist of unfamiliar.

                         (BEAT)
          You're not winning some pissing
          contest by looking me in the eye,
          you didn't know what I looked like
          until yesterday, it makes sense
          that it's easier for you.

                         JOE
          I wasn't trying to. Do you know
          what's going to happen? Have you
          already done all this, right now,
          as me?

                         OLD JOE
          No not - exactly - I don't want to
          talk about time travel shit,
          because we'll start talking about
          it and then we'll be here all day
          making diagrams with straws. It
          doesn't matter.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          43.

                         JOE
          When I hurt myself now, it changes
          your body. Do my actions change
          your memories?

                         OLD JOE
          It doesn't matter because I don't
          know how it works. Nobody knows
          how it works. Time travel was an
          accident, thirty years from now the
          smartest men in the world know
          exactly one thing about it that you
          don't: they know to be scared to
          death of it.

                         (BEAT)
          My memory is cloudy, there's a
          cloud. It's a, it starts clear
          then gets cloudy as it goes back..
          Goddammit hand me those.
          Straws. Joe passes him two.

          OLD JOE (CONT'D)
          And the salt. No, the pepper. The
          pepper.
          Old Joe sets two straws about a foot apart, parallel, and
          pours pepper between them, thus:

          OLD JOE (CONT'D)
          Ok, the span between the straws is
          a timeline of the next 30 years.

                         THIS
          (the left straw)
          is the present moment, right now.

                         AND THIS
          (the right straw)
          is the moment thirty years from now
          when I was sent back. The machine
          is tuned to a fixed time, you know
          that, 30 some years, it's not
          adjustable.

                         JOE
          What's the pepper?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          44.

                         OLD JOE
          The pepper is a sort of fog. See
          my memories start clear here,
          (at the right straw)
          but as they go back they get
          cloudier, until they're totally
          obscured. It's like a fog.
          Because my memories aren't really
          memories, they're one possible
          eventuality now, and they grow
          clearer or cloudier as they become
          more or less likely. But then they
          get to the present moment
          (the left straw)
          And they're instantly clear again.
          Like a wall of fog moving forward
          with the present moment. I can
          remember what you do after you do
          it.
          He pushes the left straw slowly towards the right, and it
          pushes the pepper with it.

                         JOE
          So you can

                         OLD JOE
          And it hurts.

                         JOE
          So when we're apart you can
          remember what I do. After I do it.

                         OLD JOE
          Uh huh. But
          Beatrix brings their food, two identical plates. Old Joe
          awkwardly clears away the pepper and straws.

          OLD JOE (CONT'D)
          This is a precise description of a
          fuzzy mechanism. Time travel fucks
          everything, my brain and body try
          to catch up. It's messy. That's
          why it's dangerous. And it hurts.
          All I know I know two things for
          sure. I know what's happening in my
          head. And I know that you're still
          going to meet her.

                         JOE
          Who?
          Old Joe takes a worn double of Joe's POCKET WATCH from his
          pocket, clicks it open. We don't see inside it, but he
          stares at it intently.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          45.

          JOE (CONT'D)
          This is a woman, what? I'm going to
          fall in love with?

                         OLD JOE
          She's gonna save your life.
          Old Joe makes eye contact with Joe, for maybe the first time,
          and holds it. Unexpectedly naked on his face is the deepest
          sort of grief. Deep and unrelenting. Joe can't look at it,
          he breaks off his gaze.
          The grief is too much for Old Joe to swallow back down, so he
          turns it into anger.

          OLD JOE (CONT'D)
          For a long time at the beginning
          she thought we'd have a baby. She
          would have been a good mother. She
          wanted that so much. And now I'm
          saying sorry to a picture.

                         JOE
          She's. How is she, you said save
          my life.

                         OLD JOE
          Your life. Let's look. At your
          life. You're a killer and a
          junkie. And a fucking child
          mentality, âMy life,â âwhat's
          mine.â Save your life, you're
          asking how? The question is why.
          Why would someone waste themselves
          on you, give up the good life they
          had, sacrifice a good life to love
          you.

                         JOE
          My life is my own, I don't need it

                         SAVED

                         OLD JOE
          Shut your fucking child mouth.
          She's going to clean you up and
          you're going to take her love like
          a sponge and you're both going to
          pretend that she's saved you,
          you're so self absorbed and stupid.

                         (BEAT)
          Yesterday. Thirty years from now
          is yesterday. And I can remember
          it, it's going to happen. Let me
          tell you what's going to happen to
          this woman who saved your worthless
          life.
          A GREEN DOOR - Kicked in with all the violence in the world.

          INT. FRENCH COTTAGE - MORNING (FLASHBACK)

          His Wife spins, as Gangsters burst into the entryway.
          Old Joe in bed. It plays out again. He leaps to his feet,
          is tackled by the Gangsters. They drag Old Joe from the
          bedroom. Though the hall, Joe sees the woman struggling
          against two Gangsters, her dress torn and bloody. One
          approaches her with the knife.
          Old Joe screams, struggles, but cannot stop them from doing
          what they do to her.

          INT. DINER

          Joe is not sure where to put his eyes.

                         OLD JOE
          Have you heard of the Rainmaker?

                         JOE
          Seth said, that night. A new boss
          in the future, he said.

                         OLD JOE
          The Rainmaker came out of nowhere
          and in the span of six months took
          total control of the five major
          syndicates.

                         JOE
          That would take an army.

                         OLD JOE
          But he didn't have an army. Legend
          is he did it alone. Alone alone.
          Don't know I believe the legend but
          he didn't have an army.

                         JOE
          How did he do it?

                         OLD JOE
          That's the question. And no one
          knows. Not only that, there's no
          pictures of him. It's insane.
          There's stories he has a synthetic
          jaw. Things like that. But word
          spread quick about him through the
          ex-looper grapevine, even before
          his mass executions and vagrant
          purges and reign of terror, because
          the first thing he did was start
          closing loops. All of them.
          Exterminating the whole program.
          Cleaning house.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          47.
          Old Joe pulls the folded papers he printed at the library out
          of his jacket, puts them on the table.

          OLD JOE (CONT'D)
          Do you know what this is? This
          number. This number.
          On the back of his papers he scrawls the number: 07153902935.
          As he writes it, a phone starts ringing, bringing us into:

          INT. OFFICE - DAY - FLASHBACK

          An 8th story office, under siege. Gangsters down in the
          street fire up at the windows with guns. Helicopters pass
          by. The office door is blocked shut with a filing cabinet.
          On the phone - the looper DALE, but in his mid 50s. Battered
          and terrified. Holding a piece of paper, reading off it, on
          the phone with Old Joe.
          The wall with the door in it EXPLODES inward.

          INT. FRENCH LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS - FLASHBACK

          The line goes dead. Old Joe hangs up. Looks at his hand,
          with the number. Standing in his cottage, before he was sent
          back. Through the window, his wife working in the garden.
          Old Joe closes his hand.

          OLD JOE (V.O.)
          This is a piece of identifying
          information on the Rainmaker. I
          can use it to find him, now, and
          stop him from killing my wife.

          INT. DINER

          Old Joe showing the number to Joe.

                         JOE
          None of this concerns me. We're
          done we're gonna walk outside now.

                         OLD JOE
          This is going to happen

                         JOE
          It happened to you, it doesn't have
          to happen to me.
          (points: the pocket watch)
          You got her picture in there? Show
          it to me. Show me her picture.
          And when I see her for the first
          time I'll walk away, and she won't
          be with me.

                         (MORE)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          48.

                         JOE (CONT'D)
          I guarantee the instant I look at
          her picture that fog in your brain
          will swallow up the memories of her
          and she'll be gone.

                         OLD JOE
          Gone.

                         JOE
          She'll be safe. And then we can
          all do what we have to do.
          A beat. Old Joe holding the pocket watch, gazing at it.
          Then he snaps it closed in his fist, drawing it back.

                         OLD JOE
          No you don't understand. We don't
          have to give her up. I'm going to
          tell you why I'm here now.
          He puts his hand on the folded papers.

          OLD JOE (CONT'D)
          I'm gonna save her.
          A quick beat. Joe goes for his gun. But Old Joe is fast, he
          jams his foot into Joe's crotch, crushing the hidden gun into
          him. Joe cries out, Old Joe grabs his hair and plants his
          face into the table.
          When Joe's hands go to his face Old Joe grabs them and pulls.
          Foot in his crotch, pulling his arms tight over the table.

          OLD JOE (CONT'D)
          The Rainmaker is alive right now.
          Living here, somewhere in this
          county. And I can find him with
          this. I need you to lay low, stay
          out of my way and not get caught.
          I know how to fix this, I won't
          stop till I finish it. I'm going
          to find him and kill him.
          Joe's face loosens, his eyes on their coffee cups.

                         JOE
          It's been awhile since we've gotten
          a warm-up.
          Old Joe realizes, looks around. The diner is eerily quiet.
          Beatrix and the staff have all quietly left. Fled.
          Old Joe swings out of the booth, still holding Joe by the
          hair, dragging him like a doll. Joe's blunderbuss clatters
          to the ground. Old Joe drags him to the window. They look
          out. Nothing in the parking lot. Too quiet.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          49.

                         OLD JOE
          It's been thirty years for me, so
          it's hard to remember. When you
          stole Seth's bike you stripped out
          the security tracker. Right?
          Joe's fearful face says âno.' Old Joe draws his gat.

          OLD JOE (CONT'D)
          Make it to the field, you can lose
          them in the field. Go east and hop

                         A TRAIN
          Joe punches Old Joe square in the jaw, and he goes down. His
          papers and gun fall. The diner door EXPLODES.

                         JOE
          I've got him! He's here!
          A GAT MAN barrels in, his gat blazing. Joe scrambles but Old
          Joe gets the gat.
          With an expert shot Old Joe puts the Gat Man down, but there
          are two more behind him. Pinned behind a booth, Old Joe
          returns fire, glass breaking and chaos.
          Joe grabs at the papers, Old Joe grabs them first and yanks.
          Leaving Joe with a torn-off top sheet.
          Joe scrambles away, down the length of the diner behind the
          booths, back to their table, as the Gat Men and Old Joe have
          their fire fight. Joe's blunderbuss on the ground beneath
          the table. He scoops it up. Turns, and fires at Old Joe.

                         OLD JOE
          Shit.
          Joe's blunderbuss hacks another shot, and the window behind
          Old Joe explodes. Old Joe makes his break, sprints for the
          broken window, jumps...

          EXT. BACK OF DINER - MORNING

          ...and hits the dusty parking lot running. Towards the corn.

          EXT. FRONT OF DINER

          Kid Blue squats on his haunches with four more Gat Men, their
          guns trained on the diner door. Three Gat Men burst out,
          followed by Joe.

          DINER GAT MAN
          The back, he's running!

                         JOE
          Around back!

                         

                         

                         

                         

          50.
          They all run around back, where Old Joe is halfway to the
          corn but not there yet.
          The seven Gat Men and Kid Blue and Joe fire their guns after
          him while running but they're too far away (and they're
          running) so nothing hits. Joe blasts at the old man blindly,
          sprinting with all his might, eyes streaming tears in the
          dust.
          When Old Joe hits the wall of corn he seems to vanish. Four
          of the Gat Men follow him in, while the remaining pursuers
          slow to a stop, doubled over, panting. Defeated.
          It takes a few seconds for Kid Blue to realize that Joe is
          there with them. It takes another second for Joe to realize
          that the dynamic has changed. He turns and runs back towards
          the diner, Kid Blue and the Gat men in pursuit. One of the
          Gat Men fires.

                         KID BLUE
          Alive! No, alive!
          Joe makes it to the Slat Bike, jumps on, hits the ignition.

          CLICK.

                         JOE
          No fuck no fucking piece of shit
          CLICK CLICK. The Kid and the Gats closing in, and just the
          moment that Kid Blue lays his hands on the back of the bike
          the engine turns over with a ROAR.
          The back of the bike kicks up, heat and air blasts from the
          open slats beneath, blowing Kid Blue back on his ass. The
          bike HOVERS a few feet off the ground.
          Joe roars off into the corn. The Kid is on his feet running
          back to the Gat Men.

                         KID BLUE
          The tracker! Get the tracker!

          EXT. CORN FIELD

          Joe riding at full speed through the thick corn stalks. He
          BAILS, snapping through corn stalks and rolling to a painful
          stop. The bike ZOOMS onward through the stalks, quickly out
          of sight.
          Pained, Joe lies still, breathing hard. Pulls Old Joe's torn
          paper from his pocket. On one side, the number Old Joe
          scribbled: 1027363259 He flips it over. It's a map.
          Mostly of empty farm land, bisected by a bold highway and
          scattered farm houses.
          One of them is CIRCLED IN BLACK.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         SARA

                         

                         

                         

                         

          51.

          EXT. FIELD - DAWN

          A bare field of churned chocolatey earth. Near its edge juts
          the dead stump of an old tree.
          A YOUNG WOMAN in work clothes named SARA chops away at the
          trunk with a large axe. Over and over, splintering it apart.
          Endless plains of corn surround the field. In the near
          distance, a two story farm house with an adjacent barn.
          Sara focused on her work as the sun rises.

          EXT. CORN FIELD - EARLY MORNING

          Sara fiddles with a garbage can sized DEVICE, and with a
          crackle of mechanic thrusters it floats up and over the corn
          fields, spraying something chemical.

          INT. FARM HOUSE KITCHEN - EARLY MORNING

          Sara makes coffee.

          EXT. FARM HOUSE PORCH - EARLY MORNING

          She sits on a rocking chair, and mimes smoking an invisible
          cigarette.
          Our first good look at her face. Clear and beautiful, but it
          has been here for awhile.
          The morning light changes from steel blue to pale white.
          Rocking gently, fake smoking and drinking coffee. Not going
          anywhere.

          INT. FARM HOUSE BEDROOM - MORNING

          Blinds drawn, dark. A FIGURE lies in bed. Sara steps in,
          puts her hand on the sleeping figure's foot.

                         SARA
          C'mon baby. Time to get up.

          INT. FARM HOUSE KITCHEN - MORNING

          Cooking eggs. The front door bangs. She looks up.

          INT. FARM HOUSE FOYER

          The screen door bangs in the wind. Sara inspects it. The
          latch is broken. She sighs.
          Then freezes.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          52.
          Through the screen door, some fifty yards across the front
          lawn, the dark figure of a MAN stands at the edge of the corn
          fields. Watching her.
          She watches right back for a long moment.
          Then grabs a shotgun mounted above the door and with no
          hesitation at all plows outside.
          The dark figure vanishes into the corn fields.

          EXT. FARMHOUSE FRONT LAWN

          Sara storms down the porch and stalks across the lawn,
          shotgun extended. Not fucking around.
          Does not slow her pace until she is ten yards from the corn
          fields, where she plants herself and shouts:

                         SARA
          Listen up fucker. I have shot and
          buried three vagrants in the past
          year. If you want to know the
          Christ's honest truth I'm starting
          to get a taste for it. So I don't
          care what hobo sob story you've
          got, I get a dozen a week and it
          cuts no cash with me. It's me and
          my husband here, we're broke and
          angry at our lot in this world and
          heavily armed. So take some corn
          and move on, but if you show your
          face again I will cut you the fuck
          in half.
          Silence. Just the wind in the corn. A long beat. Then Sara
          turns, walks briskly back.
          Moments later Joe's face pokes through the corn stalks. He
          takes in the farm. The barn behind it. The fallow field.

                         LATER
          Joe sits in the same spot, a few feet in the corn but with a
          clear sight line at the house.
          His gun on his knee.
          JOE'S FACE - Pale, sweating. Something's wrong. He winces.
          Pinches his eyes. Headache.
          The sun pounds down. He looks at the piece of map.

                         JOE
          C'mon. C'mere. C'mon. C'mon.
          C'mon.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          53.

          EXT. CITY - ESTABLISHING - DAY

          Helicopters sweep by.

          INT. ABE'S OFFICE

          Abe stands fuming, flanked by two Gat Men. Kid Blue sits
          like a kid in detention.

                         ABE
          Well. You found him. And you
          russeled up a posse and went to git
          âem. Like a good little cowboy
          from one of your movie movies.
          Without telling me.

                         KID BLUE
          I can do it again.

                         ABE
          You can fuck up again? Really.
          You know what happens to me if I
          don't get that old bastard? I got
          too much riding, Kid, I can't
          afford a fuck-up playing cowboy.
          Put your gat on the table.
          Fighting tears now, Kid puts his gun on the desk. But he
          doesn't take his hand off it.

                         KID BLUE
          I wanted you to say I did good,
          that's all I wanted. This is all I
          have.
          Abe puts his hand on the gat. Kids' finger still on the
          trigger. A tense moment. Abe pulls the gun away, across the
          table.

          KID BLUE (CONT'D)
          Please just give me one more
          chance, I'll bring him here alive
          and hold him and you can put a
          bullet in his brain yourself-
          Abe grabs the hammer. SLAMS it on Kid's bad hand, crushing
          it. Kid howls, the Gat Men grab him.

          INT. STEEP STAIRS

          Kid is literally dragged up the stairs by a Gat Man.

          INT. BACKSTAGE

          The Gat Man shoves Kid Blue through the twisty maze of
          backstage, past girls and Loopers and men.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          54.
          The Kid blubbers and bleeds. Humiliated. But he pulls
          himself halfway together. Make a show:

                         KID BLUE
          I'm gonna make this good again. I
          will. I'm gonna be back.

          EXT. ALLEYWAY - DAY

          Raining. The Gat Man pushes the Kid out the back entrance
          door, into the alley. The Kid instinctively turns towards
          the street.
          But the Gat Man steers him back, deeper into the alley. The
          Kid realizes what this means. Everything changes.

                         KID BLUE
          Oh no. Oh no no no no
          He fights in vain to break from the Gat Man's grip. Weeps,
          begs, clasps at whatever he can grab.
          The Gat Man turns a corner -- towards the alley's dead end.

          KID BLUE (CONT'D)
          No! No! No no no no!
          Shrieking. Annoyed, the Gat Man throws the Kid hard to the
          concrete. The Gat Man pulls his gun, raises it without
          ceremony.
          BANG. The Gat Man's face explodes. Staggers, his gun FIRES
          into the wall. He drops like a doll.
          Kid Blue lies in the rain, hyperventilating. His pant leg
          hiked up, showing his boot with its holster.
          In his mangled left hand, the small caliber PISTOL he keeps
          stashed. His pinkie on the trigger.

          KID BLUE (CONT'D)
          Oh.
          Cradling his crushed hand, dazed, he scampers off like a
          soaked rat.

          EXT. FARM HOUSE - NIGHT

          Silent and still. Sara comes out onto the front porch. She
          gathers up a few things, turns out the porch light.
          Notices a floodlight still lit on the BARN across the yard.
          She turns the porch light back on.
          The dark corn fields, silent and vaguely threatening. She
          steps back in the house, emerging again with the shotgun.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          55.

          EXT. FRONT LAWN - NIGHT

          Sara stalks towards the barn, shotgun in hand. Shadows loom
          across the yard. All is silent.

          EXT. BARN - CONTINUOUS

          She reaches the barn. A hard pool of light from a mounted
          floodlight falls off to inky darkness.
          Hits a metal switch near the barn door and the light snaps
          off. In its absence the darkness swarms.
          She briskly walks back towards the house, but slows. Stops.
          Turns. In the darkness by the barn, crunch crunch. Crunch.
          And maybe a shape. Deep in the swarming dark.

                         SARA
          Hey. Who's there.
          Sara levels the shotgun at the darkness, and steps back.
          Quiet but definite - crunch crunch. And now, definitely a
          shape. A man. coming towards her.

                         SARA (CONT'D)
          Stop right there. Stop!

          EXT. CORN FIELD - CONTINUOUS

          Joe slumped over unconscious where we left him, in the corn.
          Sara's shout wakes him with a start. Sweating, pasty.
          Disoriented. Something is wrong with him.
          In a flash of panic he parts the corn stalks, sees Sarah
          backing away from the barn. The dark hulking figure of a man
          pursues her slowly but steadily.

                         JOE

                         SHIT
          His hand goes to his holster but his gun has fallen out, he
          scrambles in the dirt for it.

          EXT. FRONT LAWN

          Sara backing up still, shotgun leveled. The man, still in
          darkness, comes towards her.

                         SARA
          You stop right there, you stop!
          She fires her gun in the air. The man pauses, but then
          continues towards her. She trips on a root, FALLS.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          56.

          INT. 2ND STORY BEDROOM - NIGHT

          From a CHILD'S POV - We run across a darkened bedroom to the
          WINDOW. A child's hand smacks the glass, and framed through
          the pane, through the unseen child's eyes, this is what we

                         SEE:
          Sara on the ground, fumbling the gun. In trouble. The DARK
          MAN, advancing towards her menacingly.
          At the last moment, from the corn fields, JOE runs into the
          light and steps directly between them, shouts, his gun raised
          at the Dark Man.
          And the Dark Man STOPS.

          EXT. FRONT LAWN - CONTINUOUS

          Joe's gun leveled, face set. But the porch light on the
          man's face: it is not Old Joe.
          It is a man in his 30s, filthy, with down's syndrome. A
          greasy sign around his neck: âPLEASE HELP MUWTE FOOD $ GOD

                         BLESS YOUÂ
          Joe lowers his gun, face melting.

                         SARA
          Jee sus.
          (to the MUTE VAGRANT)
          Hey, hey. I'm going to get you

                         SOME FOOD-
          But the man scampers off, leaving his sign.

                         SARA (CONT'D)
          ...great.

          EXT. SECOND STORY BEDROOM WINDOW

          The child, in darkness, watching. He recedes into the
          bedroom, his hand slipping off the glass.

          EXT. FRONT LAWN

          Sara stands, picks up the sign, calls after the MUTE.

                         SARA
          Hey you forgot your greasy goddamn
          hobo sign oh for godssakes.
          (turns to Joe)
          Alright, what are you?
          Joe turns away from her quickly, but doubles over, crumpling
          to a heap on the grass. Sara checks his face.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          57.

                         SARA (CONT'D)
          Hey. Look at - hey. The fuck-
          ehh.
          Joe PUKES. She steps away. Takes a moment. Breathes.

          EXT. FRONT PORCH - MOMENTS LATER

          She drags Joe up onto the porch, under the light.

                         SARA
          Hey. Up here, at the light. Hey.
          Sara SLAPS HIM. Hard. His eyes snap open. He sees her face.
          She feels his head. Checks his eyes. Cherry red and veined,
          swollen under the lids.

                         JOE

                         (TOTALLY GONE)
          My head... splitting apart... time
          eventualities, he said-

                         SARA
          How long since you dropped?

                         JOE

                         DROPPED
          Sara mimes an eye dropper.

                         SARA
          Dropped, or what the kids call it.

                         JOE
          A day.

                         SARA
          One day. Wow.
          She leans back on her haunches, looks at him, deep in
          thought. Deciding what to do. Joe lies prone, shaking,
          sweating.

                         JOE
          Thirsty. I can't feel my legs

                         SARA
          You're withdrawing from a synthetic
          barbiturate. It's a quick punch
          but it's this bad a day in, without
          care you might not make it through
          the night.
          Sara looks at his shoes. Beneath the caked mud, fine
          leather. Her eyes linger on his gun. They turn cold.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          58.
          She stands quickly without a word, vanishing into the house.
          Joe lies still, breath shallow. Turns his head, hazy.

                         JOE
          Thirsty. Thirsty.
          Soft footsteps approach. Small bare feet padding towards him
          through the front door. A young boy steps out onto the
          porch, 6 years old, named CID.
          Cid looks Joe over. His eyes linger on Joe's gun. Then he
          kneels, his small hands feeling Joe's sweaty face. Pushes a
          straw to Joe's lips. Joe's hands clasp around a plastic cup
          with a cartoon tiger, and he drinks.

          SARA (O.S.)

                         (SHARP)
          Cid. C'mere monkey.
          Cid goes back into the house, leaving his cup with Joe.

          INT. FARMHOUSE FOYER - CONTINUOUS

          Sara tries to pick Cid up but he dodges, walks up the stairs.

                         CID
          Who's that man?

                         SARA
          Just a vagrant babe.

          INT. FARMHOUSE UPPER HALL

          Sara leads him down the hall and into his bedroom.

                         CID
          No he's not.

                         SARA
          Oh yeah?

                         CID
          His shoes are too shiny.

                         SARA
          Well aren't you a smart monkey.

          INT. CID'S BEDROOM

          He gets in bed.

                         CID
          Is he sick?

                         SARA
          Yup.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          59.

                         CID
          Will he get better?

                         SARA
          Yup.

                         CID
          Promise?

                         SARA
          Go to sleep. Okay. Night baby
          boy.
          Kisses him.

                         CID
          Night Sara.
          Lingers over him in the pale light. Then goes.

          EXT. HIGHWAY - NIGHT

          A darkened highway, the lights of the farm house distant. A
          small STAKE BED TRUCK rumbles up, stops on the soft shoulder.
          Sara at the wheel. Sits a second. Then climbs out.
          Roughly pulls Joe out of the flatbed. He lands in the dirt.
          Sara avoids looking at him, closes up the flatbed.
          Joe weakly grabs her ankle. She pries his hand off, and
          discovers CID'S CUP in the dirt beside him. Takes it
          angrily, strides back to the truck.

          INT. STAKE BED TRUCK - CONTINUOUS

          Sara gets in, drops Cid's cup on the seat beside her. Looks
          in her rear view mirror. Leaving a man to die. Looks down
          at Cid's cup. For a long moment.

                         SARA
          Ssssshhit.

          INT. BARN - NIGHT

          Sara lights a gas lamp. Threads a hose from a tank of water
          around the cot. Joe on a metal cot, covered with blankets.

                         SARA
          Water. Drink it, all night, more
          than you think you want.
          Moves a metal bucket next to the bed. Adjusts the blankets.

                         SARA (CONT'D)
          Aim for the bucket. And don't chew
          your tongue off. In the morning
          we're gonna talk.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          60.
          The last thing she does is handcuff his wrist to the cot and
          take his gun. On her way out she puts it on a bench beside
          the door, and turns out the floodlight.

          EXT. CITY STREETS - MORNING

          Dawn breaks. Exhausted Gat Men dutifully patrol the streets
          with flashlights, stopping every passerby.
          On the outskirts of the city. Vagrant fires burn distant
          orange. A large drainage pipe drips into a brackish creek.

          INT. DRAINAGE TUNNEL

          Underground. We move through it.

          INT. RUNOFF ROOM

          Cavernous space beneath a high street grating, damp and cold.
          Old Joe sits on the ground, methodically cleaning and loading
          his gun. He finishes. Places the gun on top of his folded,
          torn maps. Closes his eyes. Sees:

          EXT. FRONT PORCH - NIGHT (OLD JOE MEMORY)

          A bank of fog clears, revealing Sara's face looking down at
          us. She slaps us hard.

                         SARA
          Hey.

          INT. RUNOFF ROOM

          Old Joe touches his temple. Head aching. Remembering.

                         OLD JOE
          The first time I saw her face.

          EXT. FRONT PORCH - NIGHT (OLD JOE MEMORY)

          Sara's face. SLAP!

                         SARA
          Hey.

          INT. RUNOFF ROOM


                         OLD JOE
          No. No no.
          His POCKET WATCH sits open in front of him. He picks it up.

          EXT. FRONT PORCH - NIGHT (OLD JOE MEMORY)

          Sara's face. SLAP!

                         

                         

                         

                         

          61.

          INT. RUNOFF ROOM

          Old Joe holds his pocket watch tight like a talisman.
          Fingers dug deep in his head.

                         OLD JOE
          No. The first time I saw her face.

          INT. PARIS CLUB - NIGHT

          A fist comes straight at us. SMACK!
          We reel back, revealing: the Paris club, crowded and rowdy.
          A piece of Old Joe's life that we've seen before.
          Joe (mid 40s) lies on the ground, lip bloodied, laughing
          hysterically at a YOUNG PUNK who has just hit him. A bar
          fight blossoms in slow motion all around.
          Joe looks up, sees the woman who will be his Wife for the
          first time. In her green dress. Whisps of fog drift into
          frame.

          INT. RUNOFF ROOM

          Inside Old Joe's pocket watch, a picture. Of his WIFE.
          The sun breaks in through the grate above. Old Joe closes
          the pocket watch, holds in tight. Then he stands and picks
          up the gun and goes.

                         CUT TO:
          A child stands in a massive doorway with blinding white light
          beaming through.
          JOE'S FACE - wrecked, but his eyes flutter. Blink.

          INT. BARN - MORNING

          Joe lies on the cot. Blinks. The barn doors, the morning
          sun rising through. If the child was there, he's gone now.

          INT. FARMHOUSE KITCHEN - MORNING

          Cid draws at the kitchen table. Sara enters.

                         SARA
          Morning monkey.

                         CID
          The man's up.
          Sara stiffens, looks out the window.

                         CID (CONT'D)
          Is he staying here now?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          62.

                         SARA
          No.

          A WALL OF LEAVES
          Fingers part the green, and Old Joe peers through the dense
          foliage.

          EXT. SUBURBAN STREET - MORNING

          Old Joe hides in the trees across the street from a suburban
          track home.
          A young boy in a bright jacket runs out the front door and
          off down the street.
          Old Joe checks the folded map in his trembling hands. On it,
          this house is circled in black, exactly like Sara's farm.
          Stuffing the map in his pocket, he pushes out through the
          trees.

          EXT. BARN - MORNING

          Sara approaches the barn, her shotgun in hand.
          Joe sits on the ground just outside the open barn door, the
          metal cot behind him still handcuffed to his wrist.
          Methodically cleaning and loading his gun.

                         SARA
          Toss it.
          Joe freezes. Then, half annoyed

                         JOE
          I just finished cleaning - alright.
          Tosses it into the dirt. Sara lowers the shotgun slightly.

                         SARA
          How do you feel?

                         JOE
          I'm at thirty percent.

                         SARA
          Take it slow and by the end of the
          week you'll be at fifty. Good.
          She tosses him a key, he unlocks his handcuff.

                         SARA (CONT'D)
          I took you in so you wouldn't die,
          and now you're not going to die.

                         (MORE)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          63.

                         SARA (CONT'D)
          So take the morning to rest, then
          you need to get off my farm.

                         JOE
          I can't do that.

                         SARA
          I'm sorry?

                         JOE
          I need to stay here for a little
          while longer.

                         SARA
          I am not cool with that.

                         JOE
          Well I'm sorry.

                         SARA
          Well I'm sorry too, you just lost
          your take the morning to rest
          privileges, get off my farm.

                         JOE
          No.
          Sara raises the shotgun.

                         SARA
          Get off my farm.

                         JOE
          No. You couldn't scare a retarded
          hobo with that thing. Literally.

                         SARA
          This is a Remington 870, one blast
          could cut you the fuck in half.

                         JOE
          And that's, that's telling. You're
          holding a gun. I say I'm not
          afraid, so you describe the gun to
          me. But it's not the gun I'm not
          afraid of.

                         (BEAT)
          What are you gonna shoot in the
          air? Blow a hole in your barn? To
          scare me? Go ahead. But you
          couldn't let me die, you won't kill
          me.

                         SARA
          So now I saved your life that makes
          me weak?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          64.

                         JOE
          Look I'm not a threat to you or
          your boy. I need to be on your
          property but I'd prefer to not have
          any contact with you at all, I'll
          stay in the fields. There's just
          one thing you need to do for me,
          and you won't have to deal with me
          again.
          He takes the map from his pocket, unfolds it. Tosses it over
          to her.

                         JOE (CONT'D)
          Just, verify for me that's your
          house on the map. So I know I'm in
          the right place.

                         SARA
          What is this?

                         JOE
          A map.

                         SARA
          That's my house. Why is it marked?

                         JOE
          Doesn't matter. Ok. I'll be out
          of the barn in an hour, if you can
          spare it I'll take the water jug
          with me. Does that well have
          water? I'll fill it from there.
          Sara turns the map over. Sees the NUMBER that Old Joe wrote
          on the back. 07153902935.
          And everything changes.

                         SARA
          What is this.
          She shows him the number. She is not asking what the number
          is - she knows. Joe is suddenly not so relaxed.

                         SARA (CONT'D)
          What is this.

                         JOE
          Does that mean something to you?
          For the first time in their conversation, Joe looks in her
          eyes. Sara stares daggers, searching. Very different than
          she was ten seconds ago.
          Joe scoots back

                         

                         

                         

                         

          65.

                         JOE (CONT'D)

                         HEY-
          And without hesitating Sara hefts the shotgun and SHOOTS HIM.
          BLAST! Rips his shirt open bloody, blows him back screaming.

          EXT. PARK

          Old Joe STOPS in his tracks, children running around him.
          His hand goes to his temple.

          EXT. BARN - DAY (OLD JOE MEMORY)

          Fog clears from Sara blasting us with her shotgun.

          EXT. PARK

          Old Joe's hand runs from his temple to his neck. Feels a new
          but old scar, just a little divot behind his ear.

          INT. BARN

          Sara drags Joe in by the foot. She heaves the barn door
          closed. In the lamp lit dark Joe rolls and groans in the
          dirt.

                         SARA
          Who are you?
          She shoves the shotgun barrel in his face, a rush of fury

                         SARA (CONT'D)
          You're right I'm not a killer but I
          am fine with how a blast of rock
          salt to your face won't kill you.
          Who are you and what are you here
          for? Who are you?
          Joe breathes hard, bleeding in the dirt with a shotgun in his
          nose. But he forces calm. A beat. Then he starts talking.

                         JOE
          Time travel hasn't been invented
          yet. But in thirty years it will
          be.

          EXT. PARK - DAY

          A suburban park. On its far end, a birthday party.
          The YOUNG BOY in the bright jacket we saw run out of the
          house earlier sits alone under a tree.
          Old Joe approaches him.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          66.

                         OLD JOE
          Hi. Daniel, right? I'm Chad's
          father. Aren't you going to come
          over? We're doing cake.

                         DANIEL
          It's ice cream cake and I can't eat
          ice cream. Cause of the milk.

                         OLD JOE
          Well you should join the party even
          if you don't have cake. You have a
          birthday coming up?

                         DANIEL
          In July. We were gonna go to the
          lake but I don't think we are now.

                         OLD JOE
          I'm sorry.
          Old Joe leaves, walks across the grass. Having trouble
          breathing.

          INT. BARN

          Sara sits. Joe weakly talks, the end of a long explanation.

                         JOE
          I can't go back to the city and
          find him cause Abe, the boss, all
          his men are going to search the
          streets 24/7 till they turn up me
          or... him. All I have is this map.
          And that he's coming here.
          Sara stands. Paces away. Deep in thought.

                         SARA
          A Looper.

                         JOE
          Yeah. Did you know about Loopers,
          what we do

                         SARA
          I've heard stories. So he's coming
          here to murder me and my son
          because he thinks we might be this
          Rainmaker. And once he kills the
          Rainmaker, what happens?

                         JOE
          I think... he thinks, the instant
          the rainmaker dies, he'll never
          have been sent back, so he'll just
          vanish, and be back with his wife.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          67.

          EXT. SUBURBAN STREET

          The same track home Old Joe studied from the trees earlier.
          Daniel trots towards it, coming home from the birthday party.

          INT. BARN


                         SARA
          Who is he? The guy you let run?
          Just some random guy from the
          future?

                         JOE
          Yeah. Someone. You know what
          these numbers mean.

          EXT. SUBURBAN HOME BACK YARD - DAY

          Well tended by someone who loves growing things. Laurels,
          ivy on trellises, flowers and trees.
          Daniel comes through the side gate. Lifts the back door
          matt, revealing a dusty key.

          INT. BARN

          Sara takes a pen from a workbench. Shows Joe the numbers:

                         07153902935
          She draws lines with the pen, thus:

                         07/15/39[02935]

                         SARA
          This is my son Cid's birthday. And
          this is the hospital he was born
          in.
          Joe's face, taking this in.

          EXT. SUBURBAN HOME BACK YARD

          Old Joe. Sitting in a corner of the yard. Face set hard.
          Daniel stands, key in hand. Drops the matt. Slow motion.
          Turns. Sees Old Joe, standing now.
          Stillness between them. OLD JOE'S FACE. Struggling to be
          stone, and then it is.
          He draws his gun in one fluid motion and FIRES.
          We don't hear the shot. We just hear the garden, the wind
          through the plants.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          68.
          And we just see Old Joe's face. Struggling now to remain
          stone.
          Numb he puts his gun away and exits.

          EXT. PARK

          Old Joe walks across the park. Map in his hand. Children
          play in the distance. Children's voices all around.
          Old Joe spins, his breath up into his head.
          The map falls to the ground. The park around him, green and
          full of children.
          He keels over onto his knees and cries. Grabs the grass,
          holds it in his fingers, thick and green.

          INT. PARIS APARTMENT - AFTERNOON

          The Wife stands at the edge of a bed. 35 and Full of life.
          Old Joe on the bed. Mid 40s.
          She unsnaps her GREEN DRESS and it falls, leaving her naked
          in the sunlight.

                         LATER
          On the bed. Old Joe and the Wife. Faces close. Drifting
          into sleep. From a neighboring apartment, a BABY CRIES.
          Loud and insistent.
          Old Joe opens his eyes, joking-annoyed at the crying baby.
          âGod you have to be kidding me.â
          Then he sees her face. Her smiling eyes, listening to the
          neighbor's baby cry. Like she's listening to music. She
          touches his hand.

          EXT. PARK

          Old Joe. Staring at the grass. On the map beside him:
          three circled houses around the city. And the torn corner.

          INT. BARN

          Sara holds the torn piece of map in her hands. Their house
          circled.

                         SARA
          Would he do this?

                         JOE
          Think about what doing this would
          fix. What he thinks it would fix.
          Sara caught that, and she did not like it.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          69.

                         JOE (CONT'D)
          He'll kill the other kids on that
          map and then come here last. Put
          off facing me.

                         SARA
          If he comes here, can you stop him?
          She turns the paper over in her hands.

          SARA (CONT'D)
          Given this, if I erred on the side
          of caution and believed all of
          this, I'm asking. If I trusted
          you. Will you stop him before he
          gets to my son?

                         JOE
          I've lost my life. I kill this
          man, I get it back. You can trust
          me.

          EXT. FRONT PORCH - LATER

          They sit on the steps, Joe stripped to the waist. Sara picks
          salt chunks from his chest with tweezers and antiseptic.
          Joe surveys the surrounding land, cleaning his gun.

                         JOE
          We're surrounded by the corn, that
          leaves us blind. He can get within
          fifty yards of the house without a
          hawk spotting him.

                         (BEAT)
          What makes sense is, we burn the
          fields, level them.
          Sara realizes he's seriously asking.

                         SARA
          No you cannot burn down my corn
          fields.

                         JOE
          What kind of equipment's in the
          barn?

                         SARA
          Farm equipment.

                         JOE
          Nothing that shoots.

                         SARA
          No farm equipment that shoots. No.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          70.
          Joe finishes assembling his gun. Sara's eyes flick to it.

          SARA (CONT'D)
          You use what you need, set up
          anywhere. But one thing, I don't
          want you talking to Cid. I watch
          my son, you watch the corn. That's
          the deal.

                         JOE
          Good by me.
          He hisses as she applies antiseptic to a gash in his arm.

                         SARA
          Hold still. Easy for things to get
          infected on a farm, start falling
          off.

                         (SOTTO)
          Pussy.
          Caught off guard, Joe almost smiles. Then grimaces.

                         JOE
          If I'm out here and you're in the
          house we're gonna need some way to
          communicate.

                         SARA
          There's a dinner bell down by the
          barn, ring that if someone's
          coming, I'll hear it.

                         JOE
          Dinner bell. We need walkies, or
          buzzers.

                         SARA
          Dunno what we've got but I'll look.
          She spots Cid at the screen door, watching them.

                         SARA (CONT'D)
          Cid.
          She goes to take him inside.

                         JOE
          Got any ammo for that shotgun?
          That isn't a seasoning?

          INT. FARMHOUSE FOYER - CONTINUOUS

          Sara leads Cid back into the house.

                         SARA
          How's the maths coming?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          71.

                         CID
          I wanna help the man.

                         SARA
          Help him what?

                         CID
          I could help him with my toys.

                         SARA
          Baby. Listen. I need you to stay
          away from that man. Okay? Let him-

                         HEY
          Cid squirms out of her grasp, bats her away with a light but
          angry slap. She grabs his arm harder.

          SARA (CONT'D)
          Let him do his thing, but you stay
          with me.

                         CID
          Is he not good?

                         SARA
          Well we're gonna see what he is.
          But you stick with me. Yeah?

          INT. DRAINAGE TUNNEL - EVENING

          Old Joe's little hide-out. He violently washes his hands in
          a trench of water.
          Slumps back, eyes blood red. Streaks of tears down his face.
          Reddish light fading to blue through the grating high above.
          Runs fingers across his forehead, spreading cooling water.
          His eyes close. His breathing shallows.
          In one hand he holds his pocket watch. He places the other
          on the gat. The map beneath it.
          Daniel's map location CROSSED OUT. Two others remaining.
          And the missing corner, edge torn.
          CLOSE ON Old Joe's face. Slipping to sleep.
          Then from nowhere a CHILD'S HAND enters frame and rests on
          his forehead. Old Joe's eyes gasp open with terror

          EXT. PORCH - NIGHT

          but it's Joe who wakes up with a start. Slumped against the
          steps, gun in hand.
          Cid's hand on his forehead. Cid steps back quickly, puts his
          finger to his lips. Shhh.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          72.

          INT. FARMHOUSE FOYER - NIGHT

          Cid leads Joe inside, beckoning him to follow.

          INT. FARM HOUSE KITCHEN

          Dark. Cid leads Joe to the kitchen table. Laid out on it:
          an arrangement of toys.
          With the deliberateness of a man at work Cid clicks on a
          flashlight and sets it on the table.
          Works on several toys, cracking open cases, pulling out
          wires. Hands moving fast. Joe sits, watching Cid.

                         CID
          Hand me that Phillips.
          Joe hands him the screwdriver. Cid keeps working.

                         CID (CONT'D)
          Tell me if you hear her coming.

                         JOE
          What are we doing here?

                         CID
          Commundication.
          He pushes a button on a small plastic box in his hands, and
          an identical one next to Joe lights up.
          The way Joe looks at Cid changes slightly.

                         CID (CONT'D)
          But I need to make it stronger.

                         JOE
          How do you do that?

                         CID
          Bigger battery.
          Joe idly fingers a toy.

                         JOE
          Smart.

                         CID
          Do you kill people?
          Joe half laughs. Cid keeps working, his face in shadows.

                         AFTER AWHILE:

                         JOE
          Let's say I kill people.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          73.

                         CID
          With your gun?

                         JOE
          Uh huh.
          Cid looks at him in the dark. Not scared at all. Then he
          goes back to fitting the backing on a toy.
          A long beat, Joe thinking.
          Broken by a PIERCING NOISE.
          They both jump - the toy truck Joe has idly played with is
          shrieking, sirens blaring.
          Joe fumbles with it, Cid reaches over and switches it off,
          they both freeze.
          And look up at the ceiling.
          Silence in the house.
          With a look of reproach beyond his years, Cid takes the truck
          from Joe and finishes up his work.

          JOE (CONT'D)
          How long have you and your mom been
          on the farm?

                         CID
          She's not my mom. My mom got
          killed when I was a baby. Someone
          bad, bad men killed her.
          Cid sets the two finished BUZZERS on the table.

                         JOE
          I'm sorry.

                         CID
          Sara doesn't think I remember cause
          I was a baby. But I remember my
          mom. I couldn't stop her getting
          killed. I don't remember it all
          but I remember. I was a baby. I
          couldn't do anything. I couldn't
          stop it. Cause I was a baby.
          Cid is crying. Joe has never been more at a loss.

                         JOE
          I'm sorry
          Takes the buzzers. Stands, fumbling. Retreating.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          74.

          JOE (CONT'D)
          You should talk to your mom about
          this.

                         CID
          She's not my mom. She's a liar.
          With one last look back at Cid in the dark, Joe exits.

          SMASH CUT TO:

          EXT. CITY OUTSKIRTS STREET - NIGHT

          Old Joe. Running hard. Sirens, flashlights behind him.
          Being chased.
          Zig zags through an alleyway, a pursuing car smashing up
          behind him.
          Bursts out onto the street, nearly hit by another car.
          Shouts all around, a few shots. Surrounding. He runs.

          INT. ABE'S OFFICE

          A Gat Man briefing Abe, who hasn't gotten much sleep lately.

                         GAT MAN 1

          Every fucking car, every gat, every
          cop - get âem down there! Flood
          that fucker! Take him down!

          EXT. CITY STREETS - SEEN FROM HIGH IN THE AIR

          Cars, motorcycles, cop prowlers, all roar to life and blaze
          through the city streets in one direction.

          INT/EXT. HALF BUILT HIGHRISE

          Kid Blue, squatting in the 10th story of a half finished
          highrise, looks down on the activity in the streets.
          Spread on the floor are maps with notes. He's been searching
          for Old Joe.
          And now his eyes are alight. He bolts for the stairs.

          EXT. CITY OUTSKIRTS STREETS - NIGHT

          A small park on one block. With a playground. Swings, and a
          merry-go-round. Gat men sweep the park.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          75.
          After they pass, Old Joe's face pops up under the merry-go-
          round. He crouches in a shallow space beneath it.
          He sees: Across from the park, a cheap APARTMENT BUILDING.
          He checks his map - the 2nd circled address. Kid number two.
          He waits.

          EXT. FIELD - EARLY MORNING

          Sara chops the dead tree trunk in the field, greatly
          diminished but still formidable. Joe approaches.

                         JOE
          Can't you pull that out with a
          plow?

                         SARA
          Uh huh.
          She keeps chopping.

                         JOE
          I found a, in the barn I found some
          parts, and I made a, thing.
          Joe pushes one of Cid's BUZZERS into her hands, which we now
          see is a colorful plastic frog toy with a light bulb nose.

                         JOE (CONT'D)
          If you see anything, just push
          that, and,
          Joe pushes the button on his buzzer, and Sara's lights up and
          vibrates. She regards the toy, then stares hard and cold at
          Joe.

                         JOE (CONT'D)
          It's important.

                         SARA
          When?

                         JOE
          Last night. He woke me up. Don't
          tell him I told you though, he...
          Sara rolls her eyes, turns away. Starts chopping again. Joe
          doesn't leave.

                         SARA
          What?

                         JOE
          You said you were his mom.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          76.

                         SARA
          Uh huh.

                         JOE
          He told me you're not.
          This hits Sara hard. She resumes chopping to cover it.

                         SARA
          He said that?

                         JOE
          If he's not your son who is he?

                         SARA

                         (SHARP)
          He's my son.

                         (BEAT)
          I had Cid when I was twenty two.
          But I didn't want to give up my
          life. In the city.
          The word âcityâ has weight for her. Implies volumes.

          SARA (CONT'D)
          So I dropped Cid with my mom, here.
          And my sister. And they saw how I
          was living and they took him. My
          sister raised him here, she loved
          him. He called her mom.

                         JOE
          How'd she get killed?
          When Sara's eyes hit him they're daggers.

                         JOE (CONT'D)
          Cid told me. You have to talk to
          him about it.
          Icy silence from Sara, and an odd stare.

                         SARA
          I told you one thing, I told you to
          stay away from my son.

                         JOE
          He asked about my gun. You think
          this is going to go away if you
          don't talk to him about it but it's
          just gonna grow

                         SARA
          Stay out of it. Stay the fuck away
          from my son.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          77.
          She goes back to chopping. Joe lingers, then leaves. She
          hacks away.

          EXT. FRONT PORCH - EARLY MORNING

          Sara sits with coffee, looking out at the fields. Deep in
          thought.
          She takes a drag from her pretend cigarette.

          EXT. CHEAP APARTMENT BUILDING - EARLY MORNING

          A motel style building. Gat Men in cars pass occasionally
          with spotlights and radios, but the activity has calmed.
          Old Joe slips around a corner. Staying hid. Checks the
          address on the map. 12 Talbott Dr, #205.
          Makes a break for stairs leading to the 2nd level. But just
          at that moment a car pulls into the building's lot.
          Old Joe ducks under the stairs. Holding his breath.
          The car parks. Door slams. Footsteps. A WOMAN. Slumping
          exhausted, up the stairs.
          And through the slatted steps Old Joe sees her face flash by.
          It is Suzie, the girl from Abe's brothel. Old Joe's face,
          pure disbelief. He recognizes her instantly. It can't be.
          He gingerly steps half a foot out. Looking up he can see the
          apartment doors above. Suzie walks down the landing.
          Towards apartment 205.
          Jesus it can't be.
          Then she passes it. Keeps walking. Old Joe's eyes,
          relieved.
          She stops at the next door over, knocks. It opens, vaguely
          indistinct conversation between her and the girl that
          answers.

                         SUZIE
          Sorry, I know I promised five, you
          know how it gets.

                         GIRL NEIGHBOR
          Don't worry sugar. She was no
          problem. Gat men searched through
          here, lookin for god knows...
          Suzie disappears into the apartment. Re-emerges, holding a
          sleeping 6 year old girl. She whispers goodbye to the
          neighbor and walks back to APARTMENT 205. She enters.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          78.
          Old Joe, frozen. Gun in his hand. Face numbly: âYou have to
          be shitting me.â
          He climbs the stairs. On the 2nd story landing. To 205.
          Breath held, back against the wall. Peeks in the window.
          On the couch, Suzie holding her daughter. Head in her lap.
          Stroking her hair. Suzie's back is to us, and with her long
          red hair down, she is eerily reminiscent of Old Joe's wife.
          Old Joe watches them for a long time.

          EXT. FARMHOUSE FRONT PORCH - DAY

          Joe sits, watching the corn. It rustles in the wind. Hand
          on his blunderbuss. Beside it, his frog buzzer.
          The tension is constant. And it's a long, long day.

          INT. FARMHOUSE HALLWAY - LATER

          Sara vacuums while Cid plays with toy trucks.

          INT. FARMHOUSE LAUNDRY ROOM - LATER

          In the basement, bare concrete. Sara empties the dryer.

          INT. CID'S BEDROOM - LATE AFTERNOON

          Sara sits on the floor with Cid, putting numbered tiles on a
          plastic multiplication table.

                         SARA
          Where does 56 go? Good. 21.

                         CID
          How long can you not sleep?

                         SARA
          I don't know, awhile. That's a
          good question. Where's it go.
          Good, there. 32.

                          CID
           We should help Joe watch.

                          SARA
          Joe?

                          CID
          Cause he can't stay awake all the
          time.

                         SARA
          He isn't our business.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          79.

                         CID
          He's keeping us safe

                         SARA
          Baby. Let's do this now. You have
          32 there, I know you know this one.

                         CID
          I want to help him.
          Sara is distracted by a distant bell-like DINGING.

                         SARA
          Cid. 32.
          She goes to the window, looks out, nervous.
          But it's just a loose LAUNDRY LINE down in the yard, whipping
          in the wind against its metal pole. In the distance, Joe
          paces the yard.
          Relieved, Sara returns to Cid. He sets the tile, petulant.

                         SARA (CONT'D)
          No. Eight times three is what?

                         CID
          Thirty two.

                         SARA
          Eight times three is what?

                         CID
          Thirty two.

                         SARA
          I want you to count three eights.

                         CID
          Eight. Sixteen. Thirty two.

                         SARA
          Are you telling me you want alone
          time?

                         CID
          No.

                         SARA
          Okay. Why don't you put that where
          it belongs?
          Deliberately, Cid lifts the tile and sets it straight back
          down on the same spot.

                         SARA (CONT'D)
          Alone time.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          80.
          Then like a knife in a fist fight:

                         CID
          He's protecting us cause you can't
          do it.

                         SARA
          Ok. I told you to stay away from

                         HIM

                         CID
          I never did anything

                         SARA
          Do you think I'm stupid?

                         CID
          So?

                         SARA
          I told you already
          Cid is building into a temper tantrum fast.

                         CID
          So?

                         SARA
          You do what I tell you

                         CID
          You can't tell me what to do you're
          not my mom.
          (a deadly beat)
          You're not my mom! You're a liar
          and you're gonna get killed and you
          won't stop lying!
          Cid lunges at her, Sara slaps him back.
          Not hard, but Cid scoots back, eyes furious.

                         SARA

                         CID BABY

                         CID
          You're a liar! Liar! I hate you
          because you're lying! I hate you!
          Liar! You're lying to me!
          Sara scoots back.

                         SARA

                         CID

                         CID
          You're lying!

                         

                         

                         

                         

          81.
          Cid stands, balls his fists, SCREAMING at her. Sara pushes
          back away from him.
          Maybe a cloud passed over the sun. The room darkens.
          And we see it now, in her eyes: Sara is afraid. She bolts
          out of the room.

          EXT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY

          Sara walks fast down the hall

          INT. SARA'S BEDROOM

          Not slowing, through her bedroom

          INT. SARA'S CLOSET

          Into her walk-in closet, to a huge steel safe tucked in back.
          She opens the safe with trembling hands. And climbs inside.

          INT. SAFE

          Closes the heavy door. Turns on a small LED light.
          And waits. Cid's screams distant but not lessening.

          EXT. BARN - CONTINUOUS

          Cid's screams from the house, clear as day.
          Joe paces in front of the barn. Turns his head back towards
          the house, not sure what to think.
          The screams stop. Joe turns uneasily back to the swaying
          corn.

          INT. CID'S BEDROOM

          The math game scattered, numbered tiles everywhere. Cid lies
          face down on the bed, cried out.
          Sara enters quietly. Sits on the bed beside him. Strokes
          his hair. He folds into her, and they're holding each other
          tight.

          EXT. CITY STREETS - DAY

          A Gat Man named CANADY strolls out of a donut shop, coffee in
          hand, and gets in his car.

          INT. CANADY'S CAR

          Canady starts the car up, starts driving.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          82.
          Somehow not seeing Kid Blue crouched clear as day in the
          passenger side foot-well.

                         KID BLUE
          Hey Can. Can.
          Canady sees him, jumps and yelps.
          The sedan swerves, scrapes to a stop against a parked car.
          Coffee everywhere.

                         CANADY
          Jesus, fuckin Kid Blue what the

                         FUCK

                         KID BLUE
          Pull into that alley.

                         CANADY
          You get the fuck outta

                         KID BLUE
          You don't wanna be seen with me
          Canady, pull in the alley.
          Canady glares at him, but pulls the car into a narrow alley,
          parks it.

                         CANADY
          The fuck are you still doing in
          town, Abe wants you dead man

                         KID BLUE
          All Abe wants right now is the
          looper. Unless he got him last
          night?

                         CANADY
          Jssshhh. No we didn't get him.
          Spotted and lost him. West End,
          near Whore's Alley.

                         KID BLUE
          Whore's Alley?

                         CANADY
          That area, Mott & Talbott, little
          working girl colony.

                         KID BLUE
          (has a thought)
          Whore's Alley..

                         CANADY
          You shoulda left town man.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          83.

                         KID BLUE
          I'm gonna bring him in, get right
          with Abe.

                         CANADY
          Yeah, maybe you bring him the
          looper, but short of that Abe don't
          get right with priced men.

                         KID BLUE
          I got a price?

                         CANADY
          Big one.
          Canady locks the car doors.
          And in that one moment, Kid Blue pulls Canady's gun from his
          holster. Holds it on him. A tense moment.

                         CANADY (CONT'D)
          Course I'd never turn a friend for

                         A PRICE

          EXT. ALLEYWAY

          BANG and the drivers side window explodes outward bloody.
          A moment, then Kid Blue stumbles out, holding his ears in
          pain. Off down the alley and out of sight.

          INT. CID'S BEDROOM

          Sara lies with Cid, both asleep.
          Distant but sharp, a bell ringing. It's unmistakable this
          time. The DINNER BELL. Sara's eyelids flutter. She hears.
          Stiffens.
          The bell stops suddenly. She stands, careful not to wake
          Cid.

          INT. FARMHOUSE FOYER - CONTINUOUS

          Sara rushes quietly down the stairs.
          Through a doorway, she sees the Frog Buzzer sitting on the
          living room coffee table. Lit up and buzzing.
          She goes to the front door, throws it open. And is face to
          face with a tall Gat Man named JESSE. She freezes.

                         JESSE
          Evenin ma'am.

                         SARA
          Evenin. How can I help you?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          84.
          Joe is nowhere in sight.

                         JESSE
          You can start by accepting my
          apologies re the hour, I hope I
          didn't catch you in supper.

                         SARA
          No, that's fine.

                         JESSE
          Yours was the last house on my list
          today, been walking between empty
          farms all day in the hot sun.
          Thought I'd tick this off my list,
          not have to come back tomorrow.

                         SARA
          What's this about?
          Back in the house somewhere, a screen door bangs.

                         JESSE
          You alone here, ma'am?

                         SARA
          My husband should be back from the
          city, any time now.

                         JESSE
          Happy to hear. Could I trouble you
          for some water?

                         SARA
          Course. I'll get some, you can
          take the glass with you.

                         JESSE
          Actually ma'am, my business
          tonight, this ticking off the list
          business, it's gonna require me
          coming in. If that's alright.
          Jesse shifts his weight, and Sara notices his heavy boot is
          now a few inches over the door jam.

                         SARA
          Will you tell me what this is
          about?

                         JESSE
          I will, yes. Can I come in?
          Hanging above the door, just over Sara's head: the shotgun.
          Possibilities whirling through her mind.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          85.

                         JESSE (CONT'D)
          Ma'am?
          Silent decision, and she steps aside to let him enter.

          INT. FARMHOUSE KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

          Joe slips in through the screen door, gun in hand. Freezes
          in the kitchen, listening.

          JESSE (O.S.)
          I'm a deputized police officer,
          we're looking for an escaped
          criminal, just doing a sweep. Seen
          anyone through here the past two
          days, vagrants?

          SARA (O.S.)
          No, vagrants are always passing but
          nobody near the house.
          Footsteps, as they walk deeper in the house. Joe can't tell
          if they're coming through the living room or hall. He
          hesitates.

          JESSE (O.S.)
          This man, here.

          SARA (O.S.)
          He's young. No.
          Then at the last moment Joe slips out the hallway door, as
          they enter from the living room.
          Sara leads Jesse in, holding a photograph of Joe. She pours
          him some water. Jesse hands her a second photograph.

                         JESSE
          We're looking for his father too,
          similar look and build but late
          50s. May or may not be travelling
          together.
          This one is a print-out from a security camera in the Bodega,
          of Old Joe holding a gun on the checkout clerk.
          Sara's eyes linger on Old Joe's photo, side by side with
          Joe's. Mind spinning. Maybe making the connection, we're
          not sure.

                         SARA
          No.
          She tries to hand the photos back but Jesse doesn't take
          them. He notices the toys on the table.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          86.

                         JESSE
          Keep em. Kids with your husband?

                         SARA
          Yeah. Just one.

                         JESSE
          How old?

                         SARA
          Eight.
          Jesse pokes his head into the hallway, just missing Joe
          slipping through the hall and into the living room.
          He lifts his glass, drinks.

                         JESSE
          Thank you.

                         SARA
          I'll show you round the grounds,
          then the house, then you can be on
          your way.
          Sara holds the screen door open for him.

                         JESSE
          We'll start with the house.
          Jesse strolls into the living room, and we follow him.

          INT. FARMHOUSE LIVING ROOM

          He sits on a couch, taps on a small folding phone. Sara
          follows him.

                         JESSE
          Eight, you said? Boy? And your
          husband. Just gotta, check in.
          With the home office. This goddamn
          thing.

                         SARA
          This man dangerous?

                         JESSE
          Tween you me and a lamppost? No.
          Sweet kid. But he's wanted. My
          boss has half the city's looking
          for him. Half the city and me.
          So. And if you find him, there's a
          helluva price. Think on that if he
          comes by, acting sweet.
          Behind the couch, Joe crouches unseen. He looks up and sees
          Cid in the foyer, standing halfway down the stairs.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          87.
          If Jesse turned his head he would see Cid clear as day.
          Joe motions for Cid to get out. Cid points to Jesse, makes a
          GUN with his hand. Asking Joe.
          Joe shakes his head, sharply motions: get out! Cid silently
          creeps down the stairs.
          He is in full sight of the living room, but Jesse doesn't
          look up from his phone.
          Cid vanishes down the hall. Jesse looks up, stands.

                         JESSE (CONT'D)
          Alright, show me upstairs.
          The screen door in the kitchen creaks and bangs. Jesse looks
          sharply at Sara.

                         SARA
          Drafts, in the house.
          Jesse is already moving fast to the kitchen. The instant
          Jesse exits, Cid appears again in the hallway.
          Opens a small door under the stairway and beckons Joe.

          JESSE (O.S.)
          This door doesn't latch?

          SARA (O.S.)
          It used to, it's busted.
          Joe hesitates, then silently dashes over and in.

          INT. FARMHOUSE FOYER

          Cid follows him in, down steep concrete stairs. Pulls the
          door closed behind them. It CREAKS. Jesse steps out into
          the hallway, gun drawn. Sara behind him.

                         JESSE
          Drafty house.

                         SARA
          Farm house.
          Jesse walks to the thin wooden door. Opens it. Closes it.
          CREAK. He looks at Sara.

                         JESSE
          What's down there?

                         SARA
          Laundry room. Door must've blown
          open.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          88.
          Jesse opens the door, then looks at Sara gravely.

                         JESSE
          Two things. First, I have a family
          of my own back in the city, and I
          want to see them again. Second if
          anything happens to me, and I don't
          report back to my boss people in
          fifteen minutes, they're gonna know
          I disappeared searching this house,
          and inside of another fifteen
          you'll have an army of more me's
          kicking down your door. Ok?

                         SARA
          It's a laundry room.
          Jesse motions - her first.

          INT. FARMHOUSE LAUNDRY ROOM

          Bare concrete basement, starkly lit by a hanging bulb. The
          only things in the basement are a small washer and dryer, and
          a large canvas hamper the size of a fridge.
          No windows. Nowhere else to go. Jesse levels his gun at the
          hamper.

                         JESSE
          You want to call out whoever's
          hiding in that hamper?

                         SARA
          If someone was hiding in the house,
          that's what I'd do. But nobody is
          in the house. Open it up.

                         JESSE
          No I think I'm gonna put a shot
          through it just to be safe.
          He raises his gat. Sara stiffens slightly.

                         JESSE (CONT'D)
          You wanna call him out?
          Sara stays silent. A long beat.
          Then Sara strides over, pulls the hamper open. Empty.
          She throws open the washer and dryer. She takes the bucket
          and shakes it upsidown, dumping out the water, shows him it's
          empty.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          89.

                         SARA
          Now if you promise not to wag your
          gun at my shoe rack I'll show you
          upstairs then show you the fuck
          out.
          She storms up the stairs. A little cowed, Jesse holsters his
          gun and follows her.
          The water from the bucket flows in a small stream across the
          room, and into a drain hole under the hamper.

          INT. TUNNEL

          Dark and earthy. Cid leads Joe with his flashlight.

          EXT. BARN - LATE AFTERNOON

          Just outside the barn, a trap door covered with earth opens
          two inches. Joe and Cid prop it open, and peer out at the
          house.

          INT. CRAWL SPACE - CONTINUOUS

          A deep large hole capped with a wooden trap door. Joe
          squats, Cid stands.

                         CID
          My granddad built it, but he didn't
          tell anyone of us why. Nanna said
          cuz he was nuts.

                         JOE
          Thank you granddad.

                         CID
          That wasn't the man.

                         JOE
          No. I know him, that's what's
          funny. His name's Jesse. I like
          him. He'll go away when he doesn't
          find me, he won't hurt her.
          They watch in silence for awhile. In the distance, Jesse
          leaves the house alone and scopes the grounds before walking
          back towards the highway.

                         JOE (CONT'D)
          My mom gave me up. I was younger
          than you. We were vagrants, and
          she was alone, for a long time I
          thought she was stupid for getting
          on the drug she was on, it was bad
          stuff, it probably ended up killing
          her.

                         (MORE)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          90.

                         JOE (CONT'D)
          But now I see, she was so alone.
          And it was what she had. She sold
          me. To a panhandle gang.
          QUICKLY, SILENTLY WE SEE - FOUR YEAR OLD JOE dragged into
          darkness by rough men, screaming. Then we're back to the
          scene.

                         JOE (CONT'D)
          But I got away. And I ran and I
          ended on a train, sitting in the
          dark in an empty freight, going to
          the city, and I saw myself over and
          over killing those men who bought
          me and who got my mom on what she
          was on. Finding them and tearing
          them apart. Saving my mom.

                         CID
          But you didn't.

                         JOE
          A man in the city found me, put a
          gun in my hand, and gave me some
          things. I didn't have my mom
          anymore. I had my work, my money.
          My plans. For my life. That's
          what I'd kill for. Not something I
          don't have, and can't ever get
          back.

                         (BEAT)
          There's just men figuring out what
          they'd do to keep what's theirs,
          what they got. That's the only
          kind of man there is.

                         CID
          I'm not gonna let Sara get killed.
          Joe looks at him. Wants to put his hand on his shoulder but
          doesn't.

                         JOE
          I think we're clear.
          He opens the trap door, climbs out.

          EXT. BARN

          Joe reaches down to help Cid out. Looking down at Cid in a
          hole with a trap door. Like Seth.
          He grabs Cid's hand and lifts him out.
          Sara comes out, sees Cid and her face breaks with relief.
          Cid runs to her, and in the distance they embrace.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          91.
          Sara and Joe share a look. Joe quickly turns his eyes back
          to the corn fields.

          INT. SECURITY MONITOR ROOM - EVENING

          A tiny, dark concrete room. Kid Blue watches a screen, his
          hand on a toggle wheel. A security cam view of Suzie's
          apartment building upper landing. Playback of last night.
          It scans quickly forward.
          The APARTMENT SUPER leans against the wall behind him,
          counting money.

                         KID BLUE
          All working girls, yeah?

                         SUPER
          Uh huh. This whole block. You
          wanna check those too, I can
          arrange.

                         KID BLUE
          I do.
          On the screen, Suzie comes home. Picks up her daughter from
          next door. Goes into 205. Kid Blue keeps scanning. And an
          instant later, Old Joe climbs the stairs. Kid Blue slows the
          playback.

          KID BLUE (CONT'D)
          âLo Joe.
          Old Joe goes up to the window, his back to the wall. Watches
          Suzie through the window for a long while. Kid watches him
          intently.
          Then very suddenly, without going inside, Old Joe leaves.
          Down the stairs, shoving his gun in his jacket.

                         SUPER
          I'm an arranger, stranger. Huhuha.
          But you don't see what you wanna
          see, no refunds.
          Old Joe vanishes down the street in a swarm of pixels.

          EXT. CHEAP APARTMENT BUILDING - EVENING

          Kid Blue emerges from a passage, into the parking lot. Looks
          up at Suzie's apartment door. Then down the street. A few
          drops of rain fall.

          EXT. FRENCH CAR - DAY (FLASHBACK)

          Driving on a highway along the beach. A few drops of rain on
          the windshield. Old Joe (late 40s) and his Wife in intense
          conversation, her hand on his.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          92.

          OLD JOE (IN FRENCH)
          But I will.

          WIFE (IN FRENCH)
          You want to, I know that. But you
          won't.

          OLD JOE (IN FRENCH)
          I'd do anything for you.

          WIFE (IN FRENCH)
          You'd do. You'd kill for me, you'd
          take life for me. But I don't want
          that. You kill for what you love,
          but someone loves the person you
          kill, and it starts again. I don't
          want that. I can't love a killer.
          What would you give up for me?
          That's yours?

          OLD JOE (IN FRENCH)
          Anything.
          She smiles but does not believe him. Old Joe sees this. A
          moment, in thought.

          EXT. BEACH / HIGHWAY - CONTINUOUS

          The car screeches to a stop, and Old Joe runs to the sea.
          THROWS his gun in the ocean. Above the waters, the sun
          breaks the clouds. Rain falls.
          He runs back to her. Falls on her. Kissing her. He holds
          her face like the most precious thing in the world.

                         OLD JOE
          Anything.

          INT. CHURCH - EVENING

          Rain beats against stained glass. Old Joe kneeling in a pew.
          Fists clenched as if in prayer. He stands, stumbles out.

          EXT. LA BELLE AURORE SIDE ENTRANCE - EVENING

          Oddly quiet. Old Joe walks down the sidewalk towards the
          side entrance to the theater. Face uncovered. In plain
          sight. Not caring. Stops 30 feet shy of the entrance, at a
          street garbage can.
          He draws his gun and leans over to drop it into the can. He
          lets it dangle from his fingers above the trash can.
          His pocket watch, hanging open from its chain. The picture
          of his Wife inside. Spinning. His gun slowly slipping from
          his grasp.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          93.
          With each spin of the watch, the photo of his Wife appears
          cloudier. Blurred. Indistinct.
          Gun on the tips of his fingers, about to fall. Then the
          photo is nearly gone.

          OLD JOE'S EYES.

          INT. PARIS CLUB - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)

          Old Joe staggering to his feet from a fight.
          We've seen this before, it's the IDENTICAL SCENE to the
          previous flashback.
          But when he sees his Wife for the first time, whisps of FOG
          grow, blotting out the scene. Deep in the fog are other
          backgrounds - a street, a house - and unfamiliar faces.
          Other eventualities, clouding this one as it becomes less
          likely Old Joe will meet his wife and have this memory.
          Erasing it.

          OLD JOE'S EYES.

          INT. PARIS APARTMENT - DAY (FLASHBACK)

          Old Joe in bed with his wife. Baby crying outside. Her
          face. Then, whisps of FOG thickens, obscuring them.

          OLD JOE'S EYES.

          EXT. FRENCH BEACH - DAY (FLASHBACK)

          The thrown gun splashes in the sea, and Old Joe turns back to
          the beach. But where his Wife was in the previous memory,
          now there is the FOG.
          A wall of it, massive, reaching to the sky. Old Joe dwarfed
          against it. Caught between the roiling waves and this wall of
          nothingness falling towards him.

          OLD JOE'S EYES.
          The gun on his fingertips. About to fall. A moment of
          decision.

          INT. SARA'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

          Sara lies in bed. Eyes wide open. Still and quiet in the
          dark. Her hand moves over her bare leg. Slides across the
          sheets. Finds the Frog Buzzer lying next to her.
          A moment of hesitation. Then she pushes it.
          Silence. Her eyes go to the window. A long beat. Then
          sound: a door opening in the house below.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          94.
          Quick footsteps approaching. Her eyes follow them. The door
          flies open. Joe, gun in hand, buzzer in the other. His eyes
          adjust to the dark.

                         JOE
          What?
          Closes the door, kisses him. The adrenaline in his head
          doesn't know where to go.

                         SARA
          Don't wake Cid.
          She pulls him to the bed, lifting his shirt off. The rain
          starts to fall against the windows.

                         LATER
          Lying beside each other. Joe still stunned.
          Sara smokes a real cigarette, taking a deep joyful drag. She
          sets the lighter on her palm. It floats about a foot in the
          air, spinning, then drops.

                         JOE
          That's pretty good.

                         SARA
          In the city, young guys would hit
          on me by floating fucking quarters,
          I wouldn't tell âem I was TK but
          I'd keep their quarters down. One
          guy busted a blood vessel in his
          eye trying to get it up.

                         (BEAT)
          He's you. Your loop. You lied to
          me.
          She doesn't seem angry but deeply curious. Joe sits up.

          SARA (CONT'D)
          But you protected Cid. And I know
          you're not lying that you're gonna
          kill this guy, your own self. Even
          though he's protecting your future.

                         JOE
          He's protecting his future. Not
          mine.
          A beat.

                         SARA
          When I came back, after my sister
          died. Cid was sitting on the
          porch, I remember seeing him for
          the first time, in two years.

                         (MORE)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          95.

                         SARA (CONT'D)
          Saw him on the porch. I drove up
          crying and I had been at a party in
          the city when I got the call, I was
          wearing this ridiculous party
          dress. All my ridiculous shit. I
          don't know if he remembered me, but
          he looked at me. I abandoned him.
          I abandoned my baby.

                         (BEAT)
          Maybe I can't be a mother to him,
          is that something I can't get back.
          When he looked at me then, on the
          porch, he was mine again, he was my
          son. I seen so many men in the
          city, who I look in their eyes and
          they're lost. Whether he loves me
          back or not I'm gonna love my son I
          said. And he's never gonna get
          lost.
          Joe sitting up still, Sara lying beside him, maybe crying.
          He touches her hair.

          INT. APARTMENT 205 - EARLY MORNING

          A DOOR FRAME - kicked open with all the violence in the
          world. Old Joe sweeps into the small apartment, gun drawn.
          Suzie cooking in a robe, opens her mouth to scream.

                         OLD JOE
          Don't. Don't wake up your
          daughter.
          Old Joe trains the gun on her. She goes silent.

          OLD JOE (CONT'D)
          Sit down.
          At the kitchen table. Quivering, she does. He keeps the gun
          on her.

          OLD JOE (CONT'D)
          Do you know me?

                         SUZIE
          No. I don't know you. Who are
          you?

                         OLD JOE
          I need to tell you why I'm doing
          this. I gotta say it out loud to
          someone so I know.

                         SUZIE
          Why you're doing what?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          96.

          INT. SARA'S BEDROOM - EARLY MORNING

          Joe sleeping alone in the bed. Sara's voice, distant.

          SARA (O.S.)
          Joe. Joe.
          He wakes. She is calling him from downstairs.

          INT. FARMHOUSE FOYER

          Joe comes down the stairs half dressed.
          Jesse holds Sara at gunpoint in the living room. Staring at
          Joe with a cool lack of malice.

                         JESSE
          Lo' Joe.

                         JOE
          Jesse.

          INT. APARTMENT 205


                         OLD JOE
          I threw my gun away once. To get
          her love. And I was going to do it
          again, now. Because I know she'd
          want me to. I was going to do it.
          And I saw then, I saw her
          vanishing, like how life probably
          goes when you die. That's what she
          was asking me to give up this time.

                         SUZIE
          ...who are you?

                         OLD JOE
          And if I picked up the gun. If I
          made this sacrifice. Life, my
          life. Absolution. Given back to
          me. My love. Given back, just
          like we were, and she wouldn't know
          what I did to get it back.

          INT. FARMHOUSE LIVING ROOM

          Joe steps into the living room, stands facing them.

                         JOE
          I'm unarmed Jesse, you can let her
          go. Sara, Jesse here's the best
          shot with a gat I've ever seen,
          when he lets you go you sit on the
          couch and don't do anything stupid.
          Jesse lets Sara go and trains the gat on Joe.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          97.

                         JOE (CONT'D)
          He's coming here Jess. My Looper,
          is gonna come here.

                         JESSE
          I gotta take you in man.

                         JOE
          I got eighty large in pure gold, I
          take my looper back in and get
          right with Abe, whatever he gives
          me back I'll split it with you.

                         JESSE
          Was that your plan?

                         JOE
          Ok. It's yours, all of it

                         JESSE
          Are you delusional?

          INT. APARTMENT 205


                         OLD JOE
          Everything set right. Everything
          fixed. Through this sacrifice.

                         SUZIE
          What are you gonna do?
          Old Joe stands, walks towards the back hall. Suzie screams

                         SUZIE (CONT'D)
          No!
          And runs at him but he shoves her back hard.

          INT. FARMHOUSE LIVING ROOM


                         JESSE
          I know you got no options you take
          the one you got but Joe, you aint
          gettin right with no one. Looper
          or no, you're beyond saving. As
          long as Abe's got one Gat Man
          standing, he'll be hunting you till
          his dying day.
          Joe's face falling.

          INT. APARTMENT 205

          Old Joe, gun ready, down the darkened hallway towards the
          door at the end with a rainbow on it. He puts his hand on
          the knob.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          98.

          INT. FARMHOUSE LIVING ROOM


                         JESSE
          We're going now. We're gonna go to
          my truck, you're gonna
          CREAK. Cid on the stairs, sleepy eyed. Jesse, purely on
          instinct, spins and draws on Cid.
          Cid's POV - Jesse's gun, snapping like a snake, barrel
          leveled at him. Cid makes a strange shouting noise, falls
          back.
          Everything slows down.

          INT. APARTMENT 205

          Old Joe pushes the door open. Blackness within.

          INT. FARMHOUSE FOYER / LIVING ROOM

          The room darkens. As if the sun passed behind a cloud.
          Jesse realizes it's a kid. Lowers his gun. But Cid is mid-
          scream, falling back, his foot misses the step and he tumbles
          down the stairs.
          Confused, terrified, falling. Joe runs into the foyer, to
          catch Cid. Sara runs behind him.
          The room is very dark now. Knick-knacks around the room
          rattle, then LIFT INTO THE AIR. All of them. Floating.
          Spinning. Sara's LIGHTER, on the coffee table: it RISES
          into the air.

          INT. APARTMENT 205

          Old Joe readies his gun, staring into the blackness. But his
          eyes lower. He touches his temple. Remembering.

          INT. FARMHOUSE FOYER / LIVING ROOM (OLD JOE'S MEMORIES)

          Fog clears - Joe is almost to Cid, who is still tumbling,
          nearly at the bottom of the stairs.

          INT. FARMHOUSE FOYER / LIVING ROOM (NORMAL)

          But just before he reaches him, Sara shoves Joe from behind.
          Shoving him TOWARDS THE FRONT DOOR. He's confused but her
          face is set.
          Cid hits the hardwood floor of the foyer, face contorted with
          rage now, hand raised to Jesse, palm outstretched.
          Screaming. His scream louder than it should be.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          99.
          Bigger things in the living room RISE OFF THE GROUND.
          Chairs. The couch. And Jesse. He rises five feet in the
          air, terrified.
          Sara pulls Joe through the front door, and he looks back and
          sees Jesse suspended in the air and Cid on the ground
          screaming like an animal, and just as they cross the
          threshold, Jesse explodes in a bright red fan of blood.

          INT. APARTMENT 205

          Old Joe's face. Remembering.

          INT. FARMHOUSE FOYER (OLD JOE MEMORY)

          Frozen in a tableau - Cid screaming, raw power. Jesse
          EXPLODING. A bright red fan.

          EXT. FRONT PORCH

          Joe and Sara fall out and down the stairs.
          The front door and windows EXPLODE in a burst of splinters
          and glass.

          INT. APARTMENT 205

          Old Joe's eyes lift. Realizing.

                         OLD JOE
          The Rainmaker.
          A bare bulb hanging from the ceiling turns on.
          A six year old girl's room. But the only person in it is Kid
          Blue. He shoots Old Joe with a blue tazer.
          Old Joe hits the ground, mouth foaming, paralyzed. Knowing
          the answer now, knowing the who and the how but helpless and
          defeated.
          Kid Blue kicks him in the face.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         CID

                         

                         

                         

                         

          100.

          INT. ABE'S OFFICE

          A Gat Man circles a spot on the map in red ink, Sara's farm.

                         GAT MAN 1
          He's there. Lost his signal five
          minutes ago, right after he sent
          word he had him. Joe.
          Abe slumps in a chair, taking oxygen from a tank.

                         ABE
          Call everyone, every Gat Man in the
          city, call âem here. Gather em all
          up here first. No mistakes this
          time. We're gonna take an army to
          that farm, all at once, and sweep
          it like hellfire. Now.

          EXT. CITY STREETS - MORNING

          From a high vantage point. Cars, bikes, Gat Men on foot, all
          heading towards the club. An army, all meeting at the Belle
          Aurore. Massing to attack.

          EXT. FARMHOUSE FRONT LAWN - MORNING

          Moments after the blast. Joe and Sara lie in the dirt.
          Jesse's TRUCK parked nearby.
          Joe stirs first. Stands shakily. The front door jam is
          splintered. Windows broken. He goes inside. Sara gets up,
          staggers in after him.

                         SARA
          Cid! Cid!

          JOE (O.S.)
          Cid!

          EXT. BACK OF FARMHOUSE

          Joe bursts out of the screen door, holding his Blunderbuss
          and wiping off Jesse's gat.
          Bloody Cid-sized footprints lead out the screen door and
          streak across the lawn, into the corn.
          Sara comes out after Joe, sees him heading for the corn.

                         SARA
          What are you doing with those guns?
          What are you going to do?
          She lunges for him, wild. Wrenches his arm and he spins,
          throwing her to the ground.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          101.

                         JOE
          How did your sister die?
          Sara holds his gaze. Then everything breaks inside her and
          she collapses in sobs. Heaving.

                         JOE (CONT'D)
          That happened to her. Cid.

                         (BEAT)
          Jesus. Jesus he killed her
          This breaks Sara out of her sobs

                         SARA
          No! No he was climbing a
          bookshelf, it fell back on him. He
          has no control, he gets scared, it
          explodes.

                         JOE
          What is it a TK mutation?

                         SARA
          Joe someday he'll learn to control
          it.

                         JOE
          Yeah I know he will. Imagine what
          he could do.

                         SARA
          If he did good with it! If he grew
          up good!

                         JOE
          He doesn't.
          Joe heads to the corn, Sara scampers after him but slips on
          the wet grass, and Joe hits the corn with a head start.

                         SARA
          You stay away from him! Cid! Cid!
          She runs into the corn.

          EXT. CORN FIELD - WITH SARA

          WITH SARA as she stumbles blindly through the tall stalks.

                         SARA
          Cid! Make a noise baby, call to
          me! Cid!
          WITH JOE through the corn, following traces of blood on the
          stalks.

          You stay away from Joe, you come to
          me! Cid!
          Tries cocking the GAT but it's broken. Tosses it, wields the
          Blunderbuss.

          INT. SMALL CROP CLEARING

          Joe emerges from the corn.
          Cid crouches at one end of the small clearing. He looks at
          Joe. Terrified. Half covered in blood. Hair matted over
          one eye.
          Joe looks back at him. Approaches him, gun not raised, but
          in hand. Cid, like a frightened animal. A long moment.
          And just like that, Joe puts his hand on Cid's head. Cid
          leans against his legs, crying.
          Sara bursts into the clearing, sees this. Runs to Cid and
          embraces him, wiping the blood from his face. Joe steps back.

                         JOE
          Right now two things have happened.
          My looper knows Cid's the kid he's
          looking for, and my gang knows I'm
          here. So in fifteen minutes one or
          both is coming down that highway.
          You pack up the Gat Man's truck,
          whatever you can fit in ten
          minutes, and you drive North away
          from the city.

                         SARA
          Where are you going?
          Joe takes the Frog Buzzer from his pocket, presses it.
          Sara's buzzes in her pocket.

                         JOE
          One buzz means come and get me.
          Two or nothing, don't.
          He vanishes into the stalks, towards the highway.

          INT. ABE'S OFFICE

          Crowded with Gat Men, all preparing.

                         GAT MAN 1
          We got everyone here. All our men.

                         ABE
          Arm âem up, let's go.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          103.
          BUZZZZ. Abe turns, annoyed, and sees the security monitor.
          On the screen - Kid Blue rips the sack off and holds Old
          Joe's bloodied face up to the camera.

          KID BLUE (ON SPEAKER)
          I got him Abe. I got him.

                         ABE
          Well. Shhhhhit.

          INT. COAT CHECK

          The door buzzes open. Kid pushes Old Joe through the long
          entrance hallway, past a dozen Gat Men, who watch him with
          shocked amazement.
          Old Joe's hands bound back. Kid Blue glows. He comes to the
          tiny coat check room, and Big Craig stops him, then sees Old
          Joe.

                         BIG CRAIG
          Hoh. So both we got?

                         KID BLUE
          Just the Looper. I got him. Knew
          he went for whores, so I checked
          every building.

                         BIG CRAIG
          They found Joe too though, in a
          farm on the east side. That's why
          all the Gats are here, the whole
          crew's arming up to make a sweep.

                         KID BLUE
          Joe fuck Joe, save your bullets I
          got the Looper. Not such a fuck up
          huh? I'm taking him up to
          This happens very fast:
          Old Joe uses his legs to kick himself off the wall and back
          into Kid Blue, SLAMMING him against the opposite wall.
          Old Joe grabs (behind his back) Kid Blue's gun, and blasts
          one shot through the chains binding his wrists and into the
          Kid's midsection.
          He whips the gun from behind his back and shoots Big Craig in
          the face. Then blasts the Gat Men in the entrance hallway
          while he reaches into the coat check and pulls an automatic
          rifle.
          He blasts like hell into the hallway. A few shots return but
          mostly the men are trapped. Then it's over. All is smoky
          still for a moment.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          104.
          Old Joe stares at the exit door ajar, down the long hallway
          jammed with bodies. Then at the passage that leads deeper
          into the club.
          A Gat Man runs in, and Old Joe shoots him down.
          He steps into the coat check and loads his pockets with guns
          and grenades. Then launches himself into passageway towards
          the club.

          INT. BACKSTAGE

          Old Joe weaves his way through the backstage area, chucking
          grenades in front of him, then unloading his automatic rifle
          into the smoky aftermath.
          And with a mixture of dumb luck and skill from years of being
          gangland muscle takes out Gat Man after Gat Man.
          The corridors are tight, twisty. Old Joe uses that.
          Throwing grenades. Blasting away. Purging. Killing
          everyone he lays eyes on. Wiping them out. All the bad guys.
          It's horrible. Men maimed, bleeding and crying, dying the way
          people actually die from gunshots. Old Joe forges on, deeper.

          INT. ABE'S OFFICE

          Empty. Old Joe kicks the door open. Takes it in, the
          office. Hammer on the desk. He reloads a gun. Eyes find
          the door to Abe's inner den.

          INT. ABE'S DEN

          Abe and two Gat Men, guns out, crouched behind the table.
          Watching the door. A display screen shows Old Joe on the
          other side.
          Abe, eyes dull. Shouts at the door

                         ABE
          Joe. Guess I put the gun in that
          kid's hand, huh Joe. Guess
          everything comes back around. Like
          your goddamn ties.

          INT. ABE'S OFFICE

          Old Joe. Breathing hard. Reloaded. Closes the gun.

          EXT. HIGHWAY

          Joe breaks out of the corn, panting. He steps out into the
          middle of the highway.
          Storm clouds on the horizon. He cleans and readies his
          Blunderbuss.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          105.

          INT. COAT CHECK - LATER

          Kid Blue's eyes flutter open. He lifts himself painfully.
          Checks his chest. Most of the shot caught his shoulder, his
          chest is grazed.
          The Gat Men in the hall. Big Craig. All dead.

          INT. BACKSTAGE

          Kid Blue wanders the smoky halls. Dead and dying men.

          INT. ABE'S DEN

          Abe, shot once in the head, twice in the chest. Kid Blue
          stands over them. Stunned. Tears well in his eyes.
          Then on the wall, he sees the map. The farm circled in red.

          EXT. FARMHOUSE FRONT LAWN - MORNING

          Clothes and boxes piled in the back of Jesse's truck. Sara
          loads one last bundle. Calls to Cid, in the front seat.

                         SARA
          Ok baby, we're going.

          EXT. HIGHWAY

          Joe waits. Then, a CLOUD OF DUST on the distant highway. He
          tenses. The cloud gets closer. It is a truck. An armored
          truck.
          Joe squints. It's the ARMORED TRUCK that Kid Blue loaded his
          gold bricks into. The front windshield blown in.
          The truck stops fifty feet away, and Old Joe steps out. He
          throws a gold bar, which lands in the dusty highway between
          them.

                         OLD JOE
          Bon jour. You take this truck, you
          take your money, and you go live
          your life. No one's coming after
          you. I fixed it.

                         JOE
          And you go kill the boy. That's
          how you fix it.

                         OLD JOE
          That's how. You got your life
          back, you better think right now
          about what that's worth to you.

                         JOE
          My life? Your life. Becoming you.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          106.
          Joe raises his Blunderbuss and FIRES. Too far away, the shot
          scatters. The old man flinches, backs away.
          Joe walks forward towards Old Joe, stepping over the gold.

                         OLD JOE
          Stupid little shit! You let him
          live, he's gonna take away
          everything that's yours, everything
          that's mine! You seen what the
          boy's gonna become.

                         JOE
          I haven't seen that yet.
          Joe fires again, close enough now to draw blood off Old Joe's
          chest and knock him back.
          Out of nowhere a SLAT BIKE careens around the van, which has
          until now blocked our line of sight down the highway.
          Kid Blue.
          The bike clips Joe's leg, sending him spinning violently to
          the dusty pavement.
          The bike shoots off down the highway, a cloud of dust in its
          wake. It takes a hundred yards for the Kid to pull it to a
          stop and spin it around.
          Joe is hurt bad. He grapples for his blunderbuss.
          Kid Blue guns the engine, gat in hand. Levels it, steady as
          a rock.
          Joe shoots at the Kid, but he's out of range, the gun fires
          scattershot.
          Kid Blue fires, a bullet hits dangerously close to Joe.
          Panicked, Joe begins firing at the pavement around him, round
          after fiery round.
          Kicking up dust. Lots of dust. Raising a cloud.
          KID BLUE'S POV - zooming towards Joe, now obscured in a cloud
          of dust and smoke. He fires his gat into the cloud, tries to
          slow the bike but can't in time.
          In the dust cloud Joe hears the bike roaring down upon him.
          He covers up and when he feels the bike roaring past blindly
          FIRES his buss.
          A moment later the bike emerges from the dust cloud. Without
          a driver. It skids, crashes.
          When the dust clears away Joe lies still, arms over his head.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          107.
          Besides him, the broken remains of Kid Blue.
          Painfully, Joe raises himself. Then realizes:
          Old Joe is gone.

          EXT. FARMHOUSE FRONT LAWN

          Sara starts the truck up.

                         SARA
          Here we go. Give it a wave
          goodbye.

          EXT. DIRT ROAD

          They roll down the dirt road that leads to the highway.
          At the far end of it, at a distance but walking towards them,
          is the dark figure of Old Joe. Gun in hand.
          Sara hesitates a minute, then guns it. Straight for him.

                         CID

                         STOP

                         SARA
          Duck down baby

                         CID
          Stop please he can shoot us

                         SARA
          Just stay down
          Half the distance closed, but he's still far off. A shot
          cracks the front grill, another cracks the windshield.

                         CID
          Stop!
          The truck lurches horribly, and flips straight back in a
          graceful arc, landing upsidown.
          Sara and Cid, dazed, hanging by their seatbelts.

                         SARA
          Are you ok?

                         CID
          I'm sorry
          In the rear view mirror, Sara sees Old Joe getting closer.

                         SARA
          You're ok. C'mon baby we have to
          run now.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          108.
          She unfastens them and they both climb out, and Old Joe stops
          suddenly, taking aim.
          Sara pulls Cid behind the flatbed for cover as two bullets
          glance off the overturned truck.

                         SARA (CONT'D)
          We're going into the fields. I
          want you to run, I'll be right
          behind you, don't look back. Okay?
          Old Joe lowers his gun and runs towards them.

                         SARA (CONT'D)
          Go!
          They both sprint off the road.

          EXT. FIELD - WITH CID & SARA

          The wide bare field. Cid runs ahead towards the corn, Sara
          not far behind. The earth soft, their feet sink in, like a
          nightmare.

          EXT. FIELD - WITH OLD JOE

          Old Joe crosses the road and chases them onto the field,
          firing at them on the run.

          EXT. FIELD - WITH CID & SARA

          Bullets thunk in the earth. Sara stumbles, exhausted. Cid
          turns, about thirty feet ahead of her.

          EXT. FIELD - WITH OLD JOE

          Old Joe stops running and steadies his gun.

          EXT. FIELD - WITH CID & SARA

          A distant gunshot CRACK. A fan of crimson blood sprays from
          Cid's head. His neck twists and he crumples to the ground.

                         SARA

          NO!
          Sara is stopped in her tracks by an invisible force.

                         SARA (CONT'D)
          No Cid no!
          The topsoil of the earth around them RISES in a fine dust.

          EXT. FIELD - WITH OLD JOE

          Old Joe reacts as the topsoil rises, an eerie moment.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          109.

          EXT. FIELD - WITH CID & SARA

          Sara struggles to reach Cid but is still about twenty feet
          behind him.
          Cid raises his head. The bullet grazed his jawline. Not
          severe but lots of blood.
          Cid's eyes locked hateful on Old Joe. Blood soaks his shirt.
          Far behind him, the barn splinters apart as if in a tornado.

                         SARA
          No!
          With a sudden jolt the field ripples out from Cid, like a
          stone thrown in a pond.
          Sara lifts into the air.

          EXT. FIELD - WITH OLD JOE

          Old Joe is hefted off the ground. His gun falls.

          EXT. CORN FIELDS - CONTINUOUS

          Joe struggling through the fields, limping, desperate.
          Something like a furious wind rushes through the stalks.

          EXT. FIELD - WITH CID & SARA

          Cid stands. Intense, eyes dark, in another place.

          EXT. FIELD - WITH OLD JOE

          Old Joe, suspended mid-air, realizes what's about to happen.
          He lifts his hand defensively and SCREAMS

          EXT. FIELD - WITH CID & SARA

          Cid's face straining, about to scream.
          Cid's focus adjusts from Old Joe to Sara. She floats,
          reaching out to him. Frightened. Yelling something he can't
          hear but he can see her eyes.
          Cid's face breaks. He barely mouths the word

                         CID

                         MOM
          And everything FALLS. Sara, Old Joe, the earth. All comes
          crashing down.

          EXT. EDGE OF FIELD - CONTINUOUS

          The corn stalks shiver then are still.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          110.
          Joe breaks out of the stalks and onto the field. Gasping for
          breath. Gets his bearings. In the far distance across the
          field, Old Joe, Sara and Cid.
          Too far.

          EXT. FIELD - WITH CID & SARA

          Cid runs to Sara, who sits up slowly. They embrace.

                         SARA
          You did good, baby. You did so
          good. I love you.
          Behind them, Old Joe struggles to his feet. Sara kisses Cid.

                         SARA (CONT'D)
          Into the fields. Run now baby.
          Go.

                         CID

                         NO

                         SARA

                         GO NOW

                         CID
          No no mom no

                         SARA
          You go!
          She pushes him away and Cid runs. Then she turns. Standing
          her ground. Directly between Old Joe and Cid.
          Old Joe TRIPS in the mud, fumbles his gun. Sees Cid
          approaching the safety of the CORN STALKS. Blocked by Sara.

                         OLD JOE
          Move!

          EXT. FIELD - WITH JOE

          Still too far away, struggling as fast as he can, helpless as
          Old Joe closes in on Sara. He fires his buss at Old Joe, but
          is way out of range.

          EXT. FIELD - WITH OLD JOE & SARA

          Old Joe gets his gun, rises with it. Cid about to hit the
          stalks. Sara between them.

          EXT. FIELD - WITH CID

          Cid nears the corn fields, running. Seconds from safety.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          111.

          EXT. FIELD - WITH OLD JOE & SARA

          Old Joe. Gun raised. Pocket watch wrapped around it. His
          wife's picture in it. Clear as day.
          No time to move around Sara. Now or never.

          EXT. FIELD - WITH JOE

          Joe running, useless gun in hand.

                         JOE
          No!

          EXT. FIELD - WITH OLD JOE & SARA

          Sara, not going anywhere.

                         OLD JOE
          I'm sorry
          He pulls the trigger.

          EXT. FIELD - WITH JOE

          Joe running. Time slows. Watching:

          EXT. FIELD - OLD JOE & SARA

          Everything is a little surreal. Dream-like. Slow.
          Old Joe shoots Sara.
          We hear no gunshot. Just the wind in the corn, and young
          Joe's breathing. She falls, giving him a clear shot at Cid.

          EXT. FIELD - WITH JOE


                         JOE WATCHING:

          EXT. FIELD - WITH CID

          Just as Old Joe gets him in his sights, Cid breaches the corn
          fields and is gone, vanishing in the stalks.
          Old Joe lowers his gun, stunned but still frantic. He
          stumbles towards the corn, still far off, his face breaking.
          Trips, falls in the mud. Corn field vast in front of him.
          Cid is gone. He lost him. He holds his pocket watch. Sobs.
          Lost.

          EXT. FIELD - WITH JOE


                         JOE WATCHING:

                         

                         

                         

                         

          112.

          EXT. CORN FIELDS

          On the horizon, a train.

          EXT. FIELD - WITH JOE


                         JOE WATCHING:

          INT./EXT. FREIGHT TRAIN CAR

          Cid sits in a darkened car, holding a bloody rag to his jaw.

          EXT. FIELD - WITH JOE

          Joe watching, seeing:

          INT./EXT. FREIGHT TRAIN CAR

          Cid's face. Bloody. Dirty. His eyes full of hate. The
          train rumbles towards the dark city.

          EXT. FIELD - WITH JOE

          Joe watches. Sees, in his mind's eye, all of this.
          And through all of this we have only heard the wind. And Joe
          breathing.
          Time hanging, slowed nearly to a stop. A moment of decision.
          Joe turns his blunderbuss back on himself and FIRES.

          EXT. FIELD - WITH OLD JOE & SARA

          Revealing that all we saw was in Joe's head, and we are still
          in the moment where Old Joe is about to shoot Sara.
          But this time, just as he's pulling the trigger, a distant
          shot is heard.
          And Old Joe DISAPPEARS.
          Sara stands shell shocked just for a moment. Then she
          doesn't process any of it, she just turns and yells

                         SARA

          CID!

          EXT. FIELD - WITH CID

          Cid stops just shy of the corn. Turns back to the field.
          There's his mom, Sara, unharmed and smiling. The bad man is
          gone. The field is empty.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          113.

          EXT. FIELD - SEEN FROM JOE'S POV

          We don't see Joe, but far across the field Cid runs to his
          mom, into her arms. Sara lifts him, holds him.

          EXT. FIELD - WITH CID & SARA

          She carries him. Walking fast back towards a far distant
          figure lying still on the edge of the field. Joe.
          Then a faint buzz. The flasher, in her pocket. She pulls it
          out. Two flashes.
          She slows. Stops. Looking at him, far away. Two flashes.

                         CID
          Where's Joe?

                         SARA
          He had to go away, baby.

                         CID
          He took the bad man with him?
          She kisses him.

          EXT. FIELD - FROM JOE'S POV

          In the distance, Sara turns away and carries Cid back towards
          the farmhouse.

          INT. CID'S BATHROOM

          Sara bathes Cid, dresses the wound on his jaw.

          INT. CID'S BEDROOM

          She tucks Cid in, holds him close. Kisses his forehead.

          EXT. FARM HOUSE PORCH - LATE AFTERNOON

          Sara emerges from the ruined front door, crosses the porch.

          EXT. FARMHOUSE FRONT LAWN

          Sara crosses the lawn, and walks across the field.

          EXT. EDGE OF CORN FIELDS

          Joe's body. Sara goes to him, slowly. She kneels beside him.
          His pocket watch in the dirt. Open. No photo inside.
          Ticking away. Around and around.
          She closes it.Touches his hair. The wind through the corn.
          After a long while, the sun breaks through the clouds.

     FADE UP

     CLOSE UP on the face of YURI ORLOV.

     Late-thirties, maybe the wrong side of forty, cigarette dangling
     from his fingers, wearing a conservative suit and tie.

     Black smoke wafts in front of his face.  He speaks matter-of-factly,
     directly into camera.

                             YURI
                 There are over 550 million firearms in
                 worldwide circulation.  That's one firearm
                 for every twelve people on the planet.  The
                 only question is...
                      (taking a draft and stubbing out
                       the cigarette)
                 ...how do we arm the other eleven?

     The camera zooms away from his face, revealing:

     Yuri alone on a battlefield surrounded by the charred carcasses of
     armored military vehicles and other equipment, discarded weapons and
     ammunition, desert floor stained with what appears to be blood.

     The faint sound of gunfire, some distance away, carries to us on the
     wind.

     CUT TO:

     A TITLE SEQUENCE FOLLOWS - A CONTINUOUS SHOT FROM A CAMERA
     MOUNTED ON THE BACK OF A BULLET CASING - ILLUSTRATING THE
     LIFESPAN OF THE BULLET.

     - Gunpowder is poured into a metal casing, lead slug mounted on top.
     A BULLET is born.  A perfect 39mm.

     - The BULLET travels along a conveyor belt with thousands of
     identical siblings in a Ukrainian factory so grey it's monochrome.

     - The BULLET, picked up by a ham-fisted UKRAINIAN FACTORY WORKER, is
     tossed into a crate.

     - The BULLET, lying in its open crate, rolls down a chute where it's
     inspected by a UKRAINIAN MILITARY OFFICER holding a manifest.  He
     seems to stare directly at our BULLET.

                             UKRAINIAN OFFICER
                      (to his SUBORDINATE carrying a
                       manifest, in Ukrainian)
                 Call it "agricultural machinery".

     - The BULLET's crate rattles around in an open-bed truck along an
     industrial road, passes a decapitated statue of LENIN.

     - The crate containing our BULLET is placed on a ship in
     the cold grey Odessa harbor.  A container door closes, plunging the
     bullet into darkness.

     - The door re-opens.  The BULLET, still in its crate, now basks in
     bright, tropical sunshine, surrounded by an azure sea.

     - The crate is removed by a pair of slim, dark hands, revealing a
     glimpse of the bustling, weathered port of Abidjan in the Ivory
     Coast.  The crate is one of dozens unloaded from the ship.

     - BULLET's POV from another open-air truck, now slogging through a
     mud-clogged road in lush rainforest.

     - The BULLET is unloaded from the truck in Freetown, Sierra Leone -
     immediately grabbed by the young HAND of a RUF soldier.

     - The BULLET is loaded into a 30-round magazine which is inserted
     into an AK-47 machine gun.

     - The BULLET waits - in the gloomy chamber.  Suddenly, from outside,
     the sound of raised voices and gunfire.

     - The BULLET and its neighbors start to rise quickly up the magazine
     towards the chamber as the Kalashnikov is fired.

     - Our hero BULLET is next.  Will it see action?

     - Smack.  The gun's bolt strieks the explosive cap, gunpowder
     ignited, the BULLET driven out of the barrel.

     - Shed of its casing - now only a slug - the BULLET emerges into
     bright sunshine.  It is flying down the main street in Freetown.

     - The BULLET gives us a perfect point-of-view of the bullet ahead of
     it.  They are both flying towards their intended target - a wild-
     eyed CHILD SOLDIER, a boy no more than twelve, firing an AK-47
     almost as tall as he is.

     - The leading bullet narrowly misses, whistles past the boy's ear,
     striking the whitewashed wall behind - one more pock-mark in a
     building riddled with pock-marks.

     - Our BULLET, following close behind, finds its mark, slamming into
     the boy's forehead just above his left eye - his expression, oddly
     relieved.

     - The BULLET carves through the lobes of the boy's brain
     where it is enveloped in blood, finally plunged into
     darkness - the bullet's final resting place.

     CUT TO BLACK

     EXT.  ODESSA - MAIN STREET.  DAY.

     "Towards A Brighter Socialist Future", reads a billboard in the main
     street.

                                                        Odessa, U.S.S.R - 1980

     Fifteen-year-old YURI walks into frame.  He spies a long line
     snaking away from the door of a barren grocery store.

                             YURI (V.O.)
                 I was born Yuri Orlovitch in the city of
                 Odessa in a country that no longer exists.
                 You might have heard of it - a little place
                 called the Soviet Union.

     A YOUNG COMMUNIST sits in the shadow of a statue of Trotsky in the
     Soviet-style plaza, jacket and neckerchief removed in the summer heat,
     poring over a Communist text.  Yuri approaches, pretends to be
     interested in the statue, glances to the Young Communist's book.

                             YURI
                      (in subtitled Ukrainian, looking over
                       the idealist's shoulder)
                 All property is theft.

     The Young Communist nods at this kindred spirit.  Yuri pats his
     comrade on the back, taking the opportunity to steal the boy's red
     neckerchief and Lenin pin.

     INT.  GROCERY STORE.  DAY.

     Now wearing the pin in his own jacket along with the neckerchief and
     a stern expression, YURI strides to the front of the line in the
     store.

                             YURI (V.O.)
                 Where I grew up, everyone was equal.  Some
                 were just more equal than others.

     The female STORE CLERK is about to order Yuri to the back of the
     line when Yuri flashes the pin.

     Intimidated, the Clerk smiles and pulls a special tray from under
     the counter.  In contrast to the meager offerings on the shelves,
     the tray contains bags of sugar, coffee, bananas, even Pepsi.

     INT.  APARTMENT - ODESSA.  DAY.

     A Soviet-style apartment building.  Front door opens - YURI enters,
     shopping bag in hand.

     His mother, IRINA, pokes her head out of the kitchen.  Yuri holds up
     a banana.

                             YURI
                      (in subtitled Ukrainian)
                 Shortages?  What shortages?

     Irina shakes her head in amazement.

     INT.  APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM.  DAY.

     While a parade of weapons in Red Square plays silently on the state-
     controlled TV, father ANATOLY and Military Cadet older brother
     VITALY, shoulder bandaged, sit at a tiny table, drinking cheap vodka
     and listening intently to an illegal shortwave radio - coat hanger
     for antenna.

                             YURI (V.O.)
                 My father was a wounded hero of World War Two, my
                 younger brother was wounded in Afghanistan - a
                 war without heroes.  I'd gotten out of military
                 service due to a heart problem - it wasn't
                 completely a lie.

     YURI joins them, careful not to interrupt the broadcoast.

     He goes to pour himself a glass of vodka.  Without looking away from
     the radio, his father's hand grasps Yuri's in a vice-like grip,
     preventing him from lifting the bottle.

                             RADIO ANNOUNCER
                      (impossibly upper-crust British
                       accent)
                 --Finally, in response to human rights
                 protests and in an effort to encourage the
                 United States to sell grain to the Soviet
                 Union after two successive crop failures, it
                 is reported that the politburo has consented
                 to permit a limited number of Jews to
                 emigrate from the Soviet Union to Israel.
                      (beat)
                 And that concludes this edition of news from
                 the BBC World Service.

     Anatoly, deep in thought, switches off the radio.  IRINA enters,
     puts Yuri's "feast" on the table.

     They speak Ukrainian, subtitled.

                             ANATOLY
                      (incredulous)
                 Trading Jews for grain.

                             VITALY
                      (reaching for a banana)
                 It's good P.R. - for the Moscow Olympics.

                             IRINA
                      (shrugs)
                 Good for the Jews.

                             YURI
                 And us.

     All eyes to Yuri, family confused.

                             YURI (cont'd)
                      (matter-of-fact)
                 We're Jewish.

                             VITALY
                      (scoffing)
                 We're not Jewish.

                             YURI
                      (shrug)
                 We're Jewish if we say we're Jewish.

     The stunned family stares at him - out of the mouths of babes.  Anatoly
     finally breaks the silence, pours Yuri a drink.

                             ANATOLY
                 Mazeltov.

     Yuri and the family drink to their new identity.

     EXT.  CEMETERY, ODESSA.  DAY.

     A sea of Jewish gravestones.

     YURI and ANATOLY bribe the cemetery CUSTODIAN.

                             YURI (V.O.)
                 There have been few occasions in the
                 twentieth century when it's been an
                 advantage to be a Jew.

     Under his father's watchful gaze, Yuri takes a rubbing from one of
     the headstones - "ORLOV".

     INT.  UKRAINIAN GOVERNMENT OFFICE.  DAY.

     ANATOLY, with YURI at his side, presents the rubbing along with
     other crudely forged paperwork confirming their Jewish ancestry to a
     CLERK.  "ORLOVITCH" now "ORLOV".

                             YURI (V.O.)
                 The rubbing from the Jewish headstone was my
                 first forged document.  Little about my life
                 has been kosher ever since.

     The Clerk gives Anatoly and Yuri the once-over, then
     stamps an emigration visa.

     INT.  APARTMENT, BEDROOM.  NIGHT.

     Suitcase in hand, YURI surveys his bedroom for the last time.

     A car horn.  He glances through the window to the communist-style
     plaza below.  ANATOLY beckons impatiently to Yuri.  VITALY and IRINA
     load overstuffed suitcases into an old Russian sedan driven by an
     old Russian Military Officer, UNCLE DMITRI.

     Yuri stares at himself in the mirror.  He replaces his stolen Soviet
     pin for a necklace - a Star of David.

     INT.  BEN GURION AIRPORT - TEL AVIV.  DAY.

     CLOSE UP on a heavily-retouched photograph of GOLDA MEIR.  She's
     still not pretty.

     YURI stares up at it.

                             YURI (V.O.)
                 We Russian Jews were supposed to be headed
                 for Israel but I didn't see much of the
                 country on that first trip.

     We reveal he is standing in a jam-packed, standing-roam-only
     "TRANSIT" lounge.

                             YURI (V.O.)
                 Real Jews or fake Jews, eighty-five percent
                 of us ended up in that other "promised
                 land".

     The Pan American destination board reads: "PA 447 to NEW YORK".

     EXT.  BRIGHTON BEACH - "LITTLE ODESSA".  DUSK.

     In the distance, a roller coaster in Coney Island, silhouetted
     against the afternoon sky.

                                              "Little Odessa", New York - 1984

     The camera travels off the coaster to a restaurant, apartment above
     it.

                             YURI (V.O.)
                 We congregated in New York's Brighton Beach
                 because of its similarity to the Crimean
                 Sea.  I've always thought it's appropriate
                 we moved next door to the circus.

     INT.  "CRIMEAN RESTAURANT" - LITTLE ODESSA.  DAY.

     A typical Jewish establishment with all its paraphernalia - menorah
     on the mantle, etc.  The family sits in a small dining room
     attached to the restaurant.  ANATOLY reads the Torah as he waits
     for dinner with YURI and VITALY.

                             YURI (V.O.)
                 I had no idea my father would take his
                 assumed identity so much to heart.  I guess
                 he just stayed in character.

     YURI, older, as we now know him, studies school work.  Long-haired
     VITALY watches "Band Aid" on TV.

     IRINA puts a plate of mussels in front of Anatoly.

                             ANATOLY
                      (glaring at the plate,
                       incredulous)
                 How many times--I can't eat shellfish.  It's
                 "treyf".

                             IRINA
                 You're not Jewish.

                             ANATOLY
                 I like it.
                      (picking up his felt fedora)
                 I like the hat - to remind us there's
                 something above us.  I like that.

     Anatoly dons his hat.

                             ANATOLY (cont'd)
                 I'm going to temple.

                             IRINA
                 You're not going to temple.  You go to
                 temple more than the rabbi!

     Vitaly begins eating his father's plate of mussels.  Yuri watches his
     father exit.

                             YURI (V.O.)
                 I was suffering an identity crisis of my own.

     We focus on orientation booklets from a careers fair.  Yuri shuffles
     between the eagle of the CIA and the dove of the U.N.

                             YURI (V.O.)
                 My gift for languages made me highly sought
                 after.  The C.I.A. and U.N. were both heavily
                 recruiting Russian immigrants.

     Yuri settles on the dove.

     EXT.  UNITED NATIONS.  DAY.

     The idealistic YURI, ill-fitting suit, full of optimism, approaches
     the United Nations Building.

                             YURI (V.O.)
                 Naturally, I went with the U.N.  They were
                 paying more.

     He strides past Luxembourg's gift to the U.N. - a sculpture of a gun
     with its barrel tied in a knot.  Never gives it a look.

     He is greeted at the entrance by an attractive female U.N. Official,
     VIVIAN CARLISLE.  She likes what she sees.

     INT.  ARMORED PERSONNEL CARRIER.  DAY.

     The blue helmeted YURI is seated in a white U.N. armored personnel
     carrier, the background behind him morphs from
     one Third World location to another: Third World desert
     to Third World rainforest to Third World slum.

                             YURI (V.O.)
                 The fastest way to find out you can't change
                 the world is to actually go there.

     EXT.  NRFL REBEL HEADQUARTERS - NORTHERN LIBERIA.  DAY.

     Poolside at a recently-captured Southern-style colonial mansion, a
     long way from Georgia.

                                                  Gbamga, Liberia - 1985


                             YURI (V.O.)
                 West Africa's Liberia, or "land of the
                 free", was originally established in the
                 1800's as a homeland for freed American
                 negroes.  It's been enslaved by one dictator
                 or another ever since.  They even copied
                 their masters' Southern architecture.

     A tatty pile of weapons - some from World War II - sits in front of
     a long negotiating table.

     YURI, blue beret, observes the CHIEF U.N. ENVOY at the table
     opposite warlord ANDRE BAPTISTE, leader of the National
     Revolutionary Front of Liberia (NRFL).

     Baptiste, 40's, is an imposing figure.  In full uniform despite the
     heat, he wears a jacket one size too small as if he cannot admit his
     extra few pounds.  His THIRD WIFE stands next to him, wiping the
     sweat from his brow like an intermittent windscreen wiper.

                             YURI (V.O.)
                 It was my first meeting with the American-
                 educated Andre Roosevelt Baptiste.  While
                 the warning signs were all there, no one had
                 any idea what a monster he would eventually
                 become.  I certainly didn't think he would
                 become my friend.

     Baptiste has a U.N. document in front of him, awaiting his
     signature, clearly enjoying his moment in the sun.

                             U.N. ENVOY
                      (referring to the meager pile
                       of weapons)
                 --With all due respect, Mr. Baptiste, you
                 don't seriously expect us to believe that
                 this represents your entire arsenal.

     Baptiste shrugs.

                             U.N. ENVOY (cont'd)
                 This is making a nonsense of the embargo
                 ratified by all five permanent members of
                 the Security Council.  The escalation in the
                 build up of arms jeopardizes not only order
                 in the region but ultimately world order.

     Baptiste smiles.

                             BAPTISTE
                      (playing to the gallery)
                 --World order?  You say we jeopardize world
                 order?

     Baptiste's Third Wife wipes his brow.

                             BAPTISTE (cant'd)
                 Your idea of world order is when you're
                 giving the orders to the world.

     The Envoy has no response.

     Baptiste rises from the table, leaving the unsigned document sitting
     there.

                             BAPTISTE (cant'd)
                 Excuse me.

     Baptiste is accompanied by two armed BODYGUARDS.  Yuri's commanding
     officer, CAPTAIN VIVIAN CARLISLE, motions for one of her detail to
     follow - Yuri.

                             BAPTISTE
                       (irritated by Yuri's presence)
                 I am only going to the restroom.

                             YURI
                      (shrug)
                 Orders.

     They reach the door marked, "MEN".

                             BAPTISTE
                      (aside to his bodyguards as he enters)
                 This is what they mean by U.N. Observer?

     Yuri winces at the remark.

     INT.  PRESIDENTIAL MANSION RESTROOM.  DAY.

     BAPTISTE pisses at a urinal.  YURI and the BODYGUARDS hang back a
     respectful distance.

                             BAPTISTE
                      (taunting Yuri)
                 Aren't you going to help me hold my cock?

                             YURI
                      (glancing towards the urinal)
                 Doesn't look like a job for two men.

     The BODYGUARDS stiffen at the insult.  Baptiste stares Yuri down for
     a moment, then suddenly bursts into laughter.  The TWO BODYGUARDS
     also start to laugh - cautiously.

     Baptiste washes his hands, stares at Yuri in the mirror, smiles.

                             BAPTISTE
                 You know you are fighting a losing battle,
                 my young friend.  War is nature.  If you
                 take away the guns, we will kill each other
                 with knives.  Take away the knives, we will
                 kill each other with sticks.  Take away the
                 sticks, we will kill each other with your
                 peace treaties.
                      (turning to face Yuri)
                 You cannot stop this bath of blood.

                             YURI
                 It's not "bath of blood".  It's, "blood
                 bath".

                             BAPTISTE
                 Thank you.  But I like it my way.

     Baptiste smiles and exits, leaving the words ringing in Yuri's head.

     EXT.  U.N. COMPOUND - MONROVIA.  DAY.

     A pep rally for the mostly male U.N. PEACEKEEPERS.  A stage has been
     erected in the rundown Embassy grounds.  They chant and stamp their feet
     impatiently.

     A U.N. OFFICER, acting as M.C., approaches the microphone.

                             M.C.
                      (battling the microphone's
                       feedback)
                 And now, we have a surprise for you.  The
                 83rd West African Peacekeeping Corp is proud
                 to present, all the way from El Salvador,
                 the newly crowned Miss World, Ava Cordova.

     From behind a jerry-rigged curtain appears the vision that is AVA
     CORDOVA.  She wears a dress that appears to have been sewn onto her.
     She is obscenely beautiful in the squalid setting.

     The peacekeepers roar and whistle their approval.  YURI, near the front
     of the stage, is hypnotized.

     Standing closer to Yuri than necessary, despite the crush, is CAPTAIN
     VIVIAN CARLISLE (attractive in her own right but pales in comparison
     with the Goddess on stage).  She catches Yuri's reaction.

                             U.N. PEACEKEEPERS
                      (chanting to Ava)
                 Take it off, baby!  Take it off!

     Ava steps up to the microphone.

                             AVA
                      (referring to the sea of U.N.
                       berets)
                 Baby blue.  My favorite color!

     A roar of approval from the men.

                             AVA (cant'd)
                 I suppose I could give you the speech about
                 "my hope for world peace" but I have a
                 feeling you don't want to hear that today.

                             U.N. PEACEKEEPER
                      (calling out)
                 My hope is for a piece of your ass!

     They roar again.

                             AVA
                      (laughing it off)
                 I don't know if you'll be taking me to bed
                 tonight, darling, but you can take her.

     Ava unfurls a life-size poster of herself in a swimsuit,
     flirtatiously holding it up against her body.  She tosses other
     posters to eager hands.

                             AVA (cant'd)
                 You're all doing a great job - keep it up.  Enjoy the
                 show!

     On stage, a generic-looking ROCK GROUP starts to play a cover from
     the 80's - Tears For Fears' "Shout".  Ava dances enthusiastically,
     provocatively.

     Ava appears to make eye-contact with Yuri - blowing a kiss in his
     direction.  He is paralyzed.

     LATER

     BACKSTAGE, YURI and other Peacekeepers observe AVA escorted towards
     a huge, American car.  An inebriated U.N. PEACEKEEPER tries to get
     her attention.

                             U.N. PEACEKEEPER
                 Ava!  Ava!

     As the young man reaches out to her, a slick, handsome BUSINESS
     MANAGER shoves him aside.

                             MANAGER
                 Don't touch what you can't afford.

     The Manager slips into the car beside Ava.  The U.N. Peacekeeper and
     Yuri watch the car roar away.

                             U.N. PEACEKEEPER
                      (regretting indulging the fantasy)
                 Let's get drunk.

     EXT.  DOWNTOWN MONROVIA - BAR.  NIGHT.

     YURI and two other U.N. PEACEKEEPERS get loaded on local beer with
     local PROSTITUTES - one of the peacekeepers pouring beer down a
     prostitute's throat.

     From the shadows across the street, a LIBERIAN MAN observes the
     group.

     Yuri's colleagues toss some Liberian dollars at a waiter and stagger
     drunkenly away from the bar, leaning for support on the PROSTITUTES.

     YURI remains at the verandah, exchanges a smile with a YOUNG
     PROSTITUTE, at least two years from legal.

     He's tempted.  He knocks back his drink.  He approaches the girl -
     presses a few bills into her hand.  She picks up her purse, makes to
     leave with him but he motions her to stay.

                             MONROVIAN GIRL
                      (referring to the money)
                 What's this?

                             YURI
                      (explaining the tip)
                 For the smile.

     Yuri exits alone.  The Liberian Man, across the street, follows.

     EXT.  DOWNTOWN MONROVIA - STREET.  NIGHT.

     YURI walks down a poorly-lit sidestreet.  He feels something in his
     back - stops abruptly.  His hand reflexively goes to his holster.
     Empty.

     He turns.  The young LIBERIAN MAN is holding him up with his own
     gun.

                             YURI
                      (mixing English and French)
                 Fuck, no, no, no, no--fuck, no.  Money?  You
                 want money?
                      (going through his pockets,
                       he starts pulling out loose bills)
                 Fuck, no.  Don't shoot.  Don't shoot me.
                 Fuck.  U.S. dollars.
                      (referring to the face on a five
                       dollar bill)
                 President Lincoln.

     The Liberian puts his finger to his lips to hush Yuri.

     The Liberian appears more interested in the gun than the hold-up.

                             LIBERIAN MAN
                      (in flawless English)
                 Glock .45.

     The Liberian produces a crisp U.S. twenty dollar bill of his own,
     offers it to Yuri.

                             LIBERIAN MAN (cont'd)
                      (referring to the face on a twenty
                       dollar bill)
                 Jackson.

                             YURI
                 What?

     Yuri stares at the money, bewildered.

                             LIBERIAN MAN
                 President Jackson.

     He shakes his head.

                             YURI
                 No.

                             LIBERIAN MAN
                      (misinterpreting him)
                 You are driving a hard bargain.

     He hands Yuri a second twenty.

                             YURI
                      (flabbergasted)
                 No, keep it.  Keep the money.  Keep the gun.

                             LIBERIAN MAN
                      (offended)
                 What do you take me for - a thief?

     The Liberian stuffs the money in the pocket of the bewildered
     Yuri.

                             LIBERIAN MAN
                 Demand and supply.
                      (referring to the gun)
                 There is more I am thinking where this comes
                 from.

                             YURI
                      (incredulous)
                 You want more Glocks?

                             LIBERIAN MAN
                 And the Heckler & Koch G-3 assault rifle.

                             YURI
                 What makes you think I'll do that?

                             LIBERIAN MAN
                      (quizzical)
                 I will come back and shoot you with the
                 Glock.
                      (checking the magazine, referring
                       to the bullets)
                 By the way, do you have the hollow point
                 cartridges?

     Yuri stares at the man.

                             YURI
                      (facetious, nodding to the gun)
                 You got any color preference for that?

                             LIBERIAN MAN
                      (missing the sarcasm, regarding the gun)
                 Kelly green.
                      (meeting Yuri's eye)
                 I will find you.

     The Liberian walks away, still admiring his new weapon.  Yuri stares
     after him.

                             YURI (V.O.)
                 He'd come to the right place - peacekeepers
                 are armed to the teeth.  And nothing but
                 premium product.  The U.N. mostly buys from
                 Switzerland - where else?

     INT.  CAPTAIN CARLISLE'S PRIVATE QUARTERS.  NIGHT.

     CLOSE ON two blue helmets lying beside each other.

     YURI and CAPTAIN VIVIAN CARLISLE are under the mosquito netting of a
     bed in her private quarters - trying to get each other out of their
     respective clothes as fast as possible - mouths and hands
     everywhere.

     Even in the heat of the moment, VIVIAN is unable to completely let
     go of her work.

                             VIVIAN
                      (between heavy breaths)
                 What are we doing here, Yuri?

                             YURI
                      (kissing her nipple)
                 Whatever you want.

                             VIVIAN
                 You know what I mean.  Here, in this
                 country.  Are we doing any good?

                             YURI
                      (finally telling her what she
                       wants to hear)
                 Would nothing be better?

     Satisfied with the answer, she completely gives in to the throes of
     passion - pulls him to her.

     LATER

     VIVIAN, satiated, dozes amongst the rumpled sheets, backside
     exposed.

     YURI uses the opportunity to take an impression of the key attached
     to her belt.

     EXT.  EMBASSY COMPOUND.  NIGHT.

     A white armored personnel carrier sits unattended.

     The LIBERIAN MAN and two COLLEAGUES approach the carrier's door.  It
     opens with their newly-made key.

     The men start to unload the weapons inside the carrier, spilling a
     box of ammunition in their haste.

     The camera drifts off the carrier to reveal YURI, behind the
     barracks, counting a thick wad of U.S. dollars.

     Spying a lone BULLET on the ground, Yuri picks it up.  We sense he has
     made a decision from which there is no return.

     EXT.  INT.  "THE CRIMEAN" RESTAURANT - BRIGHTON BEACH.  DAY.

     The BULLET has been turned into a pendant, replacing Yuri's Star of
     David.

     YURI, wearing a sharp, new suit, enters the family restaurant.  One
     table of CUSTOMERS - not exactly a thriving concern.

                             YURI (V.O.)
                 The starting salary for a U.N. interpreter
                 back then was $32,000.  I made fifty K on
                 "misplaced" weapons on that one trip alone.
                 I doubt the Secretary General noticed.  The
                 U.N. spends more on lunch.

     Yuri kisses father and Maitre d', ANATOLY, who is adding more Jewish
     decoration to the window.  He bear hugs mother, IRINA, nearly
     causing her to drop the plates she is carrying.

                             YURI (V.O.)
                 My tour as a peacekeeper was the perfect
                 preparation for war.

     Irina notices the change in her son's appearance.

                             IRINA
                      (calling after him)
                 Who are you?  You're not my son.  My son
                 doesn't own such a suit.

     Yuri flashes his killer smile in response.

     Out of their sight, he slips a hundred dollar bill into the cash
     register and breezes into the kitchen.

     INT.  "THE CRIMEAN" RESTAURANT - KITCHEN.  DAY.

     VITALY, now chef in the family business, prepares a Russian borscht
     in a kitchen unlikely to pass a health inspection.

     YURI tastes the food, pretends to gag, spits it out in the sink.
     Vitaly affectionately cuffs his older brother - the joke
     obviously a familiar ritual.

     Yuri takes his brother to the kitchen's rear door.

     EXT.  "THE CRIMEAN" RESTAURANT.  DAY.

     At the back of the restaurant, YURI and VITALY sit on the steps
     amongst the garbage cans.

                             YURI
                 You know who's going to inherit the earth?

     Vitaly looks at him blankly.

                             YURI (cont'd)
                 Arms dealers - because everybody else is too
                 busy killing each other.

     YURI plonks a glossy arms brochure in front of Vitaly.  He takes in
     the contents.

                             VITALY
                      (regarding his brother)
                 It's a hell of a fucking career move.

                             YURI
                 That's the point.  I've seen how the world's
                 coming apart.

                             VITALY
                 And you want to help with that?

                             YURI
                 You can't stop it.
                      (warming to his theme)
                 It's a basic human need - we eat, sleep,
                 sleep with each other and what else?  Fight.
                 The oldest human skeletons have spearheads
                 in their rib cages.

     Vitaly is still skeptical.

                             VITALY
                 What do you know about guns?

                             YURI
                      (joking darkly)
                 I know which end I'd rather be on.
                      (adopting a serious tone)
                 Every day there are people shooting at each
                 other.  I think to myself, what guns are
                 they using?  Why not mine?

                             VITALY
                      (hesitant)
                 I don't know.

                             YURI
                      (pressing his argument)
                 Vitaly, I've tasted your borscht, you're no
                 fucking chef.  I can eat here for free and I
                 still don't eat here.  You're doing nothing
                 with your life.

                             VITALY
                 Maybe doing nothing's better than doing
                 this.
                      (referring to an image
                       of a gun)
                 Yuri, I've actually fired one of these
                 things.

     Yuri puts his arm around his brother's shoulder.

                             YURI
                 That's why I need you.
                      (coaxing)
                 Brothers in arms.

     Vitaly smiles, looks sold.

     EXT.  ISRAEL CENTRAL TEMPLE - BRIGHTON BEACH.  DAY.

     ANATOLY makes his way to the synagogue.  YURI, hastily adjusting his
     yarmulke, falls into step.

                             ANATOLY
                      (pleasantly surprised)
                 Finally getting in touch with what's
                 important, my Son?

                             YURI
                      (simply)
                 Yes.

     However, instead of the synagogue, he is fixed on another
     distinguished Jewish man, ELI KURTZMAN, on a street corner also on
     his way to temple.

                             YURI (V.O.)
                 It wasn't God I was trying to get close to.

     Anatoly introduces Yuri to Eli, who regards Yuri warily.

                             YURI (V.O.)
                 Dad's contacts at synagogue landed me my first
                 Israeli-made Uzis and an introduction to the
                 biggest of the big guns.

     CLOSE ON THE UNDERCARRIAGE OF A TWA 747, TAKING OFF FROM JFK.

     INT.  CONVENTION CENTER - PARIS.  DAY.

     A platoon of attractive YOUNG WOMEN in camouflage mini-dresses show off
     the latest sniper rifles and grenade launchers.

     An ASIAN BUSINESSMAN pitches hardware to YURI.  VITALY is more
     interested in the girls.

                             ASIAN BUSINESSMAN
                      (brochure in hand)
                 --I can get you the shoulder-fired SA-7
                 surface-to-air missiles.  The older Chinese
                 model.  Not so effective against modern
                 military aircraft but deadly if used against
                 a commercial airliner.  I'm giving them away
                 at eight-fifty.

     Yuri notices that his vendor's attention has wandered to a suave
     older gentleman, SIMEON ZAHAROFF, surrounded by eager VENDORS of all
     nationalities.  The Asian man joins the enthusiastic throng.

                             YURI (V.O.)
                 It was the eighties and the Cold War was far
                 from thawed.  Most of the deals were
                 government-to-government.  There were some go-
                 betweens - freelancers - but it was a mostly
                 private club with a lifetime club president.

     Yuri drags Vitaly away from the sales girls.

                             YURI
                 That's him.  The guy Eli told me about.  Simeon
                 Zaharoff.  Brokered deals in the Iran/Iraq war
                 - both sides, sold missiles to Argentina in the
                 Falklands.  Hets a fucking legend.  I've got to
                 talk to him.

     Yuri pushes past Zaharoff's entourage.

                             YURI
                 Simeon!  Simeon!

     A BODYGUARD tries to step between Yuri and Zaharoff.

                             VITALY
                      (stepping between the bodyguard
                       and Yuri)
                 They're talking.

     Zaharoff, irritated, nonetheless humors Yuri.

                             SIMEON
                 May I help you?

                             YURI
                 A mutual friend, Eli Kurtzman from Brighton
                 Beach Import-Export said to contact you.  I
                 have a business proposal.  Perhaps we can
                 discuss it - over a drink.

     Simeon looks him up and down.

                             SIMEON
                 You're in the wrong place my young friend.
                 This is no place for amateurs.

     Simeon walks away without another word.  Vitaly shrugs.  Yuri
     fumes.

                             YURI
                      (under his breath in Ukrainian)
                 Yob tvayu mat.  (Subtitled - Motherfucker.)

     Yuri watches Simeon go, surrounded by flunkies.

                             YURI (V.O.)
                 Curious how you always revert to your native
                 tongue in moments of extreme anger...

     INT.  HOTEL ROOM - PARIS.  NIGHT

     Camouflage minidress and beret are now discarded on the floor - a
     contrast to the blue helmet seen earlier.

                             YURI (V.O.)
                 ...and ecstacy.

     YURI and VITALY are getting it on with two SALES GIRLS.

     We pan from one couple in the living room, Vitaly, to the one in
     the bedroom, Yuri.

     We focus on Yuri, in the midst of the act - hears his brother's
     moans in Ukrainian.

                             VITALY (O.C.)
                 Boh...Boh.  Oh, Boh! (Subtitle:  God...God.
                 Oh, God!)

     Yuri smiles at Vitaly's cries.  Something catches Yuri's eye on TV.

     CLOSE UP OF A TV SCREEN

     showing images of the aftermath of the suicide bombing at the U.S.
     barracks in Lebanon.

                             YURI (V.O.)
                 Vitaly and I found our niche in under-the-
                 counter gunrunning - regimes suffering under
                 sanctions.

     EXT.  STREET - BEIRUT, LEBANON.  DAY.

     A street lined with shelled buildings.

                                                          Beirut, Lebanon - 1986

     Through one of the shell holes, we glimpse YURI and VITALY with a
     LEBANESE CUSTOMER.

                             YURI (V.O.)
                 The job wasn't so different trom the U.N.  I
                 was just as neutral working for the ununited
                 nations.  An equal opportunity "merchant of
                 death", I supplied every army but the
                 Salvation Army.

     We track with them, only getting occasional glimpses through the
     holes as they make their way through the war-torn streets of
     Lebanon.

                             YURI (V.O.)
                 We got our start in Lebanon after the
                 suicide bombing.

     They enter a building carrying a crude rendering of a Coke sign -
     "Taste Life."  The model drinking the Coke is Ava Cordova.

     INT.  BEIRUT WAREHOUSE.  DAY.

     Inside the warehouse is a ten foot high, unruly pile of junked
     weapons.

                             YURI (V.O.)
                 When the United States leaves a war zone,
                 they generally don't take their munitions.
                 It costs more to bring it back than buy new
                 stock.

     YURI and VITALY usher the CUSTOMER over to an industrial scale
     loaded with assorted weapons.

                             YURI
                 I sell by the kilo.

     The CUSTOMER checks the combined weight of the weapons.

                             YURI (cont'd)
                      (shrug)
                 They're second-hand weapons but they're
                 still okay.

     Both men pullout calculators and start haggling over the price.

                             YURI (V.O.)
                 For all my language skills, I soon
                 discovered that what talks best is money.
                 As long as you can speak dollars, dinars,
                 drachmas, rubles, rupees, pesos, escudos,
                 lira, krones, kwanzas, trancs, guilders,
                 deutshmarks, yen and pounds-fucking-
                 sterling, you can communicate anywhere in
                 the world.

     Money is finally exchanged.  Yuri and Vitaly leave the Customer with
     his munitions pot-pourri.

     EXT.  BEIRUT WAREHOUSE.  DAY.

     CLOSE ON a row of military decorations on an army jacket.

     U.S. Army Officer, COLONEL OLIVER SOUTHERN, in dress uniform,
     adjusts the ribbons on his chest in the side mirror of a U.S.
     armored personnel carrier.

     YURI approaches.  In full view, he hands the Colonel a cut of the
     money.

     The Colonel places the money in the same pocket decorated with
     ribbons.

     EXT.  STREET - BEIRUT, LEBANON.  DAY.

     YURI and VITALY walk back along the shelled street, Yuri recounting
     what's left of the money.

                             YURI
                      (irritated by the meager amount)
                 This is bullshit money, Vit - small fucking
                 potatoes.

                             VITALY
                 What do we do, go more legitimate?

                             YURI
                 No.  More illegal.

     Vitaly nods thoughtfully.

                             VITALY
                 What I'd give right now for a plate of red
                 cabbage and potatoes.

     The wall explodes with gunfire.

     Yuri and Vitaly drop to the ground, money flying.

     The machine gun fire subsides, a shower of dust, fragments of brick
     and hundred dollar bills still floating to the ground.

     Vitaly, first to recover, draws his own handgun, sneaks a look
     through a shell hole.

     On the other side of the wall, a firing squad of MILITIAMEN has
     executed one group of MEN, lying contorted, slumped against the
     wall.  Their bound hands and feet give the bodies a macabre
     awkwardness.

     Yuri is scrabbling in the dust for the cash.

     The Militiamen prepare to execute another six men.  Men?  We focus
     on one HANDSOME YOUNG LEBANESE BOY, barely in his teens.

     Vitaly, gun poised, goes to intervene.  A HAND, stuffed with cash,
     stops him.  Yuri.

     The brothers' eyes meet.

                             YURI
                      (whisper, motioning for them
                       to leave)
                 It's not our fight.

     Vitaly's eyes well with tears.

     After one look back to the teenage boy, Vitaly reluctantly complies
     - running with Yuri, heads down, away from the scene.

     As they run, the wall explodes again with gunfire.

     CLOSE ON RONALD REAGAN

     - a cardboard cut-out planted in a sand dune.

     YURI and VITALY carry a crate from a taxi onto the desert floor in
     Somalia.  A group of MUSLIM FREEDOM FIGHTERS eagerly surround the crate -
     Yuri hands the Leader an Uzi machine gun.

                             YURI (V.O.)
                 I sold Israeli-made Uzis to Muslims.

     The Muslim Leader tests it - shooting up the cardboard REAGAN.

     His fighters applaud, Yuri and Vitaly slightly embarrassed.

     EXT.  HIMALAYAS.  DAY.

     A helicopter strains in the thin air to land on the Siachen Glacier
     in the Himalayas.

     YURI and VITALY, in thick parkas, emerge from the helicopter into
     near-blizzard conditions.

                             YURI (V.O.)
                 I sold to both Pakistan and India in their
                 fight tor the most inhospitable land on
                 earth.

     INDIAN TROOPS, unseen at first due to their white camouflage
     uniforms, descend on the chopper - eager to unload the new guns and
     ammunition.

     Yuri gasps for breath in the thin air.  An INDIAN SOLDIER gives Yuri
     a hit of oxygen as Vitaly supervises the unloading.

                             YURI
                 How's it going?

                             INDIAN COMMANDER
                      (admiring a new gun)
                 We're making terrific progress - most
                 casualties from avalanches and frostbite.

                             YURI
                      (uncertain smile)
                 Make sure you thaw out the guns before you fight.

     Yuri nods, takes another hit of oxygen.

     EXT.  BORDER TOWN - CONGO.  DAY.

     The town is deserted.  YURI and VITALY are confused as they prepare
     to unload an arms consignment from a truck.

                             YURI (V.O.)
                 We had our set-backs.  It's not called
                 gunrunning for nothing.

     Up the street, a celebration is taking place - a band, balloons,
     confetti, dancing.

     Finally, a Congolese man, JOHN "CANNIBAL" NGAWE, appears at the
     warehouse.

     The conversation is in French.

                             YURI
                      (from the boat)
                 Cannibal, what's going on?

                             CANNIBAL
                 Cease fire, man.  Cease fire.  It's over.

                             YURI
                 What?!  What do you mean it's over?

                             CANNIBAL
                 Truce.  We're friends, man.

                             YURI
                      (looking to his unopened crates,
                       more and more agitated)
                 Friends?!  You can't be fucking friends.
                 Last week I spoke to you on the phone.  You
                 said you would not rest until every last
                 rebel was dead.  You called them vermin.
                 You said would piss in their mouths, you
                 said you would exterminate them like
                 cockroaches.  Just last week, you said this!

                             CANNIBAL
                      (shrug)
                 That was last week, man.

     Cannibal starts to walk away.

                             YURI
                 Cannibal, don't you fucking walk away from
                 me!

     Cannibal flashes Yuri a peace sign.

                             CANNIBAL
                 Peace, man!

                             YURI
                 Fuck you, Cannibal!!

     Yuri looks to Vitaly.

                             VITALY
                      (referring to the truck)
                 Maybe we can offload it - the Balkans.

                             YURI
                      (nodding in agreement)
                 At least when they say they're going to have
                 a war, they keep their word.

     EXT.  NORTHERN AFGHANISTAN.  DAY.

     YURI and VITALY stand at a checkpoint in the rugged mountains.  Guns and
     ammunition are strapped to donkeys tended by MUJAHIDEEN FIGHTERS.  An
     AFGHANI OFFICIAL inspects the cargo.

                             YURI (V.O.)
                 I even shipped cargo to Afghanistan when
                 they were still fighting fellow Russians.
                 But I never sold to Osama bin Laden.  Not
                 for any moral grounds.  Back then he was
                 always bouncing checks.

                             AFGHANI OFFICIAL
                 I hope you're not thinking of selling these,
                 Mr. Orlov.

                             YURI
                      (shakes his head)
                 Personal use.

                             AFGHANI OFFICIAL
                 There's a hundred thousand bullets here.

                             YURI
                 I'm kind of trigger happy.

     Vitaly hands the Official his documentation - clipped to it, a thick
     wad of bills.

     The Afghani Official smiles.  He returns to his mud-brick border
     station beside the confiscated merchandise.

     Yuri focuses on a swimsuit calendar hanging on the mud wall - Miss
     May is AVA CORDOVA.

                             YURI (V.O.)
                 And everywhere I went, Ava Cordova kept
                 following me around.  We were as
                 international as each other.

     EXT.  FREIGHTER SHIP.  DAY.

     We tilt up from the water to find YURI on the deck of a freighter,
     ploughing the ballpoint blue seas off the coast of Colombia.

                                            North of Barranquilla, Colombia - 1989


                             YURI (V.O.)
                 Operations like mine provided the only way
                 for certain regimes to conduct a respectable
                 war.

     VITALY holds onto a railing trying to stave off seasickness, not
     helped by standing downwind from Yuri's cigarette smoke.

                             YURI (V.O.)
                 The freighter I was standing on carried 113
                 tons of weapons and ammunition for delivery
                 to one of the poorest nations in Latin
                 America in direct contravention of half a
                 dozen international arms embargoes.

     Yuri makes a call on his cell phone.

                             YURI (V.O.)
                 To keep authorities in the dark, I often spoke
                 in code.  Rocket launchers were "mothers", the
                 rockets "children".  Assault rifles were
                 "apples".  The AK-47 was "the Angel King".

                             YURI
                      (into phone)
                 The Angel King will arrive
                 tomorrow...Hallelujah to you too.

     Yuri hangs up.  His phone rings with an incoming call.

                             YURI (cont'd)
                     (into phone)
                 Yes?...Slow the fuck down--what do you mean,
                 tipped off?  They know where we are?!  Where
                 are they?!

     Yuri grabs a pair of binoculars.  On the horizon, a fast-approaching
     speed boat - INTERPOL AGENTS visible on the racer's deck.

                             YURI (cont'd)
                      (hanging up)
                 Forget it.

     VITALY and the CAPTAIN, also spying the Customs Boat, join Yuri at
     the railing.

                             CAPTAIN
                 Do we run?

                             VITALY
                 We have to get out of here.

                             YURI
                 No, no-one's going anywhere.
                      (to the Captain)
                 Slow--dead slow.  Buy me time.

     Yuri swings into action, frantically dials another number on his
     satellite cell phone.

                             YURI (cont'd)
                      (barking an order to a CREWMAN, referring
                       to the Panamanian flag)
                 Get that fucking rag down!

     The CREWMAN hastily complies.  Yuri's call is answered.

                             YURI (cont'd)
                      (trying not to sound too
                       desperate)
                 It's Yuri.  I need another handle for this
                 tub...something in our weight class.
                      (to an elderly Latin PAINTER,
                       pointing to the stern)
                 You, over the side!
                      (the painter hesitates)
                 Now!

     The terrified PAINTER makes for the stern where he's hurriedly
     winched over.

     Yuri returns to the phone call.

                             YURI (cont'd)
                 Yes, it's got to check out...you got a
                 shorter name!...what?--Kono?  How do you
                 spell that?...K-O-N-O.  That's good!

     He hangs up.

                             YURI (cont'd)
                      (to the PAINTER, already blacking
                       out the name, KRISTOL)
                 Kono!  K-O-N-O.

     The PAINTER, nods nervously from his precarious perch, starts to
     paint.

     Yuri sneaks another look through his binoculars.  The Customs Boat
     is closing fast.

                             YURI (cont'd)
                      (back into phone)
                 What are we flying?...Dutch?  Later.
                      (hanging up, to Vitaly)
                 Vit, get me a Dutch flag!

     Yuri checks the Customs Boat again.

                             YURI (cont'd)
                 Damn, they're hauling!

     He checks the Painter's progress.

                             YURI (cont'd)
                      (agitated, grasping the line of
                       the scaffold)
                 Faster!  Or I send you in!
                      (checking the binoculars again)
                 Faster...and better!

     The Painter's hand is shaking.

                             VITALY (O.C.)
                      (panicked)
                 Yuri!

     Vitaly is frantically rummaging through a trunk containing dozens of
     national flags.

                             VITALY (cant' d)
                 I don't have Dutch.

                             YURI
                 What?!

                             VITALY
                 I've got Belgium.

                             YURI
                 What the fuck use is that?!
                      (panicked, gesturing to the stern)
                 He's painting a name registered in the
                 fucking Netherlands!

     Vitaly winces.

                             YURI (cont'd)
                      (mind racing)
                 You got France?!

                             VITALY
                      (confused, finding the tricolor)
                 Yes, why?

                             YURI
                 Turn it on its side.

     Vitaly turns the flag sideways - now a makeshift Dutch flag.  Vitaly
     nods, impressed.

     Yuri looks forward.  The Customs Boat has almost reached the bow of
     the freighter.

     The flag is hoisted.  The Painter, barely completing the last "O" of
     "KONO", is hauled back on deck.

                             YURI (cont'd)
                 That's it!  Everybody look innocent--now!

     The CREW resume their normal duties as the Customs Boat slows to a
     crawl itself, at close quarters with the freighter.

     The heavily-armed INTERPOL AGENTS eyeball the rusted vessel.

     YURI focuses on the senior agent - JACK VALENTINE.  While the other
     agents wear sunglasses, long hair, tattoo or personalized uniform,
     Valentine is completely by the book.  His Interpol windbreaker clean
     and zipped to the neck.

                             YURI (V.O.)
                 They say every man has his price - but not
                 every man gets it.  Interpol Agent, Jack
                 Valentine, couldn't be bought, at least not
                 with money.  For Jack, glory was the prize.

     The Customs Boat ominously circles the freighter like a hungry
     shark.

     EXT.  INTERPOL BOAT.  DAY.

     VALENTINE never averts his eyes from the ship.

                             VALENTINE
                 Not exactly "The Love Boat".

     Another AGENT hands him a phone.

                             VALENTINE (cont'd)
                      (into phone)
                 It's clean?...It doesn't look clean.  I'm
                 boarding.

     EXT.  FREIGHTER / INTERPOL BOAT.  DAY.

     From the railing, YURI watches the Interpol boat draw alongside the
     freighter.  He surreptitiously makes another phone call.

                             YURI
                      (anxious whisper into phone)
                 It's Yuri.  Phone in a sighting of the
                 Kristol south of Aruba.

     The boat is secured to the ladder that runs down the side of the
     freighter.

     VALENTINE checks his sidearm, climbs the ladder.

     EXT.  DECK - FREIGHTER.  DAY.

     Yuri spies a life ring emblazoned with the word "KRISTOL".  He flips
     it around as Valentine and the other agents board.

     Valentine strides past Yuri to a container, nods to an agent to open
     it.  The large metal door opens to reveal a large container full of
     grain - grain spilling onto the deck.

     Valentine is about to plunge his hand into the grain when a mobile
     phone rings.

     A CREWMAN calls to Valentine from the bridge of the Interpol boat.

                             AGENT
                      (referring to the phone)
                 Sir, sighting of the Kristol due north.

     Valentine hesitates, returns to the ladder.

     As the agents go, they fail to see the pile of grain shift in the
     container exposing a crate of assault rifles hidden there.

     EXT.  RAILING - FREIGHTER.  DAY.

     Yuri and Vitaly watch the Interpol boat leap away.

     On the FREIGHTER, we focus on the terrified PAINTER standing beside Yuri -
     a pool of urine appears from the trouser leg.

     Yuri pretends not to notice, slaps the Painter on the back.

                             YURI
                 Nice job.

     CLOSE ON the word, "KONO".  From the "O", a paint drop runs down the
     stern.

     EXT.  BARRANQUILLA HARBOR, COLOMBIA.  DAY.

     YURI and VITALY supervise the unloading of the freighter from the
     dockside.

     They are alerted by the sound of a battle raging somewhere on the
     outskirts of the docks.

     A Jeep, full to overflowing with heavily-armed NARCO-GUERRILLAS
     suddenly appears at the far end of the dock and speeds towards them.

     A military vehicle full of COLOMBIAN SOLDIERS chases the Guerrillas
     several hundred yards behind.

     The Jeep full of Guerrillas screeches to a stop by the freighter.
     The NARC LEADER grabs a box of unloaded ammunition.

                             YURI
                      (in Spanish)
                 Hey, pay before you play.

                             NARC LEADER
                      (in Spanish)
                 You're late.

     The Leader smashes the box on the concrete - bullets spilling
     everywhere.

                             VITALY
                 Hey, fuck you!

                             NARC LEADER
                      (jamming his handgun in Vitaly's
                       eye socket)
                 Fuck you!

     Yuri tries to play peacemaker.

                             YURI
                      (reasoning with the Narc Leader)
                 No, you don't fuck him--

     The Narc Leader turns and shoots Yuri in the side.

     Yuri shudders with the impact.  The enraged Vitaly lunges towards
     the Leader but Yuri, despite his wound, holds him back.

                             YURI (cont'd)
                 No, Vit.  No.
                      (to the Leader, referring to the
                       bullets)
                 Help yourselves.  Free sample.

     Vitaly nurses Yuri to the ground.

     The GUERRILLAS ignore them, frantically re-load just in time,
     immediately start shooting at the approaching government vehicle.

     The government vehicle throws a vicious 180, almost toppling over.

     The Guerillas, now back in business, take off after the government
     troops.

     Yuri lies on the dock, genuinely surprised by the sight of his own
     blood.

                             YURI (V.O.)
                 The first and most important rule of
                 gunrunning is never get shot with your own
                 merchandise.

     INT.  WAREHOUSE - BARRANQUILLA, COLOMBIA.  DAY.

     YURI, now heavily bandaged around the waist, and VITALY keep a
     watchful eye as the NARC LEADER inspects crates of machine guns and
     other ammunition.

                             YURI (V.O.)
                 The second rule is always ensure you have a
                 foolproof way to get paid.  Credit card,
                 check, cash.  Preferably in advance, ideally
                 to an off-shore account.  It's why I choose
                 my customers so carefully.  Say what you
                 like about warlords and dictators, they tend
                 to have a highly developed sense of order.
                 They always pay their bills on time.

     The Narc Leader nods his approval.

                             NARC LEADER
                      (referring to Yuri's wound)
                 I apologize for earlier.

                             YURI
                      (slight wince)
                 I understand.

     WORKERS start loading the crates into a truck.  The Narc Leader
     hands Yuri the suitcase.

                             NARC LEADER
                 It's all there.

     Yuri snaps open the suitcase - inside six kilos of cocaine.

                             YURI
                 What is this?

                             NARC LEADER
                 Six keys of pure.

                             YURI
                     (incredulous)
                 I can't hand this to my fucking bank teller
                 at Chase Manhattan.

                             NARC LEADER
                      (hair-trigger temper flaring
                       again)
                 You should be thanking me.
                      (waving his cell phone)
                 Have you checked the street price today?
                 With the seizures at the border last week,
                 it's jumped thirty percent.

                             YURI
                 I sell guns.  I don't sell drugs.

                             NARC LEADER
                      (shrug)
                 Diversify.

     The Narc Leader walks away.

                             YURI
                      (calling after him)
                 I've got standards.

     The Narc Leader ignores him, climbs in his Jeep and drives off.  The
     truck, loaded with munitions, also exits.

     Yuri and Vitaly are left alone in their warehouse.

                             VITALY
                      (staring at their "remuneration")
                 Now what?

     Yuri shrugs, slices open one of the packs of cocaine.  He takes a
     bill from his pocket, rolls it into a tube.

     He goes to hand Vitaly the tube but his brother has already rolled
     his own.

     Vitaly dips his tube into the coke - snorts, keeps snorting - a
     longer inhale than should be possible for a human being.

     INT.  HOTEL ROOM - BARRANQUILLA, COLOMBIA.  NIGHT.

     Six kilo-sized coffee cans.  YURI, still bandaged, is pouring the
     coffee down the toilet and replacing it with the bags of cocaine,
     mumbling Ukrainian profanities as he works.

     The last bag is missing.

                             YURI
                      (sighs, exasperated)
                 Vit.

     INT.  HOTEL HALLWAY.  NIGHT.

     In the hotel corridor, YURI discovers the door to the adjacent room wide
     open.

     Inside, the room is vacant.

     INT.  BOLIVIAN BUS.  DAY.

     YURI, clearly fuming, is standing in a standing-roam-only Bolivian
     public bus along with an assortment of PEASANTS, MIGRANTS and
     FARMYARD ANIMALS.

     On the wall of the bus Yuri notices a cellphone ad featuring AVA
     CORDOVA.

                             YURI (V.O.)
                 I found Vitaly twelve days, two thousand
                 miles and 150 grams later in a Bolivian
                 boarding house.

     INT.  VITALY'S ROOM - BOARDING HOUSE.  LA PAZ, BOLIVIA.  DAY.

     The outline of Ukraine drawn with cocaine.

     VITALY, out of his mind, pupils the size of nickels, humming a
     Ukrainian folk tune, is putting the finishing touches to the map
     from his badly depleted bag of cocaine.

     with him, two BOLIVIAN PROSTITUTES, who appear to have passed out or
     worse.

     A pounding on the door.

                             YURI (O.C.)
                 Vitaly!  Open this fucking door!

     Vitaly, absorbed with the task at hand, appears not to notice.  Yuri
     breaks in the door.

                             VITALY
                      (happy - way too happy)
                 Yuri!
                      (to the comatose prostitutes)
                 It's my brother, Yuri.  He's my big brother.

     Yuri stares at the cocaine map.

                             YURI
                 What the fuck is that?

                             VITALY
                 Ukraine.
                      (indicating the direction he is
                       going to snort)
                 I start in Odessa, work my way to the
                 Crimea--

                             YURI
                      (staring at the map, appalled)
                 --You'll be fucking dead before you reach
                 Kiev.

     Yuri opens a window, the cocaine blows off the table.

                             VITALY
                 You fuck!

     Vitaly freaks out, slams the window so hard it shatters.  (The
     Hookers still don't rouse.)

                             VITALY (cant'd)
                 You fucking fuck!

     Vitaly desperately tries to snort the cocaine out of the shag pile
     carpet - the straw constantly clogging with carpet fibers.

     Blood oozes from Vitaly's nostril.  Yuri gazes down at his pathetic
     brother.

     EXT.  ST. JOSEPH'S DRUG REHAB CLINIC.  DAY.

     An exclusive rehab center.  A title appears:

                                                  Upstate New York - 1989

     YURI's car pulls up outside, Vitaly in the passenger seat.

                             YURI
                 Get out of the car.

     Vitaly doesn't budge.

                             YURI (cont'd)
                 I promised our parents.

                             VITALY
                      (desperate eyes)
                 Please.

                             YURI
                 Vitaly, you're going to have a good time.
                 This is a top place.  Two Ford models
                 checked in last week and that cute weather
                 girl's been here since July.

                             VITALY
                 Please.

     Yuri relents, pours a gram onto the dashboard.  Vitaly snorts it off
     the dash.

                             VITALY
                      (as he wipes his nose)
                 You're a good brother.

     Vitaly kisses Yuri.

     Two ORDERLIES open the car door, escort Vitaly away.

     Yuri watches his brother in the rearview mirror - shepherded up the
     path.

                             YURI (V.O.)
                 I never understood what separated the
                 recreational drug user from the habitual,
                 the functional addict from the
                 dysfunctional.  But for the grace of God, it
                 could have been me snorting lines as long as
                 the Belt Parkway.

     INT.  CATHOLIC CHURCH - BRIGHTON BEACH.  DAY.

     IRINA lights a candle in front of the Virgin Mary.

                             YURI (V.O.)
                 Vitaly never got completely clean despite
                 the prayers of my mother...

     INT.  SYNAGOGUE - BRIGHTON BEACH.  DAY.

     ANATOLY prays in front of the menorah.

                             YURI (V.O.)
                 ...and father.  In fact, my younger brother
                 was the only reason my father ever had to
                 question his new religion.

     INT.  AIR MAROC JETLINER.  DAY.

     An EXECUTIVE sits in his Business Class seat.  On the tray table in
     front of him, calculator and spreadsheets.

                             YURI (V.O.)
                 After Colombia I became a one-man-operation.
                 A sole proprietor as you say on your tax
                 return - that is if you're foolish enough to
                 fill one out.

     He exchanges a collegial smile with YURI who has similar
     entrepreneurial paraphernalia in front of him.

                             YURI (V.O.)
                 By then I'd mastered my craft.  Selling arms
                 is not so different to selling vacuum
                 cleaners.  You advertise, pound the
                 pavement, take orders.

     The businessman's smile dissolves when he catches a glance at the
     brochure lying next to Yuri's "Day-Runner" - glossy photos of
     GRENADE LAUNCHERS.

     A MONTAGE OF SCENES - ILLUSTRATING THE ANATOMY OF AN ARMS DEAL.

     It takes place in an unidentified country in North Africa.

                             YURI (V.O.)
                 Of course, a good arms dealer also has to be
                 a political scientist.  I go by a seven-step
                 approach.

     YURI gets off a plane.

                             YURI (V.O.)
                 One: identity a government and an opposition
                 where the opposition is ignored.

     YURI immediately picks up a newspaper, eager for the latest news.

                             YURI (V.O.)
                 Two: Wait for a radical group to break away
                 from the opposition.

     YURI is buoyed by the front page news, over-tips the NEWSPAPER
     SELLER.

                             YURI (V.O.)
                 Three: Immediately approach the radical
                 group and offer them arms.

     YURI meets a group of REVOLUTIONARIES in a backstreet bar, shows
     them an arms catalogue.

                             YURI (V.O.)
                 Four: Whether they buy or not, inform the
                 government that the radical group approached
                 you and offer the government arms.

     YURI meets a GOVERNMENT OFFICIAL in the parliament buildings, shows
     him the same catalogue.

                             YURI (V.O.)
                 Five: Whether they buy or not, re-approach
                 the radical group and offer them more arms
                 but now at a higher price.  Increasing
                 tension is a means of generating demand and
                 the ideal situation is to sell to both
                 sides.

     YURI meets the REVOLUTIONARIES a second time in the same bar - this
     time they are more enthusiastic and Yuri has his calculator out.

                             YURI (V.O.)
                 Six: If they start shooting at each other,
                 the escalation is underway.

     YURI, now accompanied by bodyguards, is escorted into the government
     buildings, where he's given a fat envelope.

     Back at the bar, YURI is given an even fatter envelope.

                             YURI (V.O.)
                 They are consuming small arms and ammunition
                 and the cash register is well and truly
                 ringing.

     YURI stands at his hotel window, sneaking a look through grimy
     venetian blinds.  A street battle is taking place.

     However, in Yuri's mind the sound of the gunshots is gradually
     replaced by the sound ot a cash register.  Each time a gun is fired,
     the register rings.

     Yuri shuts the window.

                             YURI (V.O.)
                 Seven: Don't forget that the success of a
                 radical group in one country can inspire a
                 radical group in a neighboring country.

     Yuri boards a plane, taking off for a new conflict zone.

     INT.  AIR MAROC JETLINER.  DAY.

     YURI leans back in his Business Class seat - eyes closed.  They
     suddenly blink open.  He feels someone watching him.

     Sure enough, he is face-to-face with AVA CORDOVA - staring at him
     from a magazine cover in the seat pocket next to him.

     INT.  MODEL AGENCY.  DAY.

     A gallery of MODELS from the late-eighties on VOGUE, HARPER'S
     BAZAAR, ELLE magazine covers, blown-up and framed on a white wall.

     An AGENT with a window-office overlooking Park Avenue talks on the
     phone.  In front of her, the headshot of AVA CORDOVA.

                             AGENT
                      (into phone)
                 --There's really no one else you'd consider?
                 Christie and Brooke are both available...not
                 the right look?  It's just that Ava doesn't
                 generally do print.

     The agent examines an envelope stuffed with cash.

                             AGENT (cont'd)
                 However, since you are willing to double her
                 rate and pay cash in advance.  She loves
                 working with Herb and you say the campaign
                 will only be seen in Asia?
                      (examining a first class plane ticket
                       Destination: St. Barts)
                 I certainly can't see her objecting to the
                 location.
                      (inspecting an itinerary)
                 What is the product again...?

     INT.  ARMS SHOW CONVENTION HALL.  DAY.

     YURI talks on a phone as he browses at an arms show.  He stops at a
     display of handguns.

                             YURI
                      (into phone)
                 The product?  Er,...Colt .45.
                      (a beat)
                 The beer.

     INT.  EDEN ROCK HOTEL - ST. BARTHELEMY, FRENCH CARIBBEAN.  DAY.

     An idyllic beachfront hotel.

     AVA CORDOVA enters an empty reception area.  The RECEPTIONIST hands
     her a fax - Ava's face falls.

     YURI sits by the deserted pool, observing her entrance.

                             YURI (V.O.)
                 It cost me twenty for the fake booking,
                 another twelve to buy out the hotel.  You
                 can't force someone to tall in love with you
                 but you can sure make ita damn sight
                 easier.

     INT.  HOTEL RESTAURANT.  DUSK.

     A large restaurant overlooking the ocean.

     AVA and YURI are the only guests, both eating alone.  They make eye-
     contact - exchange polite smiles.

     EXT.  PRIVATE BEACH.  DAY.

     AVA strolls down to the beach, deserted, save for YURI - sunbathing
     some distance away on one of the hundred empty sunbeds.

     Ava dives into the water.  Behind his sunglasses, Yuri watches her.

     LATER

     Towelling off on a sunbed of her own, Ava glances over to Yuri.  It
     seems crazy not to speak to each other.  Ava breaks the ice.

                             AVA
                      (calling to Yuri)
                 Popular hotel, huh?

     Yuri smiles.  Ava approaches, extends a hand.

                             AVA (cont'd)
                 Ava Cordova.

                             YURI
                 Yuri Orlov.  What brings you to St. Barts?

                             AVA
                 A photo shoot.  At least, that was the plan.
                 But the photographer's plane got stuck in
                 Miami.  Hurricane - though there was nothing
                 in the news.

                             YURI
                      (gazing out at the ocean)
                 Those things can come out of nowhere.

                             AVA
                 The job's cancelled and there's no flight
                 back to New York 'til Tuesday.

     Yuri pretends to ponder her predicament.

                             YURI
                 You can hitch a ride with me if you like.

     Ava regards him cautiously - likes what she sees.

                             YURI (cont'd)
                      (picking up his own camera)
                 In the meantime, why don't I take your
                 picture?

     Ava smiles, poses playfully for him.

                             YURI (V.O.)
                 In my experience some of the most successful
                 relationships are founded on lies and
                 deceit.  Since that's where they usually end
                 up anyway, it's a logical place to start.

     EXT.  ST. BARTHELEMY AIRPORT.  DAY.

     A limousine approaches a Lear jet parked on the tarmac of the one-
     runway airport.  YURI and AVA exit the car.

                             YURI (V.O.)
                 I nearly went broke trying to convince her I
                 was anything but.  I knew Ava was not the
                 kind of woman to be seduced by a ride in a
                 private jet unless you owned the jet.

     CLOSE ON the tail of the jet - the name "ORLOV AIR".

                             AVA
                      (holding her skirt in the wind to
                       protect her modesty)
                 This is your plane?

                             YURI
                      (shrug)
                 That is my name.

     They enter the plane.

                             YURI (V.O.)
                 Of course I was lying.  The plane was a rental,
                 like the car and even the suit I was standing
                 in.  At the last minute, I bribed the crew for
                 the paint-job.

     As the plane picks up speed on the runway, the name "ORLOV" smears.

                             YURI (V.O.)
                 Luckily, by the time we landed, Ava wasn't
                 looking anywhere but in my eyes.

     INT.  LEAR JET.  DAY.

     YURI and AVA sit beside each other on a white leather sofa in the
     customized cabin drinking Cristal champagne.

     Yuri glances through Vogue magazine - a photo spread on Ava.  Ava
     takes in the plane's sumptuous appointments.

                             YURI
                      (pretending to be impressed with
                       the photos)
                 I had no idea.

     He hands her back the magazine.

                             YURI (cant'd)
                 I'm sorry I didn't recognize you.  You must
                 think me very rude.

                             AVA
                 Don't apologize.  I put on clothes for a
                 living.

                             YURI
                      (wry grin)
                 At least you aren't taking them off.

                             AVA
                      (smiling at his irreverence)
                 I would be if half the photographers had
                 their way.
                      (shrug)
                 But I can't complain.  I'm paid to say,
                 "Cheese".
                      (meeting his gaze)
                 What about you?

                             YURI
                 Nothing so glamorous.  I'm in transport -
                 international air freight mostly.

                             AVA
                 What, like UPS or something?

                             YURI
                 Something like that.

                             AVA
                      (glance to her champagne flute)
                 Business is good.

                             YURI
                 Like you, I can't complain.

     They both drink.  A thought occurs to Ava.

                             AVA
                 But if you did?

                             YURI
                 Well...I don't know.
                      (reluctant admission)
                 It's just that I travel all around the world
                 but I can't help feeling sometimes that I'm
                 going nowhere.

     Ava regards him closely.  He's echoed her thoughts.  Yuri pours Ava
     another drink.

                             YURI (cont'd)
                 Here's to...
                      (raising his glass)
                 ...a hurricane.

     They toast.

                             YURI (cont'd)
                 Without it, I'd never have met you.

     She meets his eye.

                             AVA
                 This is no accident, is it, Yuri?

     Yuri freezes - doesn't answer.

                             AVA (cont'd)
                 It feels like fate.

                             YURI
                      (never averting his eyes)
                 I don't believe in fate.

                             AVA
                 What do you believe in?

     Yuri gazes at her a moment - he answers her question with a kiss.
     Ava does not pull away.

     INT.  LEAR JET - BEDROOM.  DAY.

     CLOUDS rush by the faces of YURI and AVA, heads close to the plane's
     oval windows.

     They make love in a wall-to-wall bed built into the rear of the jet.

     The camera moves past the couple through one of the plane's windows,
     and the clouds begin to rain.

     EXT.  ISRAEL CENTRAL TEMPLE - BRIGHTON BEACH.  DAY.

     Confetti.  YURI and AVA run through the paper shower as they descend
     the steps of a synagogue in Brighton Beach.

                             YURI (V.O.)
                 We married in a synagogue to make my father
                 happy.  In the eyes of my Catholic mother,
                 it was worse than living in sin.

     Yuri and Ava kiss his parents, ANATOLY and IRINA.

     As the happy couple reaches the limousine, VITALY - out of rehab and
     out of his mind - fires an AK-47 into the air as a salute.

     The GUESTS drop to the ground - the only ones left standing are Yuri
     and Vitaly.

     Yuri stares daggers at Vitaly, helps Ava to her feet.

                             YURI
                      (explaining to the guests)
                 It's traditional.

                             VITALY
                      (meekly echoing the remark -joke
                       badly misfired)
                 Traditional.

     The guests nod, uncertain.

                             YURI (cant'd)
                 One more time, Vitaly.

     Vitaly lets go another burst.

                             YURI (cont'd)
                      (reassuring word as he whisks Ava
                       into the car)
                 I'm sorry.  I should have said something.

     INT.  UPPER EAST SIDE APARTMENT.  DAY.

     YURI carries AVA over the threshold of their new home to cheers of
     the assembled GUESTS.

     ANATOLY and IRINA gape in amazement at the grand house.  They draw
     their son aside.

                             ANATOLY
                      (touching his yarmulke)
                 Always remember, son, there's something
                 above you.

                             YURI
                      (looking up, gently joking)
                 Sure, Dad.  A forty-thousand dollar crystal
                 chandelier.

     Anatoly forces a smile.  Irina presses a gift into Yuri's hand.

                             YURI (cont'd)
                 Mom, we don't need anything.

                             IRINA
                 You need this.

     Irina takes Anatoly's arm, they walk away.

     Yuri, alone for a moment, opens the package - a small Roman Catholic
     Bible, conveniently bookmarked at the Ten Commandments.

                                                              DISSOLVE TO:

     INT.  UPPER EAST SIDE APARTMENT.  DAY.

     A newborn baby boy, NICOLAI, plays in the wrapping paper of opened
     gifts beneath an extravagantly-decorated Christmas tree.

                                                New York - December 25, 1991


                             YURI (V.O.)
                 I was still living way beyond my means,
                 mortgaged to the hilt, using one credit card
                 to payoff another.  Anything to keep Ava in
                 the style to which she had, thanks largely
                 to me, become accustomed.  Then suddenly all
                 my Christmases came at once.

     A family Christmas - Anatoly, Irina and Ava open gifts.  Baby Nicolai
     wriggles on a blanket, trying to reach a piece of tinsel.

                             ANATOLY
                      (to Irina, regarding a nativity
                       scene on a Christmas card)
                 Jesus was Jewish.  You're worshipping a Jew.

     Irina ignores him.  She regards a gift - a silver goblet set from
     Tiffany's.

                             IRINA
                 Ava, this is too much.

                             AVA
                 Yuri likes to spoil you.

     Nicolai crawls an inch.  AVA beams proudly.

                             AVA
                 Nicki!  You did it.  Good boy!

                             ANATOLY
                 That's my grandson.

     Ava looks around for Yuri.

                             AVA
                      (calling out)
                 Yuri.  Don't you want to see what your son
                 is doing?

     No reply.  Ava wraps the piece of tinsel around the baby's head.

     A loud shout from the other room.

                             YURI (O.C.)
                 Tak!  Tak!  Tak-fucking-tak!  (subtitle:
                 Yes!)

     Ava scoops up the baby.  With Anatoly and Irina, they go to
     investigate.

     On the television, MIKHAIL GORBACHEV, is making his famous speech,
     officially ending the Cold War.

     Yuri kneels in front of the TV as if it is an altar.

                             ANATOLY
                 What the hell's the matter?

                             YURI
                 It's over!  It's over!

                             AVA
                 What's over?

                             YURI
                 The Cold War, the Soviet Union, the Evil
                 Empire.  Mikhail's saying "no mas".  He's
                 throwing in the towel.  It's over.

     Yuri kisses Ava, Nicolai, Anatoly, Irina, kisses the TV.

                             AVA
                 That's nice.
                      (referring to Nicolai)
                 Your son is crawling.

     Yuri's too busy kissing Gorbachev's birthmark.

     He gazes at the TV, revelling in the plan taking shape in his head.

     LATER

     In the living room, AVA and IRINA play with NICOLAI.  YURI and
     ANATOLY drink Johnnie Walker Black label.

                             ANATOLY
                      (contemplating the day's events)
                 At least there'll be religious freedom.

                             YURI
                 I think I'll go back for a visit.
                      (trying to sound casual)
                 Do you stay in touch with Uncle Dmitri?

                             ANATOLY
                      (face lighting up)
                 Dmitri Volkoff?  Now and then.

                             YURI
                 How is he?

                             ANATOLY
                 The luckiest man alive.  You know he was one
                 of the first men at Chernobyl.  Off-duty, at
                 his daughter's wedding, he was roaring
                 drunk.  He was the only one who survived.
                 Later they found that alcohol in your blood
                 resists radiation.

                             YURI
                 He's still a General in the army?

                             ANATOLY
                 Major General.  He got promoted.  Two of his
                 rivals were also there that day.  I told you
                 - he's the luckiest man alive.

                             YURI
                 He may be luckier than you think.

     Yuri goes to pour himself a drink.  Anatoly grabs his son's hand the
     way he did many years earlier.

                             ANATOLY
                      (lowering his voice)
                 We're not fools, Yuri.  What's between you and
                 your wife is your own business but I don't
                 think you're going to Odessa to open a
                 McDonald's.
                      (meeting his son's eye)
                 Is this how you want to be remembered?

                             YURI
                      (shrug)
                 You're only remembered when you're dead.

     Yuri knocks back his vodka, tries to lighten the mood.

                             YURI (cont'd)
                 I'll bring you back some caviar.

                             ANATOLY
                 It's not kosher.

     A crash.  VITALY and a call-girl, ANGEL, dressed in a low-cut fairy
     dress, stumble through the front door - both the worse for drink and
     drugs.

                             VITALY
                 Merry fucking Christmas!

     Angel laughs.  The family gazes at Vitaly and his friend, appalled.

                             ANATOLY
                      (paternal)
                 Vitaly, who is this?

                             ANGEL
                 Angel.

                             VITALY
                 Her name really is Angel.  She's a fairy.
                      (hoisting Angel)
                 Let's stick her on top of the Christmas
                 tree.

     Vitaly and Angel laugh.  No one else does.

     Vitaly collapses on the floor.  Nicolai cries.

                             VITALY (cont' d)
                      (at a loss for anything better)
                 I love you all.

     Yuri firmly escorts Angel to the door and pays her off.

     EXT.  ST. JOSEPH'S DRUG REHAB CLINIC - UPSTATE NEW YORK.  DAY.

     YURI drops VITALY back at the exclusive rehab center.

     By now Yuri knows the routine.  He pours a gram onto the dashboard.

                             YURI
                 I'm going back to Ukraine.

     Vitaly snorts it off the dash.

                             VITALY
                      (maudlin)
                 I miss Odessa.  I miss you.

                             YURI
                 I miss you too.

     Vitaly kisses Yuri.

                             VITALY (cont'd)
                      (meeting his brother's eye)
                 Be careful, Yuri.  Those things you sell,
                 kill...
                      (tapping Yuri's chest where his
                       heart should be)
                 ...inside.

     Two ORDERLIES open the car door, escort Vitaly away.  Yuri stares
     after Vitaly.

     INT.  UPPER EASTSIDE APARTMENT.  DAY.

     AVA and NICKI kiss YURI goodbye.

     EXT./INT.  PUBLIC STORAGE FACILITY - MANHATTAN.  MORNING.

     YURI enters a public storage facility, opens a locker with a
     combination lock.

                             YURI (V.O.)
                 There's no problem leading a double life.
                 It's the triple and quadruple lives that get
                 you in the end.

     He produces several passports from the locker, shuffles the
     passports like playing cards.

                             YURI (V.O.)
                 Back then I carried a French, British, Israeli and
                 Ukrainian passport and a student visa for the
                 U.S., but that's another story.

     The locker also contains five identical briefcases - presumably he
     can tell them apart.

                             YURI (V.O.)
                 I also packed five different briefcases
                 depending on the region of the world I was
                 visiting.

     EXT.  BORDER CHECKPOINT - IZMAYIL, UKRAINE.  DAY.

     Light snow falls.  YURI, driving a brand new Mercedes, waits in a
     long line of cars at the border.

                                                Izmayil, Ukraine - January, 1992


                             YURI (V.O.)
                 The end of the Cold War was the beginning of
                 the hottest time in arms dealing.  The Wall
                 had fallen.  The arms bazaar was open.
                 Those forty-five years had generated the
                 highest weapons build-up in history.  The
                 Soviets had tanks and guns coming out the
                 demon hole - huge stockpiles and now no
                 enemy.

     A Border Guard approaches Yuri's car window.

                             BORDER GUARD
                      (in English, checking Yuri's
                       passport)
                 Visa?

     Yuri hands the Guard his passport.  Inside, a credit card
     emblazoned, "VISA".

     The guard smiles.

                             BORDER GUARD (cont'd)
                 Cash or check only.

     Yuri smiles, hands him several U.S. bills.  Yuri's passport is
     promptly stamped.  He is waved past the line of cars.

                             YURI
                 It's good to be home.

     EXT.  ODESSA MILITARY BASE.  DAY.

     YURI, briefcase in hand, meets his Uncle DMITRI at a barracks.  (NB:
     Dmitri always carries a hip flask of vodka as if there is a constant
     threat of radiation poisoning.)

                             DMITRI
                 Nephew, come here and hug the luckiest man
                 alive.

     The General gives him a great bear hug.  Dmitri registers the
     apprehensive look on Yuri's face.

                             DMITRI (cont'd)
                 What?  Did you think I'd be glowing?  Don't
                 worry.  You can't catch it.

     Yuri kisses Dmitri on the cheek to reassure him.  Over his shoulder,
     Dmitri notices the car.

                             DMITRI
                      (referring to the car)
                 This is the SLK?

                             YURI
                 0 - 60 in 4.8.

     Dmitri is impressed.

     INT.  ODESSA MILITARY BASE - OFFICE.  DAY.

     YURI has a stack of VCR's, cartons of cigarettes, Johnnie Walker
     Black Label on the table in front of DMITRI who drinks from his hip
     flask throughout the conversation.

                             DMITRI
                 I can't just sell you government property,
                 Yuri.  I have to report--

                             YURI
                 --Report to who?  Moscow?  As of last week
                 Moscow is in a foreign country.

                             DMITRI
                      (shrug)
                 New flag, new boss.

                             YURI
                 There is no new boss yet.  They're too busy
                 squabbling over who gets the presidential
                 holiday home at the Black Sea.

     Dmitri can't deny it.

                             YURI (cont'd)
                      (talking like an evangelist)
                 It's beautiful.  The ones who know don't
                 care any more.  The ones who care don't
                 know.
                      (nodding to a safe built
                       into the floor)
                 Show me your inventory.

     Dmitri hesitates, knocks back his vodka, then opens the safe -
     produces a document.

     INT.  ODESSA MILITARY BASE - ARMORY.  DAY.

     Crates of machine guns from floor to ceiling.  DMITRI gives YURI a
     tour of the armory.

                             YURI
                 How many Kalashnikovs do you have?

                             DMITRI
                      (referring to the inventory in
                       his hand)
                 40,000.

                             YURI
                      (looking over Dmitri's shoulder)
                 Is that a "4"?  It doesn't look like a "4"
                 to me.  It looks more like a "1".

                             DMITRI
                      (missing the point)
                 No, it's a "4".

                             YURI
                 It's whatever we say it is because no one
                 else knows the difference.

     Dmitri finally gets it.  Yuri examines a Kalashnikov.

                             YURI (cont'd)
                 10,000 Kalashnikovs for a battalion.  Your
                 stocks are dangerously depleted, Dmitri.
                 You should order more from the factory.

     This is too much for Dmitri.  He stops, confronts Yuri - takes back
     the AK-47 Yuri is inspecting.

                             DMITRI
                 Someone will work this out, Yuri.  What
                 happens then?

                             YURI
                      (shrug)
                 We'll cut them in.  Anyway, what could
                 happen - you're the luckiest man alive.

     EXT.  ODESSA MILITARY BASE.  DUSK.

     The sun sets over a grassy field.  YURI sits alone - closely
     inspects a Kalashnikov.

     It is a strange moment between a man and his favorite gun.

     As we hear Yuri's thoughts, we are treated to lovingly shot close
     ups of the weapon and its features often seen in slow motion:  Sun
     glistening off the chromed barrel.  Folding metal stock arcing
     elegantly into place.  Precise docking of the 30-round curved
     magazine.

                             YURI (V.O.)
                 Avtomat Kalashnikova, model of 1947 - more
                 commonly known as the AK-47 or Kalashnikov.
                 It's the world's most popular assault ritle
                 - a weapon all fighters love.  An elegantly
                 simple nine pound amalgamation of forged
                 steel and molded plastic.  It doesn't break,
                 jam or over-heat.  It will shoot whether its
                 covered in mud or filled with sand.  It's so
                 easy, even a child can use it.  And they do.
                 The Russians put the gun on a coin.
                 Mozambique put it on their flag.  Since the
                 end of the Cold War, the Kalashnikov has
                 become the Russian peoples' greatest export
                 - after that comes vodka and suicidal
                 novelists.  One thing's for sure, no one was
                 lining up to buy their cars.

     We reveal where Yuri is sitting - on the roof of a rusting Russian
     sedan, the Vaz 4-door.  A goat is eating the upholstery.

     Yuri checks on the crates of AK-47's being loaded into a convoy of
     trucks.  In the background, the armory, full a week ago, is now
     virtually empty.  Yuri smiles a satisfied smile.

     His reverie is interrupted by the sound of a car horn.

     A commotion at the gate.  Another large, black Mercedes is parked
     there, DRIVER leaning on the horn.

     YURI smiles as he sees the passenger emerge from the car - SIMEON
     ZAHAROFF.

                             YURI (V.O.)
                 Of course my idea was not entirely unique.
                 I had rivals.

     Simeon angrily confronts the SOLDIER at the gate.

     DMITRI puts on his cap, about to investigate.  YURI stops him.

                             YURI
                 He's a friend of mine.

     Dmitri shrugs and complies.  Yuri strides towards the gate.

     EXT.  ODESSA MILITARY BASE - GATE.  DUSK.

     SIMEON, flanked by two hefty BODYGUARDS, is in the face of a YOUNG
     OFFICER.

     The Officer is flanked by three SOLDIERS, Kalashnikovs resting on
     their hips.

                             SIMEON
                 Do you know who the fuck I am?

                             OFFICER
                      (thick Ukrainian accent)
                 Who the fuck cares who the fuck you are?

                             SIMEON
                 I demand to see your commanding officer.

                             OFFICER
                 You don't demand shit.

     Simeon reconsiders his position.

                             SIMEON
                 Just give me back my papers.

                             OFFICER
                      (papers clearly visible in his
                       hand)
                 What papers?

     The Officer turns on his heel and returns to his guard station with
     the passport, starts watching TV.  The Bodyguards make to follow but
     the Soldiers close ranks, barring their path.

     Simeon fumes.

                             YURI (O.C.)
                 You're late, Simeon.

     YURI breezes past the Soldiers with an easy familiarity.  He enters
     the guard station as if he owns it.

     From beside his car, Simeon watches as Yuri jovially discusses the
     situation with the Young Officer.  After a moment Yuri slips the
     Officer money in exchange for Simeon's passport.

     Yuri emerges from the station and returns the passport to the
     veteran gunrunner.

                             YURI (cont'd)
                 I invited you for a drink once before.
                 Perhaps now you will accept my invitation.

     INT.  ODESSA HOTEL BAR.  NIGHT.

     YURI and SIMEON sit at a table near the back of the bar.  Yuri flirts with
     the BARMAID delivering drinks and a shellfish appetizer.

                             BARMAID
                      (to Yuri, impressed)
                 You sell guns?

                             YURI
                 Maybe you'd like to come to my room and see
                 my bazooka.

     The Barmaid giggles and exits.

     Simeon is clearly disquieted by the change in the balance of power or
     maybe it's the bad early-nineties pop music.  His BODYGUARDS sit
     at the table behind.

                             YURI
                 You look a little lost, Simeon.  Is the
                 world changing too fast?

                             SIMEON
                 I am here, aren't I?

                             YURI
                 Not all of you, I think.

     Simeon's look begs explanation.

                             YURI (cont'd)
                 You've gotten so rich selling for the CIA,
                 you can't get that ideology completely out
                 of your head.  The empire was evil for too
                 long.

     Simeon shrugs.

                             SIMEON
                 I can't deny, it takes some getting used to.
                 Last week we were trying to beat their
                 brains in and now we're going into business
                 together.

                             YURI
                 There's no place in gunrunning for politics
                 anymore, Simeon.  I sell to leftists,
                 rightists.  I'd sell to pacifists but
                 they're not the most regular of customers.

     Yuri leans forward.

                             YURI (cont'd)
                 Of course, you're not a true internationalist
                 until you've supplied weapons to kill your own
                 countrymen.

     Simeon regards the young man with a mixture of fear and admiration pours
     himself another drink.

                             SIMEON
                 I understand you have Ukraine in your pocket
                 but there are the other satellite states.
                 Bulgaria, Hungary, Poland, Belarus.  Instead
                 of cutting each other's throats, it may be
                 more profitable to work together.  What do
                 you think?

     Yuri smiles - the proposal is the victory he has been seeking.

                             YURI
                 I think you are the amateur now.  I think
                 you suffer from a philosophical disadvantage
                 - you have a philosophy.  I think you should
                 go with your instincts - your first
                 instinct.

     Simeon is confused.

                             YURI (cont'd)
                 I am the same man who was not good enough
                 for you before.  I am not good enough for
                 you now.

     Simeon blanches.  Yuri gets up.

     Simeon holds his rival's arm.

                             SIMEON
                 The problem with gunrunners going to war is
                 there's no shortage of ammunition.

     Yuri departs.

     INT.  HOTEL ROOM - ODESSA HOTEL.  NIGHT.

     YURI and the BARMAID never make it to the bed.  Still clothed, they bang
     each other against the door of his hotel room.

                             YURI (V.O.)
                 Back then, it was all for sale...

     EXT.  UKRAINE MILITARY BASE.  DAY.

     Row after row of tanks, armored personnel carriers and helicopter
     gunships in mothballs.

                             YURI (V.O.)
                 Helicopters, torpedo boats, armored
                 personnel carriers, whole tank divisions.

     DMITRI, flask in hand, and YURI are given a tour of the surplus hardware
     by one of Dmitri's brother officers.

                             UKRAINE MAJOR
                      (haggling over the gunships)
                 --I'll tell you what I'll do.  Buy six, you
                 get one free.

                             YURI
                 What about tech support?

                             UKRAINE MAJOR
                 No problem.

     Yuri and Dmitri come upon an oily-faced BOY, perched on the cockpit
     of a helicopter gunship - he wears an ill-fitting uniform, several
     sizes too big.

                             YURI
                 Son, get off there before you get hurt.

                             UKRAINE MAJOR
                      (sheepish)
                 He's the tech support.

                             YURI
                      (incredulous)
                 He's twelve.

                             UKRAINE MAJOR
                 Thirteen.  Almost fourteen.

                             DMITRI
                      (shrug)
                 Kids grow up fast around here.

                             UKRAINE MAJOR
                      (nodding to the gunship)
                 He can take it apart in his sleep.

     Yuri shrugs, shakes the Major's hand.

     EXT.  HILL OVERLOOKING ODESSA HARBOR.  DAY.

     THE POV FROM A PAIR OF BINOCULARS - in the crosshairs, JACK
     VALENTINE, at a surprise checkpoint, staring through binoculars of
     his own.

                             YURI (O.C.)
                 Who are you?

     YURI, on his belly to avoid detection, slithers back to the roadway
     - hands the binoculars to a YOUNG SOLDIER.

     DMITRI stands beside the convoy of trucks parked barely out of view
     of the checkpoint, including Yuri's Mercedes and a huge open-bed
     tractor-trailer carrying a Russian Hind helicopter gunship.

                             YURI (cont'd)
                      (angrily to Dmitri)
                 I thought we were supposed to be watching
                 for these checkpoints.

                             DMITRI
                 How can I?  You keep selling my helicopters.
                 You're too greedy, Yuri.

                             YURI
                      (anxious)
                 We have to go back.

     Dmitri regards the trucks, each one longer than the road is wide.

                             DMITRI
                 We'll be going in reverse.  We can't turn
                 around for a mile.

     The YOUNG SOLDIER on lookout calls to them.

                             YOUNG SOLDIER
                 They're coming.

     Yuri grabs the binoculars.  Sure enough, Valentine and his agents
     are climbing into their Interpol Jeeps and driving towards them.

                             DMITRI
                 We shoot it out?

                             YURI
                      (shaking his head)
                 And start an international fucking incident
                 - no, no, no.

                             DMITRI
                 So we run.

                             YURI
                 No.  I've got paperwork.

                             DMITRI
                      (protesting)
                 Not for the gunship.  Yuri, you know the
                 penalty for sanction-busting - selling a
                 military helicopter?

     Yuri gazes at the Russian Mi-24V helicopter gunship, bristling with
     armaments.

                             YURI
                 It's not a military helicopter.  It's a
                 rescue helicopter.

     Yuri turns to the Boy referred to as "tech support".

                             YURI (cant' d)
                 Get to work, Son.

     The boy pulls a wrench from his pocket.

     SEVERAL MINUTES LATER

     The Interpol Jeeps crest the rise and pull in front of the convoy -
     VALENTINE and his agents exit, guns drawn.

     DMITRI and the UKRAINIAN SOLDIERS stiffen, their weapons also at the
     ready.  An uneasy stand-off.

     YURI gestures for calm.  He greets Valentine warmly - offers his
     hand.

                             YURI
                 Yuri Orlov.

     In reply, an Interpol Agent unceremoniously slams Yuri into the side
     of his truck.

                             VALENTINE
                      (flashing ID)
                 Papers.

     Again Yuri waves off Dmitri and his men, about to come to his aid.
     Yuri courteously hands over his passport and other documentation to
     the skeptical Valentine.

                             VALENTINE (cont'd)
                      (regarding the photo closely)
                 Mr. Orlov, always in the wrong place at the
                 right time.  We've met before.  Off the
                 coast of Colombia.
                      (feigning memory loss)
                 What was the name of that freighter - I
                 can't remember.  Was it the Kono or the
                 Kristol?

                             YURI
                      (hesitates, he's actually forgotten)
                 The crew called that vessel a lot of names - none of
                 them repeatable in polite company.

     Valentine turns his attention to the helicopter - now devoid of its
     weapons.  An Interpol Agent escorts Yuri at gunpoint.

                             YURI (cont'd)
                      (noting to the gun in his ribs)
                 The new MP-5.  Do you need a silencer for
                 that?

     Valentine ignores the banter, inspects Yuri's documentation.

                             VALENTINE
                 The end-user certificate for this aircraft
                 states Burkina Faso.  Nice.  Did you type it
                 yourself?

                             YURI
                 It's for humanitarian missions.

                             VALENTINE
                 You're a humanitarian?

     Yuri shrugs - why not?

                             VALENTINE (cont'd)
                      (not buying it for a second)
                 This is a killing machine.

                             YURI
                 Not any more.

                             DMITRI
                      (in broken English)
                 Listen to the nephew.

     It's true.  Yuri has had the armaments detached.

                             YURI
                 Didn't you get the memo?  The war's over.
                 What can they do with military hardware but
                 convert to civilian use?

                             DMITRI
                 What, yes?

                             YURI
                      (trying to lighten the mood)
                 The only way you could die from this baby is
                 if a food drop hits you.

     Valentine's face hardens at the flippant remark.

     Still at gunpoint, Yuri is escorted to the smaller second truck in
     the convoy.  Stacked inside the container are the helicopter's
     hurriedly removed missiles and the Boy.

                             VALENTINE
                      (referring to the missiles)
                 Also going to Burkina Faso?

                             YURI
                      (pointing to the document)
                 But to a different client at a different
                 address.

     Valentine, incensed, throws Yuri up against the truck himself.

                             VALENTINE
                 What do you take me for?  A complete fucking
                 fool?

                             YURI
                      (eyeing Valentine's gun pressed to
                       his throat)
                 Not complete, Sir.  And while I hesitate to
                 tell you your job, I must point out that
                 when shipped separately the weapons and the
                 aircraft both comply with the current
                 Interpol trade standards and practices.

                             VALENTINE
                      (incredulous)
                 You expect me to believe this is a
                 coincidence?

                             YURI
                 I can see how certain people might interpret
                 it as suspicious but thank God we live in a
                 world where suspicion alone does not
                 constitute a crime.

     Valentine regards Yuri closely - this foe is more formidable than he
     imagined.

     Valentine looks to the gun in his hand, contemplating crossing the
     line.  He finally holsters his gun.

                             VALENTINE
                      (tosses the documents on the road)
                 Yuri Orlov.  You and I are going to be
                 seeing a lot of each other.

                             YURI
                 I can hardly wait.

                             VALENTINE
                      (climbing into his Jeep)
                 Watch out for the time you don't see me.

     Yuri, Dmitri and the Boy watch Valentine speed away.

                             BOY
                      (perfect American accent)
                 What an asshole.

     Yuri looks to the boy, askance - a Yuri in the making.

     EXT.  ODESSA HARBOR.  DAY.

     YURI supervises the loading of the cargo onto a freighter.  Checking
     the empty trucks, he is just in time to see SIMEON and his HENCHMEN
     climb into their car, parked beside his own car, some distance away.

     As he drives off, Simeon and Yuri make brief eye-contact.

     Yuri looks for DMITRI, exiting a nearby restroom - carrying his hip
     flask as usual, the worse for drink.

                             YURI
                      (referring to the departing
                       Simeon)
                 What was he doing here?

                             DMITRI
                      (zipping his pants)
                 Trying to beat your offer.  I sent him on
                 his way.  He doesn't understand the concept
                 of loyalty.

     Dmitri glances at the SOLDIERS around the docks.

                             DMITRI (cont'd)
                 Speaking of loyalty, too many people know.
                 I have to make pay-offs.

                             YURI
                 Don't worry.  There're more VCR's.  I left
                 them in your new car.

     Dmitri's face lights up.  Yuri hands him the keys to the SKL.

                             DMITRI
                 Even your enemy was admiring that car.  I am
                 the luckiest man alive.

     Dmitri hands his hip flask to Yuri.  Yuri watches Dmitri walk to the
     car and climb in for a test drive.

     A look of realization on Yuri's face.

                             YURI
                      (screaming to Dmitri)
                 Dmit--!!!

     The car erupts as if it has been punched by a fist beneath the
     earth.

     Recovered from the blast, Yuri runs up to the burning car but is
     beaten back by the flames.

                                                              DISSOLVE TO:

     EXT.  DOCKS.  NIGHT.

     CLOSE ON a bent Mercedes medallion, now worn around the BOY's neck.
     He regards it forlornly.

     YURI, numb, still carrying Dmitri's hip flask, makes a call from a
     payphone.

     INT.  UPPER EAST SIDE APARTMENT - MANHATTAN.  DAY.

     A darkened bedroom.  AVA is fast asleep in her bed, curled up with
     NICOLAI.

     The phone rings.  Half-asleep, Ava reaches for it.

                             AVA
                      (still groggy)
                 Yes, I'll accept the charges.

     We cut between the two sides of the conversation.

                             YURI
                 Ava--

                             AVA
                 Hey, baby.
                      (glancing to a clock - 3am)
                 You forgotten what time it is?

                             YURI
                 Sorry.  I, er...
                      (talking about anything other than
                       what's on his mind)
                 How was your audition?

                             AVA
                      (resigned smile)
                 They're going in another direction.  The
                 direction of someone who can act.

                             YURI
                 Don't say that.  You're good.

                             AVA
                 And you're biased.

     Ava grabs her robe - goes to the balcony so as not to disturb
     Nicolai.

                             AVA
                      (sensing something amiss)
                 Where are you?  Is everything okay?

                             YURI
                 Rough day at the office.

                             AVA
                 Come home.  We miss you.

                             YURI
                 Soon.
                      (more desperate than he intended)
                 How's Nicki?

                             AVA
                 Asleep in our bed.  It's lonely without you.

     From a bar down the street comes the sound of gunfire - MOBSTERS
     firing at other MOBSTERS escaping in a car.

     Yuri tries to cover the phone but Ava overhears.

                             AVA (cont'd)
                 Yuri, what's that?

                             YURI
                 A party.

                             AVA
                 It's always a party where you are.

     More gunfire interrupts.

                             YURI
                 I'd better go.  I just wanted to call--hear
                 your voice.  Kiss Nicki for me.

                             AVA
                 I love you.

     But Yuri has gone.

     EXT.  ODESSA HARBOR.  DAY.

     The freighter slips out of the harbor.

                             YURI (V.O.)
                 In Ukraine since 1992, $32 billion worth of
                 arms have been stolen and re-sold.  One of
                 the greatest heists of the 20th Century.

     EXT.  DOCKSIDE - MONROVIA.  DAY.

     Crates of munitions are unloaded from the freighter onto waiting
     trucks under YURI's supervision.

                             YURI (V.O.)
                 The primary market was Africa.  Eleven major conflicts
                 involving 32 countries in the past decade - a
                 gunrunner's wet dream.

     Yuri sizes up the MILITIAMEN loading the arms.

                             YURI (V.O.)
                 My best customer was self-declared president
                 of Liberia, Andre Baptiste.  Even though
                 we'd met before, I was in no hurry to meet
                 him again.  He'd gotten a reputation for
                 routinely hacking off the limbs of those who
                 opposed him.  His seven-year civil war has
                 been described as "a relentless campaign of
                 sadistic, wanton violence unimaginable to
                 those unfamiliar with the details of man's
                 capacity to visit the abyss."  That kind of
                 sums up Andy for me.

     As the final truck door is secured, a customized Lincoln
     Continental convertible comes flying around a corner - stereo
     blaring, deliberately terrorizing the locals on the dock.

     The car slides to a stop beside Yuri.  It contains ANDRE BAPTISTE
     JNR., a handsome young man with sunglasses, a mirror for an
     earring and a facial tattoo.  Also in the car, two BODYGUARDS and
     a pair of LIBERIAN TEENAGE GIRLS dressed in Dallas Cowboy
     cheerleader uniforms.

                             ANDRE JNR.
                 Mr. Yuri, I am Andre Baptiste Junior.  My
                 father would like to meet you.

                             YURI
                 Thank him but I have other business.  A busy
                 schedule.

                             ANDRE JNR.
                 It is not optional.  My father is easily
                 offended.

     Yuri ponders for a moment.  The machete in the Bodyguard's hand
     makes up his mind.

                             YURI
                 What do you know?  My schedule just freed up.

     A bodyguard takes Yuri's suitcase.  Yuri is barely in the car before
     it screeches away.

     As the car roars along the highway on the edge of control, we hear
     Yuri's thoughts.

                             YURI (V.O.)
                 But if I thought I was scared of Andre
                 Senior, I knew I was scared of Andre Junior.
                 Like father, like son.  The guava doesn't
                 fall too far from the tree.  He was a heavy-
                 drinker, a womanizer with a penchant for
                 cheerleaders and a lover of fast American
                 automobiles which he drove recklessly and
                 with total impunity around the streets of
                 the capital.  Oh yes, he was also a
                 cannibal.  They say Andre would eat a
                 victim's heart while it was still beating to
                 give him superhuman strength.  I could've
                 told him he'd get the same effect from a
                 pastrami sandwich at Carnegie's Deli.

     Andre announces his arrival in the main street of Monrovia with a
     burst of gunfire.  The city, a violent clash of cultures.  Goats and
     Gucci.

                             YURI (V.O.)
                 Monrovia itself was like being on another
                 planet.  Planet Monrovia.  From the
                 temperature it was obviously a planet close
                 to the sun.  I rarely saw another white man
                 even at my hotel that was soon dubbed the
                 "Little Kremlin".  And I never left town
                 alone.  Outside town, was the edge of hell.
                 I didn't want to even gaze into it.

     The car pulls up to Monrovia's premier hotel.  A DEAD BODY on the
     ground attracts no attention whatsoever.

                             ANDRE JNR.
                 This is your hotel.
                      (proudly)
                 Two stars.

     A PORTER, carrying Yuri's suitcase, steps over the dead body.

                             ANDRE JNR. (cont'd)
                      (to Yuri)
                 Can you bring me the gun of Rambo?

                             YURI
                 Part One, Two or Three?

                             ANDRE JNR.
                      (confused)
                 I have only seen Part One.

                             YURI
                      (nodding)
                 The M60.  You want the attachable grenade
                 launcher?

                             ANDRE JNR.
                 Please.  And the armor piercing bullets.
                      (revving the car)
                 I will be back to get you in an hour...or
                 two.  It's Liberia.
                      (mischievous smile)
                 We left a welcoming present in your room.

     Yuri nods, uncertainly.

     INT.  HOTEL AFRICA - LIBERIA.  DAY.

     YURI enters the hotel.

     At the reception desk, two HOTEL PORTERS watch a small, portable TV
     - CNN coverage of the O.J. Simpson trial - gruesome evidence photos.

                             HOTEL PORTER #1
                      (never averting his eyes from the
                       screen)
                 My God, he nearly cut off her head.

                             HOTEL PORTER #2
                 When I get to America, I will not live in
                 Brentwood.

     The CONCIERGE hands Yuri a key.

     INT.  HALLWAY / HOTEL ROOM.  DAY.

     YURI goes to open his hotel room door - hears music from inside,
     enters.

     Two stunning LIBERIAN GIRLS sit naked on the bed bopping to
     Madonna's lILike A Prayer".

                             YURI (V.O.)
                 In the most AIDS infested region of the
                 globe, where one in four is infected,
                 Andre's idea of a joke was to put a young
                 Iman and a young Naomi naked in my bed and
                 no condom within a hundred miles.

                             GLORIA
                 Hello, Mr. Yuri.

                             FAITH
                 We'd be happy to make you happy.

     The two goddesses drape themselves around him.

                             GLORIA
                 Don't worry, we don't have anything.

                             YURI
                 How do you know?

                             FAITH
                 Do we look like it?

                             YURI
                      (fending them off but with little
                       commitment)
                 What if I have AIDS?  Don't you worry?

     Gloria's lips gently touch his.

                             GLORIA
                 You worry too much.

     Faith begins to unbutton his shirt.

                             FAITH
                      (sultry)
                 Why worry about something that can kill you
                 in ten years when there are so many things
                 that can kill you today?

     Gloria's hands go to his belt buckle, start to unfasten it.

                             GLORIA
                 How can we make you happy?

     With great reluctance Yuri reaches behind him and opens the door.

                             YURI
                 By leaving.

     EXT.  HOTEL - CORRIDOR.  DAY.

     FAITH and GLORIA, still buck-naked, are tossed into the hallway,
     their clothes flung after them, door slammed shut.

     INT.  BAPTISTE'S PRESIDENTIAL OFFICE - MONROVIA.  DAY.

     A Glock .45, Heckler & Koch .40 and a Beretta 9mm sitm on the ostentatious
     mahogany desk in front of President of Liberia, ANDRE BAPTISTE - a few
     pounds heavier, still wearing the same size uniform.  ANDRE JNR. watches
     over his shoulder.

     Andre Baptiste examines each handgun methodically.

     In front of him, a pensive YURI, taking in his surroundings.  Half a
     dozen gun-toting ELITE GUARDS keep an idle watch.  Several HOSTESSES tend
     to a refreshments table.  On a nearby sofa, a LIEUTENANT flirts with one
     of the hostesses.

     Baptiste glances over to the Lieutenant, irritated.

                             YURI
                      (providing a commentary)
                 --that's the Beretta, comes with a 36
                 cartridge, easy-operating clip--

     Baptiste tests the loading mechanism.

     The Lieutenant on the sofa is still not paying attention.

     Baptiste casually points the gun at the Lieutenant and shoots him in
     the head - a large portion of his brain splattering across the
     fleur-de-lis wallpaper.

                             YURI (cont'd)
                      (shocked)
                 Jesus, why did you do that?

     Baptiste, clearly not used to having his actions questioned, turns
     the gun on Yuri.  He's next.

                             BAPTISTE
                 What did you say?

     Yuri, staring down the barrel of the Beretta, recovers fast.

                             YURI
                      (feigning anger, gesturing at the
                       gun)
                 Now you're going to have to buy it.
                      (grabbing the gun from Baptiste)
                 It's a used gun.  I can't sell a used gun.

     Baptiste is taken aback.  He suddenly bursts into laughter.

                             BAPTISTE
                 A used gun.  That's a good one.

     The other Officers laugh uncertainly.

     The Lieutenant's body is dragged out - leaving a smear of blood
     across the marble floor.

     Baptiste, seemingly oblivious to the carnage he's wreaked, resumes
     talking to Yuri, in a measured way as if he's discussing the sad
     state of punctuality in contemporary society.

                             BAPTISTE (cant'd)
                      (confiding in Yuri)
                 There's no discipline with the young boys.
                 I try to set an example but it's difficult.
                 I blame the MTV.

     Yuri nods, disguising his terror.

     Baptiste, checking his Rolex Oyster, rises from his desk.

                             BAPTISTE (cont'd)
                 Let me show you something.

     EXT.  BAPTISTE'S PRESIDENTIAL MANSION.  DAY.

     The camera tracks along the MILITIA - however only the very tops of
     their heads are visible.

                             YURI (V.O.)
                 I had heard of the "Boy Brigades", "Small
                 Boy Units", "Kalashnikov Kids".  The theory
                 was that a bullet coming from a fourteen
                 year old is just as effective as one trom a
                 forty year old.

     ANDRE BAPTISTE haggles with YURI as he inspects his troops ranging
     from twelve to fourteen.  Yuri, averts his eyes from the boys,
     uncomfortable reviewing soldiers a head shorter than he.

     OLDER SOLDIERS fill the ranks behind.

                             BAPTISTE
                 I can't pay your asking price, Yuri.  We are
                 not a rich people and the market is already
                 flooded with your Kalashnikovs.  In some
                 places you can buy one for the price of a
                 chicken.

                             YURI
                 You can't just look at the unit price.  You
                 forget the ancillary costs.  End user
                 certificates need to be forged and
                 notarized, shell companies set up, insurance
                 purchased, pilots and crews hired.  Not to
                 mention the bribes.  You can't get a nut
                 and bolt out of the Eastern bloc without a
                 bribe.  There's one bribe for the nut.
                 Another for the bolt.  This is an expensive
                 proposition.

     Andre interrogates Yuri's eyes.

                             BAPTISTE
                 I pay in timber...or stones.

     Baptiste produces a handful of uncut diamonds from his pocket.  Yuri's eyes
     widen at the sight of the very precious stones.

                             YURI
                      (regarding the stones)
                 I'll take the stones.  It's hard to get a
                 tree trunk in my hand luggage.

     Andre smiles.  He turns to his new Lieutenant.

                             BAPTISTE
                      (referring to the inspection)
                 Very professional, Lieutenant.

                             LIEUTENANT
                      (dismissing the troops)
                 Dismissed!

     Yuri and Andre watch the troops disperse.

                             YURI
                 I know you're planning a new offensive.  If
                 you delay a week I can get you the armored
                 personnel carriers we talked about.  They
                 would give you a significant strategic
                 advantage.

     Andre nods, grateful for the free tactical advice - regards Yuri in
     a new light.

                             BAPTISTE
                 They say I am the lord of war.  But perhaps
                 it is you.

                             YURI
                      (correcting him)
                 It's not "lord of war".  It's "warlord".

                             BAPTISTE
                 I like it my way.

     Andre smiles again.  They are going to be fast friends.

     He leaves Yuri alone to examine his uncut diamonds in his hand.

                             YURI (V.O.)
                 Diamonds are far less bulky than hundred-
                 dollar bills.  You can get a million dollars
                 into a cigarette box.

     EXT.  ART GALLERY - MANHATTAN.  DUSK.

     A GO-BETWEEN emerges from a gallery with a wrapped painting, hands it to
     YURI, waiting in a limo.

                             YURI (V.O.)
                 By the mid-nineties, my wealth had caught up
                 to my lies about my wealth - even surpassed
                 the lies.

     Yuri pays the Go-Between in cash, places the painting in the trunk.

     INT.  LIVING ROOM - NEW YORK APARTMENT.  NIGHT.

     YURI enters the front door, drops his luggage at the door.

     AVA, talking excitedly on the phone, hangs up, runs to greet him.
     VITALY, in the background, cocktail in hand, with another dubious-
     looking GIRLFRIEND, is examining another of Ava's paintings.

                             AVA
                 Yuri, I just got off the phone with the
                 dealer.  I sold my first painting.

     Yuri and Vitaly greet each other with a nod.

                             YURI
                      (feigning surprise)
                 Fantastic.  Who bought it?

                             AVA
                 Someone important.  They want to remain
                 anonymous.
                      (asking in a way that does not
                       expect an answer)
                 How was your trip?

                             YURI
                 You know.  Same old, same old.
                      (quickly changing the subject)
                 Where's Nicki, in bed?

                             AVA
                 I'm sorry.  Poor darling.  He tried to stay
                 up.

                             YURI
                 I'll kiss him goodnight.

                             VITALY
                      (opening champagne)
                 This calls for a drink.

                             YURI
                 What doesn't?

                             AVA
                      (still giddy at the news)
                 My first painting.  I'm officially an
                 artist!

     He watches Ava showing off more of her paintings to Vitaly and the
     latest girlfriend.

                             YURI (V.O.)
                 I figured I was a patron of the arts and of
                 everything else Ava had tried and failed at
                 after modelling.  Acting, her own cosmetics
                 line.  I didn't sabotage her careers but I
                 can't deny it was convenient for me in
                 maintaining a low profile.  She was a
                 beautiful bird in a gilded cage.

     INT.  BEDROOM - NEW YORK APARTMENT.  NIGHT.

     YURI kisses his sleeping son, NICOLAI, now three years old.

     He places a gift at the end of his bed - an expensive-looking
     microscope.

     At the same time he spies an object in Nicolai's toy box - a toy
     gun.

     INT.  KITCHEN / LIVING ROOM - NEW YORK APARTMENT.  NIGHT.

     YURI tosses the toy gun in the trash.

     VITALY, still in the kitchen, catches him - pretends he didn't see.

                             YURI
                 How are you, brother?

                             VITALY
                      (shrug)
                 You know, still the resident family fuck-up.

                             YURI
                 Someone has to do it.

     They watch Ava in the living room sharing a joke with Vitaly's
     girlfriend.

                             VITALY
                 She knows, right?

                             YURI
                 We don't talk about it.

     Vitaly looks askance.

                             YURI (cont'd)
                      (shrug)
                 How many car salesmen talk about their work,
                 how many executives at cigarette companies?
                 And both of their products kill more people
                 every year than mine.  At least mine has a
                 safety switch.  If those guys can leave
                 their work at the office, why can't I?

                             VITALY
                 Shit, you're good.  You almost had me
                 convinced.
                      (to his girlfriend, knocking back
                       his drink)
                 We're going, baby.

     LATER

     Yuri and Ava are alone at the window, overlooking Central Park.  He
     hands her a fresh glass of champagne.

                             YURI
                      (raising his glass for a toast)
                 To Manet, Monet...and Ava Cordova.

     Ava grins, goes to drink when she notices two huge diamond earrings
     laying at the bottom of the glass.

                             AVA
                      (gasp)
                 Yuri!

                             YURI
                      (shrug)
                 The trip went better than expected.

                             AVA
                      (fishing out the damp baubles)
                 Yuri, they're beautiful.
                      (flirtacious grin)
                 But what am I going to wear them with?

                             YURI
                      (flirting back)
                 I know just the outfit.

     They kiss.

     INT.  BEDROOM - NEW YORK APARTMENT.  NIGHT.

     CLOSE UP on the diamonds dangling from AVA's ears.  She wears the
     earrings and nothing else as she and YURI make love.

                             YURI (V.O.)
                 I didn't know how much she knew and how much
                 she ignored.  I was a good provider and as
                 far as she was concerned - loyal.  Despite
                 the other women, I always made love to Ava
                 as if she was the only one.

     INT.  HELICOPTER - MANHATTAN.  MORNING.

     From an unmarked helicopter, JACK VALENTINE and his INTERPOL AGENTS
     shadow a Mercedes sedan as it weaves through midtown traffic.

     INT.  SEDAN.  MORNING.

     YURI rides in the back seat of the sedan, scouring the world affairs
     sections of several newspapers.

     A thought interrupts his homework.

     He opens the sunroof a crack, spies the helicopter tailing the car.
     He closes the roof.

                             YURI
                      (to the DRIVER)
                 Take Park.

     EXT.  PARK AVENUE.  MORNING.

     The sedan enters the underpass beneath the Helmsley building - for a
     moment the car hidden from aerial surveillance.

                             YURI
                      (to the Driver)
                 This is good.

     The Driver pulls over, never coming to a complete stop before Yuri
     bails.  Horns blare at the illegal drop-off.

                             YURI (cont'd)
                      (to the Driver from the sidewalk)
                 Take them on a tour of the Tri-State.

     Yuri grabs Ava's painting from the trunk and the sedan pulls back
     out into daylight minus Yuri - the occupants of the helicopter none
     the wiser.

     Yuri hails a taxi.

     INT.  HELICOPTER - MANHATTAN.  MORNING.

     VALENTINE observes the sedan cruising through the heart of Yonkers.

                             VALENTINE
                 Where in God's name is he going?  Is he
                 lost?

     INT.  PUBLIC STORAGE FACILITY.  MORNING.

     With some reverence, YURI props Ava's painting against the wall of
     his private sanctuary, then goes about his business - shuffling
     passports, deciding who he will be.

     EXT.  NEW YORK APARTMENT.  DAY.

     AVA, dressed in a robe, all smiles, pours herself a cup of coffee.
     She sips the coffee at the window, glances down.

     In the courtyard below, INTERPOL AGENTS are picking through the
     garbage cans under the supervision of AGENT VALENTINE.  Valentine
     curiously examines the toy gun.

     The smile is wiped off Ava's face.  She makes brief eye-contact with
     Valentine before stepping back from the window.

     Slightly shaken, she picks up the phone and dials.

                             AVA
                      (into phone)
                 Vitaly...it's Ava.

     INT.  COCKPIT - ILYUSHIN-76 CARGO PLANE.  DAY.

     The cargo hold of an Ilyushin-76 cargo plane.  It's so overflowing
     with weapons, many are strapped into the passenger seats.

                                                        Sierra Leone - 1999


                             YURI (V.O.)
                 I was now the best merchant of death alive.  I
                 didn't own my own plane.  I owned a fleet -
                 running guns into Liberia, Sierra Leone or the
                 Ivory Coast at least once a week.
                 Unfortunately, my friends at Interpol were
                 also starting to find West Africa on the map.
                 Most trips I had phoney paperwork.  If the
                 deadline was tight, I had no paperwork at all.

     In the cockpit, an American PILOT and CO-PILOT keep an idle watch on
     their instruments as they fly over the endless plains of Sierra
     Leone.  YURI sits in the jump-seat, reading the Wall Street Journal.

                             PILOT
                      (to his co-pilot)
                 --Even taking into consideration the pay-off
                 to the parents, a week with a girl in
                 Burkina Faso is cheaper than a night with a
                 girl in Jersey.

                             CO-PILOT
                 Plus, they're cleaner--

                             PILOT
                 --and a lot of them speak better English.

                             CO-PILOT
                      (shrug)
                 Personally, I prefer a language barrier--

     An unmarked military jet appears through the starboard window.  The
     voice on the radio is familiar.

                             VALENTINE (O.C.)
                 --Charlie, Echo, India.  Descend for landing
                 on heading zero...two...nine.

     The Pilot picks up the radio, looks to Yuri.  Yuri shakes his head,
     dialling his satellite phone.  Yuri's call is answered.

                             YURI
                      (into phone, trying not to sound
                       too desperate)
                 Colonel Southern, it's Yuri.  Sorry to call
                 you on this number but I've got an Interpol
                 jet and--

     The jet outside the window falls back.

     INT.  A PENTAGON OFFICE.  DAY.

     A mid-rank office dominated by a computer terminal.  We look over
     COLONEL SOUTHERN's shoulder.  He is admiring a new medal.  Two other MEN
     IN SUITS sit opposite.

                             COL. SOUTHERN
                      (into phone, measured voice)
                 I can't know you right now.  It's not a good
                 time.

     Southern hangs up.

     INT.  COCKPIT - ILYUSHIN-76 CARGO PLANE.  DAY.

     YURI, hearing the response, explodes.

                             YURI
                      (gaping at the phone in disbelief)
                 Not a good time!

     Suddenly machine gun fire strafes the Ilyushin - bullets tearing
     through the fuselage, perilously close to Yurirs very combustible
     cargo.

                             CO-PILOT
                 Motherfucker!

     The jet appears again at the window.

                             VALENTINE
                      (radio)
                 --Charlie, Echo, India.  Comply immediately.
                 That was your last warning.

                             YURI
                 Where was the first fucking warning?!

                             VALENTINE
                      (radio)
                 Rock your wings if you intend to comply.

                             PILOT
                      (to Yuri, anxious)
                 I'm putting us down.

                             YURI
                      (incredulous)
                 You land and we're all going away!  I don't
                 have paperwork!

                             PILOT
                      (incredulous)
                 We're in a flying fucking bomb!  They're
                 firing bullets at our bullets!  Forget about
                 going away!  They shoot again, we're going
                 away for good!  I'm putting us down.

                             YURI
                      (knowing he's right)
                 Okay!  Okay!--Fuck!!

     The pilot responds on the radio.

                             PILOT
                      (into radio)
                 This is Charlie Echo India.  Descending
                 on heading zero two nine.

     The Interpol jet takes the lead towards a small airport.  Yuri surveys the
     terrain below, getting his head back in the game.

                             YURI
                      (pointing out a narrow highway)
                 Not the airport.  There.  The highway.  It's
                 our only fucking hope.

                             PILOT
                      (concerned)
                 A pothole could set us off.

                             YURI
                 Don't underestimate yourself.  You're the
                 best, Tony.

     The pilot doesn't buy it but reluctantly changes course anyway.

     INT.  INTERPOL JET.  DAY.

     From his own wingseat, VALENTINE observes the Ilyushin's detour,
     landing on the highway.

                             INTERPOL PILOT
                 I can't land there.

                             VALENTINE
                      (to the pilot)
                 He can't get far.  I want a truck waiting on
                 the tarmac.

     EXT.  HIGHWAY.  DAY.

     A heavily-trafficked highway.  WOMEN carrying water jars on their
     heads, a thin COW pulling the carcass of a car, VENDORS selling dry
     meat, CHILDREN playing war games.

     The pedestrians look up to see the lumbering Ilyushin making its
     final approach - they scatter.

     The Ilyushin weaves on landing, hits a bone-jarring pothole.

     INSIDE THE PLANE - boxes of grenades, bullets and other munitions
     jump dangerously up and down.

     Finally, the Ilyushin pulls up safely on the highway, engines
     shutting down.  YURI's head appears out of the cockpit window.

     Curious LOCALS, recovered from the shock, are gathering at the side
     of the road.

                             YURI
                      (to the pilots, sizing up the
                       locals)
                 We're going to be okay.

     The PILOTS are already halfway out of the plane door, grabbing
     supplies as they go.

                             YURI (cont'd)
                      (calling out from the window)
                 Where are you going?

                             PILOT
                 As far from the evidence as I can.

     The pilots start running down the highway.

                             YURI
                 Wait, you idiots!  There's not going to be
                 any evidence!  Stay with the plane!

     The pilots ignore him - run for their lives.

     YURI is left alone.  He turns a lever marked, "CARGO BAY".

     EXT.  CARGO BAY.  DAY.

     The rear cargo bay opens.  YURI stands beside his incriminating
     merchandise.

                             YURI
                      (to the gathering locals)
                 Help yourselves.  Be my guest.  No charge.

     One LOCAL MAN tentatively approaches the cargo bay.  Yuri hands him
     an AK-47 and a box of shells.

     More SIERRA LEONESE LOCALS emerge from the side of the road,
     seemingly out of thin air.

     Yuri hands out more guns.

                             YURI (cont'd)
                      (to other locals)
                 Take the whole crate.

     Two men oblige, ferrying the crate away.

     The other locals become bolder, then brazen.

     Soon it's a free-far-all.  Men, women and children swarm all over
     the plane pilfering the arms and anything else that isn't bolted
     down - also a lot that is.

     Yuri has to exit the plane to avoid being trampled in the rush.

     EXT.  HIGHWAY.  DAY.

     YURI buys a Fanta from a vendor - exchanging it for a box of
     grenades.

     He sits on a soda crate for a front row seat at the chaos.

     Yuri has a calculator out - totalling his losses.

                             YURI
                      (muttering under his breath,
                       shutting off the calculator in
                       disgust)
                 What a fucking disaster.

     Yuri sees the pilot seats being stolen.

                             YURI
                 Hey, not those!  You don't touch the plane!
                      (plaintive moan)
                 Not the fucking seats...

     Glancing up the highway, Yuri sees an approaching cloud of dust -
     VALENTINE and two truckfuls of heavily-armed Interpol Agents.

     Too late.  The last of the guns and ammunition are being carted away
     on the back of a thin cow.

     Valentine's truck fishtails to a halt beside the stripped plane.

     Valentine is first off the trucks and into the plane's cargo bay -
     empty.

     Other INTERPOL AGENTS fan out - futilely questioning locals.

     Miraculously the weapons have vanished into the bush.

     Valentine calls out to the last fleeing local - a BOY with a
     lifevest.

                             VALENTINE
                 Hey, you!

     The boy stares back, defiantly inflates the life preserver.

                             VALENTINE (cont'd)
                      (exasperated)
                 Forget it.

     The entire cargo has gone.  An errant bullet falls off a shelf in
     the plane and rolls down the floor - Valentine picks it up.

     YURI sits innocently on his soda crate.

     A frustrated African Interpol Agent, MBIZI, wound-up by the chase,
     rushes Yuri - slams him to the ground.

                             MBIZI
                 You run from us.
                      (flashing a machete in Yuri's
                       face)
                 Can you run with no legs?

     Valentine rushes over, pulls Mbizi off Yuri.

                             VALENTINE
                 No, Mbizi.  No, no, no.

     Valentine drags Mbizi out of Yuri's earshot.  Mbizi still wants a
     piece of Yuri - Valentine preventing him getting to the gunrunner.

                             MBIZI
                 Let me disappear him, Mr.  Valentine.  He is
                 a devil.  Let me disappear him.

                             VALENTINE
                 I can't do that.

                             MBIZI
                 Look where we are.  Who will know?

                             VALENTINE
                 We will.

     Mbizi stops struggling against Valentine.

                             MBIZI
                 Turn your back, Mr. Valentine.  I will go to
                 hell to stop him.

                             VALENTINE
                      (gently)
                 No.
                      (to his Agents)
                 Find the pilots.

     Mbizi and another Agent reluctantly head off in a truck.

     Valentine returns to Yuri who is dusting himself off.  Valentine
     handcuffs Yuri himself, picks up the soda crate and sits Yuri back
     on it.

                             VALENTINE (cont'd)
                 I've spent my whole career on the right side
                 of the line.  You're the first man I've
                 encountered who makes me seriously consider
                 crossing it.

                             YURI
                 What's the charge?

                             VALENTINE
                 What are you doing in Sierra Leone?

                             YURI
                 I'm on safari.

                             VALENTINE
                      (referring to the bullet)
                 Shooting wildebeests with submachine guns?

                             YURI
                 Are you with the park service?  Hunting
                 without a license - is that the charge?

                             VALENTINE
                 You're trafficking arms.

                             YURI
                 Trading.  But without evidence who can say?

                             VALENTINE
                 Trade or traffic, you make a fortune by
                 keeping the poorest people on the planet
                 killing each other.
                      (hesitates, unsure whether to
                       waste his breath - wastes it
                       anyway)
                 Do you know why I do what I do?

     Yuri remains handcuffed, sitting on the soda crate - dwarfed by the
     cargo plane.  Valentine paces beside him.

                             VALENTINE (cont'd)
                      (ignoring him)
                 There are more prestigious assignments, you
                 know.  Keeping track of the nuclear
                 arsenals.  You would think it more critical
                 to world security.  It's not.  Nine out of
                 ten war victims today are killed by assault
                 rifles and other small arms - like yours.
                 Those missiles just sit in their silos.
                 Your AK-47 - it's the real weapon of mass
                 destruction.

     Yuri regards his interrogator curiously.  Despite the sun beating
     down, he feels obliged to give him his version of the facts of life.

                             YURI
                 I don't want people dead, Agent Valentine.
                 I admit, a shooting war is better for
                 business.  But I'd prefer people to fire my
                 guns and miss.  Just as long as they're
                 firing.

     He regards Valentine with something approaching pity.

                             YURI (cont'd)
                 I realize the unspeakable things that are
                 done with my weapons.  I also understand the
                 unspeakable things that are done with
                 Williams Sonoma carving knives and Wilson
                 baseball bats and they aren't taking those
                 off the market any time soon.  People will
                 always buy guns.  Why not mine?

     Valentine appears to have no answer.

                             YURI (cont'd)
                 Can I go?  You've got nothing on me--
                      (unable to resist)
                 --but cuffs.

     Now Valentine smiles.

                             VALENTINE
                 I am legally permitted to hold you for
                 twenty-four hours without charging you.

     Yuri looks away, knows where this is going.

                             VALENTINE (cont'd)
                 You may ask, why do I bother to do that?  I
                 can assure you, it is not because I enjoy your
                 company.  And you may be surprised to learn
                 that it is not for any vindictive motive.  No.
                 The reason I delay you for every second of the
                 permissible twenty-four hours, is that I am
                 delaying your deadly trade and the deaths of
                 your victims.  I don't think of it as taking a
                 day from you but giving a day to them.  Some
                 innocent man, woman or child somewhere has one
                 more day on this earth because you are not
                 free.

     Valentine looks to his watch.

                             VALENTINE (cont'd)
                 See you in twenty-three hours and fifty five
                 minutes.

     Valentine walks away.  Yuri is left to ponder the notion.

     We see time lapse photography of Yuri waiting out his twenty-four
     hours, under armed guard on the highway - stretching his legs,
     eating a suspicious-looking sandwich, going to the bathroom, the sun
     arcing across the sky - all the while his plane is being
     cannibalized by the locals.  Finally the time lapse slows back into
     real time.

     Valentine returns in a Jeep with Mbizi and other Agents.

                             VALENTINE
                 You'll be pleased to know your colleagues
                 were no more co-operative than you.

     Valentine opens the back of the Jeep.  Lying in the back, the bodies
     of the two PILOTS shot and stripped.

                             VALENTINE (cont'd)
                 The locals got to them before we could.

     Yuri turns away from the sight.  His handcuffs are removed.

     Returning Yuri's documents, Valentine notices a photo of AVA and
     NICKI in the wallet.

                             VALENTINE (cont'd)
                 Handsome family.

     Valentine and the Agents get back in the truck and drive away.

     EXT.  HIGHWAY.  DUSK.

     YURI starts to walk down the deserted highway alone - his cargo
     plane is now just another carcass in the jungle.

     A CONVOY of armored personnel carriers barrels past him - the color:
     U.N. white.  The lead car slams on its brakes, bringing the train to
     a stop.  A woman pokes her head out of the window - CAPTAIN VIVIAN
     CARLISLE.

                             VIVIAN
                      (pleasantly surprised)
                 Yuri!  Yuri Orlov!

                             YURI
                      (giving her an embarrassed hug)
                 Vivian...

                             VIVIAN
                 What are you doing here?

                             YURI
                      (approaching the window)
                 You know.  Fighting the good fight.

                             VIVIAN
                 An aid program?

                             YURI
                 Uh, yes.  In fact, I've just had some
                 transport problems.  You couldn't give me a
                 ride to Monrovia, could you?

                             VIVIAN
                 Sure.  Climb in.

     Yuri steps back into a vehicle with which he is very familiar.

                             VIVIAN (cant' d)
                 We're pulling out.  It's too dangerous.
                 It's a shame.  We were really doing some
                 good things.

     Yuri nods in understanding.

     INT.  HOTEL AFRICA - YURI'S HOTEL ROOM.  NIGHT.

     A weary YURI enters his room.  Sitting on the green sofa - bound and
     gagged, face reduced to pulp, silver hair matted with blood -
     SIMEON.

                             YURI
                 Jesus!  Simeon!

     ANDRE JNR., a FLUNKY and his CHEERLEADERS appear from behind the
     door, laughing at his shocked reaction.

                             YURI (cont'd)
                 Andre!  What in heaven is he doing here?

                             ANDRE JNR.
                 A gift for you.

     Yuri stares into the old gunrunner's terrified eyes.

                             ANDRE JNR. (cont'd)
                 You got here just in time.  I was afraid he
                 would die before you got a chance to kill
                 him.

     He offers Yuri a Beretta.

                             YURI
                 Me?!

                             ANDRE JNR.
                 Who do you think informed on you - cost you your
                 plane?  He came to meet my father, hoping to take
                 your place.

     Yuri spits on Simeon.

                             YURI
                 You stupid old fuck!

                             ANDRE JNR.
                      (knowing smile)
                 He killed your man when he tried to kill
                 you.

     Andre again offers Yuri the Beretta.

                             YURI
                 No.

                             ANDRE JNR.
                      (confused)
                 You want us to let him go?

                             YURI
                 No.  No.  I...

     Andre offers him the gun a third time.  Yuri refuses it.

                             ANDRE JNR.
                 So you do want him dead.  You just don't
                 want to kill him yourself?  I understand.

     Andre grabs Yuri and presses the gun into Yuri's palm, clasping his
     own hand over Yuri's.

                             ANDRE JNR.
                 We'll do it together.  A bonding experience.

     Andre forces Yuri's finger onto the trigger as he aims at the
     terrified Simeon - eyes pleading.

     Yuri attempts to pull his hand away but Andre is too strong.

                             ANDRE JNR.
                 You can stop if you want - but
                 you do.  Just say the word.

     Andre stares at Yuri not Simeon.

                             ANDRE JNR. (cont'd)
                 Say, "stop".

     Yuri opens his mouth but no word comes.  Andre presses Yuri's finger
     onto the trigger.

     The gun goes off.  A splash of blood across the sofa's green
     upholstery.

     The gunshot echoes around the room.  Simeon is very dead.

                             YURI
                      (quietly)
                 Stop.

     Andre smiles.

                             ANDRE JNR.
                      (surveying the blood-spattered
                       room)
                 I'll get you another room with a nicer view.

     INT.  HOTEL AFRICA - LIBERIA.  DAY.

     YURI collapses on the bar - gestures to the BARMAN who immediately
     pours a line of cocaine in full view.

     YURI hoovers it up.

                             YURI (V.O.)
                 I started doing a lot of cocaine in West
                 Africa.  I wasn't medicating myself.  I was
                 simply playing catch-up.  I was constantly
                 dealing with people who are chemically
                 imbalanced without the aid of chemicals.
                 It's just a matter of etiquette.  It's rude
                 to act sane in a room full of lunatics.

     The Barman nods to a patron at a corner table - a SEASONED FIGHTER
     - no more than eighteen years old.

                             BARMAN
                 He bought you "brown-brown", Mr. Yuri.

                             YURI
                      (wiping his nose)
                 What?

                             BARMAN
                 "Brown-brown".

                             YURI
                 What is it?

                             BARMAN
                      (laughs)
                 A mixture - cocaine and gunpowder.

                             YURI
                 What does the gunpowder do?

                             BARMAN
                 It's magic.  They give it to the small boys
                 before battle - they do anything.

                             YURI
                 Some other time.

                             BARMAN
                 You have to try it at least once, Mr. Yuri.

     The Barman starts chopping another line.

                             YURI
                 Why?

                             BARMAN
                      (laughing)
                 Because it's your gunpowder.

     Sure enough the Barman pours the gunpowder from one of Yuri's 39mm
     shells into the cocaine.

     The SEASONED FIGHTER, assault rifle slung over his shoulder,
     intimidating air, sidles up to Yuri - stares him down.  Yuri has no
     option, does a line.

     He washes it down with a swig from a vodka bottle, raises his glass
     to the fighter.

     The Barman puts on a Ukrainian folk song.  Yuri picks out one of the
     PROSTITUTES in the bar, starts dancing.

     He drunkenly dances with one PROSTITUTE after another - the dance
     almost violent, the prostitutes flung aside, none lasting more than
     a few seconds - caught in the arms of the other PATRONS.

     To Yuri, the bar swims before his eyes.

     The music stops.  Yuri, wild-eyed, looks at the stunned bar room.

                             YURI
                      (to no one in particular, whipping his
                       vodka bottle off the bar)
                 I'm going for a walk.

     EXT.  MONROVIA.  NIGHT.

     A MONTAGE OF SCENES FROM YURI'S P.O.V. IN HIS ALTERED STATE.  [A
     MIXTURE OF FORMATS INCLUDING SUPER-8 & VIDEO, SHAKY HANDHELD
     FOOTAGE, OVER-EXPOSED FOOTAGE, BLACK & WHITE FOOTAGE EDITED OUT-OF-
     SEQUENCE WITH JUMP CUTS AND FLASH FRAMES]

     YURI staggers towards the edge of town - still swigging from his
     bottle.

     A ROOM WITH A CURVED CEILING ON THE OUTSKIRTS OF MONROVIA

     YURI, eyes unable to focus, stares at a WOMAN'S FACE in front of
     him, moving back and forth.  The gyrating stops.

     Yuri realizes he is lying in the mouth of an enormous cement pipe on
     his back, a prostitute on top of him.  She gets to her feet,
     adjusting her dress.

     Yuri panics, hurriedly zipping himself.

                             YURI
                      (a mixture of French and English)
                 I didn't fuck you, did I?  Did I fuck you?

                             PROSTITUTE
                      (in French, as she counts Yuri's
                       money)
                 It's not what I would call a fuck.

     The prostitute tosses a couple of bills back to him.  Yuri ignores
     the money, staggers after her.

                             YURI
                 Are you sick?

     She ignores him.

                             YURI (cont'd)
                      (screaming)
                 Are you sick?!

     Yuri staggers to his feet - wanders aimlessly across a field.

     A DANCE IN DUST SOMEWHERE ON THE OUTSKIRTS OF MONROVIA

     Two dozen pairs of feet chase each other on a dirt field to cheers
     from a crowd.  The dust clears, revealing a bundle of cloth and
     string doubling as a soccer ball.  The game is between two
     indistinguishable teams of MONROVIAN YOUNGSTERS on a makeshift dirt
     field, goalposts constructed from tree branches lashed together.

     YURI wanders onto the field, joins the game without asking.  The
     players humor him by letting him have the ball.

     Yuri dribbles up field, takes an enormous swipe at the ball, misses
     completely, clattering to the ground.

     The crowd and players laugh.  The game goes on.  Yuri, also laughing
     but in a far more desperate manner, picks himself up and wanders
     away.

     A LIBERIAN BAR CALLED "ZANZI-BAR"

     YURI throws up at the back of a saloon flimsily constructed from
     rusted corrugated iron.

     Rinsing out his mouth with vodka, he is distracted by the sound of
     two little GIRLS arguing.

                             GIRL #1 (O.C.)
                 They will!

                             GIRL #2 (O.C.)
                 They won't!

                             GIRL #1 (O.C.)
                 They will!

                             GIRL #2 (O.C.)
                 They won't!

                             GIRL #1
                 They will!

                             GIRL #2
                 Ask the foreigner.  The foreigner will know.

     The GIRLS approach Yuri - no older than seven, formal white dresses,
     hands politely behind their backs.

                             YURI
                 Hello.

                             GIRL #1
                 Sir, will my fingers grow back?

     One of the girls shows Yuri a healed stump where her hand should be.

     Yuri runs away.

     A MODERN SCULPTURE SOMEWHERE IN MONROVIA

     YURI passes in front of an abstract arrangement of holes that turns
     out to be a building pock-marked with gunshells.

     Suddenly a FACE appears in one of the holes - SIMEON.  The gunshot
     wound in his forehead still evident.  Yuri gasps.

                             YURI
                 Simeon.

     Simeon turns and walks away - revealing a large exit wound in the back
     of his head.

                             YURI (cont'd)
                 Simeon!!

     Yuri pokes his head through the hole but Simeon has vanished.  Yuri
     turns back to find himself trapped by TWO MEN in flip-flops, shorts,
     Gap T-shirts and AK-47's.

     Through Yuri's eyes the two men look like four.  The two/four men go
     through Yuri's pockets, take his watch, shoes.

     Yuri is oddly compliant - clumsily helping one of the thieves fasten
     the watch.

     One of the men, tired of Yuri's antics, aims his gun at Yuri's head.
     His colleague stops him.

                             MAN #1
                 Don't.  He's Andre's.

                             MAN #2
                      (keeping his gun raised)
                 Fuck Andre.

                             YURI
                      (seemingly beyond caring)
                 Yeah, fuck Andre.

     The man fires at Yuri.  The gun jams.  Yuri looks almost
     disappointed.  The man tries again.  Again the gun jams.

                             YURI
                      (referring to the gun)
                 I'm sorry.  They don't usually do that.  Let
                 me have a look.  Maybe I can fix it.

                             MAN #1
                      (disgusted)
                 Fuck off!

     The man whips the gun across Yuri's face.

     A PATH OUTSIDE MONROVIA

     YURI, face streaked with blood and dirt, wanders aimlessly through
     the brush outside Monrovia.

     A HYENA appears on the dirt path in front of him - teeth bared,
     frenzied eyes.

     Yuri stares at the wild dog - starts to quietly cry.  Tears roll
     down his cheeks.

     The hyena runs away.  Yuri is alone.

                                                              DISSOLVE TO:

     EXT.  MONROVIAN DOCKS.  DAWN.

     A vacant-eyed YURI sits in the shadow of an enormous stack of arms,
     unloaded from a freighter.

     A presidential motorcade appears on the dock.  ANDRE BAPTISTE
     emerges out of his Mercedes Jeep, gun in his hand.  He strides up to
     Yuri.

                             ANDRE BAPTISTE
                 Yuri, you fucked up!  I am going to shoot
                 your face off with your own gun.

     Yuri doesn't flinch.

                             YURI
                      (unfazed, regarding the man)
                 Not bad.  Andre's latest double?

     The man's face falls.  The real ANDRE BAPTISTE emerges from the car with
     ANDRE JNR.

                             ANDRE BAPTISTE
                      (to Yuri, standing beside his
                       uncanny double)
                 How did you know?

                             YURI
                 He's too eloquent.

                             ANDRE BAPTISTE
                 You have no heart.

     Baptiste brandishes a copy of the New York Times.

                             ANDRE BAPTISTE
                 Have you seen the news?  They accuse me of
                 rigging elections, but after this in your
                 Florida with your Supreme Court of
                 kangaroos--

     CLOSE ON the headline, "U.S. SUPREME COURT REVERSES RECOUNT RULING".

                             ANDRE BAPTISTE (cont'd)
                 --now the U.S. must shut up forever.

     Yuri just smiles.

                             YURI
                 More good news.  That's the last aid
                 shipment.  The war is so bad, the U.N. is
                 pulling out.

     Andre shrugs.  He regards the inactivity at the dock.

                             ANDRE BAPTISTE
                 Why is nothing happening?

                             ANDRE, JNR.
                      (reluctant to give his father bad
                       news)
                 No trucks.  They are trapped on the front
                 lines.

                             YURI
                 There are trucks.  You just have to get all
                 that food out of them.

     Yuri gestures down the dock where food is being loaded into trucks
     marked, "HUMANITARIAN AID"

     Andre Baptiste and Andre Jnr.  are clearly taken with the idea.

                             ANDRE JNR.
                 Killing certain humans can be considered
                 humanitarian.
                      (thinly disguised reference to the
                       previous night)
                 Isn't that right, Mr. Yuri?

     Andre Baptiste hands Yuri his payment - a slim briefcase containing
     a pouch of uncut diamonds.

                             YURI (V.O.)
                 After surviving the last few days I'd started
                 to feel like I was invincible.  But there was
                 a weapon that could hurt me.

     INT.  UPPER EAST SIDE APARTMENT.  DAY.

     From behind the cover of a sofa NICOLAI shoots at an unseen foe, his
     finger as the gun.

     The camera pans around the room to find AVA in an armchair opposite
     AGENT VALENTINE.

                             AVA
                 Hush, Nicki.
                      (to Valentine)
                 I don't believe you.

     Valentine is unfazed.

                             AVA (cont'd)
                 Can you prove any of it?  Where is your
                 evidence?

                             VALENTINE
                 I was hoping you could help us with that.
                      (opens an old file containing a
                       copy of a newspaper clipping,
                       headlined, "Cordova
                       Disappearance" )
                 I understand your parents died tragically in
                 EI Salvador.
                      (meeting Avars gaze)
                 That regime has startling similarities to
                 several of the regimes supplied by your
                 husband.

                             AVA
                 Get out.

     Valentine rises to leave.  Ava holds Nicolai, her mind reeling.

     INT.  FASHION SHOW - NEW YORK.  NIGHT.

     Impossibly thin MODELS strut along a transparent lightbox of a
     runway, flanked by SOCIALITES and PAPARAZZI.

     Projected on the wall behind them, the words, "FASHION AGAINST HATE
     - Dress Not To Kill" and various images from the world's warzones.

     Each outfit is enthusiastically applauded.

                             MASTER OF CEREMONIES
                 And now, one of the sponsors of tonight's
                 evening, former Miss World, Ava Cordova.

     AVA appears from behind the wings in a designer gown.  She modestly
     accepts the applause - gradually becomes aware of a projection on
     her face.

     She turns to see the projected image of a CHILD holding an AK-47.

     When she turns back, tears are rolling down her face.

     INT.  NEW YORK HOUSE.  NIGHT.

     Back to us, AVA naked, sits on the end of her bed, clothes laid out
     beside her.

                             YURI (O.C.)
                 Ava?

     YURI, still carrying his suitcase, appears in the doorway.  He drops
     the case.

                             YURI
                 Ava, what's wrong?  Where's Nicki?

                             AVA
                      (still with her back to us)
                 He's with your parents.

     Yuri senses something very wrong.

                             YURI
                 Why aren't you dressed?  I thought we were
                 going out.

     He finds a robe from the closet - gently places it around her.  She
     pulls it off her shoulders.

                             AVA
                      (turning back to look at him)
                 I can't wear the clothes.  I can't wear the
                 jewelry.  I can't drive the car.  I can't
                 live in this house.  Everything1s got blood
                 on it.

     Yuri pulls the robe back onto her shoulders, walks to the window.

                             YURI
                 Don't be so melodramatic.

     Ava pulls the robe to her, follows Yuri to the window.

                             AVA
                 Of course I'm melodramatic.  I'm a failed actress,
                 remember?  We need to talk about it.

                             YURI
                 Why?  We never have before.

                             AVA
                 Now we do.

     Yuri notices the Interpol business card on the bedside table.

                             YURI
                 These people - you can't trust them--

                             AVA
                 --I've talked to your parents.  Why do you
                 think they don't want your money?  They know
                 where it comes from.  We all know.

     Yuri sighs, resigned.

                             YURI
                 I sell people a means to defend themselves,
                 Ava.  That's all.  I don't hold a gun to any
                 one's head and make them shoot--

                             AVA
                 --Yuri, I see the news.  Sierra Leone--

                             YURI
                 --I don't sell machetes.

                             AVA
                 --What do you think is pointing at the
                 victims when they use those machetes?  I see
                 the pictures.  Yuri, the guns are bigger
                 than the boys.

                             YURI
                      (angered)
                 There's nothing illegal about what I do.

                             AVA
                 I don't care if it's legal, it's wrong.

     Ava meets his eye.

                             AVA (cont' d)
                 I can accept the drugs.  I can even accept
                 the other women.  I can't accept this.

     Yuri looks away.

                             AVA
                 Please stop.

                             YURI
                      (looks back)
                 It makes no difference if I stop.  Someone
                 will take my place the next day.

                             AVA
                 Let them.  We have enough.  You're not that
                 little boy in Odessa anymore, lining up for
                 a loaf of bread--

                             YURI
                 --It's not about the money.

                             AVA
                 What is it?

     He doesn't answer - perhaps he doesn't have one.  Ava looks out of
     the window at their expensive view.

                             AVA (cont'd)
                 I feel like all I've done my whole life is
                 be pretty.  All I've done is be born.  I'm
                 not just a failed actress.  I'm also a
                 failed writer, failed artist, failed
                 businesswoman.  I'm not much good as a
                 mother.  Come to think of it, I'm not even
                 that pretty any more.  I've failed at
                 everything, Yuri.
                      (turning back to him)
                 But I won't fail as a human being.  I'm
                 leaving.

     The words finally register with Yuri.

                             YURI
                 You can't leave.  I'll stop.
                      (as if trying to convince himself)
                 I'll stop.

     Ava is skeptical.  He holds her, reassures her.

                             YURI (cont'd)
                 I've been thinking about it for a while.  A
                 lot, lately.
                      (as if trying to convince himself)
                 I'm making more from the oil and timber
                 anyhow.
                      (further reassurance)
                 I'll stop.

     She interrogates his eyes for the truth.

                             AVA
                      (pleading eyes)
                 You will?  You promise?

                             YURI
                      (deadly serious)
                 Yes.
                      (changing the subject a
                       millisecond too fast)
                 Now get dressed.  We'll go out.

     Ava picks up the dress off the bed.

     Yuri gazes at her.

                             YURI (cont'd)
                 By the way, you're wrong about not being
                 pretty any more.

     She turns back and smiles.

     EXT.  FIFTH AVENUE AT CENTRAL PARK EAST.  DAY.

     A YOUNG INTERPOL AGENT, carrying a tray of coffee, approaches a
     plain panel van parked outside Yuri's apartment building.

                             YURI (V.O.)
                 For the next month I stopped running guns.
                 I went legitimate.

     The van door opens to reveal VALENTINE and other INTERPOL AGENTS,
     wearing headsets, monitoring a scanner device.  The agents read
     porn to keep themselves amused - except Valentine.

                             YURI (V.O.)
                 No wonder Valentine was confused.

     INT.  UPPER EAST SIDE APARTMENT.  DUSK.

     YURI toys with his old BULLET pendant as he talks on the phone.

     For once the spreadsheets in front of him deal with oil and timber.

                             YURI (V.O.)
                 Thank God there are still legal ways to
                 exploit developing countries.

     With the cordless phone to his ear, Yuri wanders to the kitchen.  He
     tosses the pendant down a trash chute.

     Back in the den, Yuri punches a calculator as he continues his phone
     call.

                             YURI (V.O.)
                 But the only problem with an honest buck is
                 they're so hard to make.  The margins are
                 too low.  Too many people are doing it.

     Finally we are privy to the conversation.

                             YURI
                      (into phone)
                 --Impossible.  Two and a quarter?  I can't
                 make a profit at two and a quarter.  Why
                 don't you take my oil and I'll fucking pay
                 you?

     Yuri hangs up, stares down from his apartment window.

     Valentine's panel truck drives away.

     LATER

     Night has fallen over Central Park - criss-crossed by a necklace of
     lights.  Yuri continues to stare out of the window.

     He is perplexed by the sight of a diplomatic motorcade parked in front of
     his building.

     Before he can make sense of it, the house phone rings.

     AVA enters.

                             AVA
                      (confused)
                 Yuri, the President of Liberia is in the
                 lobby.

     Yuri, stunned for a millisecond, recovers with a smile.

                             YURI
                      (glance to his watch)
                 He's early.

     INT.  LOBBY - UPPER EAST SIDE APARTMENT.  DAY.

     ANDRE BAPTISTE is admiring his new uniform in a gilt edged mirror.

     ANDRE JNR. is flirting with two TEENAGE GIRLS - residents of the
     building.  The perplexed DOORMAN stares at the motorcade outside his
     door - flashing lights on the police escort.

                             ANDRE JNR.
                      (to the girls)
                 --You should come to Liberia with me
                 tomorrow.  It is beautiful this time of
                 year.

                             TEENAGE GIRL
                 Liberia.  Is that on Long Island?

     YURI, ashen-faced, hurriedly exits the elevator into the ornate
     lobby - strides up to Andre Snr.

                             ANDRE JNR.
                 Yuri!

                             YURI
                      (nervous as hell)
                 What the fuck are you doing here, Andre?

                             ANDRE BAPTISTE
                      (hugging Yuri)
                 We're here for the peace talks at the U.N.

                             YURI
                      (pulling him out of earshot of the
                       curious Doorman, anxious whisper)
                 So at the same time you thought you'd drop
                 in on your arms dealer?!

                             ANDRE BAPTISTE
                 Is that what you still are?  You're a hard
                 man to get hold of all of a sudden.

                             YURI
                 I--

                             ANDRE BAPTISTE
                 --But now you mention it, we are doing a
                 little shopping while we're here - that is
                 if you open for business.

                             YURI
                      (anxious look past Andre to the motorcade
                       on the street)
                 They've got to be watching.

                             ANDRE BAPTISTE
                      (disdainful shrug)
                 Of course they blame me.  They always blame
                 me.  They are on a--

                             YURI
                      (unable to resist)
                 --hunt for a witch?

                             ANDRE BAPTISTE
                      (a smile, for once correcting
                       Yuri)
                 "Witch-hunt".  But I have been granted
                 diplomatic immunity due to the escalation
                 in hostilities.
                      (conspiratorial)
                 That is why I need you.  They are making
                 life difficult to re-supply.  It will
                 require a man of your unusual ingenuity.

                             YURI
                 I can't help you.  I'm sorry.

                             ANDRE BAPTISTE
                      (nods)
                 I understand.

     He shakes Yuri's hand firmly.

                             ANDRE BAPTISTE (cont'd)
                 But you should know that our present
                 difficulties compel us to be unusually
                 generous.

     Yuri realizes that Andre has placed a huge uncut diamond in his
     hand.

                             ANDRE BAPTISTE (cont'd)
                      (hugging Yuri)
                 Farewell, Lord of War.

                             ANDRE JNR.
                 You still haven't brought me the gun of
                 Rambo.

     Andre Baptiste and his son breeze out of the lobby.

     INT.  UPPER EAST SIDE APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM.  NIGHT.

     YURI enters, sits in an armchair.  AVA and NICOLAI are cuddled on
     the sofa - Ava reading him a fairytale.

                             AVA
                      (looking up from the book)
                 Was that about the oil or the timber?

                             YURI
                 Both.  Everything.

     Ava smiles, carries on reading.

     Yuri looks to his hand - we rack focus to the uncut diamond.  Yuri
     gets up.

     INT.  UPPER EAST SIDE APARTMENT - GARBAGE ROOM.  NIGHT.

     YURI, still in his suit, stands in a dumpster, searching.

                             YURI (V.O.)
                 At four and a half months a human fetus has
                 a reptile's tail - a remnant of our
                 evolution.

     Amongst a pile of rotten food he finds his necklace containing the
     BULLET.

                             YURI (V.O.)
                 You can fight a lot of enemies and survive
                 but if you fight your biology you always
                 lose.

     Yuri places the bullet around his neck.

     INT.  NEW YORK APARTMENT.  MORNING.

     AVA is fastening eight-year-old NICOLAI's coat, readying to go out.
     YURI, half-dressed, appears in the hallway.

                             YURI
                 Hey, not even waiting to say goodbye?  I'm
                 leaving in ten minutes.

                             AVA
                 Sorry, Nicki has swim practice.

     Nicolai kisses his father.

                             NICOLAI
                 Bye, Papa.

                             YURI
                      (hugging him)
                 See you, big guy.

     Ava kisses Yuri.

                             AVA
                      (teasing him)
                 Personally, I'm glad you're going.  You've
                 been here so long you're starting to get on
                 my nerves.

                             YURI
                      (taking the teasing good-
                       naturedly)
                 This oil concession should be wrapped up by
                 Thursday.  I'll be back for the weekend.
                 We'll go somewhere - the sea.

                             AVA
                 That would be fun.

     A thought occurs to Yuri.

                             YURI
                 You trust me, right?

     Yuri's turn to interrogate her eyes.  Ava smiles.

                             YURI (V.O.)
                 She looked me directly in the eye the way
                 I've looked in the eyes of a thousand
                 customs officials, government bureaucrats
                 and footsoldiers from every law enforcement
                 agency in the world - and she lied without
                 flinching.

                             AVA
                 Yes, I trust you.

                             YURI (V.O.)
                 She'd learned from the best.

     Ava gives Yuri a final kiss, hurries Nicolai out the door.

     INT.  MERCEDES SEDAN.  DAY.

     From the rear seat of a Mercedes sedan we observe YURI exiting the
     apartment building and entering a waiting Mercedes sedan of his own.

                             AVA (O.C.)
                      (to the DRIVER)
                 That's him.

     We reveal AVA and NICOLAI in the car.  Yuri's car pulls away and
     Ava's car follows.

                             NICOLAI
                      (confused)
                 Where are we going, Mama?

                             AVA
                 It's a game.

                             NICOLAI
                 Like hide and seek?

                             AVA
                 Yes.

     EXT.  PUBLIC STORAGE FACILITY.  DAY.

     YURI locks his storage locker, observable from the street, and exits
     the facility carrying a passport and briefcase.

                             YURI (V.O.)
                 I can always sense when I'm being tailed.  I
                 know what to look for.  But then I'd never
                 been tailed by the woman I love.

     Returning to his car, Yuri fails to notice that AVA has witnessed
     his routine from her own car.

     Instead of following the car, Ava exits with Nicolai.

     INT.  PUBLIC STORAGE FACILITY.  DAY.

     AVA, NICOLAI in tow, approaches Yuri's locker.

     She tries a combination - fails.  Tries another - fails.  A third -
     same result.

                             YURI (V.O.)
                 I can put myself in Ava's place.  She might
                 have understood if the combination was the
                 last four digits of my social, my birthdate,
                 even her birthdate but not Nicolai's.

     Ava looks to Nicolai, tries one more combination, reluctantly.

     CLOSE ON the numerals on the lock - "10...6..."

                             YURI (V.O.)
                 My son's birthday unlocked what the government
                 would later describe as, "a catalogue of
                 carnage".

     "90".  The lock opens.

                             AVA
                      (whisper, to herself)
                 Not that.  Not that, Yuri.

     Ava opens the storage room door - at first struck by the exhibition
     of her paintings inside the locker.  Shaking the image from her
     head, she turns her attention to the briefcases and other documents.

     She shuffles through the passports in horror - different photos of
     Yuri, different names: "George Eagleman", "Georges D'Aigle", etc.  Who
     is her husband?  Is he any of them?

     INT.  "THE CRIMEAN" RESTAURANT - DAY.

     VITALY is back at work in the kitchen of the family restaurant.

     YURI approaches - Vitaly senses something amiss.

                             VITALY
                 Come to see how the other half lives?

                             YURI
                 I miss your borscht.  Mom and Dad say you're
                 clean.

                             VITALY
                 You too.  They said you went legitimate -
                 hard to believe.

                             YURI
                 That's because it's not true.

     Vitaly is hardly surprised.

     Yuri glances to his parents, ANATOLY and IRINA, at the restaurant
     counter, folding napkins - observing their two sons.

     They avert their eyes.

                             YURI
                 Only you know.  I'm leaving tonight - on a
                 job.  I want you to come.

                             VITALY
                 I can't.  I'm thinking of opening my own
                 place.

                             YURI
                 Maybe this trip will help.  It's good money.

                             VITALY
                      (looking to his parents)
                 I've given my word.

                             YURI
                 They don't have to know.  We'll tell them
                 we're going for a little "r" and "r".

                             VITALY
                 Why do you need me all of a sudden?

                             YURI
                 West Africa's fucked-up.
                      (off Vitaly's look)
                 More than usual.  I can't trust anybody.  I
                 need someone to watch my back.

     The notion touches Vitaly.  Yuri closes the deal.

                             YURI (cant'd)
                 "Brothers in arms".

     Vitaly looks to his PARENTS.  They stare at him until he averts his
     eyes.

     Vitaly can't refuse his brother.

     EXT.  HIGHWAY - SIERRA LEONE.  DAY.

     A fork in the road.  Two large trucks slog through the bush -
     take the left fork.

                                                        Sierra Leone - 2000

     YURI, VITALY and ANDRE JNR. are in the cab of the truck, beside the
     DRIVER.

     Andre is admiring his new M60 machine gun with attachable grenade
     launcher - the gun of Rambo.

                             YURI
                      (concerned by the route)
                 Where are we going?

                             ANDRE JNR.
                 RUF - "freedom fighters".

     Yuri stares out of the window.

                             YURI (V.O.)
                 Every faction in Africa calls themselves by
                 these noble names - "liberation-this",
                 "patriotic-that", "democratic-republic-of-
                 something or other".  I guess they can't own
                 up to what they usually are - "federation-
                 of-worse-oppressors-than-the last-bunch-of-
                 oppressors".  Often the most barbaric
                 atrocities occur when both combatants
                 proclaim themselves "freedom fighters".

     The truck passes a checkpoint marked by two skulls.

     EXT.  REFUGEE CAMP - SIERRA LEONE.  DAY.

     A tent city.  A Jeep packed with young, machete-wielding FREEDOM
     FIGHTERS circles the refugee camp, taunting and terrorizing the
     inhabitants.

     The mostly WOMEN and CHILDREN are trapped by the circling Jeep.
     Whenever a refugee attempts to escape, they are driven back by the
     increasingly manic, shrieking rebels.

     Yuri's two trucks are parked on the roadway above the camp where the rest
     of the REBELS are massed - a rag-tag mob wearing over-sized sneakers,
     carrying machetes and the occasional AK-47.

     At a small folding table a REBEL LEADER negotiates with YURI and
     ANDRE JNR.  The Leader places a pile of uncut diamonds on the table.

     VITALY is more interested in the camp - observing the circling Jeep
     full of Rebels and their smirking comrades on the highway.

     From a distance, he spies a WOMAN and YOUNG SON make a desperate bid
     for escape from the camp.  Two REBELS, on foot, give chase.  The
     woman appears to be pregnant.

     Vitaly watches in horror.  The Woman is quickly overtaken and hacked
     to death.  Then the Boy.  Vitaly can't look, turns away.

                             VITALY
                 Jesus.

     Vitaly comes to a horrific realization.

     He hurries to Yuri, still negotiating with the Rebel Leader.

                             VITALY
                 Yuri, I need to talk to you.

                             YURI
                 Not now.

                             VITALY
                      (insistent)
                 Now.

                             YURI
                      (to the Rebel Leader)
                 Excuse me.

     Vitaly draws Yuri out of earshot.

                             YURI
                      (irritated by the interruption)
                 What?

                             VITALY
                      (anxious whisper)
                 We can't do this deal.

                             YURI
                      (incredulous)
                 The fuck we can't.

                             VITALY
                      (referring to the camp)
                 Look over there.  As soon as we leave,
                 they're going to die.

                             YURI
                      (averting his eyes from the camp)
                 It's not our business.

                             VITALY
                      (protesting)
                 They killed a boy just now - as young as
                 Nicki.

     Yuri flinches.

     The suspicious Rebel Leader and Andre Jnr. approach the two
     brothers.

                             REBEL LEADER
                 What's the hold up?

                             YURI
                      (trying to keep his poise)
                 There is no hold up.  I'll be right there.

     Yuri draws Vitaly further away.

                             YURI (cont'd)
                 Vitaly, it's what we always know - we can't
                 control what they do.

                             VITALY
                 Today we can.  They're right there - close
                 enough to touch.

                             YURI
                      (angry, impatient)
                 What do you think they'll do if we back out
                 - they'll kill us.

                             VITALY
                 And if we go ahead - they'll kill them.

     The Rebel Leader approaches again - this time he's not leaving.

                             REBEL LEADER
                 What is he saying?

                             YURI
                 Nothing.

     Vitaly realizes the futility of the discussion, backs down.

                             VITALY
                      (resigned)
                 Nothing.  You're right, Yuri.  You're right.
                      (getting his head back in the
                       game)
                 Did I hear you say 300 IPG's, 500 assault
                 rifles and 800 grenades?  I thought it was
                 1,200 grenades.  I'd better check.

     Yuri pats his brother on the back, returns to the negotiating table.
     Vitaly heads for the trucks.

     For once we follow Vitaly.  Andre Jnr. regards Vitaly warily.

     INT.  TRUCK.  DAY.

     The prongs of a hammer on a box of grenades.  VITALY is prying open
     the lid.

     Andre Jnr. appears behind him - M60 poised ominously on his hip.

                             ANDRE JNR.
                 What are you doing?

                             VITALY
                 Something for Yuri.

                             ANDRE JNR.
                 Step away - slowly.

     Vitaly closes the lid - a ruse.  He picks up the hammer and in one
     sudden, violent motion swings it across Andre's face, smashing his
     jaw, teeth flying, Andre's body flopping like a rag doll.

     Vitaly grabs two grenades from the box, pulls the pin from one and
     bowls it into the truck.

     He runs.

     The truck explodes in a fireball - instantly incinerating Andre Jnr.

     Yuri's head whips around.  The Rebel Leader's head whips around.

                             YURI
                 Vit!!

     Vitaly dashes for the second truck.

     The REBEL LEADER opens fire, raking Vitaly with machine-gun fire -
     still trying to run with legs torn to shreds.

                             YURI (cont'd)
                 No!!

     A second hail of gunfire - all REBELS firing.  Vitaly's legs betray
     him.  He collapses to the ground in a pile of blood and dust.

     We focus on Vitaly's still FACE - he has taken enough bullets to
     kill him three times over.  But he is not quite dead.

     Agonizingly slow, he raises the grenade hand to his mouth - pulls
     the pin with his teeth.

     CLOSE on Vitaly's HAND, trying to summon the strength to throw the
     grenade.

     A hand appears, grasps Vitaly's hand - gently but firmly removing
     the grenade.

     YURI.

     The Rebels keep their guns trained on Yuri, unsure where his
     loyalties lie.  Yuri holds the fate of the camp in his hands - he
     could still toss the grenade, destroy the second truck, sacrifice
     his life.

     Yuri stares to his brother and then to the grenade in his hand.  He
     reaches down and delicately takes the pin from between Vitaly's
     lips.

     The eyes of the brothers meet for the last time.  Yuri inserts the
     pin into the grenade, disarming it - the life goes from Vitaly's
     eyes forever.

     Yuri removes any last doubt by tossing the disarmed grenade to the
     Rebel Leader.

     Yuri walks away from Vitaly's dead body and returns to the
     negotiating table - Yuri now the living dead.  The Rebel Leader
     looks to the two trucks - one burning, one not.  He removes half of
     the diamonds from the table.

     EXT.  TRUCK.  DAY.

     YURI sits in the cab, staring out of the window as the truck drives
     away.

                             YURI (V.O.)
                 Vitaly broke the cardinal rule of
                 gunrunning.  Never pick up a gun and join
                 the customers.

     The truck turns the bend.  In the background, true to Vitaly's
     prediction, the rebels descend on the tent village, firing
     indiscriminately with their new weapons.

     Yuri hears the sound - we detect a barely perceptible flinch.

     INT.  REAR OF TRUCK.  DAY.

     A lone gun crate, emptied of its contents has been put to use as
     VITALY's makeshift coffin.

                             YURI (V.O.)
                 Coffins are hard to come by in Sierra Leone.
                 Demand is so high.  Fortunately, we had a lot
                 of boxes just the right size.

     EXT.  SIERRA LEONE MARKET.  DAY.

     "America's Funniest Home Videos" plays on a TV set.  The canned
     laughter appears to be almost directed at YURI who is making a long-
     distance call on a geriatric telephone.

     We aren't privy to the conversation.

                             YURI (V.O.)
                 I don't know which is worse, Jewish guilt or
                 Catholic guilt.  My parents were like God's
                 tag-team.

     We pull back to reveal the makeshift coffin sitting at Yuri's feet.

                             YURI (V.O.)
                 But I could not deny them the chance to say
                 goodbye to their eldest son.

     INT.  J.F.K. AIRPORT - CUSTOMS BAY.  DAY.

     CLOSE ON the screen of an X-RAY machine.  Innocuous oversize cargo
     passes in front of the screen - a surfboard, a double bass, then the
     crate containing VITALY's body.

                             YURI (V.O.)
                 For twenty Monrovian dollars a doctor removed the
                 lead from Vitaly's body and wrote a bogus death
                 certificate.  I should have paid more.

     The OPERATOR of the machine, stops the conveyor belt.

                             YURI (V.O.)
                 I've smuggled millions of rounds of
                 ammunition and the bullet that lands me in
                 jail is found under my dead brother's rib.

     In Vitaly's chest, a bullet.

     INT.  J.F.K. AIRPORT - CONVEYOR BELT.  DAY.

     The other oversize items move down the conveyor belt for collection
     - YURI waits with two burly PORTERS.

     No other items are appearing - finally the coffin containing VITALY.

     Two ATF AGENTS appear behind Yuri.

                             AGENT
                      (flashing some ID)
                 Yuri Orlov, we're with the Bureau of
                 Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms.

                             YURI
                      (resigned smile, regarding the
                       insignia on their jackets)
                 Believe it or not, I only use the first two.

     The agents are not amused - handcuff Yuri.

                             AGENT
                 You have the right to remain silent.  Use
                 it.

     They march him away.

     INT.  NEW YORK APARTMENT.  DAY.

     A phone rings.

     AVA, out in the hallway, surrounded by suitcases, looks to the
     phone, senses the identity of the caller.

     She hustles NICOLAI out of the door, closes it behind her.  The
     phone continues to ring.

     INT.  MANHATTAN CENTRAL JAIL.  DAY.

     YURI, on a payphone, in the jailhouse corridor, reluctantly hangs
     up.  He makes another call.

     INT.  "THE CRIMEAN" RESTAURANT - BRIGHTON BEACH.  DAY.

     ANATOLY, lighting a candle, picks up the phone.

                             ANATOLY
                 "Crimean Restaurant".

                             YURI (O.C.)
                 Papa?

     Anatoly looks at the telephone receiver in his hand - without
     another word he passes the phone to IRINA.  ANATOLY walks away.

                             IRINA
                      (into phone)
                 Both my sons are dead.

     INT.  INTERVIEW ROOM.  DAY.

     CLOSE ON a SLUG in an evidence bag tossed onto a table - by VALENTINE.  The
     Agent can scarcely contain his excitement.

     YURI sits at the small table, stares at the slug.

                             VALENTINE
                 One of yours?

     Yuri doesn't take the bait.

     Two other AGENTS sit at the back of the room observe the
     interrogation.

                             VALENTINE (cont'd)
                      (referring to a document)
                 Curiously, the death certificate says he
                 died of heart failure.

                             YURI
                      (shrug)
                 Maybe he did.
                      (referring to the slug)
                 If I saw one of those coming at me, l'd have
                 heart failure.

     The flippant comment gets under Valentine's skin but he keeps his
     temper in check.

                             VALENTINE
                 We performed the autopsy and released your
                 brother's body to your family.  You tried
                 to do something decent, Yuri.  You went
                 against your nature.  And now it's cost you.
                      (unable to resist)
                 Your brother's funeral is looking a lot like
                 your funeral.

                             YURI
                 Falsifying a death certificate?  That's not
                 going to hold me.

                             VALENTINE
                 You're right, as usual.

     Yuri not so cocky now - waits to see where this is going.

                             VALENTINE (cont'd)
                      (putting a copy of the New York
                       Times in front of Yuri)
                 Have you seen today's paper?

     A front photograph of VALENTINE posing beside Yuri's documents including
     his five BRIEFCASES.  The headline reads, "MERCHANT OF DEATH IN CUSTODY".
     Caption - "Catalogue of carnage."

                             VALENTINE (cont'd)
                      (pacing, lauding it over Yuri)
                 Fake end-user certificates, cut-out
                 companies, all meticulously catalogued.
                 There's hardly a dictator, warlord or despot
                 anywhere in the world you aren't on first
                 name terms with.
                      (producing another evidence bag
                       containing Ava's diamond earrings
                       and an engagement ring)
                 Your trophy wife gave us the prize.  She
                 also provided us with these - which we
                 suspect are conflict diamonds.

     Yuri takes all this in.

                             VALENTINE (cont'd)
                 She has agreed to testify against you.

     Yuri nods - picks up the newspaper.  But instead of reading about
     his own front page news, he opens the paper, turns to World Affairs
     - various items on the warzones at the end of the millennium.

     Yuri reads, takes his time.  Valentine cannot believe his audacity.

     Finally Yuri reacts.  A broad smile - his killer smile.

                             YURI
                 Enjoy it.

                             VALENTINE
                      (confused)
                 What?

                             YURI
                 This.  Tell me that I am everything you
                 despise, that I am the personification of
                 evil, that I'm responsible for the breakdown
                 of the social fabric of society and world
                 order, that I am a one man genocide.  Say
                 everything you want to say to me now -
                 because you don't have long.

     Valentine is infuriated by Yuri's casual demeanor.

                             VALENTINE
                 Are you not paying attention or are you
                 delusional?  You've broken every arms
                 embargo written.  There's enough in those
                 briefcases to buy you consecutive life
                 sentences.  You'll spend ten years going
                 from a cell to a courtroom before you even
                 start doing your time.

     Yuri is looking away, apparently completely unconcerned.  His
     attitude further angers Valentine.

                             VALENTINE (cont'd)
                 You don't seem to fully appreciate the
                 seriousness of your situation!

                             YURI
                      (snapping back - his emotion
                       finally showing)
                 My family has disowned me.  My wife and son
                 have left me.  My brother is dead.  Trust
                 me, I fully appreciate the seriousness of my
                 situation.  But I promise you I won't spend
                 a single second in a courtroom.

     Valentine laughs derisively.

                             VALENTINE
                 You are delusional.

     Yuri is still unfazed.  He leans forward to close the deal.

                             YURI
                 I like you, Jack.  Well, maybe not.  But I
                 understand you.  You feel your loyalty to
                 your badge has finally been rewarded.  But
                 you haven't counted on the people who gave
                 you that badge.

     Valentine's turn to hesitate.

                             YURI (cont'd)
                      (meeting Valentine's gaze)
                 Let me tell you what's going to happen so
                 you can prepare yourself.

     Yuri nods to the interview room door.

                             YURI (cont'd)
                 Soon there's going to be a knock on that
                 door and you're going to be called outside.

     A montage of scenes - Yuri's prediction plays out accompanied by his
     commentary.

     INT.  INTERVIEW ROOM.  DAY.

     A knock at the door and an AGENT nods to VALENTINE.

                             YURI (O.C.)
                 In the hall there will be a man who
                 outranks you.

     INT.  HALLWAY - JAIL.  DAY.

     Sure enough, a decorated military OFFICER talks to VALENTINE in the
     hallway as Yuri describes.

                             YURI (O.C.)
                 First, he will compliment you on the fine
                 job you've done, how you're making the world
                 a safer place and then he is going to tell
                 you that I am to be released.

     We observe valentine's reaction - vigorously arguing with his
     superior.

                             YURI (O.C.)
                 You are going to protest, you will probably
                 threaten to resign.

     The Officer, still turned away from us, tries to calm Valentine.

     INT.  HALLWAY - JAIL.  DAY.

     The door to the interview room opens.

                             YURI (O.C.)
                 But in the end I will be released.

     Yuri exits the cell to freedom.

     We return to the present.

     INT.  INTERVIEW ROOM.  DAY.

     VALENTINE's eyes burn into YURI.

                             YURI
                      (glancing to the open newspaper)
                 The reason I'll be released is the same
                 reason you think I will be convicted.  I do
                 rub shoulders with the most vile, sadistic
                 men calling themselves leaders today.
                      (referring to the newspaper)
                 But some of those men are the enemies of
                 your enemies.

     Valentine is starting to get a sick feeling.

                             YURI (cont'd)
                 And while the biggest arms dealer in the world
                 is your boss, the President of the United
                 States - who ships more merchandise in a day
                 than I do in a year - sometimes it's
                 embarrassing to have his fingerprints on the
                 guns.  Sometimes he needs a freelancer like me
                 to supply opposition forces he can't be seen
                 supplying.  You call me evil, but,
                 unfortunately for you, I am a necessary evil.

     There is a long silence.  Then,

     A KNOCK AT THE DOOR.

     Valentine and Yuri exchange a look.  Valentine rises from the desk.

                             VALENTINE
                 I would tell you to go to hell.  But I think
                 you're already there.

     Valentine turns on his heel.  He is at the door when Yuri finally
     replies.

                             YURI
                 What if I'm not?  What if I sleep fine at
                 night?  What if I sleep better than you? I
                 think that's what truly scares you.

     Valentine doesn't look back, exits.  Sure enough, the Officer is in
     the hall as Yuri predicted - COLONEL SOUTHERN.

     EXT.  MANHATTAN JAIL - REAR EXIT.  DAY.

     A car trunk closes on Yuri's five briefcases and other documents.

     YURI is escorted out the rear entrance of the city jail to the nondescript
     sedan by COLONEL SOUTHERN.  As he's ushered into the car, Southern hands
     Yuri yet another briefcase.

     COLONEL SOUTHERN ushers Yuri into the car, hands him yet another briefcase
     as the car door closes.

     INT.  NONDESCRIPT SEDAN.  DAY.

     YURI rides alone with the briefcase on his lap.

                             YURI (V.O.)
                 Most people are happy just to get out of
                 jail.  I expect to be paid to leave.

     Yuri opens the case - BALES OF CASH.

                             YURI (V.O.)
                 I'm not a fool.  I know that just because they
                 need me one day doesn't mean they won't make
                 me a scapegoat the next.  But I was back doing
                 what I do best.

     EXT.  MANHATTAN.  DAY.

     The nondescript sedan melts into rush-hour traffic.

     EXT.  SOMEWHERE IN THE MIDDLE EAST - DESERT CHECKPOINT.  DAY.

     A checkpoint in the desert - the fence a literal line in the sand.

     YURI accompanies a convoy of trucks.  He is joking with a BORDER
     OFFICER - back to doing what he loves.

     The Border Officer inspects the crates in a truck, reads the
     manifest marked, "UMBRELLAS - QTY: 4,040 units".

                             BORDER OFFICER
                      (skeptical)
                 Umbrellas - to Saudi Arabia?

                             YURI
                 Sun umbrellas.

     Yuri hands the Officer a plain, brown paper bag.  The Officer looks inside
     - a wad of cash.

                             BORDER OFFICER
                 Have a safe trip.

     The Officer waves the convoy through.

     EXT.  DESERT - BATTLEFIELD.  DAY.

     The desert where we first found YURI, the aftermath of a battle.  He
     speaks directly to camera once again.

                             YURI
                 For someone who's never fired a gun or been
                 in a battle, I have suffered many
                 casualties in my life.  I guess that's how I
                 survived.  I never went to war...

     His thought is interrupted by a burst of gunfire.

                             YURI (cont'd)
                 ...especially with myself.

     Yuri walks away through the charred munitions and black smoke.
     In the distance the sound of sporadic gunfire.

                                                 February 2007

           FADE IN ON:
                         
          THE DESERT. Sizzling dunes. Harsh. Unforgiving.
                         
          Afghanistan - Three Years Ago
                         
          We hear faint SCREAMS. A man BEGGING...
                         
           MAN (O.S.)
           No... please... There's no way...
                         
          Sand dunes stretch to the horizon. Nowhere to run...
                         
           MAN (O.S.) (CONT'D)
           Nothing... can defeat...
          A SHADOW FALLS across the sand. Then a second. One looks
          like a Dog's Head. The other like...
                         
           MAN (O.S.) (CONT'D)
           Gojira.
                         
          HAND PUPPET SHADOWS. LAUGHTER from OTHER MEN. "Godzilla"
          pursues "Dog Head", catches him, and begins HUMPING HIM.
                         
           MAN (O.S.) (CONT'D)
           Ooooh, Gojira! You the best! Me
           love you long time!

          bicep, his NINE MONTH OLD DAUGHTER'S FACE tattooed on his

           The Pooch can rest easy, I was

          WHIP PAN and FREEZE FRAME ON:
                         
          Cougar. Age unknown. Tan camo cowboy hat pulled low
          over his eyes, long hair. Sniper Rock-God. He doesn't

           It's Liar's Poker, Jensen, how in

           you at Liar's Poker?

          Roque. 30's. Close cropped black hair. If Lance
          Armstrong bred with Darth Vader. Doesn't smile much, but
          he's smiling now. The four are in
                         
          EXT. HUMVEE -- DAY
                         
          Open air, the guys sit in the back. In the middle of the
          desert with nothing to do but wait. Roque holds the deck.
                         
                          ROQUE
           Cards.
          The four take them. Lick the back, slap them to their
          foreheads -- two deuces (Jensen and Roque), a three
          (Pooch), and an eight (Cougar). Pitiful cards.
                         
                          JENSEN
           Got a feeling about this one, Roque.
                         
                          ROQUE
           Your mama had that feeling too.

          ...and tosses it into the center of the circle. HIS BET.
          Roque responds by tossing a .357 MAGNUM from his belt in.

          He puts in a Desert Eagle. Jensen pulls a second, meaner
          looking knife. Twirling it.
                          JENSEN
           This even me up?
                         
                          ROQUE
           Exactly how many knives do you
           have, anyway?
                         
          Jensen grins and STABS IT down into the pot.
                         
                          POOCH
           Cougar - your bet.
                         
          The Silent Man stares at the others. Two deuces and a
          three. He shakes his head at them. Before he can bet...

                          CLAY

          STATIC. Clay hits the send button to respond - gets a
          SQUELCH. Cursing, tossing the radio to Jensen:
                          CLAY
           Shit! Jensen, call the General at
           the Firebase, get him to abort-

          His face, stricken. They all are. And then:
                         
                          CLAY
           There's something we can do.
                         
          Clay hefts his rifle.
                         
          The others stare at him. Automatically begin checking
          their own weapons. Roque runs it down for them:
                         
                          ROQUE
           Five against a fortress, and we've

          A SERIES OF SHOTS -- We see just how good these guys are.
          Cougar on his knee in the back -- snipes SINGLE SHOT KILLS --
          takes out SEVEN MEN. Roque pulls to a halt in the center
          of the compound -- Bad Guys, coming out of the woodwork
          with AUTOMATIC WEAPONS. As the guys hop out:
                         
                          CLAY
           Pooch and Jensen, get a truck for

          Clay leads ZONE COVERAGE toward the building -- Roque and
          Cougar run middle -- QUICK DEATH STRIKES. Images BLAST
          fast and savage as these men KILL THEIR WAY INTO THE FORT.
                         
          INT. AL GHOZAR FORT - KHYBER PASS - CONTINUOUS
                         
          Roque calmly kicks in the door -- kills FIVE MEN sitting
          around a table with TWO YOUNG GIRLS in the middle -- the
          terrified girls run to him. The BAD GUYS have no chance --
          Fast. Precise. SPECTACULAR. Our crew takes the fort.
                         
          MOVING THROUGH a tight hallway, they find the children
          locked in a large empty room. They start leading them
          out. One LITTLE BOY stops Clay. In PASHTUN:
                         
                          LITTLE BOY
           
                         
          Clay checks the time. 3 MINUTES TO AIRSTRIKE...
                         
                          CLAY
           (to Roque and Cougar)
           Get 'em out.
                         
          Roque and Cougar hustle the kids toward the exit while
          Clay moves DOWNSTAIRS into the darker sublevels...
                         
          INT. AL GHOZAR FORT -- DARKER SUBLEVEL -- CONTINUOUS
                         
          Clay kicks in a door to find A MAN - Looming over a
          SHACKLED BOY. Unbuckling his pants.
                         
          The Man pales. Realizing the American understands what
          he was about to do, backing away, BEGGING IN PASHTUN:
                          PERVERT
           
                         
          Omar DOESN'T MOVE. Instead, he eerily raises his hand
          and wordlessly POINTS TO A CELL. In the corner. And
          Clay hears a MOAN emit from it. VAGUELY HUMAN.
                         
          Omar lowers his arm. Goes upstairs, dragging his bear.
           10.
                         
          Clay turns. Approaches the cell. Looks down into it...
          it's clear from Clay's face that it's SOMETHING HORRIFIC.
                         
                          SOMETHING HORRIFIC

           Max is rogue?
                         
          Something Horrific leans forward out of the shadows...
                         
                          SOMETHING HORRIFIC
           You're off-mission aren't you?

           SOMETHING HORRIFIC (CONT'D)

           Max doesn't care about Fadhil...
           He's cleaning up the mess. You're
           his mop. I'm the mission....
                         
          Clay's just staring into the burning, crazed eyes of
          Something Horrific.
                         
           SOMETHING HORRIFIC (CONT'D)

          BLAM! A BULLET pierces what used to be left of Something
          Horrific's CHEST. Not fired by Clay...
                         
           SOMETHING HORRIFIC (CONT'D)
           Thaaaank...
                         
          And he dies. Clay turns - COUGAR. Lowers his rifle.
          Speaks one word.
                         
                          COUGAR

          Clay and Cougar BURST from the fort, FIRING and RUNNING
          FULL TILT towards the commandeered TRUCK LOADED WITH KIDS.
          As they leap into the back, Pooch hits the gas:
                         
                          POOCH
           Jesus, you stop for coffee in there?
                         
          As he RUNS OVER two Bad Guys trying to stop them at the
          gate. The sound of a JET APPROACHING. Roque to Jensen:
                         
                          ROQUE
           What kind of blast radius we looking

          Jensen, calculating on the computer tablet. Shows an

          IN THE MIDDLE OF THE FIRESTORM: All Pooch can see is
          FLAMES through the WINDSHIELD as they plow through the

          Cougar's sleeve, FULLY ABLAZE. He casually rips it off
          and tosses it out the back.
                         
          THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD - The fire clears... to reveal a
          30 FOOT DROP. The guys scream as they PLUNGE OVER IT...

          Silence. Smoke rises from a crater that was once the
          Fort. The doors of the truck creak open. Most of the
          YOUNGSTERS GIGGLE. Fun ride. As the guys help them out:

           Yeah, that was great, wasn't it?

          Sounds of a BLACKHAWK CHOPPER APPROACHING...

           13.
                         
          A beat. Clay seems to shake off his daze as the BLACKHAWK
          sets down. Walking up to the chopper:
                         
                          CLAY

          Clay's eyes dart down to the Pilot's neck. A SILVER
          CRUCIFIX hangs around it. Clay, softer:
                         
                          CLAY
           You really want to leave twenty
           three kids in the desert to die?
                         
          A beat.

           Then it's them.
                         
          The Pilot nods. Our guys begin loading the kids on...

          Clay helps Omar on last. The kid looks at him. He knows
          perfectly well what Clay saved him from in that basement.

          Clay nods. A beat. The Pilot pulls the stick back and
          the CHOPPER ASCENDS. The kids wave goodbye to our guys.
                         
          Omar, holding Clay's gaze as they rise. Only broken as
          the chopper begins to recede into the distance. The last
          Clay sees of him is that ratty little TEDDY BEAR...

          Roque shield their faces from them instinctually.
                         
                          ROQUE
           I can't take much more of this.
                          CLAY
           We're on the run. It occasionally
                          INVOLVES RUNNING-
                         
                          ROQUE
           I'm serious. Grinding out lunch
           money on five dollar sports bets,
           wincing everytime some overly Aqua-
           netted cow stares at my face for
           more than two seconds-
                          (DELICATELY)
           I'm at the point where I'm thinking
           we ought to try to reach out to
           the Company...
                         
                          CLAY
           All we did was say the word "Max"
           and they blew up a building. CIA
           even gets a whiff of where we're
           at, they'll call in an airstrike.
           (shakes his head)
           Until we figure out how we can
           take Max down and get clear, we
           lay low.
                         
          A Metro Dade POLICE CRUISER rolls into the McDonald's.
          Clay watches close as it pulls into a parking spot...
                         
                          ROQUE
           Due respect, you're nobody's Colonel
           anymore.
                         
                          CLAY
           Anytime you want to move along you
           go right ahead-
           22.
                         
                          ROQUE
           Like the others? Least I still
           talk to them. You pushed them
           away. "Max this, Max that" - we
           never even saw the guy, Clay-
                         
                          CLAY
           We heard his voice. Guy with a
           voice is a guy with a throat. And
           if he's got a throat...
                         
                          ROQUE
                          (IN DISBELIEF)
           We're hiding out in the parking
           lot of a goddamn McDonald's--You
           actually think we're in any position
           to take on some shadowy CIA super-
           spook?
                         
                          CLAY
                          ROQUE-
                         
                          ROQUE
           No, it's a stellar plan - we can
           use this as our base of ops!
           (gestures to the
                          PLAYGROUND)
           Pooch can run the motor pool out
           of the ball pit and Jensen can set
           up communications by the slide!
                         
          Clay, seeing one of the COPS say something to the other...
                         
                          CLAY
           Go.
          Roque FIRES UP THE ENGINE as the COPS get out of the
          cruiser. Pulling smoothly into the street...
                         
          EXT. MOTEL SIX -- AFTERNOON
                         
          Roque pulls up to their shitbeater Motel. Tension still
          between them. He gets out, turning back to his friend:
                         
                          ROQUE
           I was there too. I remember. But
           he won. We lost.
                          (PAUSE)
           Maybe it's time for a new game.
           23.
                         
          With that, Roque heads to the Motel. Clay looks down at
          his quarter eaten burger. He needs some real food...
                         
          INT. BUSTER'S BOOZE & BURGERS
                         
          Clay at the bar, eating a steak and drinking alone. Honky-
          tonk on the juke, mix of sawdust and blood on the floor.
                         
          A YOUNG WOMAN enters - she's hot, feels familiar. Clay
          eyes her as she orders a drink, dodges several GUYS.
                         
           PARTICULARLY OFFENSIVE GUY
           Yabba Dabba Doo...
                         
          She catches Clay's eye. Rolls her eyes. Clay's paying
          more attention to his T-Bone than the girl. She slides
          up next to him. Her name's AISHA.
                         
                          AISHA
           Men.
                         
          Clay turns back to his food. Not used to attractive women
          instigating conversation. Aisha watches as Clay eats.
                         
                          AISHA (CONT'D)
           How's the steak?
                         
                          CLAY
           Meaty.
                         
          She's still watching him. It's getting annoying.
                         
                          CLAY (CONT'D)
           Want a bite?
                          AISHA
           I don't eat red meat.
                         
                          CLAY
           Why not?
                         
                          AISHA
           Slows me down.
                         
                          CLAY
           Okay.
                         
          Aisha studies Clay. If we've been paying close attention,
          we might ID her as the race track binocular chick. We're
          not sure if Clay does.
           24.
                         
                          AISHA
           You got nice arms.
                         
                          CLAY
           (turning to her)
           I know you?
                         
                          AISHA
           Relax, slugger... I like arms.
           That's all.
                         
                          CLAY
           Do I not look relaxed?
                         
                          AISHA
           No.
                          (PAUSE)
           Think we can change that?
                         
           SMASH CUT TO:
                         
          INT. HOLLYWOOD, FL. - GOLD COAST MOTEL - LATER
                         
          Clay and Aisha enter his motel room. Aisha checks out
          the sparse accommodations.
                         
                          AISHA
                          (DEADPAN)
           Wow, it's everything a girl could
           dream of. Got a bathroom?
                         
                          CLAY
           No, I specifically requested the
           only hotel room in the world that
           doesn't have a bathroom.
                          AISHA
           You lookin' to turn a "yes" into a
           "no" here?
                         
          Clay points to the bathroom.
                         
          INT. HOLLYWOOD, FL - GOLD COAST - BEDROOM / BATHROOM
                         
          Aisha checks herself in the mirror. A touch of lip gloss.
                         
                          AISHA
           So what brings you to Florida?
                         
          Clay IN THE BEDROOM. Leans over - stretching his
          hamstrings. Does a few subtle twists - Loosening up.
           25.
                         
                          CLAY
           Convention.
                         
           AISHA (O.S.)
           Convention for what?
                         
          Shit. Clay looks around. Weakly:
                         
                          CLAY
           ...Air conditioners.
                         
          IN THE BATHROOM - Aisha studies herself in the mirror.
          Stretching her arms, prepping for some physical activity...
                         
                          AISHA
           They have whole conventions devoted
           to air conditioners?
                         
          IN THE BEDROOM
                         
                          CLAY
           You'd be surprised.
                         
          Aisha comes back out. Both now stretched and loose.
                         
                          AISHA
           Bet I would. Where were we?
                         
          They study each other. Aisha slowly moves towards Clay.
                         
                          CLAY
           You were about to tell me how much
           you enjoy spending time at the dog
           track...
          Aisha smiles, tracing her fingers down his stomach...
                         
                          AISHA
           Saw me there did you?
                         
          Clay strokes her cheek...
                         
                          CLAY
           Uh-huh...
                         
                          AISHA
           Didn't see me at the McDonald's
           though...
                         
          Their lips, inches from touching...
           26.
                         
                          AISHA (CONT'D)
           I have a proposition for you...
                         
          WHAM! Clay DECKS HER. She REELS BACK -- LOADED GLOCK up
          and out and -- Clay ducks left -- BACKHANDS HER with his
          forearm -- sends her FLYING across the room -- PAUSE.
          Both breathing hard. Staring at one another:
                         
                          AISHA (CONT'D)
           Just hear me out. I don't want to
           hurt you.
                         
                          CLAY
           You're not going to.
                         
                          AISHA
           Yes, I am.
                         
          He foot-plants, spins, re-attacks and IT IS ON! INSANELY
          VISCOUS: tearing the room to utter shreds. Fists
          SMASHING. A FACE KICK, plaster SMASHES.
                         
          She HURLS a twenty six inch color TELEVISION at him.
          This EXPLODES against a wall. Sparks give to flame as
          the room starts to burn hot around these two warriors...
                         
          They continue to fight like RABID WOLVES. And they're
          GRINNING. Enjoying this. THEN FREEZE --
                         
          AISHA ON TOP OF CLAY -- Each has a BUCK KNIFE up and tight
          against the other's throat. Blades on skin. TIE GAME.
          Neither giving. FLAMES AROUND THEM:
                         
                          AISHA (CONT'D)
           Room's on fire.
                          CLAY
           Noticed. What do you want?
                         
                          AISHA
           Your life. Back.
                         
          Clay spits blood and sucks air.
                         
                          CLAY
           You want to clarify that?
                         
                          AISHA
           Max. I can help you.
           27.
                         
          This clearly has effect on Clay - Substantial Effect.
          Clay stares up at Aisha. FLAMES ALL AROUND THEM...
                         
                          CLAY
           I'm listening.
                         
          EXT. HOLLYWOOD, FL STREETS -- NIGHT
                         
          Clay and Aisha walk away from the BURNING MOTEL.
                         
                          CLAY
           How'd you find me?
                         
                          AISHA
           It's not too tough if you know
           where to look. You guys aren't
           exactly subtle.
                         
          A FIRE ENGINE screams past them towards the burning hotel,
          as if to illustrate her point.
                         
                          CLAY
           How'd you know I was alive?
                         
                          AISHA
           Counted the number of teeth found
           in the safehouse debris in Karachi.
           Not nearly enough for five men.
                         
                          CLAY
           Who else knows?
                         
                          AISHA
           That you're alive? Just me.
                          CLAY
           So what's to stop me from putting
           a bullet in your head?
                         
                          AISHA
           You want Max and I can tell you
           how to get him.
                         
                          CLAY
           Max is up to something big, isn't
           he? Agency wouldn't have sent you
           otherwise.
                         
          She gives a little smile.
           28.
                         
                          AISHA
           Nice try, but I'm working alone

                          CLAY (CONT'D)
           Right. So you want me to steal
           some super secret cargo known only
           to you and the bad guy, and I'm
           supposed to do this because you
           know the name Max and look good in
           a pair of jeans? Sorry, sister.

           fund his off the books ops. And
           it comes straight from the poppy
           fields of the late Jamal al-Fadhil.

                          ROQUE
           She's coming with us. And if
           anything feels like a set-up, I
           put a bullet in her skull.
                          (TO AISHA)
           Sound fair?
           49.
                         
                          AISHA
           Oh, completely. Now, if you'll
           excuse me, it's time for prayers.
                         
                          ROQUE
           You're Muslim?
                         
                          AISHA
           You know, you are a sharp one--and
           don't let any of these other boys
           tell you different.
                         
          With that, she turns and walks away into the shadows.
          Roque lowers the weapon. A beat. To Clay:
                         
                          ROQUE
           I don't like this.
                         
                          CLAY
           I picked up on that.
                         
                          POOCH
           I'm with Roque, man. Agency thinks
           we're dead. We show up alive and
           kickin', start waving our dicks
           around in public, they're gonna
           make it their business to bury us.
           They'll call us terrorists, all
                          KINDSA SHIT-
                         
                          CLAY
           What do you think we are now?
           (to all of them)
           Best case scenario, this gets us
           face to face with Max-
                          ROQUE
           What if it doesn't? What if we
           never get face to face with him.
           Are you gonna be able to live with
           that? Ever?
                         
          Clay doesn't reply. A pall, cast over the guys. Finally:
                         
                          POOCH
           Hell, let's just say it out loud...
                          (PAUSE)
           We do this, we're declaring war on
           the Central Intelligence Agency.
                         
          Silence, as the guys take this in. Then, from the corner:
           50.
                         
                          COUGAR

          SWOOPING DOWN over the waterways, threading our way between
          buildings, past the islands slamming into
                         
          EXT. PRIVATE AIRPORT, NEW ORLEANS
                         
          A G-550, tire chalked. A fork lift removes a large VAULT-
          LIKE PACKAGE from the back of the plane -- THE CARGO.
                         
          A fifteen ton ATTACK-STABILIZED CASH TRANSPORT RIG idles,
          surrounded by TWENTY ASSAULT TROOPERS, loading up. Machine
          guns, frag grenades, body armor.

           As of this moment, the truck is

           or your men to allow the package
           to leave the truck before it's
           secure in the compound - to do so
           would be considered an act of
           treason and punishable as such.
                         
                          LIDDY
           Understood and acknowledged, sir.

           Ten men ride with the package and

          The two truck armored convoy pulls out of the private

          Clay, Roque, and Jensen watch the armored trucks pass by.
          Roque has a silenced long gun out as the second truck
          passes. As Roque PULLS THE TRIGGER...
                         
          EXT. PRIVATE AIRPORT - CONTINUOUS
                         
          A silenced AIR BLAST -- we TRAVEL FAST with Roque's
          ordinance -- SMACKING SILENT onto the rear bumper of the
          lead truck. A ballistic, putty-coated recon tracker.

           Target is westbound. Heading for

          Clay fires up the Town Car and follows.
                         
          AERIAL -- LOOKING DOWN as the armored cars head towards
          the city. TILT UP to reveal the CRESCENT CITY CONNECTION --
          eight suspended lanes spanning the Mighty Mississippi...
                         
          EXT. CRESCENT CITY CONNECTION
                         
          HIGH ANGLE -- Looking down at the bridge traffic. Sliding

          TWO HUNDRED FEET ABOVE GROUND. Lashed into a BRIDGE
          SUPPORT. He racks the bolt of his NTW-20 ANTI MATERIAL
          RIFLE - a monster of a weapon with a bulky starlight scope.
                         
          As the FIRST SWAT TRUCK reaches the center of the BRIDGE --

           52.
                         
          The SWAT TRUCK'S nearside front wheel EXPLODES, blown
          clear off the axle mount --
                         
          The wheel spins away, bounces wild, smashes a windshield --

           Shit, I'm losing it!
                         
          The Truck SLEWS sideways -- PLOWS into a car! The Driver

          EXT. CRESCENT CITY CONNECTION -- DAY
          Cougar FIRES AGAIN -- the other front wheel DETONATES,
          and the truck's nose SLAMS down on the asphalt GRINDING
          SPARKS! Going nowhere fast...
                         
          THE CHASE VAN

          BY THE CONVOY
                         
          THICK TEAR GAS EXPLODES in dark blues, billowing across

          COUGAR pumps a round into the EMPTY CHASE VAN -- Armor-
          glass BLASTING APART, showering the roadway -- Fennel
          DIVES for cover, PANICKING -- Lifts the radio to his lips:
                         
                          FENNEL
           Code RED! We are under attack!

          ROQUE fires another TEAR GAS GRENADE into the melee --

          As the CHASE VAN is BLOWN APART behind them! Fennel trying
          to orient through smoke and gas. Then, a NEW SOUND...
          DEEP RUMBLING. Thick bass vibrations...
                         
          The thick tear gas being blown aside by the thunderous
          twin-rotor downwash of a CHINOOK HEAVY LIFT CHOPPER!
                         
          It bellies in low, the boarding ramp already lowering...
                         
          Wade crouch-runs to the SWAT TRUCK, HAMMERING the rear

          The doors BURST OPEN and the SWAT Team CRASH-ROLLS the

          SWAT Guys laying down point cover as their comrades hustle

          The ramp closing. The team and cargo safely aboard...

          Passing Cougar's sniper-harness, which now HANGS EMPTY.
          Twisting in the wind.

          Wade slumps against the burnt out wreckage of the chase
          van. Sighing in relief. SILENCE. His radio crackles:
                         
           CHOPPER PILOT (V.O.)
           This is Chopper Support--we are

          INT. CHINOOK -- WINDOWLESS HOLD -- DAY
                         
          The SWAT Guys pull off their masks and high-five. They
          think they kicked ass. Fennel, reaching for the cockpit
          door handle... He can't turn it.
                         
                          FENNEL

          We hear the FAINT YELLING of Fennel and the Swat Guys in

          It's POOCH! AISHA sitting co-pilot. Both grinning as
          they hear the protestations from behind them...

          The middle of nowhere. A small clearing. Skeeters and

          THE CHINOOK crests the tree line. Hovers above...

          Fennel and the SWAT Guys try to maintain balance and
          personal dignity as they stumble and fall all over each
          other... The chopper SETS DOWN. The men gather
          themselves. Weapons up. Checking clips, safeties off.
                         
                          FENNEL

          Aisha clambers onto the Chinook's hull, clutching a RUBBER
          HOSE. Screws the end to an inlet valve marked "FIRE
          RETARDANT SYSTEM". Looks down at Clay. With a grin:
                         
                          AISHA
           Open the valve.

          HYDRAULICS WHINE. The RAMP LOWERS. The gas drenched

          fumes...
                         
          CLAY STANDS ALONE. The men fan out around him. Multiple

          AS THAT SINKS IN -- Fennel looks like his puppy just died.
                         
          GASOLINE DRIPS from the muzzle of his own tooled up H&K

          in the back of the Chinook. As the ramp rises, he shoots
          panicked glances to Clay. The ramp closes between them.

           into some business?
                         
                          SHORT SCIENTIST
           You want another device. One
           billion dollars is now the price.
           One billion dollars cash.
                         
          Wade stares at the scientist.
                         
                          WADE
           That's going to be difficult.
                         
                          SHORT SCIENTIST
           Life the way you people want to
           live it is very difficult, Mr.
           Wade. You want less difficult
           move to my country, study Hinduism.
           Meditate. Cultivate serenity.
           Much less difficult. You want to
           buy atomic bombs... I'm afraid
           that is a more difficult way of
           life.
                         
          And he smiles...

          Wade drives in a Jeep, heading back to the city.
                         
                          WADE
           He wants one billion in cash.

          Not even close.

          Won't give it to us willingly...
                          (THINKING)
          You get that six man team together

          Yeah.

          Change of plans. Kill them.

          Kill them?
                         
                          MAX
          Or fire them, whichever's easier.
                         
                          WADE
          Honestly? Firing them.
                         
                          MAX
          Fine, fine, I'm not a detail guy.
          What I need- wait. Did you give
          them intel on Clay's people?
                         
                          WADE
          Well, yeah.
                         
                          MAX
          Aaaand we're back to killing them.
                         
                          WADE
                          (ANNOYED)
          Fine, I'll kill them - what are we
          doing instead?
           71.
                         
                          MAX
           Touchy, touchy. Jeez, what are
           you related to them?
                         
                          WADE
           Actually, one of them, yes.
                         
                          MAX
           By blood?
                         
                          WADE
           (he's had it)
           A brother-in-law, I said I'd kill
           him, what are we doing?
                         
                          MAX
           It's not what we're doing, it's
           what Clay is going to do for us...
                         
                          WADE
           And that is?
                         
                          MAX

          INT. OUTSIDE HOUSTON - BEAT TO SHIT MOTEL ROOF - NIGHT
                         
          Clay. Sitting on his bed. Shirt off. Going over
          schematics - GOLIATH WORLD HEADQUARTERS. A KNOCK on Clay's
          door. He gets up, checks the eye hole. Opens it. AISHA.
                         
                          CLAY
           I was just going over the plan.
                         
          She looks at him. Sexual. Predatory.
                         
                          CLAY (CONT'D)
           You want to go over the plan?
                         
          She steps into the room towards him. Reaching for her:
                         
                          CLAY (CONT'D)
           Let's go over the plan...

          Clay and Aisha. After. Looking out at the city.
                         
                          AISHA
           So, what really happened to you in
           Afghanistan?
                         
          Clay looks over at her. Down at the TEDDY BEAR tattoo...
          And shakes his head.
                         
                          CLAY
                          (SOFTLY)
           That's not for you.
                         
          She traces her fingers over it...
                          CLAY (CONT'D)
           Why do you want Max dead?
                         
          Aisha, taken aback by the suddenness of the question.
                         
                          AISHA
           He's a bad man. Isn't that enough?
                         
                          CLAY
           No.
                         
          A beat. She looks at him.
                         
                          AISHA
           When you tell me about Afghanistan?
           I'll tell you about Max.
                         
                          CLAY
           Fine. It's hot. There's lots of
           sand. Your turn.
                         
          Aisha smiles at this. Shaking her head.
                         
                          AISHA
           Why were you alone when I found
           you?
                         
          That takes Clay off guard. Looking out at the city.
                         
                          CLAY
           The guys got sick of it.
                         
                          AISHA
           Sick of what?
           73.
                         
                          CLAY
           Of hearing about Max. Of hearing
           me say we had to do something when
           there wasn't anything to do. They
           wanted to be around their families.
           Jensen has a sister. Pooch has a
           wife and daughters.
                         
                          AISHA
           And he hasn't told them he is alive?
                         
                          CLAY
           Would you? The people you loved
           the most, would you put them in
           that kind of danger?
          Aisha, side-stepping the question:
                         
                          AISHA
           So Roque has no one.
                         
                          CLAY
           He's got me.
                         
                          AISHA
           And you have...
                         
                          CLAY
           Enough hate to get us both through
           the day. He stuck with me when no
           one else would. And I ain't the
           easiest guy to stick with.
                         
          Aisha studies him.
                          AISHA
           If you two really fought, he would
           kill you, I think.
                         
                          CLAY
           You think.
                         
                          AISHA
           I'm almost sure of it.
                         
                          CLAY
           Why?
           74.
                         
                          AISHA
           Because you care what happens to
           the others. You wouldn't put them
           at risk to save yourself.
                         
                          CLAY
           And you think that's a weakness.
                         
                          AISHA
           I know it is. Law of the jungle.
                         
                          CLAY
           We're not in the jungle.
                         
          She looks at him.
                          AISHA
           Oh, yes we are...
                         
          INT. VAN -- MORNING
                         
          Idling. Blacked out windows. Pooch behind the wheel,
          Cougar shotgun, Roque in back. Back door slides open and
          Clay and Aisha enter. Together. It doesn't go unnoticed.
                         
                          ROQUE
           Well, that's just great.
                         
          That's it. Fed up, Pooch SHUTS THE ENGINE like dad in
          the family truckster.
                         
                          POOCH

           Pooch, we're on a schedule here-
                         
          Pooch takes the keys out of the ignition and folds his
          arms. Clay sighs. Looks over to Roque. A beat. Then:
                         
                          CLAY (CONT'D)
           Sorry I hit you.

           Good. Roque?
                         
          A longer beat...
                         
                          POOCH (CONT'D)
           Roque?

                          ROQUE
           Sorry I threatened to cut your

                          POOCH
           Verrrry good. Now don't you two
           feel better?

          JENSEN heads towards the building. Street bicycle, bike
          shorts, messenger bag. He's disguised as a Bike Messenger.

          Jensen enters the reception area singing. Moves to the
          receptionist desk. A PRETTY RECEPTIONIST answering phones.
                         
                          JENSEN

                          RECEPTIONIST
           Excuse me one moment-

                          JENSEN
           I think Cougar's got a plan! Coug,
           do you have a plan?
           (to the others)
           He's got a plan!
                         
                          POOCH
           (trying to steer)
           Stop yelling at the sniper!
          THROUGH THE SCOPE -- Cougar sights the TAIL ROTOR of the
          chopper on the left... Smiles, PRESSES THE TRIGGER...
                         
          And we see how one bullet can bring down two helicopters.
                         
          The bullet strikes the tail rotor DEAD CENTER -- it SHORTS
          and spins off -- sending the chopper itself into a spin --
          COLLIDING with it's TWIN CHOPPER on the right -- they
          both twist and hink up -- their ROTORS SLICING INTO EACH
          OTHER -- both FINALLY CAREENING ONTO THE FREEWAY BEHIND
                         
          Our guys. Driving away from the carnage of two exploding
          Cobra Helicopters splattered across the road...
                         
          Safe.

          INT. LEAR JET 550 -- DAY
                         
          As it taxis towards a HANGAR. Max straightens his suit.
          Wade on the phone, frowning. Bad news. He flips the
          phone shut. To Max:
                         
                          WADE
           They got away.
                         
                          MAX
           So?

           We know exactly where they're going,
           Wade. Port of New York, for their
           big final awesome stand against
           the forces of evil where they die.
                         
          He claps Wade and the shoulder and heads down the steps...

           I recently attended the funeral of

                          MAX
           Can't complain. I'm thinking of

          Max looks over to Wade.
                         
                          MAX
           Time to go make a withdrawal...

                          SHORT SCIENTIST

           right here.
                         
          A PAUSE as Max contemplates this little twist.
                         
                          MAX
           God, are you short.

                          MAX
           Get it done.
                         
          Wade heads for the jet. Max watches him go. As Wade
          boards the jet Max takes a big sigh. For the first time,
          looks like a guy who might not be quite as sure of things
          as he would like. Max Looks back to the Short Scientist.
                         
                          MAX (CONT'D)
           How much do you weigh? Seriously.

           Where the hell is my bomb?
                         
          The Short Scientist points to a large flatbed pick-up. A
          HEAVY TARPED BOMB LIKE PACKAGE strapped to the back.
                         
                          SHORT SCIENTIST
           You do not get it till I get the

                          MAX
           For a guy who's all about

          who carry a BLEEDING JENSEN in. They lay him on a table.

          Cougar nods. Gathers gauze, needle, thread, and a WOODEN
          DOWEL. Comes over as Jensen looks at the last one.
                         
                          JENSEN
           What's that for?

          His words echo through the room.
                         
          JENSEN SCREAMS through the dowel as Cougar sews him up...
                         
          This is how low they've sunk. Clay finally looks up.
                         
                          CLAY
                          (SLOWLY)
           Okay. We split up. Some of us
           should go international. I'll do
           that if nobody else wants to-
                         
                          ROQUE
           So we just run again?
                         
          Clay turns to him.
                         
                          CLAY
           There's nothing else we can do...
                         
          Silence. Then:
                         
                          ROQUE
           There's something we can do.
                         
          A beat.

                          ROQUE
           Three years is enough. If there's
           a drive at that port that we can

                          CLAY
           What part of "he knows we're coming
           for it" do you not get? They're
           gonna be waiting for us. Par-Sec
           is gonna waiting for us...

           So figure out a way around them;
           you're good at that shit, Clay!
                         
          He turns, addressing all of them:
                         
                          ROQUE (CONT'D)

           To steal them back. And I'm

           to make that happen.
                         
          He looks Clay dead in the eye.
                          ROQUE (CONT'D)
           Never play a longshot, you're never
           gonna win.
                         
          A long beat. Clay, not breaking his look with Roque:
                         
                          CLAY
           Pooch, what's the minimum time to

           Pooch?

                          CLAY
           So?
                         
          A beat. Pooch looks up.
                         
                          POOCH
           So let's go get it back.

          ESTABLISHING. The harbor is enormous. A small TWIN
          HURRICANE BOAT cuts through the morning waves. Half mile
          from the Goliath docks. At the controls, Clay and Roque.
          THROUGH CLAY'S BINOCULARS:
                         
          GOLIATH EMPLOYEES going about their business, preparing
          for a tanker docking. All seems normal until we look a
          bit closer: FOUR-MAN Par Sec security patrols. Bomb
          sniffing DOGS. Two Cobra ATTACK CHOPPERS.
                         
                          CLAY
           You ready?
                         
          A GOLIATH TANKER approaches from behind. Roque looks
          back at the tanker. Not answering - he seems to have

          Clay drops the twin throttles and spins the speed boat
          towards the APPROACHING TANKER. Several TUGS and SECURITY
          LAUNCHES are maneuvering around it...

          Clay and Roque approach one of the launches from behind.
          Climbing aboard. They take the two SECURITY MEN from
          behind with TASERS, then strip off their outer gear,
          revealing PAR-SEC UNIFORMS.

          SLAM UP HARD ON COUGAR. Crouched BELOW the terminal.
          Looking up through a grilled man hole at Par-sec Guards.

          A huge shipping room with hundreds of crates. We push in

           (leans down; softly)
           We lost the moment we went off
           mission. This is just the logical
           conclusion of that playing out.

          In the corner, Wade nods at this. Behind him, A LARGE
          SEMI pulls up to the CASH CONTAINER. Over the following,
          a hydraulic lift hoists the cash container onto the truck:
                          CLAY
           Kill me now... Maybe you live
           through this.
                         
                          WADE
           Oh, we're not gonna kill you.
           Someone's gotta get away with the
           cash. Your crew? I'm definitely
           wasting them. But you?
                         
          He nods to the HYDRO-WINCH slowly lowering the CASH
          CONTAINER onto the flat bed, with a smile...

          Clay stares at daggers at both of them.
                          WADE (CONT'D)
           It's for our replacement nuke.
           When a billion goes missing, people
           tend to ask who took it.

           Max really does love to frame you...
                         
          Several Par-Sec Guards arrive. Wade points to Clay:
                         
                          WADE (CONT'D)
           Take him away. Drop him in Newark.
                          (TO ROQUE)
           I'll see you at Turner Airfield.
           104.
                         
          The Guards handcuff Clay and drag him to his feet. Pushing
          him towards the door. As he hustled past Roque:
                         
                          ROQUE
           Wait.
                         
          They stop. Roque looks at his old friend.
                         
                          ROQUE (CONT'D)
           I'm sorry it had to end this way.
                         
          Clay stares back at him.
                         
                          CLAY
           You're going to die very badly.
          The guards hustle Clay out the door...
                         
          EXT. GOLIATH TERMINAL - DAY
                         
          PAR-SEC GUARDS lead the Pooch, Jensen, and Cougar towards
          the far end of the terminal. Each, bound. Cougar looks
          up to see a separate set of Guards leading CLAY the
          opposite way. Their eyes connect - both knowing:
                         
          They've lost.
                         
                          CLAY
           (answering the question)
           Roque.
                         
          Cougar lowers his head, sadly. Clay's pushed into A TRUCK.
                         
          Gone.
          The Guards take Pooch, Jensen, and Cougar BEHIND A
          WAREHOUSE. Looking at each other. Knowing, this is the
          end of the line. The Lead Guard RACKS HIS MACHINE GUN.
                         
                          LEAD GUARD
           On your knees.
                         
          Pooch SPITS AT HIM. The Lead Guard calmly SHOOTS HIM in
          BOTH LEGS!
                         
          Pooch SCREAMS. Falls. The Par-Sec boys force Cougar and
          Jensen down too, CLUBBING THEM with their rifles. Pooch
          looks up at his assailant. Gasps through the pain:
                         
                          POOCH
           Get on with it...
           105.
                         
          The Lead Guard smiles. Looks to Cougar, who's shredding
          his skin to the bone trying to claw out of the cuffs...
                         
                          LEAD GUARD
           That's a nice hat.
                         
          He steps forward to take it, but Cougar is too quick for
          the man, MOVING HIS HEAD AWAY. He reaches for Cougar
          again. Again, Cougar evades. The guards laugh at their
          colleague, who continues trying to grab Cougar's hat.
                         
          The Lead Guard has had enough of Cougar's antics.
          Levelling the rifle at his head...
                         
           LEAD GUARD (CONT'D)
           Don't really care of there's a
           hole in it. One wash, good as...
                          (NOTICING)
           What are you smiling at?
                         
          Cougar's nods past him...
                         
          As the Guards turn to see ON TOP OF AN OIL TANK...
                         
                         AISHA
                         
          As she rises up to standing, A SLANT-K 600 ROCKET HIP
          BLASTER locked and loaded. Looking like an Old Testament
          style Goddess of Vengeance and Destruction. A moment of
          FROZEN SHOCK on the rest of Wade's Hit Crew...
                         
          And she pulls the trigger. A HIGH PITCHED WHISTLE as
                         
          THE ROCKET STREAKS across the Terminal! Headed straight
          for an ENORMOUS FUEL TANK...
          KA-BOOM! The explosion ROCKS THE ENTIRE TERMINAL...
                         
          INT. TRUCK (MOVING)
                         
          The Truck Clay is prisoner in is BLOWN INTO THE AIR by
          the SHOCKWAVE... SMASHING down onto it's side, skidding...
                         
          EXT. BY THE WAREHOUSE
                         
          Cougar and Jensen DESTROY the remaining Par-Secs with
          legs. Grabbing cuff keys and freeing themselves.
                         
                          JENSEN
           Shouldn't have gone after the hat...
           106.
                         
          WHAM! Cougar kicks the Guard in the face, knocking him
          cold. Aisha rappels off the Oil Tower in the distance.
          VARIOUS PAR-SEC TEAMS fire at her! Cougar scoops up two
          rifles and tosses one to Jensen - they give her covering
          fire as she comes! As he shoots, to the wounded Pooch:
                         
                          JENSEN (CONT'D)
           Can you stand?
                         
                          POOCH
           I've been shot in both legs, what
           kind of dumbass question is that?
                         
                          JENSEN
           Oh, so we're Mr. Grumpy now? You're
           not the only one who's been shot
           recently, you know!
                         
          He empties a full clip into a Par-Sec team and reloads...
                         
          AISHA -- Pinned down forty yards away. Almost out of
          AMMO. Par-Sec Team, almost on top of her when
                         
          A FIGURE emerges from an OVERTURNED TRUCK. GUN in each
          hand, BLAZING. The Par-Secs cut down one by one. The
          figure lowers his guns. Desert Eagles. Walks up to her.
          Underneath the blood, oil, and grime, it's
                         
          CLAY. They stare at each other...
                         
          Then, incredibly, Aisha RAISES HER WEAPON AT HIM.
                         
                          AISHA
           Did you kill my father?
          Jensen comes running up, interrupting:
                         
                          JENSEN
           Clay?
                         
                          CLAY
           Kind of in the middle of something
           here, Jensen-
                         
                          AISHA

                          JENSEN
           There was no drive, Clay-

                          CLAY
           (eyes on Aisha)
                          I KNOW-
                         
                          JENSEN
           There was no drive and Roque's
           gone and Par-Sec's regrouping and
           Pooch could bleed out-
                         
          Aisha's had enough, thumbing the hammer back:
                         
                          AISHA
           Did you kill him?
                         
          Clay, about to respond when:
           COUGAR (O.S.)
           I did.
                         
          They turn to see our LONG TALL SNIPER standing above them.
                         
                          COUGAR (CONT'D)
           He asked us. It was mercy. But
           you're his family, so I understand.
                         
          And then, incredibly, Cougar lays his rifle at her feet.
                         
          SURRENDERING...
                         
                          COUGAR (CONT'D)
           But only me.
                         
          Clay and Jensen blink, shocked. Aisha stares at Cougar,
          equally surprised. She levels her pistol AT HIS HEAD...
          Silence. We CUT WIDE to see...
                         
          A GUNSHOT. Muzzle flash from Aisha's gun. COUGAR FALLS...
                         
          In close again. Aisha stands over Cougar's body.
                         
          The others, stunned... And then Cougar rises. Face
          BLOODY. Cheek ripped open, from where the bullet creased
          his flesh. She FIRES AGAIN - BLAM!
                         
          Identical scar on his other cheek. Blood runs down his
          face. He doesn't move to wipe it away.
                         
                          AISHA
           Wear it. Remember him.
           108.
                         
          Cougar nods. Leans down, picks up his rifle. Debt paid.
                         
                          JENSEN
           Okay, excellent, very tribal--We
           need to go.
                         
          As if on cue, BULLETS kick up DUST around them! A new
          Par-Sec team, incoming. Clay, Jensen, Aisha, and Cougar
          hightail it back to where Pooch lies.
                         
                          CLAY
           Can you stand?

           This is stupid question day, isn't
           it? It's stupid question day and
           someone forgot to tell me...
                         
          Clay slings Pooch over his shoulders fireman carry style.
          Looks across the Terminal to where Pooch's van is parked.
          PUSH IN on Clay's face for:
                         
                          CLAY
           Let's go.
                         
          And they do. Sprinting across the open space IN SLO-MO,
          Cougar and Aisha WASTING EVERYTHING THAT MOVES. A full
          on ballet of fully automatic mayhem...
                         
          They make it to the van! Piling in! Cougar behind the
          wheel GUNS THE ENGINE and they PEEL OUT...
                         
          INT. VAN (MOVING) -- NIGHT
                         
          Pulling on to the HIGHWAY. Silence sets in. The high of
          the firefight, over. Just pain and loss now.
                         
          Five people, some terribly wounded, with nowhere to go.
          Just the rocking of the van as it heads down the road.
                         
                         FINALLY:
                         
                          CLAY
           They won. We lost. Way it goes.
                         
          Silence.
                         
                          POOCH
           Way it always goes.
                         
          Clay looks at him.
           109.
                         
                          POOCH (CONT'D)
           Guess we should just head home.
           Oh, wait, that's right. We don't
           have homes.
                         
          Clay doesn't respond. Aisha studies him. Nods. Knows
          what has to be done. They all do. From behind the wheel:
                         
                          COUGAR
           Where to, Colonel?
                         
          Clay looks up at the use of rank...
                         
          EXT. PRIVATE AIRSTRIP -- NIGHT
                         
          Wade pulls up in a Corvette. Gets out and walks over as

          the CASH onto a HUGE TRANSPORT PLANE.

           long?

                          ROQUE
           They were good guys.
                         
          Wade half smiles at this. Shaking his head.
                         
                          WADE
           No such thing. I'll go call Max.

           Where the hell is she going?
          Aisha is heading off to the fenceline... Clay and Cougar
          run for Wade's CORVETTE. Cougar slides behind the wheel
          and starts her up, PEELING OUT after the plane...
                         
                          POOCH
           You call me legless Pooch again,
           you're gonna be Headless Jensen.

          ON THE RUNWAY
           111.
                         
          Cougar guns the engine, catching up to the TAXIING
          TRANSPORT PLANE. Clay leans out the window, shooting at
                         
                         ROQUE
                         
          Huddled in the plane's CARGO HOLD, RETURNING FIRE. The
          PILOT, yelling to him.
                         
                          PILOT
           We don't have enough runway to
           take off - we're going to have to
           turn around and come back to get

                          ROQUE
           Fine, just get us in the air!
          He fires ANOTHER BURST from his weapon at the Vette!
          CLICK - his WEAPON DRY.

                          CLAY
           I'm out.
                         
          He stares through the windshield to look at Roque.

           Come out and plaaaayyy-
                         
          The ROAR of an engine -- Jensen DIVES out of the way as
          Wade WHIPS PAST on a MOTORCYCLE! Heading for the runway!

          He trails off. Looking at THE LEAR JET that Wade arrived
          in. Sitting in the Hangar's Corner. Keys the radio...
           112.
                         
                          JENSEN (CONT'D)

          EXT. AIRSTRIP -- DAY
                         
          The Corvette, pulling behind the still lowered REAR RAMP
          of the TRANSPORT PLANE! Clay, onto the CORVETTE'S HOOD...
                         
          Roque, rising to meet him. Waiting for him...
                         
          Clay JUMPS! Landing on the ramp!
                         
          IN THE CARGO HOLD - Roque smiles. Pulls a WICKED LOOKING
          KNIFE. The two men stand there. Sizing one another up...
                          ROQUE
           Gotta admit, I always wondered how
           this would play out.
                         
                          CLAY
           Aisha thinks you kill me.
                         
                          ROQUE
           It's a distinct possibility...
                         
          They begin circling one another. Clay, still weaponless.
                         
                          ROQUE (CONT'D)
           You don't have a knife?
                         
                          CLAY
           Don't need one.
                         
                          ROQUE
           Bit of as longshot for you...
                         
                          CLAY
                          (SMILING)
           No. It's not.
                         
          Roque LUNGES AT HIM...
                         
          But Clay does have a knife. He PULLS IT and SLAMS IT
          into Roque's belly! Roque, stunned! Staggers back...
                         
          For most men, that would be the end of the fight. But
          not these two. Roque gives Clay a bloody grin.
           113.
                         
                          ROQUE
           Now I really am gonna cut your
           head off...
                         
          He LUNGES AGAIN! And now it is FULLY ON...
                         
          The blades whip up and down - almost too fast to see
          Roque gets Clay with a left cross, then buries his knife
          in Clay's shoulder. Clay twists free, slashes at Roque.
                         
          Ten seconds in, the men separate again. Breathing hard...
                         
          Clay sees Roque doesn't have his knife. Looks - realizing
          it's still embedded in his own shoulder. Pulls it out,
          TOSSES IT BACK TO ROQUE. They stand there, both panting...
          Then RUN AT EACH OTHER full tilt!
                         
          Here's how it ends. And pay attention, IT HAPPENS FAST:
                         
          Clay goes low -- coming up to grab Roque's knife hand,
          which is arcing DOWNWARDS TOWARDS CLAY'S THROAT -- Clay
          manages to HALT THE HAND, blade inches from his Adam's
          apple -- and there's a moment where Roque could overpower
          him and actually cut his head off... But Clay THROWS HIS
          WEIGHT FORWARD and BREAKS ROQUE'S RIGHT ARM!
                         
          And for the first time, Roque SCREAMS.
                         
          Which seems to make Clay happy.
                         
          So he BREAKS ROQUE'S LEFT ARM too.
                         
          Roque falls to his knees, BROKEN, BLOODY, AND BEATEN...
          TO REVEAL -- The PILOT. Leaning out of the cockpit, DESERT
          EAGLE levelled at Clay.
                         
                          CLAY
                          SHIT-
                         
          The Pilot PULLS THE TRIGGER. The bullet slams into Clay's
          abdomen and BLOWS HIM off his feet backwards -- FLYING
          OUT OF THE PLANE -- And landing on hood of
                         
                         THE CORVETTE
                         
          Clay SMASHES DOWN ON the windshield -- Cougar pumps the
          brakes and spins the wheel -- desperately trying to keep
          Clay from rolling off the hood...
           114.
                         
                         THE PLANE
                         
          TURNING AROUND at the end of the runway. Beginning it's
          final run to get up to speed...
                         
                         THE CORVETTE
                         
          Now driving TOWARDS IT on a chicken-like collision course
          when WHOOSH! WADE FLIES PAST ON HIS MOTORCYCLE! Clay
          turns to Cougar through the spiderwebbed windshield:
                         
                          CLAY (CONT'D)
           Rifle...
                         
          Cougar passes Clay his SNIPER RIFLE and FLOORS IT...
          VISUALIZE THIS --
                         
          AT ONE END OF THE RUNWAY, the plane starting to take off.
                         
          AT THE OPPOSITE END, Wade's motorcycle heading full speed
          at the approaching plane. Cougar and Clay, chasing Wade.
                         
          And then AISHA steps out INTO THE MIDDLE of the runway.
          The ROCKET LAUNCHER clutched in her hands.
                         
          She takes a knee. Aims at the plane, which is almost at
          lift speed. ROQUE sees her from the cockpit.
                         
          She locks eyes with him and GRINS -- FIRING into the
          LANDING GEAR of the plane AS...
                         
                         THE CORVETTE
                         
          PULLS EVEN WITH WADE. Instead of shooting, Clay THROWS
          Cougar's RIFLE BETWEEN THE SPOKES of Wade's FRONT TIRE,
          causing the bike to
                         
          CATAPULT WADE OFF and FORWARD...
                         
          ...THROUGH THE AIR and into the RIGHT NUMBER TWO JET ENGINE
          of the now flying cargo plane. The ENGINE EXPLODES.
                         
          Aisha, somehow safe on the ground, looking up at the
          escaping plane. Clay looking up. All of them watching...
                         
          ...as Roque dies very badly.
                         
          WHOOMP! The big plane EXPLODES in a MONSTER FIREBALL--VA
          DOOOM! Burning gas and iron and cash. FIRE RULES.
           115.
                         
          ON THE GROUND
                         
          Our guys. Bloody, eyes bitterly triumphant. Clay stares
          at the sight before him. Only one word for it.

           Not to rain on everyone's we killed
           all the bad guys parade, but we

           for us in the Hangar.

           It's a cool name-
                         
          From the smashed up bike Wade was driving, WADE'S CELL
          PHONE RINGS. Clay gets off the hood of the Vette and
          Cougar and Aisha help him hobble over. Answering it:

           You coming?
                         
          A beat. She nods.
                         
                          AISHA

          head for the Hangar. Together.

          Max lowers the phone. Looking stunned. The Short
          Scientist has run out of patience.
                         
                          SHORT SCIENTEST
           Time is up, Stretch.
                         
          Max looks at the Short Scientist.
                         
                          MAX
           Stretch. That's a good one.
                         
          But he doesn't look like he's very amused.
                          SHORT SCIENTEST
           Because you are so much taller
           than I.
                         
                          MAX
           Yeah, no, I get it...
                         
          Momentary pause. The Short Scientist looks at Max. Slowly
          gets up, LEAVES MAX alone in the room with the ten Indians.
          Max takes a deep breath, looks up at the DEATH SQUAD.

          We think it's the end. But then we hear
                         
          WIND. Blowing through trees. Crickets. The soft sound
          of evening television. Somewhere suburban...

          A nice quiet neighborhood. Outside the kitchen window
          Pooch's wife JOLENE, doing dishes in the sink again.
                         
          A RUSTLING. Jolene looks up this time. She obviously
          heard it. She puts down the dishes and goes to the door.
          Opens it and looks out to see...
                         
          Nothing. Not even by the swingset.
                         
          She sighs. About to head back inside when she spies
                         
          A GLINT OF LIGHT. By the oak tree in the front. She
          steps outside. Walks down until she sees what it is.
          Her breath hitches in her chest.
                         
          A frilly purple ribbon is tied around the old oak tree.
                         
          And now there are tears in Jolene's eyes. Because she
          knows what it means.
                         
          Her husband is alive. And he will make it home.

          This is true...

          EXT. VILLAGE - NIGHT - (2003)
                         
          The night is stillborn.
                         
          Without sound or movement and nothing is in definition. All we see
          are degrees of blackness in this unlit world. The vague impressions
          of an African village in the void... a ragged line of tukuls (straw
          huts)... a bicycle propped against a mud wall... a soccer ball in
          the dirt...
                         
          INT. TUKUL - NIGHT
                         
          And we find a Sudanese family asleep on reed mats. A mother, father
          and their two boys. The younger boy we'll come to know as "WILLIAM"
          (9). His older brother "CHRISTOPHER" (12) curled next to him.
                         
          EXT. VILLAGE - NIGHT
                         
          And slowly the blackness begins to shift... an otherworldly light
          seeping in from someplace far off... shadows contorting in a ghostly
          orange flicker... images emerging... the silhouettes of men coming
          into this village carrying flaming torches.
                         
          INT. TUKUL - NIGHT
                         
          The family still sound asleep, oblivious to the torch glow coming
          from outside, and suddenly --
                         
          SCREAMING! -- GUNSHOTS!
                         
          The family bolts awake, moving to their feet as the door to their
          tukul SLAMS open -- THREE soldiers from the Lord's Resistance Army
          (LRA) coming in carrying AK47's -- shouting in Arabic -- "Get up!
          Get up!" -- the FATHER stepping forward -- holding up his hands --
          "Don't shoot!" --
                         
          KAK! KAK! KAK!
                         
          And he's gunned down in cold blood. The soldiers grab the mother and
          boys and begin to drag them out of the tukul -- but WILLIAM breaks
          free -- scrambles deeper into the room --
                         
          THE SOLDIER going after him -- WILLIAM darting behind a stack of
          storage boxes knocking them to the ground -- frantically burrowing
          into the corner -- trying to get away but it's useless -- THE
          SOLDIER grabs his feet and begins to pull him out -- WILLIAM KICKING
          WILDLY -- digging his nails into the dirt -- and as he's dragged out
          of the corner he reaches out... inadvertently grabs a FADED
          PHOTOGRAPH which has fallen on the ground...
                         
          EXT. VILLAGE - NIGHT

          families yanked out of their burning tukuls by LRA rebels -- the
          adult males of this village shot dead or bludgeoned to death -- the
          women and children forced into the center of the village -- huddled
          together and weeping --
                         
          -- and now we see WILLIAM hauled out -- his captor shouting to
          another soldier -- pointing to WILLIAM'S mother and she's pulled
          from the group and forced onto her knees...
                         
          ... and WILLIAM is brought in front of her -- his captor saying
          something in Arabic as he hands him a club -- "Kill her!" -- WILLIAM
          shaking his head `no' -- tossing the club in the dirt and --
                         
          CRACKKK! -- WILLIAM is hit with the butt of a rifle -- goes down --
          blood streaming down his face as he's pulled back up to his feet --
          crying -- shaking with fear...
                         
          ... and then he sees his mother staring up at him... and despite the
          hell unfolding around them we see a moment here between mother and
          son... something calm and reassuring in the way she's looking at him
          now... her eyes full of love... and pity... for her child in this
          terrible moment... and before we see how this ends we --

          And we see SAM CHILDERS coming down a corridor toward us, dressed in
          jailhouse orange and flanked by a guard. He's stocky, 32 years old,
          with a biker's handlebar moustache. On the surface he appears good-
          looking... even handsome if the light is right... but his face is
          tricky... always changing... behind the quick smile, around his dark
          eyes, in the taut muscles of his neck we see violence.

          We see a CLERK handing Sam a prison issue tub full of his personal
          affects. He takes out his clothes, digs out a leather wallet, a
          watch, some silver rings and a lighter.
                         
          He looks up to the Clerk and flashes a malicious smile --

          EXT. PRISON - DAY
                         
          A beat-up CHEVY VEGA parked at the curb. Sam's wife, LYNN, 30's, in
          a thrift store dress, leaning against the car, waiting.
                         
          Sam (dressed in civilian clothes now) pushes out a door and she sees
          him, straightens her hair, an uneasy smile.
                         
                          LYNN
           Hey baby.
                         
          EXT SIDE OF ROAD/INT. LYNN'S CAR - DAY
                         
          The Vega pulled of the side of the road and Sam fucking Lynn in the
          back. There's nothing tender about what we're watching here. Sam
          finishes and Lynn slumps into the seat, pulls down her dress.
                         
                          SAM
           Gimme a smoke.
                         
                          LYNN
           Don't got any.
                         
                          SAM
           What, you quit?

          EXT. MOBILE HOME PARK - DAY
                         
          The Vega pulls up to a beat-to-shit single-wide and Sam and Lynn get
          out. We see a homemade sign hanging outside the trailer that reads,
          "Welcome Home Daddy!"
                         
          And now Sam's daughter PAIGE (6) bursts out of the trailer and down
          the steps... Followed by Sam's mother, DAISY, mid 60's, comes out of
          the trailer.
                         
                          PAIGE
           DADDY!
                         
          And she jumps into his arms.
                         
                          SAM
           Hey bug...

          Lynn enters the trailer, Paige follows.

          Sam and Daisy enter.
                         
          There's a quiet anxiety to this homecoming. Everybody on edge,
          careful.
                         
                          LYNN (CONT'D)

          Lynn hesitating, not sure how to answer... not sure what's going to
          happen when she does... finally...

          He walks toward the fridge.
                         
                          LYNN
           Paige, get that chair.

          Sam's face changing, starting to turn bad. A look we'll come to
          know.

           Fuck you talkin about?
                         
          Daisy scooping up Paige and exiting, screen door slamming behind
          them and now Sam and Lynn are all alone.
                         
                          LYNN

           baby.

           you was away.
                         
          Lynn reaches for him but he shoves her back violently...
                         
                          SAM

          Sam straddles the bike and kicks it to life. He PEELS OUT, kicking
          up gravel as he blasts past Paige and Daisy.

          INT. CROSSROADS BAR - NIGHT
                         
          A tough biker bar in Johnstown, PA. A jukebox in the corner playing
          Lynard Skynard. Sam coming through the door, AD-LIBBED greetings
          from some of the other bikers here. He makes his way to a back table
          where a hulking biker in a leather vest named DONNIE is sitting with
          two girls. Donnie looks up, sees Sam...
                          7
                         
                          DONNIE
           Crazyhorse! There he is...
                         
          They embrace, old friends.
                         
                          DONNIE (CONT'D)
           Figured you'd be rollin out round now.
           How you doin, buddy?

           I'm doin.

                          (SAM SITS)
           Don't look too worse for the wear.
                         
                          SAM
           I'm alright.
                         
                          DONNIE
           Heard yer old lady ain't at the Bunny Hop
           no more.
                         
                          SAM
           Bitch found Jesus.
                         
                          DONNIE
           Damn! That bearded sonuvagun slipped her
           the high holy dick while you was in the
           can, huh? Better him than the milk man, I
           guess.
                         
                          SAM
           Ain't so sure bout that.
                         
          Donnie laughs, slaps him on the shoulder...
                         
                          DONNIE
           You wanna taste?

          INT. BATHROOM - THE CROSSROADS BAR - NIGHT
                         
          Sam and the biker chick crammed into this dirty stall, Skynard
          pounding through the walls. He rolls up his shirt sleeve as she
          cooks a spoon of methamphetamine... juices a hypodermic... he finds
          a vein and she spikes his arm... presses the plunger and his head
          rolls back on his shoulders... speed slamming into his bloodstream
          as we RAMP UP THE MUSIC.

          Snow piled up on the windowsills and it's cold as shit outside. Sam
          passed out on the couch and this guy looks like hell.
                         
          Thinner than the last time we saw him, skin sallow and drawn tight
          over his face. He stirs awake, sees Paige playing by herself on the
          floor next to him. She sees that he's awake, picks up her doll, and
          quietly goes outside without saying a word.
                         
          INT. BATHROOM - CHILDERS MOBILE HOME - MORNING
                         
          Sam coming in, taking a piss, staring at himself in the mirror and
          we see a junkie map of track marks running up and down his arms. And
          then WE HEAR a Pentecostal communion hymn, "the Old Rugged Cross",
          coming through... taking us to...
                         
          INT. CHURCH - JOHNSTOWN, PA. - DAY
                         
          A congregation packed into this church for Sunday service. We see
          Lynn and Paige in the crowd, singing along with the congregation.
                         
          EXT. DOPE HOUSE STREET/INT. DONNIE'S CAR - NIGHT
                         
          Sam and Donnie in this car, parked in front of broken down clapboard
          houses. Donnie pointing through the windshield...
                         
                          DONNIE
           Right there. With the green light.
                         
          EXT. PORCH - DOPE HOUSE - NIGHT
                         
          Bone chill cold. Sam and Donnie on this porch, scarves pulled around
          their necks, hands shoved into their jackets trying to stay warm.
          Donnie KNOCKING at the door...
                         
                          DONNIE
           Hey, man, you there?! Open up...
                         
          Donnie KNOCKING again and the door cracks an inch... and we see a
          black man with a SHAVED HEAD on the other side looking out...
                         
                          SHAVED HEAD
           Fuck are you?

           I don't know you.
                         
                          DONNIE
           Yeah you do, man. I saw you the other

           Who the fuck is Bobby?
                         
          Suddenly Sam pulls a short barrel shotgun from his jacket --
          MOSSBERG 10 GAGE -- presses it to the door and --
                         
          BOOOM!

          SHAVED HEAD sprinting down this hallway -- Sam tracking him in the
          b.g. -- bloodlust in his eyes -- leveling the MOSSBERG and --
                         
          BOOOM! -- BOOOM!

           In there...

                          SAME
           Hurry the fuck up.
                         
          SHAVED HEAD crawling to a small safe in a closet, spins the combo,
          opens it and pulls out six ounces of uncut cocaine.
                         
                          SAM
           Cash!
                         
          SHAVED HEAD grabs a stack of hundreds, hands it to Sam and --
          CRACKKK! -- he SLAMS the butt of the Mossberg into SHAVED HEAD'S
          face and he hits the ground on his back -- Sam standing over him --
          shoves the barrel of the shotgun into his mouth --
                         
                          DONNIE
           C'mon, let's go!
                         
          But Sam's not moving... just staring down at SHAVED HEAD... and
          we're watching something here... a terrible intelligence taking
          over... something bloodless and inhuman coming over Sam in this
          moment... and he chambers a slug into the shotgun...
                         
                          DONNIE (CONT'D)

           I'm going a hundred miles an hour in this
           thing.
                         
          Sam juices a needle and spikes Donnie's arm. Donnie feeling the
          rush... pressing on the gas and howling like a wild man... both of
          them wired out of their heads... BLASTING down this dark, country
          road... and then they see...
                         
                         A HITCHHIKER
                         
          Up the road, standing in this bitter cold with his thumb out.
                         
                          SAM
           Look at this sorry fucker...
                         
          EXT. COUNTRY ROAD - NIGHT
                         
          Donnie's car pulls off the road and the Hitchhiker hustles up to it.
                         
          INT. DONNIE'S CAR - NIGHT
                         
          The Hitchhiker climbing into the backseat. He's late 40's, a
          drifter, probably American Indian. Donnie starts driving.
                         
                          SAM
           Cold enough for ya out there, boy?
                         
                          DRIFTER
           Yeah.
                         
                          DONNIE
           Where you goin, man?
                         
                          DRIFTER
           Dunshore.
                         
                          SAM
           That's up there past Muncy, right?
                         
                          DRIFTER
           Yeah.
                          12
                         
                          DONNIE
           We can take you far as McClure.
                         
                          DRIFTER
           Take me to Dunshore.
                         
          Sam looking back --
                         
                          SAM
           We ain't goin to Dunshore, boy. Said we
           can drop you at McClure.
                         
          Suddenly -- silver flashing -- A BLADE -- out of nowhere -- pressed
          into Donnie's neck from the backseat -- the Drifter pulling him
          tight against the seat rest, pressing it into his throat --
                         
                          DONNIE
           What the fuck?!
                         
                          DRIFTER
           Keep drivin! Dunshore or I'll cut his
           fuckin throat.
                         
                          SAM
           Get that fuckin blade off him...
                         
          Sam reaches his leg over and STOMPS ON THE GAS PEDDLE -- the car
          LURCHES forward -- accelerating --
                         
                          DONNIE
           Sam!
                         
                          DRIFTER
           SLOW THE FUCK DOWN!
                         
          But Sam's not letting up... pressing down on the peddle hard...
          90... 100... 110 mph -- Donnie YELLING -- trying to keep the car on
          the road -- MUSIC BLARING -- like some wild ride to hell and then --
                         
          SAM SUDDENLY JUMPS IN THE BACKSEAT -- wrestling with the drifter --
          fighting wild -- elbowing him in the face and somehow the blade is
          in his hand now -- and --
                         
          Stick, stick, stick, stick, stick, stick!
                         
          He stabs him six times in the gut. The drifter HOWLING in pain.
                         
          EXT. COUNTRY ROAD - NIGHT
                         
          Donnie's car skidding off the shoulder of the road, back door
          popping open and the Drifter's body dumped into the dirt. The car
          PEELS OUT, accelerates, tail lights disappearing into the dark.
                          13
                         
          INT. BEDROOM - CHILDERS MOBILE HOME - NIGHT
                         
          Lynn sound asleep in bed. And she slowly stirs awake, hears water
          running from somewhere in the trailer.
                         
          INT. HALLWAY AND BATHROOM - CHILDERS MOBILE HOME - NIGHT
                         
          Lynn moving down the hall... toward a sliver of light coming from
          under the closed bathroom door... gently pushing it open to see --
                         
          Sam standing at the sink... covered in blood... frantically trying
          to clean himself up... trying to wash the sin from his skin and
          clothes but it's useless... and the sense we get is that we're
          staring at a man at the edge of an abyss... set to swallow him
          whole... terrified... shaking...
                         
          ... and now he realizes Lynn is here and he turns to her... holding
          up his stained hands... a terrible fear in his eyes when he says...
                         
                          SAM
           Help me.
                         
          EXT. CHILDERS MOBILE HOME - DAY
                         
          Days later and we see Lynn and Paige, dressed up, sitting in the
          idling car, waiting.
                         
                          PAIGE
           He comin or ain't he?
                         
                          LYNN
           I don't know.
                         
          INT. BEDROOM - CHILDERS MOBILE HOME - DAY
                         
          And we find Sam in this bedroom all alone, wearing a thrift store
          sportcoat, sitting on the edge of the bed. Frozen. Staring at his
          stocking feet and three or four pairs of workboots scattered on the
          floor.
                         
          Lynn steps into the doorway...
                         
           VOICE (O.S.)
           Honey? You ready?
                         
          Sam turns to her, and he looks lost here. Like a little boy.
                         
                          SAM
           I don't got no good shoes, Lynn.
                         
          And she comes into the room, sits on the bed next to him, puts an
          arm around his shoulder.
                         
                          LYNN
           He don't care what kinda shoes you
           wearin, baby.
                          14
                         
          INT. BAPTISM CHURCH - JOHNSTOWN, PA. - DAY
                         
          Packed with Sunday families listening to Pastor Krause at the
          pulpit. Behind him we see a BAPTISMAL TANK filled with water. And
          now we see Sam, Lynn, Paige, and Daisy sitting near the back. Sam
          looks uncomfortable, on edge.
                         
                          PASTOR KRAUSE
           The point of receiving God's word is
           life. Life upon life. And to accept the
           blood of Jesus is life upon life upon
           life...
                         
                          CONGREGATION
           Praise be to God!
                         
                          PASTOR KRAUSE
           He breathes his spirit into darkness and
           makes something good. He sees our shadow
           and says, `let there be light!"
                         
                          CONGREGATION
           Amen!
                         
                          PASTOR KRAUSE
           ... now proclaim his saving grace! If
           there are sinners here looking for God
           raise your hands!
                         
          A few hands shoot up --
                         
           PASTOR KRAUSE (CONT'D)
           Stand up! Receive Jesus Christ as your
           light and saviour...
                         
          Three or four people moving to their feet, making their way up to
          the altar. Lynn turns to Sam, their eyes meet. He looks hesitant,
          unsure. She gives him a reserved little smile, nods her head
          slightly as if saying "you can do this"...
                         
          And in her look he finds strength, gets up, slowly makes his way
          to...
                         
                         FRONT ALTAR
                         
          And now we see Sam on his knees in the baptismal tank. The water
          almost up to his waist. Pastor Krause kneeling behind him.
                         
           PASTOR KRAUSE (CONT'D)
           Receive Jesus as your Lord and Saviour...
           in the name of the father and of the son
           and of the Holy Ghost...
                         
          ... and he leans Sam back, cradling his head as he submerges him in
          the water completely... and when Sam comes back up the church breaks
          into ROWDY HALLELUJAHS!... and we see Lynn... tears in her eyes...
                          15
                         
          clapping in the back row... and an organist and singer begin to sing
          "Amazing Grace" taking us to...
                         
                         OMITTED
                         
          EXT. CONSTRUCTION SITE - DAY - (JUNE/1999)
                         
          Months later and the snow has thawed... it's summer... and we see
          Sam with other CONSTRUCTION WORKERS finishing their day, packing up
          their tools, cleaning up. We notice that his gaunt cheeks have
          filled out and he looks healthier.
                         
          And now a CONTRACTOR comes up to Sam, hands him a check.
                         
                          CONTRACTOR
           Thanks for your help, Sam.
                         
                          SAM
           You need me to stay on, I can.
                         
                          CONTRACTOR
           We're movin inside next week.
                         
                          SAM
           I can drywall, tile, whatever you got.
           Know my way round some electrical too.
                         
                          CONTRACTOR
           Sorry, Sam, I gotta cut the crew. Just
           ain't enough work.
                         
          EXT. STEPS - CHILDERS MOBILE HOME - NIGHT
                         
          Sam alone on these steps, lost in thought. Screen door opens and
          Lynn comes out, sits next to him.
                         
                          SAM
           She asleep?
                         
                          LYNN
           Think so, in our bed... she's funny.
                         
          BEAT.
                         
                          SAM
           Job's done.
                         
                          LYNN
           I thought that was goin through August?
                         
          Sam shakes his head, and they're quiet... both of them sitting here
          on these steps... the burden of this life catching up to them in
          this moment.
                          16
                         
          INT. EMPLOYMENT OFFICE - DAY
                         
          A WOMAN stares down at her desk with a frown, shaking her head. Sam
          sitting in a small chair in front of her.
                         
                          WOMAN
           I got somethin in Pitt, but you gotta
           have some college for that.
                         
                          SAM
           I'm a hard worker and I learn real fast.
                         
                          WOMAN
           But you got no education, Mr. Childers.
                         
          EXT. USED CAR LOT - DAY
                         
          And we see Sam standing next to his Harley, talking to a MECHANIC.
                         
                          MECHANIC
           ... don't deal bikes. Probably have a
           better shot if you take it over to Pitt.
           Or maybe down to Philly.
                         
                          SAM
           I gotta sell it today.
                         
                          MECHANIC
           Give you four hundred for it.
                         
                          SAM

           Them pipes right there is custom. You
           wont see pipes like that on anything
           round here.
                         
                          MECHANIC
           Like I said, don't deal bikes. I'll give
           you four-twenty. Cash. Best I can do.
                         
          INT. PAIGE'S ROOM - CHILDER'S MOBILE HOME - NIGHT
                         
          Sam on the edge of Paige's bed reading her a CHILDREN'S BOOK.
                         
                          SAM
                          (READING)
           "Into the street the Piper stept, smiling
           first a little smile, then three shrill
           notes the pipe uttered like a great and
           mighty army muttered..."
                         
                          PAIGE
           What's uttered?
                         
                          SAM
           Like spoke up, made a sound.
                          17
                         
                          PAIGE
           Okay, keep goin.

           And out of the houses the rats came
           tumblin, black rats, brown rats, brother
           rats, sister rats, and husband rats

           drowned and lost their lives."
                         
                          PAIGE
           They got rid all them rats?
                         
                          SAM
           Yep.
                         
                          PAIGE
           How come you sold yer Harley?
                         
                          SAM
           Cause it's what I had to do.
                         
          Off her look...
                         
                          SAM (CONT'D)
           We're gonna be ok, bug, don't you worry.
                         
          Paige curls into him closer, and we're watching him here... in this
          moment... holding his daughter... not so sure they're gonna be ok.

          CLOSE ON Sam, behind the wheel of the car, parked, staring out the
          front windshield. REVERSE to see he's in the parking lot of the bar,
          just watching the entrance.
                         
          INT. THE CROSSROADS BAR - DAY
                         
          Empty except for a handful of regulars. Sam coming through the door,
          taking in the place, the fucking grime and despair. Moving to Donnie
          who is sitting in his same spot...
                         
                          DONNIE
           Well, well, well, wondered when I was
           gonna see you again, ole buddy. How you
           doin?
                         
          Sam sits.
                         
                          SAM
           I'm doin.
                         
                          DONNIE
           Heard you was followin the Lord now.
                          18
                         
                          SAM
           Lil' bit.
                         
          Donnie sizes him up, "how much is a little bit?", turns to the
          BARTENDER...
                         
                          DONNIE
           Jackie, gimme a mash and bud...
                          (TO SAM)
           You want somethin?
                         
          Sam shakes his head.
                         
                          DONNIE (CONT'D)
           You know that old Indian didn't die out
           there that night. Story in the Lehigh
           Valley News bout it. Somebody picked that
           poor bastard up after us, took him to the
           emergency room, you believe that shit?
                         
                          SAM
           God was lookin out for us both, I
           suppose.
                         
          WAITRESS slides a shot and beer in front of Donnie...
                         
                          DONNIE
           Well then, here's to him.
                          (DRINKS)
           Didn't hear you pull up.
                         
                          SAM
           Got Lynn's car.
                         
                          DONNIE
           She broke down on ya?
                         
                          SAM
           Sold her.
                         
                          DONNIE
           Ahhh, shit, man. Shoulda come to yer ole
           buddy first.
                         
          Donnie smiling, inviting him back into this world. And we're
          watching Sam, threshold moment here, considering.
                         
          INT. CHILDERS MOBILE HOME - NIGHT
                         
          It's late and we see Lynn sitting at the kitchen table alone. Sam
          has not come home and she is clearly worried. And then we hear a car
          pulling up outside, door opening and closing, and Sam coming into
          the trailer.
                         
                          SAM
           Sorry I'm late.
                          19
                         
          Lynn staring at him, trying to read this man's face but he's not
          looking at her. Avoiding her gaze. Did he use? Is he high? And then
          she sees a PINPRICK OF DRIED BLOOD on his shirtsleeve. Her face
          contorting almost imperceptibly. Her worst fear realized. Relapse.
                         
          And she moves to him without saying a word... lifts up his arm and
          unbuttons the cuff of his shirt... slowly pushing up his shirtsleeve
          to discover a NEEDLE PRICK in his arm...
                         
          ... and then he pulls out a $20 bill and hands it to her.
                         
                          SAM (CONT'D)
           Gave blood over in Pitt.
                         
          Lynn searching his eyes and she knows he's telling the truth.
                         
                          SAM (CONT'D)
           That's all I got.
                         
          And she pulls him close, hugging him tight, grateful.
                         
                          LYNN
           Somethin will come through. I promise.
                         
          And we hold on Sam, his troubled eyes. Completely out of options.
          And we see that for this man the inability to provide for his family
          is crushing.

          from the back...

          Sam opening the door, coming down the steps, looking up to the sky
          and it is fucking black, swirling, ominous.
                         
          INT. CHILDERS MOBILE HOME - NIGHT

                          SAM
           Come on! Let's go...

                          SAM
           Get Paige, grab a blanket.

          Sam coming in, moving to a metal gun locker in the corner of the
          room, pulling out a SHOTGUN.
                         
          INT. LIVING ROOM - MOBILE HOME - NIGHT
                         
          THE WIND -- SLAMMING the trailer now -- Lynn and Paige -- terrified -
          - watching as Sam moves to the center of the room, points the barrel
          of the shotgun toward the floor and --
                         
          BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!
                         
          Blows four gaping holes in the floorboards, then starts to kick
          through the wood with his boot --
                         
                          LYNN
           (yelling, over the wind)
           What are you doing?!
                         
          He kicks a hole in the planks, turns to Lynn and Paige --
                         
                          SAM
           GET IN!
                         
          Paige crawling through the opening... into a shallow trench
          underneath the trailer... Lynn squeezing in behind her... Sam
          staying outside... no room for him... the trailer starting to buck
          VIOLENTLY in the tempest... thin walls contorting around him...
                         
          ... and Paige starts to cry -- terrified -- Sam laying down on the
          floor next to the opening, close enough so she can hear his voice...
                         
                          SAM (CONT'D)
           Bug, you hear me?! -- Bug?!
                         
                          PAIGE
           Yeah.
                         
          And he starts to play a child's word association game with her...
          something she knows... something they've played before...
                         
                          SAM
           I'm thinkin of a snail... you hear me,
           Bug?! Snail.
                          21
                         
          And we hear her tiny little voice say...
                         
                          PAIGE
           Whale.
                         
                          SAM
           Good job, Bug, good job! You said whale,
           I'm thinkin of a pail!
                         
                          PAIGE
           You said pail, I'm thinkin of a tail.
                         
          And so this little game goes between father and daughter... Paige
          listening to his voice... in the midst of this terrible storm...
          somehow becoming less terrified.

          A brilliantly clear day and we see neighbors picking up after the
          storm. Sam on a ladder leaning against the trailer, nailing down a
          strip of bent aluminum as a pickup truck pulls up. Window rolls down
          and we see it's the CONTRACTOR from before.

          Sam climbs down, moves to the truck, shakes his hand.
                         
                          CONTRACTOR

                          PAIGE
           I wanna peek.

           Keep em closed.
                         
          Sam finally stops them.

           Ok. Open em up.
                         
          They do and both of their eyes go wide with surprise.

          REVERSE to see a modest two bedroom house at the end of this

          Paige sprints for the house as Lynn hugs Sam, softly starts to cry
          into his shoulder.
                         
                          LYNN
           It's beautiful.
                         
          INT. CHILDERS HOUSE - NIGHT
                         
          The first night in their new home and we see a few unpacked moving
          boxes here.
                         
          INT. PAIGE'S ROOM - CHILDERS HOUSE - NIGHT
                         
          Paige sound asleep on a small bed upstairs.
                         
          INT. KITCHEN - CHILDERS' HOUSE - NIGHT
                         
          Lynn in the kitchen organizing the cabinets. And Sam enters carrying
          a box, sets it on the counter.
                         
                          SAM
           That's everything.
                         
                          LYNN
           You get what's in the trunk?
                         
                          SAM
           Yep.
                         
          Lynn looking up, seeing how dirty Sam is from the move...
                         
                          LYNN
           Lord, you're filthy, Sam Childers.
                         
          Lynn tossing him a kitchen towel. Sam, smiling mischievously...
                         
                          SAM
           Who you callin filthy, woman?
                         
                          LYNN
           You.
                         
                          SAM
           You dirtier than I am.
                         
                          LYNN
           No I ain't.
                         
                          SAM
           Yes you are. I seen it. C'mon, girl,

                          24
                         
          Sam winking at her and playfully snapping a kitchen towel at her
          butt... Lynn giggling and scooting away...
                         
                          LYNN
           I ain't doin that no more.
                         
                          SAM
           ... just a little somethin for yer old
           man, c'mon...
                         
          And he snaps her butt again but she grabs the towel and snaps him
          back...
                         
                          SAM (CONT'D)
           Owww!
                         
                          LYNN
           You gimme a little shake...
                         
          She snaps him again and he feels the sting...
                         
                          SAM
           C'mon, Lynn...
                         
          She snaps him again but he grabs her and they fall into each other
          against the counter... laughing... and he kisses her... playful at
          first and then it becomes more passionate... and just as it starts
          to lead somewhere we go...
                         
          INT. CHURCH - DAY - (AUGUST/2002)
                         
          Two years later and we're watching a congregation finish a Sunday
          hymn. Sam, Lynn, Daisy, and Paige (10) in the crowd listening to
          Pastor Krause.
                         
                          PASTOR KRAUSE
           Today we are blessed with a special
           guest. It's my pleasure to welcome Pastor
           Relling from the Kilangire Christian
           Ministry in Uganda, Africa. Pastor...
                         
          Polite applause as a tall, white South African man named PAUL
          RELLING steps up to the pulpit, and in a deep Afrikaner accent he
                         BEGINS --
                         
                          RELLING
           Thank you Pastor Krause, and thank you
           brothers and sisters for inviting me into
           this house of the Lord.
                          (BEAT)
           I'm here today to talk to you about your
           Christian brothers and sisters, families
           just like yours, a half a world away that
           desperately need your help...
                         
          And we see Sam in this sea of faces, listening.
                          25
                         
          INT. FOYER - CHURCH - DAY
                         
          Parishioners slowly filing out of the church after service. Lynn,
          Paige, and a few other women chatting by the entrance.
                         
          And now Lynn looks over her shoulder and sees Sam talking with Paul
          Relling off to the side, just the two of them in a corner, deep in
          discussion.
                         
          INT. CHILDERS HOUSE - NIGHT
                         
          The first thing we notice is the relative "opulence" of this
          place... deep shag, new color TV, matching sectional sofa... the
          rural idea of making it. Sam, Lynn, Daisy and Paige at the dinner
          table eating. Sam in his own world, oblivious to the MINOR
          CONVERSATION until --
                         
                          LYNN
           Paige, go get some more beans.
                         
          Paige heads to the kitchen.
                         
                          LYNN (CONT'D)
           What are you thinking?
                         
                         
                         
                          SAM
           Thinking about Africa.
                         
          Paige comes back in carrying the beans.
                         
                          PAIGE
           They have tigers over there?
                         
                          SAM
                          (JOKINGLY)
           They eat people!
                         
                          LYNN
           What about Africa?
                         
                          SAM
           Just thinkin bout that fella today.
                         
                          PAIGE
           He talked funny.
                         
                          LYNN
           Just from a different place than us,
           baby, that's all.
                         
                          SAM
           Was thinkin maybe I'd go over there. Help
           em out fer a few weeks.
                          26

                          PAIGE
           To see the tigers.
                         
                          SAM
           He was talkin about puttin box beam roofs
           on school houses over there.
                         
                          LYNN
           What about finishing that job in Boswell?
                         
                          SAM
           I'll only be gone a few weeks. Be back
           before you know it.
                         
          EXT. MISSION CONSTRUCTION SITE - OUTSIDE KAMPALA - DAY
                         
          Two weeks later and we're in the rural countryside outside Kampala,
          Uganda. Sam on the roof of a bombed out school building with other
          white VOLUNTEERS, working.
                         
          Sam looks below to see a dozen black men dressed in the ragged
          fatigues of the Sudanese People's Liberation Army (SPLA). Each is
          carrying an AK 47 and standing guard at various points around this
          compound. The lead soldier is a man named DENG. ANGLE three others
          we'll come to know as "NINETEEN", "MARCO" and "A.J."
                         
          EXT. MISSION CONSTRUCTION SITE - DAY
                         
          It's later and we see Deng sitting underneath an awning by himself,
          working on his machine gun. Sam approaches...
                         
                          SAM
           You Ugandan Army or what?
                         
                          DENG
           SPLA.
                         
                          SAM
           What's that?
                         
                          DENG
           Sudanese People's Liberation Army. We are
           freedom fighters.
                         
                          SAM
           Name's Sam Childers.
                         
                          DENG
           I am Deng.
                         
          There is a certain reserved nobility in this man, in the way he
          carries himself and speaks. An unwavering strength and self-reliance
          born from a lifetime of war and struggle.
                          27
                         
                          SAM
           (re: Deng's weapon)
           Givin ya problems?
                         
                          DENG
           Yes. A bit.
                         
                          SAM
           Double-feed?
                         
                          DENG
           Sometimes.
                         
                          SAM
           Lemme have a look...
                         
          Deng hesitates, then hands his AK over to Sam who pops the mag out
          and studies it...
                         
                          SAM (CONT'D)
           Yer mag is tight. See here...
                          (INDICATING)
           The loads are feedin right to the barrel
           face. That's yer problem...
                         
          Sam pulls out a knife and begins to work on the base plate of the
          mag as he explains...
                         
                          SAM (CONT'D)
           ... you need this plate to ramp into the
           chamber... that way yer brass won't get
           stuck...
                          (FINISHING)
           ... there ya go, should be better...
                         
          And Sam hands the weapon back.
                         
                          DENG
           Thank you.
                         
                          SAM
           No problem.
                         
                          DENG
           Are you military?
                         
                          SAM
           No, not me. I ain't the military type.
           Ain't so good with bein told what to do.
                         
                          DENG
           When did you learn about weapons?
                         
          Sam considers the question for a moment... then simply says...

          Fifteen or twenty volunteers lounging on cots in this dorm, playing
          cards, talking, smoking. And we find Sam off from the group, on his
          bunk, reading The Bible...
                         
           VOICE (O.S.)
           Hey Childers...
                         
          Sam turns to find a British man in his late 20's named DAN standing
          next to him, thick Cockney accent, smoking a cigarette.
                         
                          DAN
           Some of us are going into Kampala
           tomorrow night. Find ourselves a little
           fun this weekend. You in?
                         
                          SAM
           I was thinkin bout goin up north.
                         
                          DAN
           You crazy? There's a civil war going on
           up there.
                         
                          SAM

          It's mid-day, blazing hot, and we see Sam approaching Deng.
                         
                          SAM
           Hey, Deng, you wanna Coke?
                         
          Sam offers him a can and he takes it.
                         
                          DENG
           Thank you.
                         
                          SAM
           Got a question for ya.
                         
                          DENG
           Yes?
                         
                          SAM

           The others are going into Kampala.

                          SAM
           That ain't my speed no more. I wanna see
           some country.
                         
          Deng looks at him, surprised by the request...
                         
                          DENG
           You want to see?
                         
          EXT. DIRT ROAD - RURAL UGANDA - DAY
                         
          A dirt road cutting through grassy plain stretching in every
          direction... and we see a BRIGHT YELLOW BUS speeding toward us in
          the distance, kicking a rooster tail of dust high into the air...
          and as it gets closer we see 15 or 20 men piled onto the roof,
          hanging on for dear life as this bus bounces over the road...
                         
          INT. BUS - DRIVING - RURAL UGANDA - SAME
                         
          ... Sam and Deng crammed into this crowded bus...
                         
                          SAM
           They always drive this fast?
                         
                          DENG
           Traveling is the most dangerous time in
           Sudan. If the rebels find you on the open
           road it would be very bad.
                         
          An awkward silence as Deng stares out the window. Sam wanting to
          connect here, but Deng is reticent.
                         
                          SAM
           You got kids, Deng?
                         
                          DENG
           No. I have no children.
                         
                          SAM
           Where you from?
                         
                          DENG
           A little village called Aweil. Many hours
           from here.
                         
                          SAM
           That's where your family is?
                         
          And Deng simply says...
                         
                          DENG
           My family was killed by LRA.
                          (BEAT)
           Unyama is about two hours from here. We
           will stop there for lunch.
                          30
                         
          Deng turns and looks out the window again, silent, quietly watching
          the land blur past. And Sam says nothing more, intuitively feeling
          this man's need to be alone in the moment. A great, lost giant.
                         
          EXT. UNYAMA REFUGEE CAMP, UGANDA - DAY
                         
          A dense sea of people. 20,000 displaced refugees living on top of
          each other.
                         
          Life is lived out in the open here... women bent over brightly
          colored washtubs sloshing clothes in soapy water... smoke from giant
          cooking pots drifting into the air... semi-clothed children, some
          with even younger children on their hips, running everywhere. The
          poverty and hopelessness is overwhelming.
                         
          And we see Sam and Deng walking through the camp...
                         
                          DENG
           The Muslim North has tried to kill the
           Christian South for 30 years. Two million
           have lost their lives...
                         
          Deng sweeping his hand, indicating the mass of refugees.
                         
                          DENG (CONT'D)
           ... these people have been driven from
           their villages, however these camps are
           not much better...
                         
          EXT. MEDICAL AREA - UNYAMA REFUGEE CAMP, UGANDA - DAY
                         
          A row of wood sheds and worn nylon tents marks the hospital area.
          Each enclosure jammed with the desperately sick. Battle-weary AID
          WORKERS move among them, doing what they can, caring for the ones
          who are most desperately ill.
                         
                          DENG
           Cholera and Malaria are everywhere, there
           is little food and not enough UN soldiers
           to protect everyone. Even here they worry
           the LRA will attack at night.
                         
          And another SPLA soldier comes up to Deng --
                         
                          SPLA SOLDIER 1
                          (ARABIC)
           Are you from Kitgum?
                         
                          DENG
                          (ARABIC)
           Yes.
                         
                          SPLA SOLDIER 1
                          (ARABIC)
           Someone wants to speak with you.
                          31
                         
          Deng turns to Sam...
                         
                          DENG
           I'm sorry, Sam... I'll be five minutes.
                         
                          SAM
           Course, do what you gotta do.
                         
          Deng leaves and now Sam is completely alone, taking in this mire of
          humanity all around him. And suddenly there's COMMOTION! -- two aid
          workers coming into this tent carrying a WOMAN on a stretcher. One
          of the aid workers looking around -- a white woman -- mid 30's --
          her name is AGNETE CLOSSON, Regional Director of Doctors Without
          Borders. She sees Sam across the tent.
                         
                          AGNETE
           Excuse me. You. Can you help please?
                         
          Sam moving to her --
                         
                          AGNETE (CONT'D)
           We need to transfer her to the bed. Get
           her shoulders...
                         
          Sam grabbing the woman underneath the shoulders as another aid
          worker gets her feet...
                         
                          AGNETE (CONT'D)
           One, two, three...
                         
          And they swing the woman over to a cot... but as they do the sheer
          piece of blood-stained muslin that was covering her face falls
          away... and we see that she has been mutilated... her lips cut off
          of her face...
                         
          ... and now a DOCTOR sweeps into the tent and begins to work on her.
          Sam and Agnete pushed back, away from the action. Sam still shocked
          by what he's seen.
                         
                          SAM
           What happened to her face?
                         
                          AGNETE
           The rebels cut off her lips because she
           argued. These are Kony's orders.
                         
                          SAM
           Who's Kony?
                         
          Agnete, suddenly suspicious, takes an appraising look of Sam.
                         
                          AGNETE
           Who are you with?
                         
                          SAM
           I'm with Deng over there.
                          32
                         
                          AGNETE
           What organization are you with?
                         
                          SAM
           Working with a Christian group down
           South. Just up here takin a look around,
           seein a bit of the country.
                         
                          AGNETE
           This isn't a tourist destination, this is
           a war zone. You stay in this area, you'll
           be killed.
                          (BEAT)
           Thank you for your help.
                         
          And she walks off.
                         
          EXT. NIMULE, SUDAN - DUSK
                         
          Establishing a bustling trading center on the border of Uganda and
          Sudan. Noisy and overpopulated, a maze of concrete and tin
          buildings, hundreds of people on the streets, riding bicycles,
          finishing their business before nightfall.
                         
          INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIMULE, SUDAN - NIGHT
                         
          A stale room with two cots, bare, institutional. Deng on the edge of
          his cot, pulling off his boots, taking off his jacket, getting
          comfortable. And we see Sam sitting on a small balcony overlooking
          the empty street below.
                         
                          DENG
           Some say Joseph Kony is a wizard. A
           shapeshifter. He calls himself a
           Christian...
                         
          He pulls a baggy of tobacco from his pocket and begins to roll a
          cigarette...
                         
                          DENG (CONT'D)
           ... but I say he is Satan, who devours
           his own people.
                         
                          SAM
           Kony is the leader of the LRA?
                         
                          DENG
           He is the one we have been fighting for
           years. But there is very little we can
           do. Our weapons are old, and our boots
           are full of holes. We have been forgotten
           by the rest of the world.
                         
          And now Deng turns to Sam...
                          33
                         
                          DENG (CONT'D)
           Why are you here?
                         
                          SAM
           S'cuse me?
                         
                          DENG
           What are you looking for in this place?
                         
                          SAM
           Ain't lookin for nuthin.
                         
          Deng staring at him, skeptical...
                         
                          DENG
           And then you will get your picture and go
           back to your life and all this will just
           be a story you tell your friends.
                         
          INT/EXT. HOTEL - NIMULE, SUDAN - NIGHT
                         
          Sam has no response... and Deng lights his cigarette... and suddenly
          we hear voices... through the open window... children's voices...
          Sam peering into the darkness but seeing nothing... only empty
          streets... and then one-by-one... out of the darkness like
          apparitions... we see children coming up the street carrying
          bedrolls... some of them singing spiritual hymns as they walk...
          laughing as children do... at first just a dozen or so... and then
          more... fifty... a hundred...
                         
          EXT. HOTEL ROOM BALCONY - NUMILE, SUDAN - NIGHT
                         
          Deng steps onto the balcony next to Sam.
                         
                          DENG
           They are night commuters. They come from
           deep in the bush. Their parents send them
           out because it is safer to sleep here
           than in their own homes.
                         
                          SAM
           Why?
                         
                          DENG
           Because death comes at night in the
           villages and refugee camps.
                         
          And we continue to watch this great migration of children... now
          streaming into this town... a few of them finding a dark corner just
          below us... unrolling their reed mats... huddling up against each
          other for the long night...
                         
                          DENG (CONT'D)
           These are the lucky one so far. The ones
           the rebels have not found. The invisible
           children.
                          34
                         
          Sam watching them for another beat then suddenly turning, moving
          back into the room...
                         
                          DENG (CONT'D)
           Where are you going?
                         
          INT. STAIRWAY - HOTEL - NIMULE, SUDAN - NIGHT
                         
          Sam coming down these steps. Deng following.
                         
                          DENG
                          (CALLING AFTER)
           Sam...
                         
          EXT. HOTEL - NIMULE, SUDAN - NIGHT
                         
          Sam exiting the hotel, moving to a group of 5 children huddled on
          the sidewalk...
                         
                          SAM
           Get up... let's go...
                         
          The children looking up, surprised to see a white man here...
                         
                          SAM (CONT'D)
           Come on...
                         
          The children getting to their feet... and Sam moves to another
          cluster of children up the block as Deng catches up to him...
                         
                          DENG
           What are you doing?
                         
                          SAM
           They ain't sleepin out here. Tell em
           they're comin inside.
           (to children on the ground)
           Ya'll get up... let's go...
                         
          And Sam starts to move up the block further, wanting to gather up
          more children, but Deng stops him...
                         
                          DENG
           Sam, there are too many...
                         
          And he looks up the street and we see more children here than we
          thought... hundreds of young kids huddled on the streets...
                         
                          DENG (CONT'D)
           ... you can't help them all.
                         
          Sam knows he's right. A moment here as he looks to the children he's
          gathered, staring up at him...
                         
                          SAM
           I can help these here.

          INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIMULE, SUDAN - NIGHT
                         
          -- and a DOZEN CHILDREN are ushered into this small room. Sam
          pushing their cots against a wall so there's more space. Deng
          speaking to the children --
                         
                          DENG
                          (ARABIC)
           Settle down... it's alright... you can
           sleep here till morning...
                         
          -- and they begin to settle onto the floor... and now we notice a
          particular BOY in this group... maybe 8 years old... wearing bright
          GREEN SHORTS... and we watch as he and his SISTER move to a corner
          of the room and unroll their mats...
                         
          ... and eventually Sam turns off the lamp and we stay here in the
          dark... Sam on his cot, listening to these 12 little children
          breathing... their shifting bodies on the floor trying to get
          comfortable... and then...
                         
                          CUT TO:
                         
          INT. HOTEL ROOM - NUMILE, SUDAN - DAY
                         
          Sam's closed eyes... sound asleep...
                         
          Just before dawn. Deng standing over him, shaking him awake...
                         
                          DENG
           The LRA attacked a village last night.
                         
          Sam looking up to him...
                         
                          DENG (CONT'D)
           You said you wanted to see.
                         
          Sam sits up, looks around the hotel room and we see that it's
          empty... the children vanished... only a small, handmade toy on the
          ground which has been left behind.
                         
          INT. PICKUP TRUCK - DRIVING - RURAL SUDAN - DAY
                         
          Sam, Deng, and a few other SPLA SOLDIERS jammed into the flatbed of
          this truck, carrying heavy weapons, bouncing fast over this open
          dirt road... featureless savanna FADING into sporadic mud huts...
          the outskirts of a VILLAGE in the distance... and thin columns of
          black smoke twisting into the air...
                         
          ... and as the truck gets closer to the village we begin to pass
          CHILDREN walking along the side of the road... night commuters
          returning to their village... some of them huddled together,
          weeping...
                          36
                         
          ... and we notice -- Sam notices -- the little boy in the GREEN
          SHORTS, walking hand-in-hand with his sister, their faces quiet
          masks of fear as they move closer to their home.
                         
          EXT. VILLAGE - YEI, SUDAN - DAY
                         
          The pickup arrives and Sam, Deng, and the other soldiers hop out...
          and this is what they see:
                         
          Complete devastation. 30 or 40 bodies mutilated and stacked outside
          smoking tukuls. Some children already here, on their knees, weeping
          next to the corpses of their parents. If you could smell the air it
          would smell of burnt flesh and death.
                         
          Sam silent, aghast, just staring at the horror all around him...
                         
          ... and now we see GREEN SHORTS and his sister arriving at the
          village... moving to their family's tukul and discovering their
          mother and father piled outside. Naked and burned alive. And the
          sister falls onto her mother's corpse and begins to wail as GREEN
          SHORTS stands there -- frozen -- staring down at his dead parents --
          and suddenly --
                         
          MOVEMENT! -- from inside the tukul... a small dog... a family pet...
          darting into the open... running across the dirt... GREEN SHORTS
          going after it, yelling his name...
                         
          Sam watching the boy chasing after his dog, rounding a corner out of
          sight...
                         
          ... for a moment...
                         
          ... just the boy's voice calling after his dog... and then...
                         
          BOOOOM!
                         
          A muffled burst -- in the distance -- Sam, Deng, and the other
          soldiers running out of the village toward the explosion...
                         
          EXT. DIRT ROAD - YEI, SUDAN - DAY
                         
          ... Sam, Deng, and the others arriving at the source of the
          explosion. And we see GREEN SHORTS laying on the side of the road...
          cut in half by a land mine... his dead eyes wide open with
          surprise...
                         
          ... and Sam drops to his knees... lifting what's left of the boy
          into his arms and rocking him back and forth... and we watch as a
          terrible sadness overtakes him... something happening here... a
          fierce and overwhelming burden dropping into this man as he holds
          this dead boy... in the dirt... in the middle of this savage
          world...
                         
          ... and as Sam puts it, his "life changed forever" in this moment...
          and we see him looking up to the heavens...
                          37
                         
          tears streaming down his face... saying something we can't hear, but
          it's a promise... to God...
                         
          To save the children of Sudan.
                         
          INT. PITTSBURGH AIRPORT - DAY
                         
          A bright, fluorescent corridor filled with garish advertising and
          harried travelers rushing to make planes... and we find Sam coming
          down this concourse, carrying his duffle bag, his face
          expressionless. He reaches a revolving door but stops... doesn't
          pass through... sees Lynn, Paige, and his mother waiting for him on
          the other side... their happy, expectant faces...
                         
          But they don't see him yet... and he just stays here... hidden...
          watching them through the glass... and as Sam puts it, at this
          moment he realized he would never look at his own family the same
          way again... in some way lost to them forever after what he saw on
          the side of road in Yei...
                         
          ... and finally he forces a smile, pushes through the revolving door
          and we watch, from this side of the glass, as Paige leaps into his
          arms... Lynn and Daisy moving to him too, embracing him, welcoming
          him home.
                         
          INT. BATHROOM - PAIGE'S ROOM - CHILDERS HOUSE - NIGHT
                         
          Paige brushing her teeth at the sink. Sam watching her from the
          doorway...
                         
                          PAIGE
           You see any tigers over there?
                         
                          SAM
           Naw, didn't see no tigers.
                         
                          PAIGE
           But they do have them over in Africa.
                         
                          SAM
           So I hear, but not where I was.
                         
                          PAIGE
           Sure am glad you're home.
                         
                          SAM
           Me too, bug.
                         
                          PAIGE
           I'm thinkin of a plane...
                         
                          SAM
           It's late, you better get to bed...
                         
          And he grabs her and carries her into the bedroom, plops her onto
          the bed...
                          38
                         
                          PAIGE
           C'mon, plane... I'm thinkin of a plane...
                         
          Sam giving in, playing their little game as she gets under the
          covers...
                         
                          SAM
           You said plane, I'm thinkin of a train...
                         
                          PAIGE
           You said train, I'm thinkin of a brain.
                         
                          SAM
           You said brain, I'm thinkin of a...
                          (HESITATING)
                         
                          PAIGE
           Gotcha!
                         
                          SAM
           Ok, you got me.
                         
                          PAIGE
           You coulda said drain, or mane... like
           horse's hair.
                         
          Sam bending over, kissing her forehead...
                         
                          SAM
           Sweet dreams, bug.
                         
          INT. HALLWAY - CHILDERS HOUSE - NIGHT
                         
          Sam coming out of Paige's bedroom, pulling the door closed, finding
          Lynn waiting for him.
                         
                          LYNN
           You comin to bed?
                         
                          SAM
           In a bit
                         
                          LYNN
           You ok?
                         
                          SAM
           Just a long flight.
                         
          She senses more but knows this man well enough not to push... and so
          she simply turns away.
                         
          EXT. FRONT PORCH - CHILDERS HOUSE - NIGHT
                         
          Quiet. Just Sam on this porch all alone, been here for some time,
          eyes far off, images in his mind he can't seem to shake.
                          39
                         
          And he steps into the yard... walking along the side of the house...
          just moving... trying to shed this feeling like snakeskin...
                         
          ... and he comes to something on the ground which stops him dead in
          his tracks... something we don't see yet... and slowly he reaches
          down and picks up...
                         
          A LITTLE DOLL. One of Paige's toys. Soiled and faded and left in the
          dirt. And we watch him holding this forgotten doll... and what we
          see on his face ain't pretty... his world collapsing out from under
          him... trying to keep rein on his emotions... a battle he's losing.
                         
          INT. BEDROOM - CHILDERS HOUSE - MORNING
                         
          Lynn stirs awake, looks next to her and realizes Sam never made it
          to bed the night before.
                         
          EXT. CHILDERS HOUSE - MORNING
                         
          Lynn coming out the front door in her nightgown, sees a light on in
          a utility shed in the back...
                         
          INT. UTILITY SHED - MORNING
                         
          ... Lynn slowly pushing open the door to find Sam on the floor,
          hunched over a pad of Paige's art paper... drawing... paper wads
          strewn all around him... been here all night...
                         
                          LYNN
           Baby, whatcha doin?
                         
          He looks up...
                         
                          SAM
           Makin plans.
                         
                          LYNN
           You been to bed yet?
                         
          He gathers up a couple of the papers, moves to her.
                         
                          SAM
           I had a vision last night, Lynn. Crazy as
           it sounds, God spoke to me...
                         
          He hands her a sheet of paper -- CU to see it's a crude drawing of
          building.
                         
                          SAM (CONT'D)
           I'm gonna build a church.
                         
                          LYNN
           A church?
                          40
                         
                          SAM
           Right across the street. Not like Faith
           United or Calvary Fellowship. Place that
           ain't gonna turn you away if you a drug
           addict or a prostitute or whatever. Place
           for sinners, just like me, who wanna hear
           the word of God.
                         
          Lynn studying him, trying to judge how serious he is here. And Sam
          looking back at her, his eyes like we haven't seen them before.
          Sparkling.
                         
                          LYNN
           How we gonna pay for a church, Sam?
                         
                          SAM
           We got money in the bank. Business is
           good. Besides, I own a construction
           company...
                          (SMILING)
           I'm gonna give us one heck of a good deal
           on the build.
                         
          She smiles, shaking her head, catching his enthusiasm...
                         
                          LYNN
           Yer crazy.
                         
                          SAM
           `Lil bit.
                         
                          LYNN
           What's that?
                         
          He hands her the other paper -- CU to see it's a another drawing.
                         
                          SAM
           That's the orphanage I wanna build. In
           Sudan.
                         
                          CUT TO:
                         
          EXT. RURAL ROAD - CENTRAL CITY, PENN. - DAY - (MAY/2003)
                         
          Eight months later and we're looking at a simple, cinder block
          church which is under construction. A scattering of pickup trucks
          parked at the site and a flurry of activity. WORKMEN pouring cement,
          laying sheetrock, etc. And Sam in the middle of this crew, putting
          the finishing touches on a timber frame which is about to be raised.
                         
          EXT. PLAYGROUND - JOHNSTOWN, PENN. - DAY
                         
          Children at play, laughing, screaming, swinging on swing sets and
          digging in a sand pit. And we see Sam off to the side, leaning
          against a (new) black Harley, watching Paige playing in the group.

           VOICE (O.S.)
           Sam Childers...
                         
          Sam turns to see a BIKER, late 40's, leather vest, standing with his
          12 year old DAUGHTER.
                         
                          SAM
           That's me.
                         
          The Biker extends his hand, they shake.
                         
                          BIKER
           Hey bro, Ben Hobbes, knew each other long
           time ago.
                         
                          SAM
           Yeah, Ben, how you doin?
                         
                          DAUGHTER
           Daddy, I'm gonna go.
                         
                          BIKER
           OK, sweetie...
                         
          She runs off.
                         
                          BIKER (CONT'D)
           Goddamn, they grow up quick, don't they?
                         
                          SAM
           Sure do.
                         
                         
                         
                          BIKER
           Hey, nuthin fer nuthin, Sam, but rumor
           has it you was puttin up a chapel over
           there in Central City.
                         
                          SAM
           That's right. Gonna minister to anybody
           who's lookin for The Lord.
                         
                          BIKER
           That's good, man. Maybe you can do
           somethin bout your old friend, Donnie.
                         
                          SAM
           What about em?
                         
                          BIKER
           He ain't doin so good, bro. But hey, good
           seein ya' man.

          EXT. CRACK HOUSE - JOHNSTOWN, PENN. - DAY
                         
          A torn up house in a shitty part of town, windows spray painted
          black. Sam pulls up to the curb on his Harley, gets off, opens one
          of the bike's hard cases and pulls out the same SAWED OFF 10 gage
          we've seen before... chambers a slug as he moves toward the house...
                         
          INT. CRACK HOUSE - JOHNSTOWN, PENN. - DAY
                         
          Dark, junkie squalor. Two or three people slumped on a ratty couch,
          strung-out, watching a flickering TV -- and then --
                         
          THE FRONT DOOR CAVES IN!
                         
          Sam coming into the house -- sawed-off leveled -- junkies scrambling
          for cover -- YELLING! -- CHAOS! -- Sam moving into --
                         
          INT. CRACK HOUSE - BACK ROOM - DAY
                         
          Sam comes around the corner and finds himself face-to-face with a
          CRACKHEAD pointing a .357 MAGNUM -- eyes amped up and wild --
          shaking -- a stand-off -- and Sam sees a body on a bare mattress in
          the b.g. -- bone thin and pale -- spent hypodermic hanging out of
          his arm --
                         
          It's Donnie.
                         
                          SAM
           I'm here for that boy right there. You
           gonna get in the way a that?
                         
          A TENSE BEAT -- not sure how this is gonna go -- and then the
          CRACKHEAD shakes his head "no"
                         
          INT. CHILDERS HOUSE - CENTRAL CITY, PENN. - DAY
                         
          Donnie in a bed, covers pulled up to his neck and he's shaking bad,
          retching in a bucket, deep in the throes of a detox. Sam and Lynn
          here doing what they can, toweling off his forehead, trying to keep
          him warm, as Donnie pulls the sheets tighter, gritting his teeth,
          shaking his head.
                         
                          DONNIE
           I can't do this.
                         
                          SAM
           Look at me. God don't make trash, boy.
           Now he ain't givin up on you, so don't
           give up on him, you hear me?
                         
          And somehow Donnie finds strength in his words, and in Sam's hand
          touching his head, and he nods.

          EXT. RURAL ROAD - CENTRAL CITY, PENN. - DAY - (AUGUST/2003)
                         
          A bright Sunday morning and we're staring at the cinder block church
          which is almost completely finished... the sound of a garage band
          coming from inside, playing an unlikely rendition of a spiritual
          hymn... and a handful of people, dressed for service, moving up the
          cement stairs into...
                         
          INT. ENTRY HALL - SHEKINAH FELLOWSHIP CHURCH - DAY
                         
          And we see Donnie, dressed in his biker jacket and a buttondown
          shirt, sober for the moment, greeting people as they come through
          the front door. Standing next to him is Daisy handing out programs.
                         
                          DONNIE
           Welcome to Shekinah Fellowship Church.
                         
          INT. CHAPEL - SHEKINAH FELLOWSHIP CHURCH - CENTRAL CITY - DAY
                         
          Still under construction. Exposed beams and bare insulation on the
          walls. There's a small riser at the front of the hall with an altar,
          organ, and the GARAGE BAND playing the rocked-out hymn.
                         
          A handful of people here sitting in pews. FARMERS in clean overalls,
          FACTORY WORKERS, BIKERS still dressed in their riding leathers,
          listening to the garage band and chatting.
                         
          And now we see Lynn and Paige (11) standing near the back. Lynn
          nervous, checking her watch.
                         
          INT. FOYER - SHEKINAH FELLOWSHIP CHURCH - DAY
                         
          Sam on his knees, sleeves rolled up to his elbows, wrenching a
          leaking pipe. Lynn and Daisy walk in...
                         
                          LYNN
           It's five-til and he still ain't here.
                         
          Sam hearing this, moving to his feet, toweling off his hands.
                         
                          SAM
           You call him?
                          (LYNN NODS)
           Try him again.
                         
          Lynn exits and Daisy steps forward, shuts the door behind her. Just
          she and Sam here alone now.
                         
                          DAISY
           You like this dress, Sam?
                         
                          SAM
           What, mom?
                          44
                         
                          DAISY
           You ain't never seen this one. I bought
           it a long time ago. Been keepin it for a
           special occasion.
                         
                          SAM
           It's nice.
                         
                          DAISY
           I never told you this but when I was
           pregnant with you, now this was way back,
           probably 1960, when yer daddy and I was
           still in Grand Rapids, a Pastor
           prophesied over me. Pulled me right up on
           stage and laid his hands on my belly and
           told me I was gonna have a Preacher for a
           son.
           (smiling at the thought)
           Yer daddy and I were so proud. I remember
           we went home and neither of us could
           sleep all night. Just laid there and
           talked bout you, bout what was comin.
                         
                          SAM
           I just built a church. I ain't no
           preacher.
                         
                          DAISY
           Yes you are. You were born to it. Just
           took you a little ways to get here.
                         
          INT. CHAPEL - SHEKINAH FELLOWSHIP CHURCH - DAY
                         
          Sam entering at the back of the chapel, taking a moment to
          appreciate what he's looking at: 20 or 30 people here in the church
          that he built. A dream realized. And he walks down the center aisle,
          shaking hands with a few people, climbing steps to the altar and
          switching on the microphone...
                         
                          SAM
           (to the band)
           Thank you, Tommy. You boys is soundin
           pretty good up here.
                         
          Sam turning to the crowd, clearing his throat, clearly nervous.
                         
                          SAM (CONT'D)
           I wanna thank ya'll for comin out for the
           first day of worship here at Shekinah
           Fellowship Church.
                         
          Some applause. Lynn and Paige sitting with Daisy who is beaming.
                          45
                         
                          SAM (CONT'D)
           The guest preacher we had booked today
           ain't shown up... so I thought I'd say a
           word or two.
                         
          An awkward beat...
                         
                          SAM (CONT'D)
           Lotta yous been wonderin what made me
           wanna build this here church. Seein as I
           ain't the best seed in the bunch I can
           understand that.
                         
          A beat, considering what to say... and he begins...
                         
                          SAM (CONT'D)
           Buncha years ago I was runnin from some
           bad fellas in the woods over there by
           Cleary. Those old boys was comin after me
           hard and I reached in my bag lookin for
           my old shotgun but it was gone. My momma
           had took it out when I wasn't lookin and
           put this bible in there instead...
                         
          Sam holding up a worn bible, and we start to notice something
          here... a transformation happening in this man as he speaks to these
          people. His nervousness falling away and a natural charisma taking
          over...
                         
                          SAM (CONT'D)
           Well I figured I was done for, so I sat
           down under an old tree with this useless
           book and I waited...
                         
          And we see the congregation hanging on his every word, identifying
          with this man standing before them. One of their own.
                         
                          SAM (CONT'D)
           ... and then the strangest thing
           happened. Them boys ran right on past me.
           Didn't even see me sittin there. Now the
           way I figure it, things would have turned
           out pretty different if I had pulled out
           that shotgun instead of this here Bible.
           And that's probably the first time I can
           remember God savin my butt.
                          (BEAT)
           God... and my momma.
                         
          Some laughter and applause...
                         
                          SAM (CONT'D)
           Figure least I could do was build em both
           this church.
                         
          And the congregation responds with a Hallelujah!

          Sam holding Paige, her face buried in his shoulder, crying.
                         
                          SAM
           Be back soon as I can.
                         
                          PAIGE
           You're gonna miss my play.
                         
                          SAM
           Have momma videotape it for me, k? Now I
           gotta git.
                         
          Lynn pulling Paige off, kissing Sam on the lips.

           I will.
                         
          Sam turning to Donnie, and we see he's back to the hulking man he
          once was.
                         
                          SAM (CONT'D)
           You watch out for em while I'm gone, ya
           hear?

           That's done, buddy.
                         
          Sam winks, slaps Donnie on the shoulder, as we --

          And we see a line of SPLA soldiers (including NINETEEN, MARCO, and
          A.J.) sitting in the dirt, pulling on NEW BOOTS, smiling, spit-
          polishing them to a high shine.

          Deng driving fast down this bumpy road. Sam in the passenger seat.
          Nineteen, Marco, and A.J. in the flatbed of this truck, ever
          watchful.
                          47
                         
                          SAM
           Right here, stop the truck!
                         
          EXT. DIRT ROAD - DEEP IN THE BUSH - DAY
                         
          Sam already out of the truck, moving into the bush. Deng
          following...
                         
                          DENG
           Sam, wait...
                         
          But he's not listening, moving through the scrub to a small
          clearing... walking around...
                         
                          DENG (CONT'D)
           It is not safe here.
                         
          Sam kneeling down, picking up a handful of red dirt, letting it
          trickle through his fingers...
                         
                          SAM
           This is it...
                         
          EXT. NIMULE - ON THE BORDER OF SUDAN AND UGANDA - DAY
                         
          Establishing a busy trading town on the border of Sudan and Uganda.
          And we see a small crowd of villagers standing underneath a tarp,
          watching a small color TV (the only TV for miles) -- on the screen
          we see a black man in a military uniform giving a fiery speech --
          this is JOHN GARANG -- one of the good guys -- the founder of the
          SPLA.
                         
          INT. GOVERNMENT OFFICE - NIMULE, SUDAN - DAY
                         
          A tight, cramped office filled with villagers. Two or three men
          here at desks handling the administration of life in the bush:
          renewing travel papers, registering newborn children, hearing
          complaints from local farmers, etc. And we see Sam and Deng at one
          of these desks, a topographical map splayed out in front of them.
                         
                          ADMINISTRATOR
           This is not a good idea.
                         
                          SAM
           I think it's a heckuva good idea.
                         
                          ADMINISTRATOR
           It would be better further south. Closer
           to Kampala.
                         
                          SAM
           If I wanted to be closer to Kampala, I'd
           be closer to Kampala. I wanna be right
           here...
                         
          Sam pointing to the map. The Administrator turning to Deng --
                          48
                         
                          ADMINISTRATOR
                          (ARABIC)
           He should not be this far north.
                         
                          SAM
           What are you sayin?
                         
                          ADMINISTRATOR
           The villages in this area are very
           remote, Mr. Childers. There is nothing
           there.
                         
                          SAM
           Then it seems to me them people need help
           the most.
                         
                          ADMINISTRATOR
           (to Deng, Arabic)
           He will be killed.
                         
                          SAM
           Talk to me.
                         
          The Administrator turning to him, laying it out simply --
                         
                          ADMINISTRATOR
           This is in the war zone, Mr. Childers.
           The LRA will kill you here.
                         
                          SAM
           I don't think you understand me, so lemme
           make it real clear to ya. I didn't pick
           this land -- God did.
                         
          EXT. CHILDREN'S ORPHANGE - SUDAN - DAY - THREE MONTHS LATER
                         
          What we're looking at is the modest beginning of The Angels of East
          Africa Children's Orphanage. A cluster of tukuls and 2 or 3
          rudimentary wood buildings built on the dirt Sam first let trickle
          between his fingers.
                         
          And we see life already finding it's place within these bamboo
          walls. Acholi WORKERS laying brick on what will eventually become a
          schoolhouse and chapel.
                         
          And we find Sam with two or three small CHILDREN who are crying for
          no apparent reason. He's on his knees, trying his best to soothe
          them but he is way out of his depth here.
                         
          And now we see Deng in the b.g. approaching with a powerfully built
          Ugandan woman in her late 40's.
                         
                          DENG
                          (INTRODUCING)
           Sam... this is Betty. She is from the
           village of Kotido. A few miles from here.
                          49
                         
                          SAM
           Good to meet you Betty.
                         
          Betty, no reaction. Just the incessant crying of the children in the
          b.g.
                         
                          DENG
           She is knowing that you need someone to
           run the orphanage.
                         
                          SAM
           I'm lookin for somebody who can keep the
           place in order. Make sure things is taken
           care of when I'm away.
                         
                          DENG
           She can do this.
                         
                          SAM
           She's gonna have to take care of the
           children too, make sure they're fed, fix
           em when they're sick. Can she do that?
                         
          Betty hears this, turns to the crying children and softly says --
                         
                          BETTY
                          (ARABIC)
           Quiet now.
                         
          -- and instantly their crying stops.
                         
                          SAM
           Tell her she's hired.
                         
          INT. DORM - CHILDREN'S ORPHANGE - NIGHT
                         
          We see Betty and another Camp Woman (ROSE) moving through this room
          carrying lanterns, helping the children get ready for sleep --
                         
                          BETTY
                          (ARABIC)
           You two share a blanket and tomorrow we
           will find another.
                         
                          ROSE
                          (ARABIC)
           Shhhh, it's time to shut your eyes...
                         
          And we see Sam here too, doing what he can, tucking in a few of the
          kids, starting to make a connection with these children.
                         
          EXT. CHILDREN'S ORPHANAGE - NIGHT
                         
          And we see a handful of SPLA soldiers stationed around the perimeter
          of the compound, standing guard. Sam and Deng sitting next to a
          lantern by the front gate.
                          50
                         
                          SAM
           You know what's funny? In English your
           name means "darn it."
                         
                          DENG
           What is this `darn it?'
                         
                          SAM
           Deng. It means `shucks.' You know, like
           you stub your toe and you go "ahhhhh,
           deng!" Get it?
                         
                          DENG
                          (DEAD SERIOUS)
           This is not funny. In my language, in
           Arabic, names are very important. They
           tell you everything about a man.
                          (BECOMING HEATED)
           Your name proceeds you wherever you go.
           You are Sam. This is how you are known.
           In my language this means something.
                         
          Sam feeling terrible, realizes he's offended him.
                         
                          SAM
           I'm sorry, buddy. It was just a joke.
                         
          Quiet, awkward, just the two of them sitting here quietly for a long
          beat. Finally...
                         
                          SAM (CONT'D)
           What does Sam mean in Arabic?
                         
                          DENG
           Small penis.
                         
          And Deng smiles brightly. Sam realizing he's been played. And Deng
          starts to LAUGH. A deep, guttural, infectious laugh. Sam joining
          him, and we sense that at this moment these two have become friends.
          And gradually their laughter subsides, and it's quiet again.
                         
                          SAM
           Can I ask you a question?
                         
                          DENG
           Of course.
                         
                          SAM
           You believe in God?
                         
          Deng considering this for a beat, and then...
                         
                          DENG
           I was raised to believe there was a God
           in heaven.
                          (MORE)
                          51
                          DENG (CONT'D)
           But it is impossible to live here, to see
           what I have seen, and not turn your back
           on him.
                         
          BEAT.
                         
                          SAM
           Maybe you'll invite him in again one day.
                         
                          DENG
           I don't think so.
                         
                          CUT TO:
                         
          EXT. AFRICA NIGHT - PITCH BLACK
                         
          The heavy stillness of an African summer night. Only the sound of
          Kestrel hawks screeching far off in the distance, hunting prey...
          and the drone of African Cicadas buzzing all around us.
                         
          INT. DORM - CHILDREN'S ORPHANAGE - NIGHT
                         
          The children sprawled on their mats sound asleep.

          INT. SAM'S TUKUL - CHILDREN'S ORPHANAGE - NIGHT
                         
          Sam sitting on his cot. He rips open an airmail package and pulls
          out a small VIDEOCASSETTE, slides it in a VIDEOCAMERA, hits play --
                         
          ON THE SMALL VIDEO SCREEN we see Paige, dressed in a pilgrim
          costume, performing in a Thanksgiving Day play. Her voice coming
          through the tiny speakers as she recites her lines. Sam smiling at
          what he's watching.
                         
          EXT. FRONT GATE - CHILDREN'S ORPHANAGE - NIGHT
                         
          A few of the SPLA soldiers sitting next to their weapons in the
          dark, smoking, tossing beads into a carved wooden trough, playing
          the ancient game of Mancala --
                         
                          SOLDIER #2
                          (ARABIC)
           That was a mistake...
                         
                          SOLDIER #3
                          (ARABIC)
           Where?
                         
                          SOLDIER #2
                          (ARABIC)
           Right here... your third "house" is
           open...
                          52
                         
          Soldier #3 reacting to his mistake as --
                         
          -- WE SEE SHADOWS IN THE DARKNESS... MAYBE 10 OR 12 FIGURES MOVING
          SLOWLY THROUGH THE UNDERBRUSH... LRA REBELS... APPROACHING THE
          PERIMETER OF THE ORPHANAGE.
                         
          The SPLA soldiers oblivious to the advance.
                         
          INT. SAM'S TUKUL - CHILDREN'S ORPHANAGE - NIGHT
                         
          Sam watching Paige's play -- when suddenly --
                         
          AN EXPLOSION! -- machinegun fire popping o.s. -- Sam hitting the
          ground, scrambling for cover --
                         
          EXT. CHILDREN'S ORPHANAGE - NIGHT
                         
          -- Sam rushing out of his tukul -- sees the front gate OBLITERATED
          from a grenade blast -- bamboo fence burning -- the death song of
          AK47's howling in the darkness --
                         
                         NEW ANGLE
                         
          -- Sam hustling across the compound -- joining Deng and another
          soldier behind a makeshift shed --
                         
                          SAM
           How many are there?
                         
                          DENG
           Two squads...
                          (INDICATING)
           There -- and there.
                         
          Sam peering around the corner -- sees MUZZLE FLASHES in the
          blackness -- maybe 15 or 20 rebels moving through the bush like
          specters -- flanking the compound --
                         
                          SAM
           Where are your men?
                         
                          DENG
           I don't know.
                         
          Sam looking around, realizing the rest of the SPLA soldiers are
          scattered throughout the compound firing randomly into the dark.
                         
                          SAM
           They're gonna pick us off like this!
                         
          Sam, split-second decision here -- and he starts to sprint across
          the compound to --

          INT. DORM - CHILDREN'S ORPHANAGE - NIGHT
                         
          TERRIFIED SCREAMING! -- the children cowering in the corners --
          Betty and Rose here trying to calm them down --

          Sam bursting through the door --
                         
                          SAM
           -- Betty! Get em to the church right now!
                          (ARABIC)
           Quickly.

          Betty nodding as Sam rushes out --
                         
          INT. STOREROOM - CHILDREN'S VILLAGE ORPHANAGE - NIGHT
                         
          -- Sam bombing into this shed -- quickly opening a metal chest and
          pulling out an AK47 and mags of ammo --
                         
          EXT. FRONT GATE - CHILDREN'S ORPHANAGE - NIGHT

          Deng and pops a mag into the machinegun --
                         
                          SAM
           Get yer men back to the church! That's
           our best shot! I'll cover you...
                         
          And Sam starts to open up the AK -- laying down a curtain of
          suppression fire as Deng shouts to his men --
                         
                          DENG

           To the church! --

          INT. CHAPEL - CHILDREN'S ORPHANAGE - NIGHT
                         
          Betty and the other Camp woman herding the terrified children into
          this building -- the only brick structure on the compound -- and
          then Deng, Marco, A.J. and the other SPLA soldiers coming in --
          moving to the window holes and returning fire --

          EXT. FRONT GATE - CHILDREN'S VILLAGE ORPHANAGE - NIGHT
                         
          Sam sweeping the AK back and forth, trying to hold off the rebels as
          long as he can -- and then --
                         
          KABOOOM!!
                         
          More of the fence eviscerated by a grenade blast.
                         
          REBELS ADVANCING ON THE ORPHANAGE -- BREACHING THE PERIMETER --
                         
          Sam becoming overwhelmed in the fight -- firing as he retreats back
          into the compound --

                          SAM
           (meaning the children)
           Put em in the middle!
                         
          Betty and the other woman do exactly that -- they move the children
          into a tight group in the center of the room.
                         
                          BETTY

          Rebels moving through the compound, firing into tukuls and setting
          everything on fire.

          Sam starting to open up with his AK -- Krakakakakakak! -- spent
          shells showering down around the children huddled in the middle of
          the room.

          Rebels swarming around the chapel, but reaching a point where they
          can't advance any further --
                         
          -- and we see a rebel squat behind a shed and screw an RPG into a
          launcher -- he pops up -- levels the launcher at the chapel and --
                         
          Krakakakakak!

          burning through magazines and reloading -- rebels firing back --
          Betty and the children crowded on the floor in the middle of this
          STORM OF GUNFIRE -- and we stay in this little chapel -- watching
          this last stand -- until we --

          And we see the entire orphanage has been razed to the ground. Betty
          and a few of the children picking through the burned out buildings
          and torched tukuls, looking for anything salvageable. Deng,
          Nineteen, and some of the SPLA soldiers loading the corpses of
          rebels into the back of the truck...
                         
          ... and now we find Sam staring at the brick chapel in the middle of
          the compound. The only structure that remains. Everything else --
          his entire dream -- in ashes.

          And we see Lynn pushing a shopping cart down the aisle, past shelves
          loaded with packaged produce. And we hear BUZZING. Lynn digging the
          cell phone out of her purse --

          And we find Sam sitting at a table along this dusty, crowded street.
          His duffelbag on the ground next to him.
                         
                          SAM
                          (INTO PHONE)

                          SAM
           They burned it to the ground. All of it.

          And we're watching her here, clocking the resignation in his voice.
          A moment of quiet for both of them. Lynn sensing the dimensions of
          his heartache. All she wants to do is bring him home, hold him
          close, ease his pain... but she knows that's not what he needs...
          not this man...

          the other shoppers. And she says...

          BEGIN SEQUENCE. Giving us a sense that many months are passing.
                         
          -- Sam and a crew of VILLAGE MEN hauling the charred remnants of
          tukuls and burned building out of the compound on their backs.
                         
          -- The remainder of the bamboo fence that once surrounded the
          orphanage being torn down.
                         
          -- Nineteen, Marco, A.J. and a few other SPLA soldiers cutting the
          bush away from the edge of the compound with machetes.
                         
                          SAM

           hide...
                         
          -- Sam, Deng and the crew of village men digging post holes around
          the perimeter of the orphanage...

           All the way around...
                         
          -- The men sinking metal beams into the holes with cement, then
          surrounding the compound with heavy gage CHAINLINK FENCE.
                         
          -- New DORMS being built from brick. An INFIRMARY. A MESS HALL.
          SOLDIER'S BARRACKS. And finally, Sam laying the last brick on the
          chapel in the center of the compound. Completing it.
                         
          INT. OFFICE - CHILDREN'S ORPHANAGE - DAY
                         
          A simple administrative office with a short-wave radio and sat
          phone. Sam here, sitting at a desk when we hear a knock at the door.
                          58

          The door opens and we see Deng.
                         
                          DENG
           Preacher, you need to come see this.
                         
          EXT. CHILDREN'S ORPHANAGE - DAY
                         
          Sam following Deng to the center of the compound where we see 5 or 6
          camp women (including Betty and Rose) dressed in colorful robes and
          headdresses. Maybe 80 children here, quietly sitting in the dirt,
          watching the women. Nineteen, Marco, A.J. and the rest of the SPLA
          soldiers here too, watching from the side.
                         
                          SAM
           What's goin on?
                         
                          DENG
           The Acholi people were farmers before
           they were driven from their ancestral
           homeland. Each year they blessed the soil
           before a planting.
                         
          And now the women begin to move in unison... singing an ancient
          Acholi song as one of the older orphan boys beats a small drum in
          accompaniment...
                         
                          DENG (CONT'D)
                          (TRANSLATING)
           They are saying that fire brings strength
           and ashes abundance...
                         
          The women continuing their dance... moving in a tight circle and
          stomping their feet as they sing...
                         
                          DENG (CONT'D)
                          (TRANSLATING)
           ... when the land burns, the next year
           the soil produces more...
                         
          And now Betty peels away from the group and approaches Sam, talking
          to him directly in Arabic...
                         
                          BETTY
                          (ARABIC)
           The children are your fields...
                         
                          DENG
                          (TRANSLATING)
           ... she says you are a farmer and these
           children are your crops...
                          59
                         
          Sam looking to the 80 little orphans watching this from the side...
          and now Betty bends down and scoops up a bit of ashen earth and runs
          her finger across his forehead, blessing him...
                         
                          BETTY
                          (ARABIC)
           ... and this ground will grow them tall.
                         
                          DENG
           ... and this ground is richer now and
           they will grow stronger because of it.
                         
          OFF SAM standing here with his ashen face, staring at these people
          in front of him -- his African family.
                         
          INT. MESS HALL - CHILDREN'S ORPHANAGE - DAY
                         
          Days later and we see Sam here with Nineteen and a few other SPLA
          soldiers, eating lunch, trying to learn their language. And it's
          humorous to these guys as Sam tries to pronounce some words in
          Arabic...
                         
          And suddenly we hear YELLING coming from outside.
                         
          EXT. MESS HALL - CHILDREN'S ORPHANAGE - DAY
                         
          Sam coming out fast, sees soldiers pulling open the front gate as
          THREE pickup trucks speed into the compound -- SPLA military trucks -
          - skidding to a stop.
                         
          Sam rushing over as soldiers help two YOUNG BOYS out of one of the
          trucks. Both are around 5 years old, injured and crying. And then a
          third child is lifted out in a makeshift stretcher -- this is ALICE -
          - 10 years old -- her broken body limp and bleeding profusely --
          mumbling something to herself in Arabic over-and-over again --
                         
          INT. INFIRMARY - CHILDREN'S VILLAGE ORPHANAGE - DAY
                         
          -- DOORS BANGING OPEN! -- CONTROLLED CHAOS as the children are
          hauled into this clinic -- Betty taking care of Alice -- the worst
          off -- hooking her up to an IV as Sam moves to her bedside -- the
          little girl still mumbling quietly --
                         
                          SAM
           What is she saying?
                         
                          BETTY
           She is asking what she did wrong?
                         
          Sam taking Alice's hand in his... very slowly her beautiful eyes
          open and she sees him... and says something in Arabic...
                         
                          BETTY (CONT'D)
                          (TRANSLATING)
           She is asking if you are `The Preacher.'
                          60
                         
                          SAM
                          (NODDING)
           Tell her she's gonna be ok.
                         
          Betty translates and Alice smiles faintly... and now one of the
          other camp women comes over and Sam steps back so they can work...
                         
          EXT. INFIRMARY - CHILDREN'S VILLAGE ORPHANAGE - DUSK
                         
          Sam coming out of the infirmary and finding Deng here with a few of
          the SPLA soldiers who brought the children.
                         
                          SAM
           Where did they find em?
                         
                          DENG
           Their village was hit out Adjumani.
                         
          Off Sam, hearing this, we...

          EXT. INFIRMARY - CHILDREN'S VILLAGE ORPHANAGE - DAWN
                         
          And we see Sam and Deng sitting outside the infirmary, exhausted,
          been here all night waiting. And now the door opens and Betty comes
          out. She looks down at them and simply shakes her head...
                         
          And we know Alice is dead.
                         
          And it looks like a grenade has gone off inside Sam. And suddenly he
          grabs an AK and gets up, seething, walks off...
                         
                          DENG

          Sam reaching the SUV and starting to gear up...
                          61
                         
          FADE UP the plaintive wail of an Acholi WAR SONG... haunting...
          ethereal... and then a chorus of voices rising up... taking us to...
                         
          INT. SUV - DRIVING - DEEP IN THE BUSH - DAY
                         
          Bombing down this rutted, red dirt road. The engine at full tilt.
          Sam, Deng, Nineteen, Marco, and A.J. jammed into this truck riding
          in dead silence... AK47's bouncing between their knees... only the
          sound of the WAR SONG playing as we watch these men... a grave
          stillness on their faces... thinking of what men do just before
          their own death.
                         
          EXT. DIRT ROAD - DEEP IN THE BUSH - DAY
                         
          We see two LRA VEHICLES approaching in the distance... a LEAD JEEP
          and a PICKUP TRUCK behind it...
                         
          INT. LRA PICKUP TRUCK - DRIVING - DAY
                         
          Four CHILD SOLDIERS squatting in the flatbed of this truck carrying
          AK47's. We recognize one of the boys as the younger brother from the
          opening scene -- WILLIAM.
                         
          INT. LRA JEEP - DRIVING - DAY
                         
          With two ADULT REBELS in this Jeep as they drive down this road past
          bombed-out vehicles... and in the distance we see the smoldering
          wreckage of a transport truck on the side of the road... the thick
          smoke hanging over the road like a black curtain... blocking out
          vision of the road ahead...
                         
          ... and the Jeep punches into the black smoke followed by the pickup
          truck... and we're lost in the swirling haze for a moment before
          coming out the other side... and this is what we see --
                         
          SAM -- standing in the middle of the road ahead of us shouldering a
          RPG -- the ADULT REBELS see him just as --
                         
          WHOOOOSH! -- an RPG streaks right at us and DETONATES -- KABOOOOM! --
          and the Jeep flips onto it's side --

          - accelerating back into the curtain of smoke -- trying to get the
          fuck out of there when --
                         
          BBrrraaaappp!
                         
          .30 CALIBER MACHINEGUN STRAFE across the front hood --
                         
          EXT. SUV - SAME
                         
          -- and we see A.J. behind the .30 cal -- opening it up --
          BBRAAAAAAPPP! -- BBRAAAAAPPP! -- blasting the engine compartment of
          the truck, trying to disable it --

          EXT. LRA PICKUP TRUCK - DAY
                         
          -- the pickup truck reversing out of the black smoke -- OUT OF
          CONTROL -- going off the road into a ditch -- WILLIAM and the other
          boys bailing out of the flatbed -- TWO ADULT REBELS piling out of
          the cab -- scrambling for cover behind the truck.
                         
          EXT. BUSH - DAY
                         
          Sam, Deng, A.J. and the others hustling through the smoke and
          finding cover. From Sam's vantage point he sees rebels hiding
          behind the disabled truck for cover -- shooting back -- a withering
          firefight -- the big .30 cal ROARING offscreen but the truck is
          protecting the rebels -- no clear shot --
                         
          EXT. LRA TRANSPORT TRUCK - DAY
                         
          William and the other child soldiers here with two ADULT REBELS --
          crouched behind the truck for cover -- the ADULT REBELS returning
          fire, but the children aren't moving, scared shitless.
                         
          William peers around the truck and sees Sam fifty yards away, turns
          to the boys next to him...
                         
                          WILLIAM
                          (ARABIC)
           It's the white preacher!
                         
          The other boys reacting, this means something to them. And now one
          of the ADULT REBEL turns to the children...
                         
                          ADULT REBEL
           STAND UP AND FIGHT!!!
                         
          And he pops up and returns fire, but the boys don't move.
                         
          EXT. BUSH - DAY
                         
          MARCO running through the smoke toward Sam. He hits the ground and
          starts to screw an RPG into his launcher... he wants to hit the
          transport truck, but Sam shakes his head, waves him off...
                         
                          SAM
           No shot! There are children behind the
           truck!
                         
          Marco hears this, ditches the RPG and picks up his AK.
                         
                          SAM (CONT'D)
           Cover me!
                         
          Marco laying down suppression fire as Sam sprints across the road --
          advancing on the transport truck -- firing his AK from the hip --
          bullets zinging past him -- he dives behind a berm and finds himself
          next to Deng. Neither man says a word as they jam fresh mags into
          their AK's, gunfire erupting all around them.

          EXT. LRA TRANSPORT TRUCK - DAY
                         
          The adult rebels continue fighting -- alternately popping up from
          behind the truck and returning fire. The ADULT REBEL realizing that
          William and the other boys still aren't fighting --
                         
                          ADULT REBEL
           Fight you cowards!!!
                         
          But William and the other boys don't move, and the Adult Rebel keeps
          shooting until his mag clicks empty. He looks around and sees an RPG
          LAUNCHER on the ground, picks it up, arms it --
                         
          EXT. BERM - DAY
                         
          Sam and Deng behind the berm. Sam peers over just as GUNFIRE misses
          him by inches. He drops back.
                         
                          DENG
           Why don't you just go home?
                         
                          SAM
           What?
                         
                          DENG
           This is not your war.
                         
                          SAM
           You leavin?
                         
          Deng shakes his head --
                         
                          SAM (CONT'D)
           Well then, I ain't leavin neither...
                         
          Sam chambers a round, pivots around the berm as --
                         
          EXT. LRA TRANSPORT TRUCK - SAME
                         
          -- the Adult Rebel stands up with the RPG -- fires! -- at the same
          instant William shoots him in the head -- he jerks -- WOOOOOSH! --
          the missile launching at a bad angle as --
                         
          SAM COMES OUT FROM BEHIND THE BERM
                         
          RPG streaking directly at him -- hitting the ground short --
                         
          BA-WHOOOM! --
                         
          AND OUR VISION EXPLODES TO WHITE
                         
          For a long beat... only silence... and then slowly the white begins
          to fade... and we see Sam flat on his back... eyes blinking open...
          shell-shocked... staring up at blue sky... and then a shadow coming
          over him... someone stepping into his POV...
                          64
                         
          it's William, hands held open in surrender, staring curiously at
          this strange white man laying in the dirt... and now Deng and Marco
          appear next to Sam and help him to his feet.
                         
          And we see the battle is over. The remaining child soldiers slowly
          emerging from behind the LRA truck... laying down their weapons and
          walking toward Sam... joining William... staring at this white man
          in front of them...
                         
          ... William reaches into his pocket and...
                         
          ... Deng and Marco REACT -- lifting their AK's -- "Don't move! Don't
          move!" -- but the boy only pulls out a FADED PHOTOGRAPH... the one
          he grabbed just before his capture... a picture of him and his older
          brother... standing next to each other smiling.
                         
                          WILLIAM

          80 children laying on the floor on reed mats, getting ready for
          sleep. And we find William in mid-conversation with a young boy
          named Anthony.

           Were you with the rebels?
                         
          Anthony nods. William pulls out his photograph.
                         
                          WILLIAM (CONT'D)
           Did you know my brother? He was called
           Christopher.
                         
          Anthony studying the photograph...
                         
                          WILLIAM (CONT'D)
           He has a funny left eye. It looks the
           other way sometimes. Do you remember him?
                         
                          ANTHONY
           No.
                         
          William folding up the photograph, getting up, moving to another
          little boy a few feet away... kneeling next to him... and so he
          continues...
                         
                          WILLIAM
           I am William. Were you with the rebels?
                          65
                         
          EXT. GENERATOR HUT - CHILDREN'S ORPHANAGE - NIGHT
                         
          A soldier cuts off the generator and the compound goes black.
                         
          INT. TUKUL - NIGHT
                         
          And we see Sam on his cot when the light goes out. He leans over and
          torches a small Kerosene lamp next to him.
                         
          INT. DORM - NIGHT
                         
          The children on their mats in the dark now... quiet... a few of the
          younger ones whimpering, starting to cry... the darkness becoming
          too much... reminding them of past horrors... and then we hear a
          FAINT VOICE in this dark room... singing quietly... an ancient
          African lullaby... and then other little voices joining in...
          singing this song they all know... a song their mother's once sang
          to them...
                         
          INT. SAM'S TUKUL - CHILDREN'S ORPHANAGE - NIGHT
                         
          ... Sam hearing the soft chorus drift across the compound... somehow
          finding comfort in it too... blowing out the lamp and laying here in
          the dark... listening to the children sing.
                         
          EXT. CHILDREN'S ORPHANAGE - EARLY MORNING
                         
          A SLOW DISSOLVE... life springing up in the camp... daylight
          breaking... a routine seen here... Betty, Rose and the other camp
          women arriving at the orphanage... cooking fires being lit...
          soldiers drinking cups of strong coffee, warming themselves after a
          long night...
                         
          ... and Sam coming out of his tukul carrying his duffle bag...
          discovering William curled up next to his door, sleeping on a mat in
          the dirt... been there all night. William stirring awake, seeing Sam
          above him and scrambling to his feet.
                         
                          SAM
           Mornin, buddy.
                         
          William, no response. Just staring up at him.
                         
                          SAM (CONT'D)
           Ain't you gonna say nuthin?
                         
          William, nothing.
                         
                          SAM (CONT'D)
           Ok then.
                         
          And Sam walks across the compound followed by William a few paces
          behind... and he reaches Deng, Betty, Nineteen, and a few of the
          other volunteers waiting by the truck...
                          66
                         
                          DENG
                          (MEANING WILLIAM)
           Looks like you've got yourself a
           bodyguard.
                         
                          SAM
           Guess I do.
                         
          Sam tosses his bag into the back, says goodbye to everyone...
                         
                          SAM (CONT'D)
           Take care of things while I'm gone, ok?
                         
                          DENG
           I will, Preacher.
                         
          They shake hands and Sam gets into the truck... and we see William
          already here, sitting in the backseat.
                         
                          SAM
           You can't come with me, buddy.
                         
                          DENG
           (to William, Arabic)
           Get out of there.
                         
          But William isn't moving...
                         
                          DENG (CONT'D)
                          (ARABIC)
           Come on! -- out! --
                         
          ... and finally Deng reaches in and grabs him... tries to pull him
          out but he fights back... yelling as Deng drags him out of the
          truck...
                         
          INT. TRUCK - DRIVING - DAY
                         
          Sam turning around in his seat as we pull away from the compound...
          and he sees William still struggling in Deng's arms... and finally
          he breaks free and SPRINTS for the truck as it drives off... fast as
          he can... chasing Sam until he no longer can.
                         
                          CUT TO:

          And we see two teens moving toward the sound of a crowd coming from
          inside the church, responsive, "Hallelujah!"... and then Sam's voice
          over it all...
                         
           SAM (O.S.)

          Sam at the pulpit in mid-sermon. There is an air of Fire and
          Brimstone to what we're watching here... electric... the
          congregation listening in rapt attention...
                         
                          SAM
           ... he's not interested in your good
           thoughts... your good intentions... he
           wants your hands... your backs... your
           sweat... your blood to pour into the
           foundation that will build up his
           kingdom!
                         
          Ad-libbed SHOUTS and PRAISE... and now we see Lynn, Daisy, Donnie

          Lynn and Sam walking through the facility, and we see this place is
          alive with activity. More than just a church, this is a community
          center. Lynn opening a door and we see a Volunteer here with a dozen
          little children running around this playroom...
                         
                          LYNN
           We started daycare last month. Monday

           Sue.
                         
          Lynn pulling the door closed and they continue... moving down a set
          of stairs to the basement where we see children and parents... some
          of them playing ping-pong and air hockey... others in a corner
          rehearsing for a Christmas play...
                         
                          SAM (CONT'D)
           Been thinkin we need to put up a
           playground. Swings. Some things the kids
           can climb on.
                         
                          LYNN
           We can't build anymore. Not for awhile.
                         
                          SAM
           You said Sundays has been full.
                         
                          LYNN

           Economy is in trouble, construction
           business is slow. Times is tight.
                         
                          SAM
           Be good for them kids, Lynn.
                         
                          LYNN
           They got the playground over in
           Cairnbrook. And they can play at the
           school on weekends if they want
                         
          Sam turning to her --
                         
                          SAM
           Not talking bout here. Talkin about the
           orphange.
                         
          Lynn catching up to him now, realizing his head is still back in
          Africa.

          Donnie moving next to him, working on the bike...
                         
                          DONNIE (CONT'D)
           ... never had these problems when we was
           runnin solid lifters, huh?
                         
                          SAM
           Used to fix them old shovelheads on the
           side of the road with a buckknife and a
           wire hanger.
                         
                          DONNIE
           Remember that year we went to the
           Freakers Ball?
                         
          Sam smiling...
                         
                          SAM
           I think that old `78 broke down five
           times on that trip.
                          69
                         
                          DONNIE
           Sounds about right. Shoot, we had more
           fun tryin to get there than when we
           finally did.
                         
          Sam and Donnie share a laugh.
                         
                          DONNIE (CONT'D)
           Can I talk to you about somethin?
                         
                          SAM
           Yep.
                         
                          DONNIE
           I'm glad I'm walkin with the Lord and
           all, but sometimes I ain't sure I'm gonna
           be able to do what he wants me to do.
                         
                          SAM
           The Lord don't ask for nuthin you can't
           deliver, buddy. And yer one tough ole
           boy.
                         
                          DONNIE
           Sometimes I ain't so sure how tough I am.
                         
          And we see in Donnie's eyes just how troubled he is.
                         
                          SAM
           Why don't we pray together then...
                         
          And they both take a knee, bowing their heads as Sam continues...
                         
                          SAM (CONT'D)
           Our gracious Heavenly Father, bless us
           with the strength to carry on in your
           name. And grant us, in our darkest hours,
           the understandin that you are always by
           our side.
                         
          And we leave these two men, their heads bowed in quiet supplication,
          next to this Harley, praying for strength.
                         
          INT. SHOWROOM - CAR DEALERSHIP - JOHNSTOWN, PENN. - DAY (JULY/2004)
                         
          Four or five gleaming sedans on this showroom floor. And we see Sam
          sitting across from BILL WALLACE, late 40's, gold Rolex.
                         
                          BILL

                          SAM
           Still got a ways to go, but we're gettin
           there. You should come on by one of these
           Sundays, bring the family.
                         
                          BILL
           That's nice of you, but we're at Calvary
           now. Bit more our speed over there I
           think.
                         
          Sam, getting down to business...
                         
                          SAM
           Reverand Carlton gives a mean sermon,
           puts me to shame. Anyway Bill, I'm here
           cause I wanna talk to you about what
           we're doin over there in Africa.

           Course I know about what you're doin.
           Helluva thing helpin out those kids, Sam.
                         
                          SAM
           Thank you, but I'm gonna be straight with
           ya. We're hurtin for money... If we had a
           little bit more support from people like
           yourself sure would help things run a lot
           smoother over there.
                         
          Bill feeling the rub, shaking his head...
                         
                          BILL
           Sam, look, everybody is feelin the pinch
           around here.
                         
                          SAM
           I hear that, but you gotta understand
           that them kids over there got nuthin. I
           mean nuthin, Bill, and I'm not asking for
           much.
                         
                          BILL
           How much you lookin for?
                         
                          SAM
           Five thousand dollars.
                         
                          BILL
           Jesus Christ, Sam! Five thousand dollars?
                         
                          SAM
           That keeps them doors open for another
           six months.
                          71
                         
                          BILL
           People are losin their jobs left and
           right round here. Tough to be askin for
           five thousand dollars for a buncha
           African children half-way around the
           world.
                         
          Sam shifting, not giving up, coming at him another way...
                         
                          SAM
           You're right. We got problems right here.
           But with that kinda money we could feed
           them kids, house them kids.
                         
          Bill staring at him, saying nothing, on the spot. Sam hoping that
          somehow he's reached this man. And finally Bill stands up...
                         
                          BILL
           Alright, tell you what, lemme see what I
           can do.
                         
          Sam feeling this victory, flashing a smile, shaking Bill's hand.
                         
                          SAM
           Ok.
                         
                          BILL
           Why don't you and the family come over to
           the house next Sunday. We're havin a
           little barbeque, ok?
                         
                          SAM
           Sounds good.
                         
          INT. SUBURBAN HOUSE - DAY
                         
          Upscale French provincial in suburban Johnstown. A "barbeque" is
          underway. 15 couples here with their kids and a handful of waiters
          in white-tie offering champagne and hors d'oeuvres to the guests.
                         
          DOOR BELL RINGING -- and we see a perky woman in her late 40's
          coming through the crowd, blonde hair from a bottle, accessorized to
          the hilt, holding a glass of white wine. SHANNON WALLACE. She opens
          the door to find Sam, Lynn, and Paige standing in the doorway.
                         
                          SHANNON
           Well, come on in...
                         
          And they enter... Lynn smiling awkwardly, dressed in the same yellow
          dress we saw her in previously... her only dress... and Sam looking
          around this enormous room...
                         
                          SHANNON (CONT'D)
           Ya'll must be the Childers. Welcome. I'm
           Shannon, Bill's ball-n-chain.
                          72
                         
          Smiling, a joke she loves...
                         
                          LYNN
           I'm Lynn, this here is Sam, our daughter
           Paige.
                         
                          SHANNON
           Good to meet you.
                         
           VOICE (O.S.)
           There he is!
                         
          Everybody turning to see the car dealer coming through the crowd,
          smiling, a little drunk. AD-LIBBED introductions and then...
                         
                          BILL
           Glad ya'll could make it. Get on in here
           and meet some people...
                         
          Bill ushering them deeper into the house... quick intros to a few
          guests as they pass... Sam, Lynn, and Paige taking it all in...
          starting to sense the dimensions of this massive house... the
          waiters in their pressed jackets offering them food... the
          extravagance... like nothing they've ever seen...
                         
          ... Bill pulling Sam off from the crowd so it's just the two of
          them... taking an envelope from his jacket and handing it to him...
                         
                          BILL (CONT'D)
           This is a little somethin for the kids,
           ok? What we were talking about.
                         
                          SAM
           Thank you, Bill.
                         
                          BILL
           Forget it. Now c'mon, can I get ya a
           mojito or somethin?
                         
          INT. BATHROOM - SUBURBAN HOUSE - DAY
                         
          Sam coming into this bathroom and locking the door... taking the
          envelope out of his pocket and tearing it open... pulling out a
          personal check -- CLOSE UP to see it's in the amount of $150
                         
          HOLD ON Sam face, and it's disgust we see in his eyes.
                         
          EXT. SUBURBAN HOUSE - DAY
                         
          Front door opening fast and Lynn and Paige coming out, followed by
          Sam, pushing them along...
                         
                          LYNN
           Sam...
                          73
                         
                          PAIGE
           Why we leavin so soon?
                         
          Shannon appearing in the doorway in the b.g., calling after...
                         
                          SHANNON
           Everything alright?...
                         
          Lynn turning to respond, but Sam keeps her moving forward, down the
          driveway, past the line of parked BMW's and Mercedes to their truck
          at the curb...
                         
                          SAM
           Get in the car.
                         
                          LYNN
           What's wrong?
                         
          As they load into the truck...
                         
                          SAM
           Sonuvabitch is cryin pour-mouth to me and
           he's livin in the damn Taj Mahal...
                         
                          LYNN
           Sam...
                         
                          SAM
           I asked him for five-thousand dollars to
           feed a buncha motherless babies and you
           know what he gave me?
           (taking out the check,
           wadding it up)
           Hundred and fifty bucks. That's it.
           Handed it to me like it was gold
           bouillon! Sonuvabitch spent more than
           that on salsa for his party.
                         
          INT. CHILDERS HOUSE - DAY
                         
          -- Sam coming into the house, enraged, followed by Lynn. He moves to
          his gun cabinet, grabs a hidden key, unlocks it...
                         
                          LYNN
           What are you doin?
                         
                          SAM
           I've had it with these people and all
           their bullshit about wantin to help...
                         
          And he starts pulling out weapons... shotguns and assault rifles...
          stuffing them into an oversize gun bag...
                         
                          LYNN
           Sam Childers...
                          74
                         
          Lynn reaching for him and he grabs her wrist... tightly... staring
          at her with dark eyes. A flash of the "old" Sam Childers here when
          he says...
                         
                          SAM
           Stay outta my way.
                         
          And for the first time in years this woman is scared. He lets go of
          her wrist and continues to fill the bag -- and we go --
                         
          EXT. PAWN SHOP - JOHNSTOWN, PENNSYLVANIA - DAY
                         
          Sam coming out followed by the Shop Owner...
                         
                          SHOP OWNER
           ... I'm sorry, twenty-five hundred is the
           best I can do for them gun.
                         
          REVERSE to see Lynn's car parked at the curb, Sam pointing to it...
                         
                          SAM
           Throw in the car for five.
                         
          The Shop Owner considering, as we go...
                         
          EXT. ROAD - PENNSYLVANIA - DAY
                         
          Windy, pissing rain. And we see Sam walking up this rural road,
          hands in his pockets, head down... the only human for miles...
          trudging through this shitstorm completely alone.
                         
                          CUT TO:
                         
          EXT. CHILDREN'S ORPHANAGE - DAY
                         
          And we see Sam with a group of men working in the sweltering heat...
          laying brick... adding another room to the children's dorm...
                         
          ... and he squints into the distance, sees a cloud of dust on the
          horizon, cars coming closer.
                         
          EXT. MAIN GATE - CHILDREN'S ORPHANAGE - DAY
                         
          Seven or eight heavily armed vehicles coming through the gate. Maybe
          20 or 30 SPLA soldiers guarding a black SUBURBAN in the middle of
          this motorcade. Nineteen waving his hand, yelling as the cars pass --
                         
                          NINETEEN
                          (ARABIC)
           It's Garang! -- It's Garang! --
                         
          Palpable excitement ripples through the compound... Sam's soldiers
          grabbing their weapons and forming a ragged line near the Suburban
          as it stops...
                          75
                         
          ... the back door to the Suburban opens and a black man, dressed in
          shirtsleeves and slacks, steps out. The same man we saw giving the
          fiery speech on the little outdoor TV in Nimule earlier -- JOHN
          GARANG.
                         
          Sam turns to Deng --
                         
                          SAM
           Who's this guy?
                         
                          DENG
           That's our leader.
                         
                          SAM
           John Garang?
                         
          Deng nods as we go...
                         
          EXT. COMPOUND - CHILDREN'S VILLAGE ORPHANGE - DAY
                         
          Sam and Garang walking through the middle of camp, trailed by a
          squad of SPLA bodyguards and camp children...
                         
                          GARANG
           They call you Preacher. Is this what I
           should call you?
                         
                          SAM
           Sam is fine.
                         
                          GARANG
           I hear what you have done for the SPLA
           and I am grateful.
                         
                          SAM
           We can thank God for his blessins.
                         
                          GARANG
           Yes, we can. How many children do you
           look after, Sam?
                         
                          SAM
           Couple hundred with us here. Feed another
           thousand a day from nearby villages.
           Anyone who shows up hungry gets a meal.
                         
          And they continue through the camp. A few of the children running up
          to Garang, touching the cuff of his shirt, then sprinting away...
                         
                          GARANG
           What you are doing is noble, but too
           dangerous. I must advise you to stop
           risking your life in our struggle.
                          76
                         
                          SAM
           Until someone starts fightin for these
           children, I'm the one that's gonna do it.
                         
                          GARANG
           You are stubborn, aren't you?
                         
                          SAM
           As a mule.
                         
          Garang smiling, an instant affinity for this man.
                         
                          GARANG
           You and I come from very different
           worlds, but we are not so dissimilar.
                         
          And another child runs up to Garang, touching him, and then sprints
          away giggling...
                         
                          GARANG (CONT'D)
           I founded the SPLA in order to fight for
           the future of Sudan because nobody else
           would. We fight for freedom from the
           government in Khartoum, for the right to
           vote, and for the right to worship any
           god one may choose.
                         
          More children running up... Garang touching their heads...
                         
                          GARANG (CONT'D)
           But most important to me is our struggle
           for the children. Their laughter has been
           lost to this country for far too long.
                          (BEAT)
           There are Peace Talks scheduled for the
           end of August in Naivashu. I'd like you
           to come as my guest.
                         
                          SAM
           Talkin bout peace in a room somewhere is
           a waste of time. You gotta go out and
           make it.
                         
                          GARANG
           You are correct, but we must fight them
           at every level. Part of my battle is
           waged in those rooms. We must talk of
           peace, but keep our rifles ready for war.
                         
          Sam turning to him, coming to an understanding here. Realizing that
          both of them are warriors in the same fight.
                         
                          GARANG (CONT'D)
           Maybe together you and I can make Sudan
           free once again.
                          77
                         
          And now we see they have arrived at the brick chapel in the middle
          of the compound. Garang turning to him, eyes suddenly becoming
          dark...
                         
                          GARANG (CONT'D)
           There is a cost for freedom, Sam. A price
           for the future of these people. Some pay
           with their lives, others pay in different
           ways.
                          (BEAT)
           My only hope is that your cost is not too
           great.
                         
          AND SUDDENLY WE'RE SOMEPLACE FAR AWAY... ANOTHER WORLD... THE
          SILHOUETTES OF ANIMALS DANCING ON A DARK CEILING... PROJECTED FROM A
          CHILD'S NIGHTLIGHT... WE ARE...
                         
          INT. PAIGE'S ROOM - CHILDERS HOUSE - NIGHT
                         
          Donnie tucking Paige into bed, making it up as he goes, clearly out
          of his depth here but wanting to do it right.
                         
                          DONNIE
           You say prayers or somethin?
                         
                          PAIGE
           Already did.
                         
                          DONNIE
           Ok then, sweet dreams.
                         
                          PAIGE
           Ain't you gonna read me a book?
                         
                          DONNIE
           Ahh, Paige, you know I don't read so
           good.
                         
                          PAIGE
           Then let's play a game.
                         
                          DONNIE
           Ok.
                         
                          PAIGE
           I'm thinkin of a dog.
                         
                          DONNIE
           What about it?
                         
                          PAIGE
           Never mind, Donnie.
                         
                          DONNIE
           Ok.
                          78
                         
                          PAIGE
           Dad usually kisses me on the forehead
           before he leaves. You can do that.
                         
                          DONNIE
           Sure I can.
                         
          And Donnie does just that, bends down and kisses Paige on the
          head...
                         
                          DONNIE (CONT'D)
           Sweet dreams.
                         
          And now we see Lynn in the hallway having just witnessed this
          through the cracked door, keenly feeling Sam absence in this moment.
                         
          EXT. CHILDREN'S ORPHANAGE - DAY
                         
          And we see Sam, Betty and Rose leading a group of children, their
          hands covering their eyes so they can't see, into a clearing behind
          one of the dorms.
                         
                          SAM
           Keep em closed! A little bit more!
                         
                          BETTY
                          (ARABIC)
           Keep your eyes closed.
                         
                          ROSE
           (stern, Arabic)
           Michael! Cover your eyes! No peeking!
                         
                          SAM
           ... keep comin'...
                         
          The children inching forward, following his voice, until...
                         
                          SAM (CONT'D)
           Ok, stop! Open your eyes!
                         
                          BETTY
                          (ARABIC)
           Open your eyes!
                         
          And we see a hundred little eyes popping open, staring at something
          off screen, confused for a split second at what they're looking at.
                         
          REVERSE to see a PLAYGROUND: two or three battered swingsets, a few
          see-saws, and a jungle gym soldered out of metal pipe.
                         
          And the kids SPRINTING for it, climbing all over the jungle gym like
          ants... hitting the swing-sets... and then we hear it... something
          we realize we haven't heard in this place before... the sound of
          laughter... children losing themselves in play. Innocence flooding
          back.
                          79
                         
          And now we see Nineteen, A.J. and two other SPLA soldiers standing
          around a BUNNY BOUNCER... staring at it quizzically... talking in
          Arabic, trying to decide what this thing is... and then A.J., the
          bravest, slings his AK onto his back and carefully straddles the
          bouncer... pulling up his long legs and resting his feet on the
          pegs...
                         
          And he begins to bob back and forth... holding onto the bunny's ears
          with his big hands... the other soldiers starting to laugh as he
          bobs faster... and then we see A.J's smile... a million watt smile
          on this guy... the first time he's played like this since he was a
          boy.
                         
          EXT. DORM - CHILDREN'S ORPHANAGE - DAY - LATER
                         
          Hours later and we see Sam pushing a couple of the smaller children
          on the swingset. Deng approaches...
                         
                          DENG
           Some of the child soldiers say there is a
           bounty on your life. That Kony is
           offering money for your nose and ears.
                         
          Sam, no reaction, just keeps swinging the children...
                         
                          DENG (CONT'D)
           I'd like to assign a few more men to you
           during the day.
                         
                          SAM
           He ain't the first old-boy who wanted to
           see my head hanging on his wall. Keep yer
           soldiers where they're needed. I can take
           care of myself.
                         
          Deng clearly worried for his friend, but doesn't press the issue.
          And now Sam notices William off from the group, sitting on the
          ground by himself, not playing.
                         
                          SAM (CONT'D)
           He said anything yet?
                         
                          DENG
           All we know is that his family was killed
           and that he and his brother were taken
           into the LRA.
                         
                          SAM
           Where's the brother?
                         
                          DENG
           Nobody knows.
                         
                         NEW ANGLE
                         
          Sam approaching William, kneeling down next to him.
                          80
                         
                          SAM
           Hey buddy, you don't wanna play with the
           other kids?
                         
          William, no response.
                         
                          SAM (CONT'D)
           You know sometimes it helps to tell
           somebody what you got locked up inside,
           know what I mean?
                         
          William, no reaction whatsoever. Something dawning on Sam in this
          moment...
                         
                          SAM (CONT'D)
           You have no idea what I'm sayin, do you?
                         
          William just stares back at him and Sam realizes he doesn't speak
          English. And they both just sit here for a moment, silent, staring
          at the children playing on the playground. And then Sam, feeling the
          need to unburden himself, begins to talk...
                         
                          SAM (CONT'D)
           I done a lotta things I ain't proud of.
           Hurt a lotta people. Truth is, helpin you
           kids is about the only good thing I ever
           done in this life.
                         
          William watching him quietly.
                         
                          SAM (CONT'D)
           But I'm scared. Scared one day I'll close
           my eyes to all this and make it somebody
           else's problem.
                          (BEAT)
           Just like everybody else in this world.
                         
          And he stops and it's silent between them again. William just
          sitting there quietly. And Sam looks up to the sky... feeling his
          life washing over him... his burden... this fear.
                         
          INT. SUV - DRIVING - DAY
                         
          Sam behind the wheel, driving alone the edge of a dry ravine. Deng
          is in the passenger seat and we see Nineteen, Marco and A.J. crammed
          into the back.
                         
                          SAM
           I don't see nuthin.
                         
          Deng checking a handheld GPS unit --
                         
                          DENG
           This is it.
                          81
                         
          Sam looking out the window, sees movement at the bottom of the
          ravine.
                         
                          SAM
           Hold on...
                         
          ... and we see what he sees -- CHILDREN hiding behind a bush.
                         
                          SAM (CONT'D)
           I got em.
                         
          EXT. RAVINE - DAY
                         
          And we see the SUV picking it's way down the rocky slope... reaching
          the dry riverbed below and moving closer to the children...
                         
          EXT. SUV - DAY
                         
          ... and the terrain becomes inaccessible and the SUV stops. Unable
          to go any further. Sam and the others getting out of the truck and
          we see two children hiding behind a bush 50 yards away. Sam
          WHISTLING to the kids, but they draw back. Too scared to move.
                         
                          SAM
           Deng, tell camp we're comin back with
           two. A.J., Nineteen -- go get them kids.
                         
          A.J. and Nineteen move off as Sam pops the rear hatch on the SUV and
          pulls out a MEDICAL BAG.
                         
          EXT. RIVERBED - DAY
                         
          A.J. and Nineteen moving over rocks toward the children, calling out
          to them in Arabic -- "Come out, we won't hurt you." -- but they
          don't move...
                         
          ... and finally they reach the kids and we see it's two boys (6
          years old), kneeling in the dirt, terrified...
                         
           A.J.
                          (ARABIC)
           Don't be scared.
                         
          He smiles, reaches for one of the boys -- and --
                         
          -- A SHOT RINGS OUT!
                         
          -- A BULLET hits A.J. in the neck, killing him instantly.
                         
          Nineteen dives behind a boulder for cover.
                         
          EXT. SUV - DAY
                         
          Sam, Deng, and Marco scramble behind the SUV. A moment before we
          hear Nineteen YELLING offscreen.
                          82
                         
                          SAM
           What's he sayin?
                         
                          DENG
           A.J. is dead.
                         
                          SAM
           Shit.
                          (BEAT)
           Tell him to stay where he is. Don't move.
                         
                          DENG
           (yelling to Nineteen, Arabic)
           Don't move!
                         
                          SAM
           Ask him if he saw the shooter.
                         
                          DENG
           (yelling to Nineteen, Arabic)
           Did you see him?!
                         
          Nineteen responds.
                         
                          DENG (CONT'D)
           He did not see.
                         
          SNIPER POV -- and we see A.J.'s lifeless body lying by the
          children... and the SUV... and then part of Sam's head peering from
          behind the truck --
                         
          EXT. SUV - DAY
                         
          Sam looking through binocs as --
                         
          -- A SHOT RINGS OUT! -- hitting the windshield right next to his
          head, and he drops behind the truck.
                         
                          SAM
           You got `em?
                         
                          DENG
           Yes. He's on the ridge... just below that
           outcropping.
                         
                          SAM
           Can you reach the Browning?
                         
          Deng opening the rear door and reaching inside the truck... pulling
          out a long barrel HUNTING RIFLE as...
                         
          -- A SHOT RINGS OUT!
                         
          The bullet hitting the SUV, narrowly missing Deng. He slides the
          HUNTING RIFLE to Sam.
                          83
                         
                          SAM (CONT'D)
           Need you boys to cover me on three,
           alright? Put everything you got into that
           rock up there.
                         
          SNIPER POV -- locked on the SUV when suddenly -- Deng and Marco
          pivot around the truck and start firing -- bullets popping all
          around and the sniper drops for cover as --
                         
          EXT. SUV - DAY
                         
          -- Sam SPRINTS over the rocks and dives into a shallow ditch out of
          sight. Deng and Marco stop firing and drop back behind the SUV.
                         
          SNIPER POV -- slowly pops up from behind the rocks after the
          shooting stops. And we realize he didn't see Sam change positions.
                         
          EXT. DITCH - DAY
                         
          Sam rolling onto his stomach and slowly sliding the barrel of the
          rifle between two rocks... then seeing a sliver of the SNIPER hidden
          on the ridge.
                         
          SNIPER POV -- still locked on the SUV, waiting for a clear shot.
                         
          EXT. DITCH - DAY
                         
          Sam putting a bead on the Sniper, but at this range the shot is
          going to take instinct. Sam turns his head away from the rifle and
          exhales -- controls his breathing -- as we go --
                         
          SNIPER POV -- trained on the SUV... and then we see a FLASH from the
          right side of the screen... and a delayed POP!...
                         
          CRACKKK! -- THE SNIPER DROPS
                         
          Killed instantly.
                         
          EXT. SUV - DAY
                         
          Deng looking through binocs at the ridge --
                         
                          DENG
           (calling out to Sam)
           I think you got him!
                         
          EXT. RIVERBED - DAY
                         
          Sam, Deng, and Marco moving toward the children, weapons drawn,
          scanning the area in all directions. Deng is the first one to reach
          the boys who are huddled on the ground, shaking from fear...
                         
                          DENG
                          (ARABIC)
           It is ok. You can get up now.
                          84
                         
          But the boys don't move... and Deng reaches down, pulls them to
          their feet and we see that their ankles are chained to a post which
          has been buried in the ground.
                         
                          DENG (CONT'D)
           Sam.
                         
          Sam joins Deng, sees the chains.
                         
                          DENG (CONT'D)
           LRA wanted us here.
                         
          Sam realizing that these children were used as bait -- for him.
                         
          EXT. RAVINE RIDGE - DAY
                         
          We're at the top of the ravine now and we see Sam and the others
          moving toward the location of the SNIPER...
                         
          ... and Sam is the first to reach the body... laying on the ground
          face down... a pool of blood soaking the dirt underneath... and he
          rolls the body onto it's back and we see it's just a kid -- no older
          than 15 years old.
                         
          INT. SAM'S TUKUL - CHILDREN'S ORPHANAGE - NIGHT
                         
          It's late at night and we see Sam on his cot, sitting here in the
          dark. And we hear the sound of his satellite phone vibrating on the
          table next to him. He picks it up, sees DONNIE'S name on the
          screen...
                         
                          SAM
                          (INTO PHONE)
           Hello?
                         
          INT. UNKNOWN LOCATION - PENNSYLVANIA - DAY
                         
          And we see Donnie on a couch by himself in this shitty little room.
                         
                          DONNIE
           Sam, it's me.
                         
          INTERCUT THE CONVERSATION:
                         
                          SAM
           Everybody ok?
                         
                          DONNIE
           Oh yeah, everybody's just fine. I was
           just callin to say `hey' is all.
                         
                          SAM
           How're the girls?
                          85
                         
                          DONNIE
           They're good. Paige cooked us all dinner
           the other night. Chocolate-chip pancakes.
                         
                          SAM
           By herself, huh?
                         
                          DONNIE
           Yep. I helped her with the stove is all.
           She did everything else. Pretty good too.
                         
          And now we see Donnie's DOPE WORKS sitting on the table in front of
          him. He's using again.
                         
                          DONNIE (CONT'D)
           How's it goin over there?
                         
                          SAM
           Goin fine.
                         
                          DONNIE
           Hey, maybe I'll come with you one of
           these trips. I'd like to get outta here
           for a spell. See what it's like.
                         
                          SAM
           Sounds good.
                         
          And it's silent between them... both of these men lost in their own
          worries for a moment... and then...
                         
                          DONNIE
           Ask you a question?
                         
                          SAM'S VOICE
           Yeah.
                         
                          DONNIE'S VOICE
           You think God will forgive us for the
           things we've done?
                         
          And we're watching Sam, this question hitting him like a freight
          train. Unable to answer.
                         
          EXT. NIMULE - SUDAN, AFRICA - DAY - DAYS LATER
                         
          We're hit by a crush of people, a thousand black faces moving past
          us and all the noise and confusion of this busy border town. And we
          find Sam, Deng, and Nineteen here loading supplies into the back of
          the SUV.
                         
           VOICE (O.S.)
           They talk about you...
                         
          Sam turning to find Agnete, the aid worker, approaching him.
                          86
                         
                          AGNETE
           In the camps. The children. They say
           there is a white preacher who hunts the
           LRA. This place does not need more
           killing, Mr. Childers.
                         
                          SAM
           I'm just tryin to help these people. Same
           as you.
                         
                          AGNETE
           War upon war does not fix what is broken
           here. The history of this country is
           filled with righteous killers. That is
           how it always begins, with men thinking
           they are killing for the right reasons.
                         
                          SAM
           I got a 200 kids who are gonna sleep safe
           tonight and wake up tomorrow mornin to a
           bowl of hot food. Right or not, that's
           all the reason I need.
                         
                          AGNETE
           And what about the rumors I have heard
           about you supplying weapons to the SPLA?
                         
          Sam turning to her, face-to-face, starting to get pissed...
                         
                          SAM
           You fight the evil in this place your
           way, I'll fight it mine.
                         
                          AGNETE
           Do not delude yourself, Mr. Childers.
           You're a mercenary, not a humanitarian.
                         
          Sam, finished with this conversation, slams the lift-gate closed on
          the truck and starts to climb in...
                         
                          AGNETE (CONT'D)
           They say you are doing good. That you
           have special powers. That you are
           protected by angels and cannot be killed
           by bullets.
                         
          Sam looking at her and there's a warning in what she says next...
          about violence corrupting men... consuming them...
                         
                          AGNETE (CONT'D)
           They said the same thing about Kony in
           the beginning.
                          87
                         
          EXT. SAM'S TUKUL - CHILDREN'S ORPHANAGE - DUSK
                         
          Sam sitting outside his tukul alone, tearing open an airmail package
          and pulling out another VIDEOCASSETTE, slides it into his
          videocamera, hits play --
                         
          ON THE SMALL SCREEN we see a school production... children dressed
          in costumes shuffling across the stage... lines being spoken by
          rote...and then the awkward entrance of Paige speaking her lines...
          but instead of finding joy in this sweet moment he finds
          heartache... the distance from his family... from their innocence...
          simply too great to bear in this moment...
                         
          ... and then he hears giggling... and he realizes two young orphan
          BOYS have snuck up behind him and are looking at the screen over his
          shoulder... and Sam holds it up so they can see better and now more
          children gather around -- maybe 10 or 15 kids -- pointing at the
          small screen... giggling and chatting in Arabic...
                         
                          ORPHAN #1
                          (ARABIC)
           Look at their shoes...
                         
                          ORPHAN #2
                          (ARABIC)
           They look silly...
                         
                          ORPHAN #1
                          (ARABIC)
           This is how Americans dance?
                         
                          ORPHAN #2
                          (ARABIC)
           Their dancing is terrible!
                         
          The children laughing hysterically... and for an instant Sam is
          swept out of his melancholy by their sweet enjoyment...
                         
          ... and then Sam sees Deng and Nineteen approaching quickly...
                         
                          SAM
           What's goin on?
                         
                          DENG
           An LRA convoy has moved north over the
           border. They're heading for Ed Duim.
                         
                          SAM
           That's where they sell em on the black
           market, ain't it?
                         
          EXT. DIRT ROAD - DEEP IN SUDAN - NIGHT
                         
          A moonless night... and we see headlights piercing this blackness...
          bouncing down a singletrack road... we are...
                          88
                         
          INT. SAM'S TRUCK - DRIVING - NIGHT
                         
          Deng behind the wheel driving -- Sam in the passenger seat -- Marco,
          Nineteen, and a third SPLA SOLDIER jammed in the back --
                         
                          DENG
           Look...
                         
          Far ahead we see three sets of HEADLIGHTS coming towards us on the
          road -- just bouncing white dots on the horizon -- and silently
          they begin to check their mags and weapons -- preparing for battle --
                         
          -- and the headlights get closer -- Deng not slowing down -- and we
          realize we are on a collision course with this convoy -- and finally
          we see MUZZLE FLASHES in the distance -- and --
                         
          THUNK!, THUNK!, THUNK!
                         
          Machine gun strafe hitting the front and side of the truck --
                         
                          SAM
           Let's go!
                         
          Sam and Nineteen leaning through the open windows as Deng drives --
          leveling their AK's and firing --
                         
          KRAKAKAKAKAK! KRAKAKAKAKAK!
                         
          And now the approaching convoy LIGHTS UP with RETURN FIRE! -- Sam
          and Nineteen hanging out the windows blasting back -- Deng stepping
          on the gas, accelerating toward the convoy like some hellish game of
          "chicken"(reminiscent of Sam and Donnie's wild ride with the Drifter
          in scene #29) --
                         
          -- and we watch as the headlights barrel towards us at full bore --
          BULLETS POPPING across the windshield of the truck -- SAM AND
          NINETEEN IN CONSTANT FIRE MODE -- THE SOUND DEAFENING -- headlights
          blown out on both trucks and now we're plunged into total blackness -
          - only the wild-strobe of machine gun fire lighting up the night as
          these trucks slam towards each other -- and finally --
                         
          THE LRA CONVOY CAREENS OFF THE ROAD AND BOTTOMS OUT IN A DITCH
                         
          Deng skidding to a stop as Sam, Nineteen, and the third SPLA SOLDIER
          pile out of the truck -- firing and advancing on the caravan by
          foot.
                         
          EXT. DITCH - SIDE OF DIRT ROAD - NIGHT
                         
          Rebels jumping out of their disabled trucks -- Sam and his men
          flanking them -- blasting one of the trucks until the engine bursts
          into flames -- cutting down the rebels before they even knew what
          hit them. And then there's a great stillness. The quiet of death...
                          89
                         
          ... Sam coming out of the blackness with his AK leveled... moving
          toward the flaming wreckage of the caravan... Deng, Nineteen, and
          Marco moving to each rebel body... making sure they're dead.
                         
                          NINETEEN
           Clear!
                         
          Sam and Deng moving to the back of the Transport Truck...
                         
                          SAM
           Bring me a flashlight.
                         
          Marco hustling up with a spotlight -- Sam switching it on as Deng
          rips the canvas back and we see --
                         
          TWENTY THREE CHILDREN IN THE BACK OF THIS TRANSPORT TRUCK
                         
          Boys and girls... none of them older than twelve... tied together
          with rope... emaciated... terrified... in very bad shape.
                         
                          MARCO
                          (ARABIC)
           The front axle is broken... this truck
           won't drive.
                         
                          SAM
           What'd he say?
                         
                          DENG
           The truck is too damaged to move.
           (meaning the children)
           We don't have room for them all,
           Preacher.
                         
          The implication of this hitting Sam, his mind reeling, turning to
          Nineteen...
                         
                          SAM
           Bring our truck up here and shine them
           lights on us.
                          (TO DENG)
           Pull everyone of them kids outta there.
                         
                          DENG
           (to soldiers, Arabic)
           Bring the children out...
                         
          Deng and Marco helping the children out... one-by-one... untying
          them...
                         
                          SAM
           Put em right here... real easy...
                         
                          DENG
                          (ARABIC)
           Put them together here... gently...
                          90
                         
          And now Nineteen pulls up in the SUV, lighting up the children.
                         
                          DENG (CONT'D)
           What are you doing?
                         
                          SAM
           We're takin the ones that ain't gonna
           make it through the night. Come back for
           the others later.
                         
          And Sam moves to the first child in the group -- a little girl --
          reaching out to her but she pulls back.
                         
                          SAM (CONT'D)
           Tell her I'm not gonna hurt her.
                         
                          DENG
                          (ARABIC)
           It's ok... he will not hurt you...
                         
          And slowly the little girl steps forward... and Sam gently unbuttons
          her shirt and begins to examine her little body... turning her
          around in the harsh light of the SUV's headlamps... and he finds
          five infected gashes on her back... whip wounds... already turning
          gangrene... and he gently pushes her toward Deng...
                         
                          SAM
           Put her in the truck.
                         
          And Sam continues with the group... assessing each child's health...
          tenderly running his hands over their broken, starved bodies...
          somehow calculating which ones are worse off and pulling them out of
          line...
                         
          ... and he reaches the last child and we see that the SUV is now
          PACKED with children... huddled into every available corner... 10
          children in total. There's no more room.
                         
                          SAM (CONT'D)
           Tell em we're comin back.
                         
          Deng hesitating, knows the reaction he's going to get...
                         
                          SAM (CONT'D)
           Tell em!
                         
                          DENG
                          (ARABIC)
           We will be back for you!
                         
          The children become hysterical, crying, running at Sam and grabbing
          for him, begging to be taken.
                          91
                         
                          SAM
           Let's go!
           (to the children, holding up
                          TWO FINGERS)
           Two hours... I'll be back in two hours...
                         
          Sam, Deng, and the others loading into the SUV... some of them
          climbing onto the roof... the only available space... the remaining
          children clamoring around the truck as it begins to pull away...
                         
                          SAM (CONT'D)
           Tell em to hide. Don't come out til they
           see my face...
                         
          Deng yelling this to the children as they drive off...
                         
                          DENG
                          (ARABIC)
           Hide until we return!
                         
          ... the faint cries of the children slowly fading as they speed into
          the darkness.
                         
          EXT. CHILDREN'S ORPHANAGE - DAWN
                         
          A red sun breaking the horizon. It's ONE HOUR LATER and we see the
          SUV blasting through the front gate of the compound and skidding to
          a stop -- DOORS POPPING OPEN -- SOLDIERS JUMPING OFF THE ROOF --
          Betty and the other camp women already pulling the children out of
          the truck... ushering them into the infirmary...
                         
          Sam yelling at another soldier as he walks across the courtyard --
                         
                          SAM
           Gas it up! We're leavin here in five!
                         
          INT. TRUCK - DRIVING - MORNING
                         
          Two hours into this return trip and it's silent in this cab. Deng
          checking a handheld GPS, clocking their position, and then they see
          it -- through the windshield -- in the distance --
                         
                         SMOKE
                         
          Rising in a thin column a half-mile away.
                         
          EXT. ROAD - DEEP IN SUDAN - DAY
                         
          The scene of the ambush the night before. Burned out pickup trucks
          and dead LRA rebels strewn in the dirt. Sam's SUV arriving and he's
          the first one out... whistling for the children but they're nowhere
          to be seen.
                         
          And now we realize that the column of smoke isn't coming from the
          bombed-out LRA trucks -- it's coming from behind them. Sam moving
          around the back of the TRANSPORT TRUCK to see --
                          92
                         
          THIRTEEN LITTLE BODIES STACKED ON TOP OF EACH OTHER
                         
          The children Sam left behind.
                         
          Burned alive by the LRA an hour earlier.
                         
          Sam just standing here, staring at this smoldering pile of children.
          Starting to go someplace very dark. And as he puts it, most of him
          died in the bush this morning too.
                         
                          CUT TO:
                         
          INT. PITTSBURGH AIRPORT - NIGHT - (JUNE/2005)
                         
          And we see a line of American TRAVELERS waiting to be checked
          through customs... BUSINESS MEN in their rumpled suits carrying
          briefcases, PARENTS with their tired children returning from
          vacation... and Sam standing in this line with his duffel bag,
          somehow cut-off from the life all around him. And the CUSTOMS
          OFFICER waves him forward... Sam handing him his passport...
                         
                          CUSTOMS OFFICER
           Sudan?
                         
          And he looks up, studies Sam --
                         
           CUSTOMS OFFICER (CONT'D)
           What are you doing over there?
                         
          And we see Sam has no answer for him. This question beginning to
          plague him like a festering sore.
                         
          EXT. PASSENGER PICK-UP - PITTSBURGH AIRPORT - NIGHT
                         
          It's raining and we see Sam sitting on a bench waiting, staring o.s.
          at a SKYCAB TROLLEY. Two men working through a pile of BLACK GOLF
          BAGS, heaped on top of each other like bodies, tossing them one-by-
          one into the back of the trolley...
                         
           VOICE (O.S.)
           Sam!
                         
          He looking up as Donnie gets out of his car, smiling.
                         
                          DONNIE
           Sorry I'm late. Sixteen was all jammed
           up...
                         
          Donnie is strung out, but Sam is too deep in his own shit to see it.
                         
                          DONNIE (CONT'D)
           Welcome home, buddy.
                         
          INT. OFFICE - BANK - JOHNSTOWN, PENN. - DAY
                         
          A BANK MANAGER at a desk, in a gray suit, shaking his head.
                          93
                         
                          BANK MANAGER
           I understand what you're saying, but
           there's just not a lot we can do, until
           we pay down some of what you owe my hands
           are tied.
                         
          REVERSE to see Sam sitting in a chair across from him, a manila
          folder filled with his business papers sitting on his lap.
                         
                          SAM
           It's just an application for a short term
           loan.
                         
                          BANK MANAGER
           Sam, we already took out a second on your
           home.
                         
                          SAM
           It's only 90 days.
                         
                          BANK MANAGER
           You're completely leveraged.
                         
                          SAM
           I only got one truck over there, John. I
           need the money to buy a second vehicle.
                         
          Sam opens a manilla folder and pulls out a photo of a truck for
          sale.
                         
                         
                         
                          SAM
           It's important. Now, there's one in
           Kampala I can probably get for twenty-
           one...
                         
                          BANK MANAGER
           (cutting him off)
           Sam, we know what you're doing over there
           in Africa and we support it but ...
                         
          Sam leans over the desk and sets another photograph down in front of
          him -- and we see it's a gruesome photograph of a mutilated boy...
                         
                          SAM
           I want you to look at this. See that?
           Twelve year old boy had both his arms cut
           off by LRA...
                         
          An employee approaches the bank manager with something to sign,
          looks down at the photos. The Bank Manager becoming uncomfortable.
                         
                          BANK MANAGER
           Sam... It's not necessary.
                          94
                         
          Sam pulls out another photograph and sets it in front of the Bank
          Manager -- this one even more gruesome...
                         
                          SAM
           Look at this John, when we found this
           little girl her breasts had been hacked
           off...
                         
          Bank Manager not looking at the photograph...
                         
                          BANK MANAGER
           Sam, this isn't necessary...
                         
                          SAM
           Look at her. Look at this girl.
                         
          Bank Manager glancing at the photograph then looking away...
                         
                          SAM (CONT'D)
           Now I ain't in here askin fer money fer a
           hot tub or vacation or somethin like
           that. I'm askin for an extra vehicle so I
           can save some children. You understand

          A/C on the fritz and it's blistering hot in here. 150 parishioners
          in pews waving themselves with hand fans trying to stay cool. And we
          see Sam at the pulpit in mid-sermon, shirt pitted and rolled up to
          his elbows. The rage in this man is palpable.

           there...
                         
          The congregation whipped into a frenzy. A few of them jumping to
          their feet, shouting praise...
                         
                          SAM (CONT'D)

           They broke up last month.
                         
          And now we see Sam off from the group, absently watching the TV in
          an adjoining room... and a NEWS REPORT begins... a PICTURE OF JOHN
          GARANG flashing on the screen... Sam moving closer to the set so he
          can hear --
                         
                          TV NEWSCASTER
           ... Sudanese opposition leader John
           Garang has been killed in a helicopter
           crash according to a statement released
           by the Sudanese Government in Khartoum
           today.

           Garang was hailed as a peacemaker in
           Sudan and was instrumental in ending the
           21-year civil war that has ravaged that
           country.

           Six of Garang's associates and seven
           others also died in the crash which is
           being blamed on bad weather.
                         
          Sam frozen, shocked... just staring at the TV as the newscast
          switches to another story...

           We could probably get us a deal through
           one of Tom Hickey's boys. Between the six
           of them it wouldn't cost too much.
                         
                          SAM

          Tears welling up in Paige's eyes, anger, hurt, wanting to lash out
          at him somehow. And what she says next she's felt her whole life...

          Tension like a hair trigger.

          Donnie standing here, hurt... looking to Lynn to make sure she's
          alright and she nods for him to go... and he turns and walks out.

          INT. BAR - DAY
                         
          A crowded, noisy outlaw bar in Johnstown. We see Sam sitting at the
          bar all alone, a shot of whisky and a bottle of beer in front of
          him. Staring into a void.

          smiling.
                         
                          BIKER
           Yep, you him. I seen your face in the

          Sam nods.

                          BIKER (CONT'D)
           The way I figure it, the reason you so
           interested in helpin them porch monkeys
           is cause you probably throwin it in them
           nigger bitches, ain't ya?
                         
          The Biker smiles a nasty, malicious smile. His buddies moving next
          to him now... and we see a quiet storm brewing in Sam...
                         
                          BIKER (CONT'D)
           Am I right? You a nigger fucker, boy?
                         
          A moment here --
                         
          Sam staring at the Biker with a look we've come to know -- and --
                         
          CRACKKKK! -- Sam HEAD-BUTTS the Biker's face and a sudden, violent
          brawl breaks out -- Bikers swinging cue sticks -- Sam wading into
          the crew -- swinging wild -- taking the Biker down and stomping on
          his face -- bloody -- murderous -- and then --
                         
          EXT. JAIL - JOHNSTOWN, PENNSYLVANIA - DAY
                         
          Sam released, coming out a door and we see Lynn's car parked in the
          parking lot, engine idling.
                          101
                         
          EXT. JAIL - JOHNSTOWN / INT. LYNN'S CAR #2 - DAY
                         
          Lynn behind the wheel as Sam comes around the passenger door and
          gets in. And the two of them just sit here for a long beat, until...
                         
                          LYNN
           You're gonna sit there and you're gonna
           lemme talk.
                         
          BEAT. Sam says nothing.
                         
                          LYNN (CONT'D)
           I've always believed in you. I trusted
           you, trusted the Lord, and did what I
           could so you could follow your dream.
                          (BEAT)
           But I ain't willin to lose you to what
           you're doin over there. Ain't gonna just
           stand by and watch you get swallowed up
           by it.
                         
          She looks to him and we see she has tears in her eyes...
                         
                          LYNN (CONT'D)
           I know you're all them kids got, but
           you're all we got too. Paige needs her
           father. I need my husband.
                         
          INT. SHED - CHILDERS HOUSE - NIGHT - (AUGUST/2005)
                         
          Sam sitting in a chair in the dark. And we hear his cell vibrating
          on the desk. He picks it up and sees DONNIE'S name on the screen...
          a moment here and then he sets the phone back down... doesn't answer
          it... as we go...
                         
          INT. UNKNOWN LOCATION - SAME
                         
          Donnie on a couch and he looks like hell... pale, gaunt face...
          phone at his ear listening to RINGING and RINGING... and then the
          sound of Sam's voice...
                         
                          RECORDED MESSAGE
           This here's Sam. You know what to do.
                          (BEEEEP)
                         
                          DONNIE
                          (QUIETLY)
           Hey buddy, it's Donnie. Shoot, I was
           hopin' you was there...
                         
          Donnie hesitating... doesn't hang-up... and we can feel how badly he
          needs to talk to somebody...
                         
                          DONNIE (CONT'D)
           Other day I was thinkin bout when you and
           me was kids.

           That summer we'd go down to the quarry
           over in Montrose, remember that? We
           hooked up them ropes and spent all day
           swimmin and jumpin off them walls...
                         
          Donnie smiling to himself, a fleeting memory, and then something
          dark coming over him. And now we see another man here in this shitty
          dope house, cooking up a spoon of black tar, juicing a needle.
          Donnie watching him like a hawk...
                         
                          DONNIE (CONT'D)
           I wish you was there to pray with me,
           buddy.
                         
          EXT. WOODS - CENTRAL CITY, PENN. - DAWN
                         
          Eastern White Pine wrapped in early morning fog. Hazy. Floating like
          a dream. And then the sound of WOOD SPLINTERING... and we find Sam
          alone in this vapor cutting logs with an axe. Sweating despite the
          chill in the air...
                         
          ... and then a voice from somewhere far off. Sam stopping, looking
          into the haze as a figure materializes... coming toward him calling
          his name... at first it looks like Donnie... but then we see it's
          Lynn...
                         
          And when she reaches him her look tells us something terrible has
          happened.
                         
                          CUT TO:
                         
          INT. CHAPEL - SHEKINAH FELLOWSHIP CHURCH - CENTRAL CITY - DAY
                         
          DONNIE'S CORPSE lying in a casket...
                         
          Packed with mourners. And we hear a CHILDREN'S CHOIR singing a
          plaintive hymnal... "My Jesus, I love thee"... and Donnie's mother
          in the first pew, dressed in black, surrounded by a few other women
          offering her comfort.
                         
          And now we see Sam moving up the steps to the platform... and the
          choir softly finishes... and he looks out over the congregation...
          not saying a word for a long beat... and then...
                         
                          SAM
           Most of you want me to stand up here and
           make some sense outta this. That's why
           you come here today. You want me to tell
           you that God has his plan for all of us,
           and when he wants to call us back home
           he's gonna do it.
                          (BEAT)
           That's what you wanna hear...
                          (QUIETLY)
           That's what you wanna hear...
                          103
                         
          And Sam stops, unable to continue... just stares out at the
          congregation... at the expectant faces looking back at him,
          waiting...
                         
          ... but he steps away from the lectern, down the steps, and walks up
          the aisle toward the exit... the congregation staring at him as he
          passes...
                         
          INT. LYNN'S CAR #2/CHILDERS DRIVEWAY - DRIVING - DAY
                         
          Hours later. Lynn and Paige still dressed from the funeral, driving
          up the driveway to their house.
                         
                          PAIGE
           Mom, who are those men?
                         
          THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD we see a FLATBED TRUCK parked next to the
          house and 7 or 8 MOVERS pulling heavy machinery out of the barn.
                         
          EXT. GARAGE - CHILDERS HOUSE - CENTRAL CITY, PENN. - DAY
                         
          Lynn getting out of the car, approaching some of the men...
                         
                          LYNN
           S'cuse me, what are you doing?
                         
                          MOVER
           Loadin up...
                         
          And she makes her way into...
                         
          INT. GARAGE - CHILDERS HOUSE - CENTRAL CITY, PENN. - DAY
                         
          Filled with movers busily hauling equipment out of the garage. Lynn
          coming in, confused...
                         
                          LYNN
           Hey, s'cuse me...
                         
          And now she sees Sam going through a cabinet in the back.
                         
                          LYNN (CONT'D)
           Sam, what's goin on? What are these men
           doin here?...
                         
          Sam slamming the cabinet closed, moving past her without saying a
          word. Lynn grabbing his arm, stopping him.
                         
                          LYNN (CONT'D)
           Where are they taking our stuff?
                         
                          SAM
           Ain't ours no more. Best go through and
           make sure they ain't takin nuthin that
           belongs in the house.
                          104
                         
          He walks off...
                         
                          LYNN
           Sam...
                         
          And she sees two men start to dismantle the "Childers Construction
          Company" sign that she painted herself years ago --
                         
                          LYNN (CONT'D)
           Hey! -- Don't touch that! --
                         
          EXT. GARAGE - CHILDERS HOUSE - CENTRAL CITY, PENN. - DAY
                         
          Sam moving toward the house. Lynn comes out of the barn after him...
                         
                          LYNN
                          (CALLING AFTER)
           Sam!
                         
          But he's not stopping. He reaches the house...
                         
          INT. CHILDERS' HOUSE - DAY
                         
          ... Sam coming inside, moving to the kitchen... Lynn following him.
                         
                          LYNN
           Honey, I know you're hurtin. I know
           you're angry, but we need to talk about
           this...
                         
                          SAM
           It's all done, so save yer breath...
           where's the keys to the safe?
                         
          Sam grabs papers from the counter and hands them to Lynn. She
          quickly pages through them, can't believe what she's reading.
                         
                          LYNN
           You sold the business for $27,000?
                         
                          SAM
           I need a new truck for the orphanage.
                         
                          LYNN
           A new truck? You sold our business for a
           new truck?
                         
          Sam finds the Keys.
                         
                          LYNN (CONT'D)
           That was our future, Sam. Paige's future.
                         
          Lynn follows Sam into the office.
                          105
                         
                          LYNN (CONT'D)
           Everything we have has gone to those
           children, Sam. There's a point when there
           ain't no more to give.
                         
                          SAM
           What's the combination? What's the
           fucking combination.
                         
                          LYNN
           Paige's birthday.
                         
          Sam starts to spin the combination but hesitates...
                         
                          LYNN (CONT'D)
           You don't know it, do you? You don't even
           remember your own daughter's birthday.
                         
                          SAM
           What are the numbers?
                         
                          LYNN
           You fight for everyone but us.
                         
          She moves past him, spinning the combination and cranking open the
          vault. Sam grabbing a couple stacks of cash.
                         
                          LYNN (CONT'D)
           You take that and we lose the house. The
           church. All of it.
                         
                          SAM
           You can make it up with the ministry.
                         
                          LYNN
           What ministry?! They see what you've
           become, Sam. They see how far gone you
           are. You need to get quiet with The Lord.
                         
          And he looks to her...
                         
                          SAM
           Fuck the Lord.
                         
                          LYNN
           Don't say that. Don't turn yer back on
           him.
                         
                          SAM
           ... He turned his back on me! -- on
           Donnie! -- on every one of them kids over
           there.
                         
                          LYNN
           The good you're doin is destroyin this
           family.
                          106
                         
                          SAM
           What good have I ever done?
                         
          Sam standing here, weighing something in his mind. A choice he must
          make here... and finally he moves past her...
                         
                          LYNN
           Please don't leave...
                         
          But he's gone.
                         
                          CUT TO:
                         
          EXT. KAMPALA AIRPORT - DAY
                         
          And we see Sam moving across this crowded tarmac. Disconnected. A
          bit frightening. And he's greeted by Deng.
                         
                          DENG
           Welcome back.
                         
          But Sam says nothing, and Deng sees that his eyes are deserted.
          Inevitable. And Sam moves past him without saying a word.
                         
          INT. MESS HALL - CHILDREN'S ORPHANAGE - DAY
                         
          30 or 40 adults and children here eating the last meal of the day.
          And we see Sam in a corner, off from the rest of the group. And
          maybe it's just the lighting in here, but there's a darkness around
          him -- literally as if the space surrounding this man is devoid of
          light.
                         
          And we see William working his way through the room... refilling
          cups with hot tea... his particular job here... and he comes up to
          Sam and accidently sloshes some of the tea onto Sam's arm and he
          flinches! -- burned -- "Damn it!" -- shoots his arm out and
          accidentally hits William in the chest -- knocking him backward onto
          the ground.
                         
          The entire room falls silent. Nobody moving.
                         
          And Sam gets up and walks out of the room.
                         
          INT./EXT. TRUCK/RURAL ROAD - SUDAN - DAY
                         
          A convoy of 2 OR 3 AID RELIEF TRUCKS coming down this dirt road. And
          we see Agnete here with a DRIVER in the first truck as they drive
          onto a NARROW BRIDGE -- and just before they reach the other side --
                         
          A PICKUP TRUCK filled with heavily armed LRA REBELS pulls in front
          of them, cutting them off.
                         
                          AGNETE
           STOP THE TRUCK! -- STOP!! --
                          107
                         
          The truck grinding to a halt. The driver becoming terrified, trying
          to jam the truck into reverse --
                         
                          AGNETE (CONT'D)
           No, no, no! -- don't go back --
                         
                          DRIVER
           WE ARE GOING TO DIE! -- THEY WILL KILL
           US!
                         
                          AGNETE
           You move and they'll shoot! -- calm down!
           -- I will talk to them.
                         
          Agnete climbing out of the truck as we go --
                         
          EXT. NARROW BRIDGE - SUDAN - DAY
                         
          Rebels jumping out of the pickup truck and moving up the bridge as
          Agnete approaches -- holding up her hands --
                         
                          AGNETE
           It's ok -- we are a relief convoy --
                         
          Agnete and the LRA LEADER meet in the middle of the bridge --
                         
                          AGNETE (CONT'D)
           We have only medical supplies -- non-
                          MILITARY --
                         
          And suddenly the LRA LEADER slams her in the gut with the butt of
          his rifle and she collapses. The other Rebels swarm all over the
          convoy, pulling out AID WORKERS and DRIVERS, forcing them onto their
          knees in a group.
                         
                          ADULT REBEL #3
           Get on your knees!... Get down!...
                         
                          DRIVER
           PLEASE DON'T KILL US!
                         
                          ADULT REBEL #4
                          (ARABIC)
           On your knees or we will take your legs!
                         
          Everyone terrified -- some of them sobbing -- Agnete looking up,
          trying to talk to the LRA LEADER--
                         
                          AGNETE
           We are only a relief convoy --
                         
                          LRA LEADER
           Shut your mouth!
                          108
                         
          -- and he SLAMS her in the face with the butt of his rifle and she
          goes down hard... and he rests the barrel of his rifle on the back
          of her head... he's going to shoot her -- and --
                         
          KAK! KAK! KAK!
                         
          His chest EXPLODES! -- three bursts from behind -- the other rebels
          spinning toward the gunshots as --
                         
          KRATAKRATAKRATAKRAK!!!
                         
          A firestorm of lead -- Sam, Deng, and the rest of his team coming
          onto the bridge shooting -- rebels scrambling for cover but it's too
          late -- dropping as they try and sprint away -- and in an instant
          it's all over.
                         
          Agnete sees Sam, rushes toward him, but when he looks at her she
          freezes. He is completely unrecognizable to her in this moment -- a
          killer's thousand-yard stare -- barely human -- more like a machine
          than a man.
                         
          And he moves past her down the bridge, to the LRA LEADER on the
          ground who is still alive. And he puts the barrel of his rifle
          against the rebel's head and...
                         
          BOOOOM!
                         
          He's dead. Just like that. And he continues walking up the bridge.
          And we see Agnete, Deng and the other soldiers having just witnessed
          this.
                         
          INT. INFIRMARY - CHILDREN'S ORPHANAGE - NIGHT
                         
          William coming in quietly, moving next to one of the captured Rebels
          from the previous scene who is shackled to a bed, injured. Two SPLA
          soldiers here standing guard.
                         
                          WILLIAM
                          (ARABIC)
           I want to ask you something...
                         
          William pulls out the photograph of his brother, holds it up...
                         
                          WILLIAM (CONT'D)
           This is my brother. His name is
           Christopher. He was stolen by the rebels.
                          (BEAT)
           Do you know if he is alive?
                         
          The Rebel looks at the photograph but says nothing, just shakes his
          head... and he looks off, his thousand yard stare inscrutable...
                         
          And William simply folds the photograph back up and slips it into
          his pocket... but he doesn't leave... he sits here a moment
          longer... quietly... thinking... and then...
                          109
                         
                          WILLIAM (CONT'D)
           Were you taken when you were young like
           me?
                         
          The Rebel hears this and turns to him... and nods his head...
                         
                          WILLIAM (CONT'D)
           Do you remember your parents?
                         
          And we see something happening in this hardened rebel... his eyes
          filling with a distant memory... a sadness... and slowly he nods his
          head again.
                         
          And we stay here with these two lost souls sitting next to each
          other... silent... connected by a shared history and anguish.
                         
          EXT. CHILDREN'S ORPHANAGE - DAY - LATER
                         
          Sam sitting alone, lost to the world around him. Deng approaches.
          Neither one acknowledging the other for a long beat until...
                         
                          DENG
           Do you hear that, Preacher?
                         
                          SAM
           What?
                         
                          DENG
           There is no more laughter. The children
           do not play here anymore. They are scared
           once again.
                          (BEAT)
           But now they are scared of you.
                         
          Sam, no response.
                         
                          DENG (CONT'D)
           The men do not trust you any longer to
           lead them into battle. They say you have
           a wish to die.
                          (BEAT)
           I am worried about my friend. I want to
           help him.
                         
                          SAM
           I don't need your help.
                         
          And Sam turns away. After a beat Deng walks off, leaving him alone
          once again.
                         
          INT. SAM'S TUKUL - CHILDREN'S ORPHANAGE - NIGHT
                         
          And we see Sam here in the dark... moonlight filtering in through
          the thatched roof... like shards of glass cutting through the
          blackness... and he doesn't look right here... soul worn thin...
          eyes hollow... starting to go someplace very bad...
                          110
                         
          ... IMAGES FLASHING IN HIS HEAD... babies burned and screaming...
          Donnie in his coffin... and we realize we're watching something
          here... his world starting to cave in on him...
                         
          ... and he drops against his cot... distraught... tears in his eyes
          and this man is breaking... and suddenly we see a gun in his hand...
          finger curling around the trigger as he puts it to his head... eyes
          closing against the world... and...
                         
          WE HEAR A KNOCK AT HIS DOOR
                         
          Sam frozen... still holding the gun... and slowly the door pushes
          open and we hear soft footsteps shuffling into this dark room...
                         
          ... and William steps into the light, sees Sam here on the ground
          with the gun in his hand... and slowly he moves next to him, sitting
          on the cot without saying a word... just the two of them here for a
          moment... and then slowly he begins in perfect English...
                         
                          WILLIAM
           I remember my parents when I sleep. I see
           them in my dreams sometimes.
                         
          Sam looking to William... this small boy sitting above him...
          telling his story...
                         
                          WILLIAM (CONT'D)
           My father was big like you. They shot
           him. We were so scared. Then the rebels
           gave me a club and told me if I didn't
           kill my mother they would shoot my
           brother and me.
                         
          And William pauses in his story... lost in this memory... his face
          becoming a mask of pain... but no tears... there are no more tears
          in this young man left to be shed... and so he continues...
                         
                          WILLIAM (CONT'D)
           I refused, but my mother told me to swing
           hard... that I must make her proud...
                          (BEAT)
           And so I did. I made her proud.
                         
          And now William looks down at Sam... staring at this man on the
          ground... and he reaches out and gently touches Sam's head... a
          moment of tenderness for both of them... an act of love.... these
          two broken souls finding each another here... and William says...
                         
                          WILLIAM (CONT'D)
           If we allow ourselves to become full of
           hate then they've won. We must not let
           them take our hearts. This is the most
           important thing.
                          111
                         
          And Sam sets the gun down and reaches out to William, pulls him into
          an embrace... holding him close... and we know that without a doubt
          this boy has saved this man's life.
                         
          INT. CHILDERS' HOUSE UPSTAIRS HALLWAY- CENTRAL CITY, PENN. - NIGHT
                         
          Soft Christian music is playing on the radio. Lynn folding clothes
          in the laundry room when the phone rings. Paige comes into the
          upstairs hallway and answers it.
                         
                          PAIGE
           (quiet, into phone)
           Hello?
                         
          INT. SAM'S TUKUL - CHILDREN'S ORPHANAGE - NIGHT
                         
          Sam on his sat phone --
                         
                          SAM
           Bug? You there?
                         
          INT. CHILDERS' HOUSE - CENTRAL CITY, PENN. - NIGHT
                         
                          PAIGE
           Dad?
                         
                          SAM
           Yeah, it's me.
                         
                          PAIGE
           You ok?
                         
                          SAM
           I'm ok, Bug.
                         
          And there's a long pause... so much to say but no words to say it...
          each of them holding their phones to their ears and just
          listening... and finally Sam says...
                         
                          SAM (CONT'D)
           I'm thinkin of a tree...
                         
          And we see tears well up in Paige's eyes when she hears this... and
          now we see Lynn coming around the corner, overhearing them as they
          begin their little game one more time...
                         
                          PAIGE
           You said tree... I'm thinkin of a knee.
                         
          Sam smiling to himself... and we realize this man is coming back to
          life when he says...
                         
                          SAM
           You said knee, I'm thinkin of bee...
                          (BEAT)
           I love you, Bug.
                          112
                         
                          PAIGE
           I love you too, Daddy.
                         
          Lynn hearing this and tears roll down her cheeks as we go...
                         
          EXT. COMPOUND - CHILDREN'S VILLAGE ORPHANGE - NEXT DAY
                         
          And we see the soldiers at their posts... Betty and the other Camp
          Women cleaning clothes and preparing food... and we see most of the
          children loitering around a tree in the shade, sullen, not playing
          on the playground.
                         
          And then we see Sam coming into the courtyard kicking a soccer
          ball... some of the children see him and point... and slowly the
          entire camp begins to notice Sam kicking the soccer ball awkwardly
          by himself out in the open... Betty and the other women stopping
          their chores and watching him, speaking to one another in Arabic...
                         
          Deng and the other soldiers staring as Sam pops the ball into the
          air and bounces it off his head...
                         
          ... and now a couple of the smaller kids sprint for him and he kicks
          them the ball... and slowly the rest of the children join in the
          fun... kicking the ball back and forth... an impromptu soccer
          game... and then we hear LAUGHTER again... joy flooding back into
          this place.
                         
          Deng watching with a big smile as this white man dances around these
          little children... a Pied Piper of joy... playing in the dirt.
                         
          EXT. FRONT GATE - CHILDREN'S VILLAGE ORPHANAGE - DAY - LATER
                         
          And we see William approach a knot of soldiers standing by the front
          gate smoking cigarettes...
                         
                          WILLIAM
           Excuse me...
                         
                          SPLA SOLDIER #3
           What is it?
                         
                          WILLIAM
           Is it true an LRA commander was captured
           last night?
                         
          Soldiers nodding their heads "yes."
                         
                          WILLIAM (CONT'D)
           Where is he being held?
                         
                          SPLA SOLDIER #3
           At the army base in Kisoro.
                         
                          WILLIAM
           Are you going there?
                          113
                         
                          SPLA SOLDIER #3
           Yes.
                         
                          WILLIAM
           Can I ride with you?
                         
                          SPLA SOLDIER #3
           Why do you want to go to Kisoro?
                         
                          WILLIAM
           I want to ask the commander something.
                         
                          SPLA SOLDIER #3
           No, you cannot ride with us. Wait till
           tomorrow and go with the women on the
           bus.
                         
          And the soldiers turn their backs on William and he slinks away.
                         
          EXT. RIVERBANK - CHILDREN'S ORPHANAGE - DAY
                         
          We see a line of women along the riverbank in their colorful
          dresses... scrubbing pans and washing clothes... singing an ancient
          African spiritual as they work... the sun dropping pale red on the
          horizon...
                         
          And we see Sam here too... alone with himself... sitting at the
          river's edge, watching the water rolling gently past... listening to
          the soft serenade of the women... the beauty of it all...
                         
          ... and then he gets up and walks into the river... and he kneels
          down so that water reaches his waist (reminiscent of his first
          baptism in scene #35)... and now the women on the riverbank stop
          their work, watching him as he closes his eyes and gently leans
          back... submitting to the water... and when he comes up again we see
          in his eyes that his soul has been saved in this simple act.
                         
          And the women begin to shout their praise from the riverbank as we
          go...
                         
          INT. DORM - CHILDREN'S VILLAGE ORPHANAGE - DAY
                         
          And we see William here alone, pulling out a small satchel...
          filling it with a bottle of water and a blanket...
                         
          EXT. COMPOUND - CHILDREN'S VILLAGE ORPHANGE - DAY
                         
          William at the edge of the compound... looking over his shoulder to
          make sure nobody is watching him... and then quickly slipping under
          the fence and he's gone...
                         
          EXT. BUSH - DUSK
                         
          William walking through the dry scrub alone... already a couple
          miles deep in the bush... the sun starting to set... light waning...
          William starting to get nervous, picking up his pace...
                          114
                         
          AND THEN THE SOUND OF MEN
                         
          A squad of LRA rebels coming through the scrub... William hiding
          under a bush, terrified... the men coming closer... no idea if they
          saw him or not... his mind racing... voices getting louder...
          starting to hyper-ventilate from the fear -- and --
                         
                         WILLIAM BOLTS
                         
          Sprinting through the bush -- running for his life -- rebels see him
          -- yelling for him to stop -- chasing him down -- shooting their
          rifles into the air and he hits the ground in the fetal position --
          too terrified to continue -- eyes clamped shut as 4 or 5 rebels
          surround him -- guns pointed at his head -- caught.
                         
          INT. INFIRMARY - CHILDREN'S ORPHANAGE - DUSK
                         
          Sam coming into the building, finding Betty tending to a sick child.
                         
                          SAM
           Have you seen William?
                         
          Betty shaking her head "no", and we see the worry on Sam's face...
          intuitively knows something is wrong.
                         
          INT. LRA TRUCK - DRIVING - DUSK
                         
          William bound and gagged being dragged through the bush by 5 or 6
          rebels... and one of the rebels sees him staring at them and he
          brings the butt of his Kalishnikov down hard -- striking William on
          the head as we go --
                         
          EXT. OFFICE - CHILDREN'S ORPHANAGE - DUSK
                         
          Deng coming up to Sam...
                         
                          DENG
           Some of the soldiers said he was asking
           about the commander that is being held at
           Kismoro.
                         
          Sam closing his eyes, knows instantly what William has done.
                         
                          SAM
           Get em on the phone, see if he's shown up
           at the base yet.
                         
          EXT. LRA CAMP - DEEP IN THE BUSH - NIGHT
                         
          William shoved through the bush... moving deeper into this rebel
          encampment... dark and otherworldly... figures moving around camp
          fires... laughing... men with little girls... their child wives...
          with pregnant bellies... and incongruously the sound of American rap
          music coming from a jambox somewhere.
                         
          The overriding sense we get from this place is one of `insanity.'
                          115
                         
          And William is dragged to a clearing next to a grouping of tents and
          he's kicked to the dirt... two other soldiers pinning him to the
          ground as a third grabs his feet and pulls off his shoes... William
          YELLING and now a handful of other LRA soldiers start to gather
          around... most of them only a few years older than him... watching
          as his ankles are bound together and placed on a wooden block...
                         
          ... and now another soldier steps forward with an AXE... and the
          crowd whips into bloodlust... shouting... cheering...
                         
          AND THE SOLDIER LIFTS THE AXE INTO THE AIR --
                         
          WILLIAM WRITHING ON THE GROUND BUT CAN'T GET FREE --
                         
          AND THE SOLDIER STARTS TO BRING THE BLADE DOWN -- AND --
                         
           VOICE (O.S.)
                          (ARABIC)
           Stop!
                         
          The soldier freezes -- everyone turning as an LRA COMMANDER comes
          through the crowd -- takes the axe from the soldier --
                         
                          SOLDIER
           He ran from us.
                         
                          COMMANDER
           He is worth nothing with no feet. Put him
           with the others until tomorrow.
                         
          EXT. COMPOUND - CHILDREN'S VILLAGE ORPHANGE - NIGHT
                         
          Deng hustling up to Sam... shaking his head...
                         
                          DENG
           They have not see the boy.
                         
                          SAM
           Ok. Get Nineteen and Marco -- we're gonna
           go look for him.
                         
          EXT. LRA CAMP - DEEP IN THE BUSH - NIGHT
                         
          And we see William in a bamboo cell in the center of camp... and we
          see other children here... in various stages of fear and
          suffering... some of them completely naked... shivering in the cool
          air... others catatonic, probably doped up or too battered to move.
                         
          INT. SUV - DRIVING - NIGHT
                         
          Sam, Deng, Nineteen and Marco in this lead truck... been out here
          for hours... behind them we see the second camp truck following...
                         
          And they come to a fork in the road, pulling to a stop.
                          116
                         
                          DENG
           It will be light soon. What do you want
           to do?
                         
          Sam looking at a topo map on his lap...
                         
                          SAM
           Let's go through Maridi, see if they've
           seen anything.
                         
          EXT. LRA CAMP - DEEP IN THE BUSH - DAWN
                         
          Pale yellow sun breaking and we see William and a line of 10 or 12
          other children -- shackled in iron -- being loaded into the back of
          a TRANSPORT TRUCK.
                         
          INT. SUV - DAWN
                         
          Both SUV's parked off the side of the road now. Sam and Deng here,
          looking at maps and the GPS tracker. And we hear Deng's radio
          squawk. He digs it out, responds in Arabic, then turns to Sam...
                         
                          DENG
           The village outside of Akot says an LRA
           caravan came through there an hour ago.
           They were headed for Ed Duim.
                         
          INT./EXT. - LRA CONVOY/BUSH - DEEP IN SUDAN - DAY
                         
          A convoy of 4 or 5 LRA trucks barreling down this dirt track. And we
          see lots of rebels standing up in the back of these trucks, cradling
          heavy weapons, alert -- and suddenly we see in the distance --
                         
          TWO ROOSTER-TAILS OF DUST COMING AT US
                         
          From different angles -- converging on the LRA convoy -- the Rebels
          see them and point -- they know what's coming and they begin to
          prepare for war --
                         
                         THE ROOSTER-TAILS
                         
          Getting closer -- and then we see them --
                         
          SAM'S TWO TRUCKS
                         
          Bouncing over the terrain towards us -- coming fast -- and then --
                         
          WOOOOSH!
                         
          An RPG streaks toward the lead LRA truck and -- KABOOOM! -- the
          truck is blown off it's axles -- the other LRA trucks pulling off
          the road -- and suddenly we're in a withering firefight -- the roar
          of heavy weapons at full-tilt.
                         
          SAM AND HIS MEN
                          117
                         
          Jumping out of their trucks and flanking the LRA convoy --
          triangulating fire -- shredding the rebels -- blowing them back off
          their feet.
                         
                         NINETEEN
                         
          Sprinting through the bush -- edging around the LRA trucks --
          finding a position on their weak side and locking an RPG into a
          launcher -- shouldering it -- aiming -- WOOOOSH! -- the missile
          streaking toward the second LRA jeep and --
                         
          KABOOOM!
                         
          It's blasted into the air -- onto it's side -- rebels scurrying away
          from the wreckage -- still firing -- an absolute hail of lead --
          AK's barking in every direction --
                         
          KRATAKRATAKRATAKRATAKRAKKK!
                         
          One of the rebels standing up -- firing an RPG -- WOOOOOSH!
                         
          MARCO crouched behind the new orphanage truck firing -- sees the
          white streak coming at him -- dives -- just as --
                         
          THE TRUCK IS EVISCERATED IN THE BLAST!
                         
          SAM moving closer to the rebels -- shooting -- picking them off one
          by one -- gunfire raking over his head -- a dozen muzzle flashes
          coming from everywhere -- Sam yelling over the thunder --
                         
                          SAM
           Go! -- Go! -- Go! -- Go!
                         
          And we see Deng coming out of the bush to his right -- and then
          Nineteen to his left -- and they charge on the remaining rebels --
          Sam providing covering fire -- a curtain of lead cutting through the
          enemy -- and just like that it's over -- Sam waving behind him --
                         
                          SAM (CONT'D)
           Cease fire!!
                         
          -- and suddenly there's just a sick silence -- smoke rising from the
          shot-to-shit LRA trucks -- bodies strewn in the dirt -- the brand
          new orphanage truck bombed out and smoking on it's side.
                         
          And Sam makes his way to the first TRANSPORT TRUCK -- Deng covering
          him as he rips the canvas back to see --
                         
          50 CHILDREN CRAMMED INTO THE BACK OF THIS TRUCK
                         
                          SAM (CONT'D)
           Pull em all out! C'mon, let's go!
                         
                          DENG
           (to Soldiers, Arabic)
           Take them out.

          Soldiers start to unload the children --
                         
                          SAM
           Cut them loose!
                         
                          DENG
           (to soldier, Arabic)
           Cut the ropes!
                         
          Sam moves to the second TRANSPORT TRUCK, rips the canvas back to
                         FIND --
                         
          50 MORE CHILDREN SHACKLED IN THE BACK OF THIS TRUCK
                         
          Holy fuck indeed.
                         
          He's been here before... 100 kids and he only has one good
          vehicle... and we watch him standing here... staring at these tiny
          faces looking back at him... a moment... lost in indecision until
          one of the kids stands up near the back...
                         
                         IT'S WILLIAM
                         
          Sam sees him and suddenly he knows exactly what he needs to do...
                         
                          SAM
           C'MON, LET'S GO!... get em out of there
           and line em up! -- C'MON! --
                         
          And we've seen this before... Sam going through these children...
          assessing their health... one by one... separating the worse off
          from the others... forming two group... turning to Deng and Nineteen
          and motioning to the smaller group (about 15 children)...
                         
                          SAM (CONT'D)
           Load these here into the truck. Put em
           three deep if you have to...
                         
          Deng herding the children toward the one good truck...
                         
                          SAM (CONT'D)
           (turning to Marco, Arabic)
           Come with me --
                         
                         NEW ANGLE
                         
          Sam and Marco moving from one dead LRA rebel to the other... rolling
          them onto their backs... going through their belts... pulling out
          extra ammo clips and grenades...
                         
                          SAM (CONT'D)
           Get them AK's too.
                          (ARABIC)
           The machine guns.
                         
          Marco swinging four or five machine guns onto his shoulder...
                          119
                         
                         NEW ANGLE
                         
          At the SUV, now jammed with children. Sam talking to Nineteen, Marco
          and the others...
                         
                          SAM (CONT'D)
           I need all you to climb up on that roof
           and keep yer eyes peeled. That road back
           might be hot, so be ready.
                         
                          NINETEEN
           What about you, Preacher?
                         
           VOICE (O.S.)
           We're staying.
                         
          Sam turns to see Deng next to him, holding an AK in his hands, a
          steely resolve in his eyes. Sam nods, emboldened by his support.
                         
                          SAM
           (to the soldiers)
           Go on. Get outta here.
                         
          The soldiers load onto the SUV and drive off, leaving Sam and Deng
          standing here in the middle of these 85 children.
                         
          Waiting for the war that will surely come.
                         
          INT. SUV - DRIVING - DAY
                         
          And we stay in this truck as it pulls away... driving for a long
          time... until Sam, Deng, and the children become only specks on the
          horizon... and then...
                         
          WHITE LETTERS ON A BLACK SCREEN THAT READ --
                         
                         
                         
           "To this day, Sam Childers fights for the children of Sudan and
           Northern Uganda."
                         
                         
                         
                          THE END
                          120
                         
                         LEGENDS:
                         
                         
                         
          Joseph Kony and his Lord's Resistance Army continue their reign of
          terror in Sudan and Northern Uganda.
                         
                         
                         
          Amnesty International estimates that Kony and the LRA are
          responsible for over 400,000 murders and more than 40,000 child
          abductions. These children are tortured, raped, sold into sex
          slavery, and forced to take part in ritualized killing by LRA
          commanders.
                         
                         
                         
          The Islamic Government of Sudan continues to provide weapons and
          safe haven to Kony and the LRA as part of a deal to wage a proxy war
          against the predominately Christian South.
                         
                         
                         
          Without pressure from the United States, this support will continue
          and more innocent children will be slaughtered.
                         
                         
                         
          Now you know.

          As of 2011, Sam Childers has rescued over 800 children from the LRA.
          His `Angels of East Africa Orphanage' is home to more than 300
          orphans, and feeds over 1200 meals a day to neighboring villagers in
          need.
