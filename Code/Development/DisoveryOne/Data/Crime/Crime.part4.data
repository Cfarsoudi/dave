          INT. PIER BUILDING - DAY


          BANG!!
          A shock chord as we cut from black to a harshly toplit

                         CLOSE SHOT:
          A man is talking into a cellular phone. He is a paunchy
          but powerful looking black man, bald with a gray fringe.
          His baldness makes his head look muscular; he is a tough
          man whose life has been shaped by the violence of the docks.
          His name is EDDIE BLACK.
          In the distance a foghorn moans.
          We are pulling back.

                         BLACK
          Yeah. .'Cause he's an asshole. Tell
          him no... Tell him no too... Him, tell
          fuck you... Yeah... Uh huh...
          The continuing pull back shows that we are inside a huge
          empty pier building. Black is leaning against the roof of
          his car, which is parked in the middle of the vast empty
          space.
          The room is lit by bare bulbs, its farthest reaches
          falling into darkness.

                         BLACK
          No, I'll be a few minutes here. Guy
          comin' up, thinks he's gonna muscle me
          outs my property... Does it matter?
          Just another tough guy...Yeah, okay...
          Another hard-looking man is approaching.

          for those fuckers.

          We are tracking towards a chain link fence which is
          swinging open to admit two midnight blue Lincoln
          Continentals.
          The cars stop in the foreground and eight men get out,
          eerily backlit in the mist of the riverfront.

          is a wiry twenty-year old who looks about in short, jerky
          motions. He huddles in behind the others. He is
          stylishly dressed, with slicked back, black hair. His
          protruding Adams apple bobs as he swallows.

          is middle-aged and balding. His spare tire hangs over the
          edge of his suit pants. He subdues a belch. He raises a
          bottle of Maalox and slugs down fifty cents worth. A ring
          of white chalky fluid coats his lips.

          11 They are approached by a group of fifteen dock workers, 11
          Black's men, with massive shoulders and grain-sack bellies.
          Looks like they just got off their shift and now they're
          ready to kick some ass.

          Okay, against the car, ladies. You're
          c gonna stand for a search.
          12 The eight visitors assume the position, placing their 12
          hands on the roof of their car. The dock workers pat them
          down and haul off iron -- lots of it.

                         DOCK WORKER #2
          Bunch a cuties.

          Put skirts on 'em, I'd marry one.
          From the other Dock Workers, hearty male laughter. The
          visitors bare up in silence.

          Workers take up positions around Durant and his men.

          The last shot echoes away to leave silence -- except for
          the arhythmic echoing scuffle of Skip's one shoe, as he
          continues to hop in place for balance.
          Smiley, after a watchful pause to make sure everyone is
          dead, sticks out his left arm at waist level.
          Skip grabs the arm for support, stops hopping, and there
          is now...total silence.

          ROBERT G. DURANT
          the elegantly suited leader, takes out a cigar and a
          gold-plated cigar trimmer. SNIP--he trims the and of
          the cigar, and sticks it in his mouth.
          As he walks towards the dumbly apprehensive Black:

                         DURANT
          Now let's consider my points, one by
          one...

          ...Two: I don't always succeed.
          SNIP! Black screams. Reaching for another finger:

          ...Three: I've got seven more points.

          Making jerky little movements this way and that.

          EYE'S POV: AN ENORMOUS NOSE
          We pull focus through the nose, then back to sharp focus
          again. The nose fills the screen, every pore a cavern,
          every blemish a mountain.

          As it hums to life. It is a box containing linear rows of
          densely packed pins. Tiny servo-motors beneath the pins
          allow each pin to rise or fall individually, per computer
          command. A smooth synthetic substance is being sprayed
          evenly atop the surface of the pins. The sprays halts; the
          wet substance glistens. The densely packed pins rise to
          programmed heights, molding the solidifying synthetic
          substance into an exact replica of Yakatito's nose.

          ..Ninety-nine minute. Cells always
          break up at a ninety-nine minute.
          He punches away at a keyboard and takes the readout.

          But still this ninety nine minute.
          Yakitito makes a notation of the time on a lab sheet.

                         PEYTON
          Pacing, thinking;

                         PEYTON
          Why? What is destabilizing it?
          Vivification process was cake. Tissue
          rejection? We licked
          that. We're close. We're smart guys.
          So why can't we make these cells
          stable? Hokay. Let's try a
          ten percent alkalinity. Get those
          suckers too drunk to fragment.

                         YAKITITO
          posts the completed lab sheet on a wall covered with hundreds
          of similar sheets.

                         YAKITITO
          We already try ten.
          He pokes at a section of lab sheets.

                         YAKITITO
          And twenty. And twenty-two... We try
          all phase of alkalinity.

          month ago... ninety nine minute...
          BAM BAM... Yakitito punches the wall again and again.
          Peyton calmly taps a plastic dunking bird that slowly
          bobs.

                         PEYTON
          A word of advice, Yakitito. Don't get
          emotionally involved. Watch.
          Analyze. Remain object ---

          BAM!
          He is cut off as Yakitito punches the wall again and
          again to punctuate his speech.

                         YAKITITO

          Quick, Yakitito.
          A basketball appears in Peyton's hands. He tosses it to

          CAMERA.

                         YAKITITO
          Catches the ball.

                         PEYTON
          The answer, Yakitito.

                         YAXITITO
          snags the ball angrily from the air.

                         YAKITITO

                         (FURIOUS)
          It is most strongly depending on
          temperature!
          He throws it at Peyton, who grabs it, and pump-fakes
          Yakitito, not letting him have the ball.

                         PEYTON
          Go on!
          Again he pump-fakes. Yakitito flinches.

                         YAKITITO
          This means the temperature of the
          emitter is not critical as long as it
          is sufficiently high and as
          long as pure metals with high
          operating temperatures such as
          tungsten or tantalum are used.
          Peyton tosses him the ball. Yakitito catches it. Calm
          now. He blinks.

                         YAKITITO
          Amazing. It work every time.

          The Stracks and Julie are seated at a table next to a large
          picture window that looks out on the bridle path. Jodhpured
          equestrians gallop past in the distance.
          Seated across from them are Baron Hugo Von Hoffenstein, a
          bald, hook-nosed Austrian aristocrat with a patrician air
          and cold beady eyes. He is accompanied by his attorney
          Myron Katz.
          Liveried waiters are just clearing the table and serving
          coffee.

                         KATZ
          We want to be reasonable here. We
          said we were interested in selling the
          pier frontage and we are interested in
          selling. But frankly Mr. Von
          .will not be robbed.
          Seventy-five strikes us as a fair
          price for this parcel. We're ready to
          conclude a deal here and now at that
          price.

                         PLEASANTLY:

          Strack Jr. tries to suppress a smile.
          Waiters bring in the wine and pour a tasting portion for
          Von Hoffenstein, silent, coldly watchful.
          He rolls the wine in his glass, eyes appraising Julie.
          He takes a sip, cocks his head, nods.
          Wine is poured around.

          Sunshine streams through the sheers of the window onto
          Julie's shoulder. She sits on the bed going over some papers,
          her expression increasingly disturbed.
          Julie punches a number into the phone.

                         JULIE
          .Dale Gorson, please...
          Peyton's hand enters with a mug of coffee, which he sets on
          the papers in front of her.

                         JULIE
          Peyton!
          Julie takes the mug away; it has indeed left a brown circle
          on the topmost memo.
          Julie smiles at him. Then:

                         JULIE
          Dale? Yes, Julie Hastings... yes, I
          found some memos researching the Von
          Hoffenstein deal that I don't think I
          was supposed to find... From the late
          Mr. Strack to a guy named Claude
          Bellasarious. They're records of
          payments to various people on the
          zoning commission...
          Peyton, behind her, massages her back.

                         JULIE
          .They look like payoffs. Suspicious,
          at the very least... Well, the way I'd
          like to proceed is to talk to Strack's
          son first... Give him the benefit of
          the doubt. Under the circumstances,
          it's the least I can do.
          She hangs up. Peyton kisses her. She leans back into his
          arms and closes her eyes blissfully. Reluctantly, she rises
          and slips on her shoes. Peyton watches her admiring everything
          about her. She gracefully lays her legal papers in her
          briefcase and heads for the door. Half way out the door she
          turns to Peyton.

          No thank you. Mr. Strack, I've been

          across something that puzzled me. It's
          a memo from your office to a Mr.
          Claude Bellasarious--it went out over
          your father's signature. It detailed

          being laid into the palms downtown.
          You're not naive; you know
          it's a cost of doing business.
          Ordinarily you don't have to face it.

          Take a look at that model, Julie.
          That was my father's dream. Now it's
          my dream. Acres of riverfront
          reclaimed from decay, thousands of
          jobs created, a building block--a very
          large building block--laid for the
          future. Not such a bad dream, as
          dreams go. And if the price of
          realizing that dream is the occasional
          distasteful chore, well...

          .the point is my father is well

          All right, you're point is well taken.
          But the fact remains that I'm in
          possession of evidence of the
          commission of a crime. You can no
          more ask me to destroy it than I could
          ask you to destroy one of your
          buildings.

                         STRACK
          Let me suggest this. You excuse
          yourself for a few minutes, go to the
          ladies' room, leaving your briefcase
          here. What happens to the memorandum

          toward the limousine but is suddenly hammered by grief.
          Her gait wavers. Racked by sobbing, she falls.
          Tears stream from her eyes as she clutches at the grass.

          106 FADE IN: INT HOSPITAL BURN UNIT- DAY 106

                         BLUE
          The undifferentiated blue resolves itself, as a ripplin
          blue fluid, resembling the acid bath in Peyton's lab. A
          form emerges from it's depths; a completely bandaged head
          breaks the surface of the fluid.

                         107 WIDER 107
          A patient is lifted from a hydro tank, the complex water
          vessel in which burn patients are treated. He lies
          perfectly still, hands and face swathed in gauze; A 20th-
          century mummy. Tubes and wires.poke from his body.
          We hear the steady beeping of a cardiogram.

          108 MASKED BURN NURSES 108
          carefully strap the mummy onto a hydraulically powered,
          multi-axied burn platform. Behind him are other
          bandaged patients, some rotating on burn platforms,
          some still submerged in their hydro-tanks.

          109 THE RESIDENT PHYSICIAN AND FOUR INTERNS
          saunter over to the hydraulic bed where nurses adjust
          the patient's I.V. tubing.

                         RESIDENT
          Here we have a 25-30 year-old-male, no
          I.D., no medical history. Fished the
          guy out of the river with burns
          covering over forty percent of his
          body. His hands and.face were the
          most severe.

                         110

          110 A BURN NURSE
          pushes a button. Motors grinding, the hydraulic platform
          rotates, slowly spinning the mummified man. For a brief
          moment he is upside down.

                         RESIDENT
          Ten years ago, pain from the burns
          would have been intolerable. The guy
          would have spent the rest of his
          screaming. Now we use the Rangeveritz
          technique; quite simply, we sever his
          spino-thalamic nerve...

                         111
          111 ZIIIP! He extends a telescoping steel pointer and to n's bandaged ear.

          .Here. Which, as you know,
          transmits neural-impulses of pain and
          vibratory sense to the brain.

          112,
          112 ZIIIP! He collapses the pointer and returns it to his
          pocket.

                         113

          113 THE HYDRAULIC BURN PLATFORM
          continues its slow rotation with the mummified patient
          now turned sideways.

                         RESIDENT
          No longer receiving impulses of pain,
          you stick him with a pin...

                         

                         

                         

                         

          54.

                         114
          He jabs a sterilized needle deep into the bandaged knee. 114
          Interns gasp. The resident leaves the pin in the knee
          for dramatic effect.

                         RESIDENT
          .and he can't even feel it.
          With a sharp practiced motion, he plucks out the pin.

                         115

          PATIENT'S BANDAGED FACE

                         115
          His eyes still closed. No response.

                         RESIDENT
          Of course, there are serious emotional
          side effects to this operation. When
          the body ceases to feel, when so much
          sensory input is lost, the patient
          becomes alienated. The mind, cut off
          from its regular diet of input, has a
          never-satisfied thirst; alienation
          gives rise to loneliness, anger;
          uncontrolled rage is not uncommon.
          And the rage problem is exacerbated by
          the chemical effect of severing the
          nerve. Now, surges of adrenaline flow
          unchecked through body and brain--
          giving him the strength of dozen men.
          Hence the leather restraints.
          The resident turns and heads for the door. The interns
          follow behind like ducklings.

          But as it rotates into frame and clangs to a halt.
          Between the bandages, the eyes pop open, blue and
          fiercely lucid. It's Peyton. He has heard everything.

          No. No. I've considered it. but the
          police ruled out arson. It burned
          hot. A gas fire. There was an

          Julie, I was quite impressed with yo
          performance in the von Hoffenstein
          negotiations. Outstanding. I believe
          in instinct. I like yours. I want
          you to think about something. No need
          to decide now. But I'd like staff.
          you as a member of my permanent

          You had no right--

          Don't be childish, I had every right.
          He doesn't want to lose you--said
          he'll fight tooth and nail to keep you
          at the firm. Good! I like a good
          scrap! If it's not worth fighting for
          it's not worth having. Just consider
          that I won't be outbid. Think about

          into his confidence.

                         JULIE
          I'll consider it...
          Strack smiles. As he sweeps her around, her eye catches
          something. Her face tightens.

          Mr. Strack, I don't want to alarm you,

          around his mouth, revealing: a terrible maw of black
          and crooked teeth, attached to a lipless jawbone. It
          jerks... and words come out:

          Peyton, I still don't understand. Why
          didn't you come back to see me before
          now?

                         PEYTON
          Well... it's like I told you. The
          burns left some scars and... I was
          ashamed. Afraid. I was afraid that
          you wouldn't want me anymore.

                         JULIE
          Of course I still want you.

                         PEYTON
          But...what if I was...burned. So
          horribly burned, that you couldn't
          stand to look at me. Couldn't stand
          to have me touch you. What then?

                         JULIE
          Well...if that were the case... I
          don't know. But why even ask me that?
          The point is: You're fine. Your
          back. Just like always.
          She smiles. Peyton is filled with the warmth of being
          accepted and wanted once again.

          rewound.
          We are panning past the Walkman, which is wired to
          the computer. The tape stops, then, as programmed,
          plays again.

          We pan past the back of the Darkman's head. The -
          bandages have been removed. Although his face is not
          visible, the singed hairless back of his skull is.
          It is not a pretty sight.

          The Darkman swabs a thick white paste, silvidine burn
          ointment, upon his skeletal fingers.

          That would be just fine for me.
          The Darkman switches off the desk lamp and removes a
          mask from a black lightproof bag. He examines it,
          returns the mask to the bag, then slips it into his
          coat.
          The camera arcs around to see the bottom half of his
          skeletal face.

                         DURANT'S VOICE
          That would be...
          CLICK--the Darkman stops the tape mid-sentence and his
          own hideously charred mandible finishes it:

          came.
          He freezes in the center of a tunnel intersection at the
          sound of FOOTSTEPS. Crunching on gravel; Approaching.
          He fingers the gun's trigger.
          Empty tunnels on all sides.

          Perfect., Handsome. But as for the rest...
          The 3i,a is a hairless skull, covered with random bits of
          scaranf char. Without the benefit of gums or lips, the
          entire 3ength of his teeth are exposed down to the root,
          connec g crookedly to the jaw bone. One ear remains
          intact, the other a burnt hole. Only the rudimentary
          cartile forms the nose. But it is the wild eyeballs
          protruig obscenely from the bone of their sockets, that
          tell tba,story. There, lies madness; a dark river of evil
          rage.

          shines upon the wet walls of the tunnels. Nearby they
          find the gun and one of Trumayne's shoes.

          rises quietly into frame. His suit is still clean. He
          appears remarkably unscathed. He runs a hand through his
          hair, turns and walks slowly along the tracks. That's
          when we see his back: the train has raked off the fabric
          of his suit and pants, exposing bare back and buttocks.
          Somehow maintaining his dignity, Durant picks up the
          smouldering cigar from the tracks. He takes a puff
          and moves off.

          party to answer, he cuts into the painless wound on his
          arm with a surgical instrument, digging for something

                         ATTENDANT
          Sorry buddy. It don't count if you
          ain't standing behind that line.

                         PEYTON
          I was behind the line.

                         ATTENDANT
          Not hardly.

                         PEYTON
          I was standing right here. Next to my
          girlfriend. Now. The pink elephant,
          .if you please!

                         ATTENDANT
          Na way.
          Julie tugs at his sleeve.

                         JULIE
          Peyton, it doesn't matter.
          Peyton is fighting to contain his rage. in clipped
          words, between gasps for breath:

                         PEYTON
          It matters. I won a pink elephant.
          For my girlfriend.

                         JULIE
          Peyton... It's okay...

                         ATTENDANT
          Get lost, buddy.

          People screaming on the Tilt-A-Whirl. Merry-Go-Round
          horses bobbing up and down. Calliope music gets louder
          and louder.

                         339 PEYTONN
          Shaking under the pressure of contained rage, his vein
          bulging, throbbing. Under his-breath:

                         340

                         340

                         PEYTON
          The elephant... Quickly!
          The attendant unwisely pushes two fingers into Peyton's
          chest.
          We rocket into a close shot of the offending digits.
          From of fscreen, we hear the attendant's voice:

                         ATTENDANT
          You heard me, weirdo. Get lost!

                         341

          341 CRACK!
          The counter dissolves into a million fissures, as do the
          stuffed animals on the shelves above.

                         342

                         342 PEYTON'S FACE
          Twitching violently, vein swollen to bursting. The camera
          races into an eyeball to find:

                         343

          Screaming. A skin blister bubbles on his cheek.

          The attendant screams. Peyton screams with him.
          Julie screams as well.

                         349
          349 Peyton reaches for the attendant, lifts him into
          the air, hurls him into another pyramid, which
          collapses.

          350 FUZZY PINK ELEPHANT

                         351 PEYTON
          shoves it at Julie.
          In a voice hoarse with rage:

                         PEYTON
          Take it!

                         352
          352 Another skin blister opens.

          Peyton! No!

                         PEYTON
          'Take it!

                         353
          353 His face is starting to send off wisps of smoke.

                          JULIE
          Please!

                          PEYTON

           TAKE THE FUCKING ELEPHANT!!

                          354
          354 She is looking at him, frozen in horror.

                          355
          355 His face is erupting into boils, which simmer and pop,
          giving off bursts of smoke.

                          356
          356 Peyton stares at her. Rage ebbs. His eyes become
          haunted. Hoarsely:

                         PEYTON
          Forgive me!
          He runs off, the fuzzy pink elephant still clasped,
          forgotten, beneath one arm.

                         357
          357 Julie runs after him.

                          JULIE

          359 EXT. WAREHOUSE - ALLEY 359

          Darkman rushes down the darkened alley, unlocks the
          warehouse door and rushes inside. CAMERA PANS TO:

          361 INT. WAREHOUSE 361

          There's A HORRIBLE RIPPING NOISE. Darkman is
          destroying something, flailing his arms...

                         362 DARKMAN'S EYES 362
          roll toward the noise. He steps back into the shadows.

          363 INT. WAREHOUSE 363

          Julie slips through a warehouse window. She is
          confronted by rack upon rack of clothing, shoes, body
          padding, and wigs. The place looks like the wardrobe
          room of a major studio.

                         JULIE
          Peyton?!
          364 No answer. She cautiously advances. Her eyes fall 364
          upon something that makes her gasp.

          365 THE PINK ELEPHANT 365
          ripped to shreds, it's white stuffing all over the
          place.
          366 He moves forward towards a darkened corner of 366
          the lab.

          367 THE DARKMAN'S LAB
           Beams of light cut through the darkness to reveal it;
           The charred holographic imagers, computers, and the
           rebuilt bio-press all sit atop large wooden crates.

                         375 DARKMAN
          turns his head sharply. Only the upper right corner
          of his face falls into the light. The handsome,
          undamaged portion.

                         JULIE
          Why didn't you tell me? If you loved
          me, why didn't you tell me?

          You had no right--

                         377
          377 Tears stream down Julie's face but she is too upset
          to brush them away. She moves forward.

          Do you think it was the face I cared
          about?! Is that how little you think
          of me?! Why didn't you come to me?

                         JULIE
          I would have helped you.
          She stares into the shadows a long time without

          383 INT. EACK'S APARTMENT - DAY

          Strackâ naked except for a monogrammed bath towel
          wrapd around his thickening midriff, walks across
          the plush bedroom of his penthouse apartment. A
          Mahler symphony plays in the background.
          He bends to hoist a huge inlaid mahogany chest that
          rests on a marble stand, 'then, grunting under the
          strain of the load, he staggers back across the room
          to the king-sized bed.
          With a mighty heave he tips the contents of the chest
          out onto the bed. A torrent of golden ICrugerands.
          They wash over the bed, so many that some spill over
          the sides and clatter to the floor.
          Strack pauses for a beat, staring down at the booty,
          then reaches down to the towel and lets it drop to the
          floor.
          Like a swan he dives.
          He rolls, luxuriating in the feel of gold against
          flesh, laughter bubbling from his lips.
          Gold coins stick to his flushed, sweating flesh, then
          slough off, leaving their imprint.
          Strack makes swimming motions with his arms, laving
          himself with the golden coins--
          A knock at the door.
          Strack freezes.

                         STRACK

          as he reaches down for his pants.

          384 INT. STRACK'S LUXURIOUS STUDY- DAY

          Strack enters, tying his tie.

                         STRACK
          Julie, how sweet of you to come before
          our appointed hour... but I expected--
          you in something a little more formal.
          Didn't Ruth inform you that we have
          tickets to Der Fliedermause tonight?

                         JULIE
          I can't go, Louis. We have to talk.

                         STRACK
          Excellent! I love to talk. Brandy?

                         JULIE
          Thank you, no.

                         STRACK
          I'll have one;_
          As he walks to a bar and pours himself a drink.

                         STRACK
          ...Fair warning--it's Napoleon, and
          it's quite good--

                         JULIE
          Louis, I can't see you anymore.

                         STRACK
          Darling, settle down. Don't be rash.
          As you say, let's talk.

                         CONTINUED

                         JULIE
          You know about Peyton, the man I was

                         SEEING--

                         STRACK

                         OF COURSE--

                         JULIE
          Louis, he's alive. He's back. He was
          burned, horribly, horribly burned--I
          don't understand what happened but I
          know he needs my help.
          Strack is visibly taken aback. He sets the brandy
          down.

                         STRACK
          .Your news has a bittersweet
          flavor... Of course I'm very happy for
          you. If there's anything I can do--
          the finest medical care can be at your
          disposal--burn therapy, recon-
          structive surgery. How badly was
          he... mutilated?
          Julie has broken down. She sits down on Strack's
          sofa, her body wracked with sobs.

                         STRACK
          ... Where is he, Julie?

                         JULIE
          He's living in an abandoned warehouse.
          He's alone... he needs me.
          The phone RINGS. Strack crosses to the desk and picks
          it up.

                         STRACK
          Not now!... Who?... All right, I'll
          take it in the other room.
          He looks up at Julie.

          phone.

                         STRACK
          Yes, Franz... And the closing
          price?...

                         JULIE
          She reaches for a tissue. Next to it is.

          Strack's briefcase sitting on top of his desk.

                         JULIE
          Wipes a tear from her eyes. She moves closer.

                         STRACK (OS)
          I feel sufficiently diversified...
          Franz, it is immaterial to me what the
          market is doing. I want you to buy...

                         JULIE'S POV
          A sheaf of papers stick up above the mouth of the
          briefcase.

                         STRACK'S VOICE
          Yes. The Belasarious memorandum.

                         JULIE
          whirls to face him. He stands looking down over her
          shoulder.

                         STRACK
          .I'm sorry you had to find that,
          dear. Our relationship didn't need
          this further strain.

                         JULIE
          The fire... it wasn't an accident, it
          was you.

                         STRACK
          Not me personally. I have an employee
          who does certain things for me,
          unofficially, off the books. Robert
          doesn't like to pay taxes.

                         JULIE

                         (QUIET)
          And now you'll kill me.
          Strack_ spreads his arms.

                         STRACK
          Hardly. You have nothing on me, my
          dear, and you'd find the extremely
          expensive police department quite
          unsympathetic.
          (A beat).
          Julie. Consider the big picture.

          Julie stares hatefully at him for a beat, then hurries
          out the door.

                         388
          388 Strack moves quickly to the briefcase. He taps
          his fingers idly on the coffee-stained document. Then
          he hits a button on his desk-top intercom.

                         STRACK
          Send Robert in.
          Strack strolls over to the window and stares out at
          his rising city. OS the door clicks open.

          ROBERT G. DURANT
          enters the room.

                         I STRACK
          Robert! I have good news and bad.

                         DURANT
          Custom dictates that you render the
          bad news first.

                         STRACK
          You recall the little difficulty with
          my father and how you resolved it. We
          have a similar situation with Miss
          Hastings. It seems Miss Hastings has
          uncovered some unflattering
          information about us.

                         DURANT
          No problem at all. And the good news?

                         STRACK
          Your wife died. I'm joking, of
          course. No, the good news is that I
          know who's behind our little troubles
          of late. When you retrieved my
          memorandum, you failed to excise the
          good doctor.

          He's alive. I don't like loose ends,
          Robert. Finish it.

                         DURANT
          Okay. Where is he?

           RATTLING up the steel skeleton of a skyscraper,

          P446 stars all around us.

                         STRACK
          I'm glad you survived, Robert. I'd
          hate to see your kids deprived of a
          role-model.

                         DURANT
          They do look up to me.
          The elevator grinds to a halt and the two emerge. The
          lights of the city tremble over the water. A glitter
          and breadth to the landscape, an urban grandeur.

                         STRACK
          Kids need an example, Robert. When I
          was a young man my father made me work
          high steel. That's how he started out,
          and in his view what was good enough
          for him was good enough for me...

          Strack gestures broadly with one arm.

                         STRACK
          ...It was just me and the Indians, no
          one else crazy enough to run around up
          here, against the wind, four-fifty an
          hour. Sure I resented it, but now--
          call me crazy--sometimes I miss it, it
          sharpens your wits. Life on the edge.
          Five inches wide. Two hundred fifty
          feet down. High steel...
          He turns to face Durant. There's a gun in his hand.

                         STRACK
          You don't have any kids, Robert.

                         DURANT
          What are you talking about?

                         STRACK
          Or should I say, Doctor Westlake?

          I'm Durant! Robert G. Durant!

                         STRACK
          Then I'm going to make a mistake.
          There's a long beat. The vein begins to pulse on
          Durant's temple. His eyes grow predatory, evil.

          Where's the girl?
          Strack hops nimbly out onto a narrow girder. He smiles
          back over his shoulder.

                         STRACK
          You want to see the girl? Follow me,
          I'll take you to her...
          Durant/Darkman follows, taking the first few tentative
          steps.

          Pretty much wiped out the security arm
          of Strack Industries. That's okay.
          I'm a good sport...
          He leaps from beam to beam, Durant/Darkman following
          cautiously behind.

                         STRACK

          realize those dreams.

          and I are pretty much the same. We
          should be working together. Both smart

          other people's faces now, since yours
          is so... loathsome.
          He shrugs.

          .See I could never do that. The

          447 Julie stands out on the end of a projecting girder, at
          the furthest extremity of the growing building. Wind
          whips at her hair and dress; she clings pathetically
          to an upright.

                         DURANT/DARKMAN
          Julie!
          Strack laughs.

                         STRACK
          Bring on the strings! Young lovers!
          In peril! Separated by ruthless
          forces, larger than they!--What a
          banal tale. In it, I suppose I play
          the villain. But wait, Julie--which
          of us is the monster here?!
          With this he reaches over to Durant and--SQUISHHHRIPPP!!
          -- tears his face off, tossing it over the edge..

                         448
          448 The face spins down, whooshing end over end, the wind
          flapping it this way and that. On the way down it slaps
          against the occasional girder, momentarily flattening
          out into the recognizable face of Durant, and then peels
          away again. It spins downward towards a forest of
          reinforcing bars that form a pungi pit of steel spikes
          in the open foundation below. Finally it lands--splat--
          pierced through the eye by one of the rusty re-bars.

          gazes at Darkman's ghastly visage for the first time,
          overcome by horror and repulsion. Darkman's vein pulses
          like csa y..
          Strack"s tone is almost admiring:

          STR.ACK
          You truly are one ugly son of a bitch.

          BLAM!
          Strack shoots Darkman in the shoulder, hurling him off
          the bean. The Darkman tumbles, limbs flailing, bellowing
          with rage.

                         THE WORLD
          Spinning upside down--stars, abyss, stars, abyss--

                         GIRDER

          I-beam... barely hanging on, vein pulsing.

          ON THE UPPER GIRDER
          Strack looks down, wind whipping his hair. HIS POV--
          nothing. Darkman has been swallowed up by the night.
          Pocketing his gun, Strack proceeds toward Julie.

                         JULIE
          recoils as Strack stops in front of her. He touches her
          hair.

          With that Strack Sr. rips off his own face, exposing
          the enraged visage of Darkman... Strack reaches for
          his gun.

                         451

          451 BAM!
          Darkman mashes his face and the gun flies out of his
          hand into the darkness below.

                         OF
          battle it out on the narrow girder, hundreds of feet
          sure death on either side of them.

          BAM! BAM! BAM!
          Savage punches send Strack reeling--BAM!--he falls onto
          the girder... nearby are a bunch of tools... Strack
          crawls toward them.

          inching painfully toward the rivet gun.

                         DARKMAN
          pummelling, lost in the act of his final revenge. He
          steps back to give a final blow...
          .and slips on some loose rivets, flailing for balance.

                         STRACK
          lunges. CLANG! Darkman slams into a vertical bar.

          ZMMMMMM! Z !

          452 The rivet gun shoots a bolt through Darkman's wrist,
          then the other wrist--pinning him to the I-beam...

          hot soup of rage.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          454 CRACK!
          Gigantic fissures appear on all the girders... we spin
          into Darkman's eyeball to find--

          455 THE ULTIMATE RAGE MONTAGE 455
          Nightmarish flashes of laughing faces jeering into the
          camera; Julie and Strack kissing, naked.
          456 Strack's face bobs, attached now to the body of the 456
          dunking bird, his nose nearing the ignition of a huge
          lighter. As contact is made the lighter explodes in a
          shower of gold Krugerands.
          457 The gold coins fall away to reveal Peyton's unscathed 457
          head, bobbing on a freakish and deformed doll's body.
          Atop a circus platform, he does an angry jig. He wears
          a funny little hat.
          458 Peyton's face liquefies and flows off his head to reveal- 458
          the face of the Darkman.
          459 A drop of liquid Peyton falls upon... A cube of ice. It 459
          bursts into flames.
          460 The camera races back from Darkman's eye.. his vein 460
          pulsing madly.

           insensitive to pain, he pulls, every sinew concentrated
           on the task. GGGGGGGG ! A horrible grating
           sounds as the first rivet rips through steel... One hand
           is freed. GGGGGGG ! .The other is freed.

          flail impotently.

          Darkman hurls him up, up into the air.
          463 Strack rises helpless, flailing his limbs... then begins 463
          to fall, yards away from the girder.
          464 He spins, end over end, to--PPHHHHFFFTHHMP!--be impaled 464

          her.

          I don't care how you look, Peyton! I.
          love you. The burns don't matter.
          There's a long pause. Then Darkman turns the twisted
          remains of. his face toward her. Julie sees them in
          close-up.
          CLAMP! The elevator jars to a halt on street level.

          overcomes her repulsion and puts her hand in his.

                         DARKMAN
          It disgusts you.

                         JULIE
          No.
          Darkman stares at her a long time, anguished, torn.

                         FINALLY:

                         DARKMAN
          This hand... it used to caress you.

          things.

          I can live with it now, but I don't
          think anyone else can.

          I want it back. The two of us--the way
          it was...
          Darkman's voice breaks:

          What we had--our life together--it
          belonged in the light of day.
          He disappears into the darkness.

                         JULIE
          Peyton!
          Darkman's voice floats back as he stalks away:

                         DARKMAN
          Peyton is gone...
          466 He heads into the shadows. At the edge of the darkness 466
          he pulls a mask from his coat and disappears behind a
          construction trailer. A pedestrian reappears on the other
          side.
          Julie knows it's!Darkman. She chases after him but he
          slips into the pedestrian traffic.
          The camera hurries down the street with Julie as she
          desperately searches for him, turning people around,
          staring at their faces... It begins to snow.

                         JULIE
          Peyton!
          She rushes from pedestrian to pedestrian, staring into
          alien faces in search of the man she loves.

          AS WE ROLL END CREDITS
          The camera pulls back into the crowd of pedestrians,
          any one of who could be Darkman... We continue to pull
          back, down avenues and side-streets, byways, courtyards,
          wherever the crowd spills, into an alley... As a street-
          person shuffles into view:

          467 A MUSCULAR HAND 467
          snaps open a switch-blade. A second set of arms grabs
          the street person and spins him around, revealing--

          Wild, half-mad eyes gleam wickedly from boney sockets.
          Mandibles yank back and, through a lipless smile, he

          FADE IN:

          INT. BACHELOR APARTMENT BEDROOM - NIGHT

          A modest city bedroom. Suitcases and half-unpacked boxes
          sit on one side of the room. Sc_-orLe's -moving in.
          In his bathrobe, PHIL FOSTER, a good looking guy in his
          mid-20's, hums to himself as he looks through stacks of
          WEDDING PICTURES organized all over the bed. Just as he
          finishes up a pile and starts another, beautiful CLARA
          FOSTER, in a bathrobe too, jumps across his lap.

                         PHIL
          Hey, hey! Careful Clara! You were the
          one who told me not to mess up the
          precious picture piles!
          he gives him a long, slow kiss.

          PHIL (CONT ' D )
          Minty fresh.

                         CLARA
          That was nice.

                         PHIL
          It was nice.

                         CLARA
          Hey from now on when you change the
          toilet paper, could you just make sure it
          is out?

                         PHIL

                         (CHUCKLES)
          Wow! She moves in and the honeymoon's
          over!

                         CLARA
          Oh, believe me, we're just getting
          started, Phil.

                         PHIL
          (reaches into picture pile)
          Look at this one of your Mom with me. I
          mean that woman can't contain her 'Love!

          ON the wedding picture: RUTH, Clara's,mother, stands
          stiffly next to Phil with an expression like she's ankle
          deep in a manure bin.

                         CLARA

                         (LAUGHS)
          She just takes a while to warm up. You
          guys are gonna be best buddies. You
          picked a favorite of us yet?  

                         

          2.
          Phil finds the picture, handing it to Clara.

                         CLARA (CONT'D)
          That's exactly the one I picked!

          Clara leans the photo on the night stand next to the bed.
          It's a PORTRAIT OF THEM FROM THEIR WEDDING. They look
          joyous, excited. A young couple with the world in front
          of them.

                         PHIL
          Man, I wish I was them.
          Phil kisses the back of Clara's neck, but her smile fades
          as she stares at the picture. He notices.

                         PHIL (CONT'D)

                         WHAT IS

                         CLARA
          I just... when I was growing up my Mom
          and Dad had a picture just like this.
          Now they can't even acknowledge each
          other.
          Phil sympathetically gives her a squeeze.

                         CLARA (CONT'D)
          Let's always remember to have some time
          that's just for the two of us. No matter
          what else comes up in our lives - if it's
          work or friends or when we have kids-

                         PHIL
          We're having kids? With an "S"?

                         (CLARA LAUGHS)
          OK fine. But I promise you it's never
          gonna happen to us.

                         CLARA
          Yeah, we'll see if you'll be saying that
          when I'm long in the tooth.

                         PHIL
          You'll be even hotter long toothed.
          Right now to be honest Clara they're a
          little stumpy.

                         CZ

                         (GIGGLES
          Oh really?
          As Phil climbs on top and kisses her, he reaches over and
          turns off the light. Suddenly, we hear the piles of
          pictures SLIDE OFF THE BED and hit the ground. Beat.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         CLARA (CONT'D)
          Phil. Tell me it wasn't the pictures.

                         PHIL
          wasn't the pictures.

                         CLARA
          You know how long that took?

                         PHIL
          We'll fix the picture piles, Clara.
          We've got all the time in the world.
          From now on everything's gonna be just
          about us.
          Suddenly, a YOUNG VOICE breaks through the darkness.

          OLLIE (V.0.)

          MOM!
          The Talking Head's "Once in a Lifetime" kicks

          INT. PHIL AND CLARA'S BEDROOM 7 YEARS LATER - MORNING

          Next to the framed wedding picture of Phil and Clara, an
          ALARM CLOCK on a side table reads 6:45 am.

                          E

          OLLIE (O.S.)
          Mo-om!
          It's SEVEN YEARS LATER as Phil and Clara stir .-id groan
          in bed. Clara has the comforter WRAPPED ALL HER
          while Phil lies uncovered next to her in his boxers and a
          T-shirt. Without saying a word, they rise out of each
          side of their beds and sleepily march in opposite
          directions across their suburban bedroom- Clara down the
          hall and Phil to the bathroom.

          OLLIE (O.S.) (CONT'D)
          Mom! Mom! Mom!

                         CLARA
          I'm coming, Ollie!

          INT. OLLIE'S ROOM - A LITTLE LATER

          As the Talking Heads song continues, Clara makes Ollie's
          bed while OLLIE, 5, plays with LEGOs on the floor. Phil
          showered and dressed in a suit, walks quickly past the
          doorway carrying a briefcase, his eyes glued to a stack
          of PAPERS in his hand.

                         CLARA
          Uh Phil?

                         0

                         

                         

                         

                         
          Phil doubles back, still looking at the papers.

                         PHIL
          Yep?

                         CLARA
          I need to switch. I've got an open
          house.
          Phil obviously doesn't want to be bothered right now, but
          contains it.

                         PHIL
          Really?

                         CLARA
          Yeah. Really.
          As Clara walks quickly past him, Phil claps his hands
          together.

                         PHIL
          OK, so I say today we go for the slacker
          look - cool yet approachable.

                         OLLIE
          Yeah, well Mom says that.
          Ollie points to a PREPPIE OUTFIT laid out on a chair.

                         PHIL
          Oh. Well... that's cool too!

          INT. PHIL AND CLARA'S BEDROOM/BATHROOM - SAME

          The Talking Heads song continues as Clara walks quickly
          through the bedroom. She lets out a YELP as her shin
          SMASHES INTO PHIL'S DRESSER DRAWER - he's left them open.
          She kicks them closed and limps to the bathroom, then
          stops in the doorway. WATER covers the floor. Grabbing
          a towel, she tosses it down and shimmies to the mirror.
          As she picks up her toothbrush, she notices it's WET as
          well.

                         CLARA
          Ech. Mine.
          She re-rolls the toothpaste from the bottom up and starts
          brushing when she sees the sink - a Jackson Pollock of
          razor hairs and bits of toothpaste.
          Disgusted, Clara reaches for the Kleenex box, only to
          discover it's EMPTY. She tosses the box in the trash and
          shimmies on the towel to get some toilet paper.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         5
          Seeing the roll, she sighs as she takes it out of the
          holder, turns it around and puts it back so it ROLLS OUT.
          As the CREDITS END, the Talking Heads song fad

          NT. KITCHEN
          Phil, pen in hand, is focused again on his papers as
          Ollie, now in the preppie outfit, watches him and waits
          at the table. Phil finally notices.

                         PHIL
          What?

                         OLLIE
          Breakfast?

                         PHIL

                         (HOPPING UP)
          Oh. Yeah, sorry. Your Dad's a boob
          today. What's it gonna be?
          Ollie peers down the hallway to see if there's any sign
          of his tom.

                         OLLIE
          How about... some Captain Crunch?
          Phil gets an idea and writes zickly.

                         PHIL

                         (DISTRACTED)

                         OL
          Captain Crunch?The cereal?

                         PHIL
          Uh... yeah. Sure.
          Phil grabs the Captain Crunch cereal box out
          cupboard and starts toward the table when Clara, dressed
          in a suit, comes into the room and spots it.

                         CLARA
          Ah ah ah... what's that Ollie? You had a
          bowl yesterday.

                         IE
          But Dad already said yeah sure.
          Clara glances at Phil.

                         PHIL (CONT'D)
          Yeah, sure! You know it's only one bowl

                         A DAY-

                         CLARA

                         (CORRECTING HIM)
          A week.

                         PHIL
          One bowl a day a week.
          Clara, eyebrows raised, eyes the Captain Crunch already
          in Phil's hand. Phil shakes the carton at Ollie.

                         PHIL (CONT'D)
          This is not for you today!

                         CLARA

                         (CHUCKLES)
          Yeah right.

                         PHIL

                         (SHRUGS)
          Worth a try.

                         CLARA
          Did you get his lunch together?

                         PHIL
          Oh. Whoops.

                         CLARA

                         (SIGHS)
          You just get his breakfast and I'll do
          it.
          As Phil takes out some Special K and pours milk for Ollie
          and a glass for himself, he finishes the carton. Peeking
          back over his shoulder, he sees Clara's dialing with the
          phone to her ear as she readies Ollie's lunch. He
          stealthily pours the TINIEST BIT of milk back, quickly
          returning the carton to the fridge.

                         CLARA (CONT'D)

                         (INTO PHONE)
          Hey Jane? I'm getting a late start but
          I'll be there as soon as I can.

                         PHIL
          Sorry I dropped the ball. It's this
          Quarterly Report to Mr. Rivers today.
          You know how he freaks me out with all of
          his mixed animal metaphors that I don't

                         UNDERSTAND-

                         CLARA
          (focusing on Ollie's lunch)
          Ollie, do you want a banana?

                         PHIL
          Did you hear me?

                         CLARA
          (not looking at him)
          Uh huh. He freaks you out with his mixed
          animal metaphors that you don't
          understand. Banana Ollie?

                         PHIL

                         (BEAT)
          So I should probably get going. With the
          highway construction it takes forever to
          get downtown these days.

                         CLARA
          OK. Have a good day.
          Phil kisses her on the cheek and Clara absently wipes it
          off. He looks at her strangely. Noticing, Clara quickly
          kisses Phil on the cheek.

          CLL. -- (CONT ' D )
          Sorry. Your mouthy was still ail milky.

                         PHIL
          Sorry for the milky mouth.
          He heads out. With a sigh, Clara spots Phil's left his 1ï¿½1
          dirty glass on the counter. She cleans it in the sink,
          then gets the carton out of the fridge to put some milk
          in her own coffee. A DRIBBLE comes out. Shaking her
          head, she tosses the carton in the trash.

          EXT. FRONT OF FOSTER' S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

          As Phil exits the front door and heads to the carport
          next to the house, his overly cheery neighbor CHAZ picks
          a newspaper off his lawn.

          CHAZ (O.S.)
          Well, well! We're up bright and early,
          aren't we!

                         PHIL
          Yes we are!
          (under his breath)
          ike you say to me every morning.
          Reaching the carport, Phil scoots between his car and
          Clara's. He tries to open his driver's door, but Clara'
          car is parked TOO CLOSE and the door only opens a few
          inches. He tries to SQ'L'-Z- IN, but ends up GETTING
          STUCK halfway.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         8

                         PHIL (CONT'D)

          OW! OW! OW!
          Dislodging himself, Phil sidesteps between the cars and
          peers around the other side of Clara's. TONS of room.
          Shaking his head, Phil crosses to his car's passenger
          side. OPEN HOUSE BANNERS piled in the garage block the
          front passenger door. Frustrated, Phil hops in the rear
          and grunts as he climbs diagonally over to the driver's
          seat.

          HONKING.

          EXT. EISENHOWER HIGHWAY - A LITTLE LATER

          The Eisenhower Highway is a parking lot as ROAD
          CONSTRUCTION blocks 3 out of 4 lanes. In the middle of
          it, Phil checks his watch, frustrated. Peering out his
          window, he looks at a billboard of a smiling older man in
          slick suit and construction hat. The sign reads MAYOR

          DIGGS APPRECIATES YOUR PATIENCE WHILE WE BUILD OUR
          HIGHWAY TO THE FUTURE! Phil scowls, then checks his
          watch.

          EXT. STREET


                         E
          Clara and JANE, another sharply dressed realtor in her
          30's, walk down the street putting up OPEN HOUSE ARROW
          SIGNS on the sidewalk.

                         JANE
          His name's Juan and he's some kind of
          Spanish, I think. He knows all these
          exclusive, underground places downtown.
          It's so exciting. And in bed...

                         (WHISPERS)
          I never knew I could still get my leg
          back that far.

                         CLARA
          Too much information, Jane.

          INT. OPEN HOUSE

          Clara and Jane speak loudly to each other as they each
          move quickly around different parts of the vacant home,
          cleaning and inspecting.
          The divorce was the best thing that ever
          happened to me. Seriously. You know
          that great nervous feeling in your
          stomach? Where you don't know what's
          going to happen next?

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         9
          On her way down the hall, Clara spots a mark up ahead on
          the wall. She reaches into her large purse and pulls out
          a mini-409 mister and a rag. With the aim of a
          SHARPSHOOTER, she sprays ahead, wiping the mark as she
          passes.

          JANE (O.S.) (CONT'D)
          With Larry, I lost that. Everything had
          just become routine, you know? Boring.
          Jane's words hit Clara close to home. Passing on through
          the kitchen, Clara notices that the REFRIGERATOR makes a
          weird, loud buzzing noise.

                         JANE (CONT'D)
          But now, all of a sudden I'm alive again!

                         CLARA
          Good for you, Jane.
          Clara takes out her frustration on the ridge, kicki
          the side and silencing it.

                         CLARA (CONT'D)
          Good for you.

          T. FRONT HALLWAY - A LITTLE L
           Clara and Jane sit on the floor, together
          prospectuses.

                         JANE
          There's this g---eat restaurant downtown we
          went to the ot__ar night that you guys
          would love. _"st amazing view of the
          city. You guys should check it out on
          your next date night.

                         CLARA
          (focusing on stapling)
          Yeah, well, maybe. We don't really have
          those that much anymore.

                         JANE
          't have date nights:

                         CLARA
          (shrugs),
          You know, we're pretty tired all the time
          between work and Ollie. And some of the
          shows on TV these days are really great.
          Ah. I see.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          10.

                         1Ï¿½1
          They staple in silence for a second. Jane and Clara look
          at each other.

                         CLAM
          I know that's really lame.

                         JANE
          So it's Phil?

                         CLARA

                         (SIGHS)
          No, it's not Phil. It's the both of us.
          I don't know. It just... happened.

                         JANE
          So why don't you change it? All you have
          to do is stir things up and have one
          great, sexy, exciting night again.

                         CLARA
          I guess. Maybe.

                         JANE
          Not maybe. Tonight.

                         CLARA
          Nah. Tonight's no good.

                         Â¢

                         JANE
          Why not? Seriously think about it.
          What's really gonna be more important
          tonight than that?
          Clara takes this in. Jane's right.

          INT. CHICAGO MERCANTILE EXCHANGE

          Checking his watch, Phil shakes his head as he rushes
          through the large bullpen of the Chicago Mercantile
          Exchange. In the pits all around him, BUYERS and SELLERS
          scream out their orders.

          INT. MR. RIVERS' OFFICE

          In a dark wood office with STUFFED AR 'ï¿½ L HEADS lining
          the walls, a young, smartly dressed man in his 20's,
          GEORGE, quietly goes through a binder with MR. RIVERS,
          60, at the older man's desk. As Phil bursts in they both
          look over.

                         PHIL
          I'm sorry I'm late. The construction on
          the highways is insane these days!

                         

                         

                         

                         

          MR. RIVERS
          Don't worry about it, Phil. It's fine.
          Catch your breath.
          George gives Mr. Rivers an ornate, pal-sy handshake, then
          heads out with the binder, nodding at Phil. Phil nods
          back warily, then takes out his binder, ready to launch
          into his report.

          MR. RIVERS (CONT'D)
          Uh, Phil. Listen, before we start...
          I've been thinking... this next quarter
          we need to venture into open tundra.
          Start really ripping the meat.

                         PHIL
          (beat, trying to decipher)
          Uh. OK. You mean... take the fund in a
          more high risk direction?

          MR.
          Yeah. That's wha: I - -aid.
          Sure. OK, fine. I can work up some
          higher risk options and come back
          tomorrow.

                         Â¢

          MR. RIVERS

                         (CLEARS THROAT)
          OK. The thing is Phil, tomorrow I want
          George to give me his thoughts on where
          we need to be hunting too.

                         PHIL
          Oh.

          MR. RIVERS
          s nothing personal.

                         (BEAT)
          So let me get this straight. You're
          telling me that tomorrow I'm going to
          have to interview for the job I already
          have? Against George?

          MR. RIVERS
          I wouldn't put it like that. I Just need
          our pack leader to be more like... like a
          momma kangaroo. Ya get me?

                         PHIL
          Kinda.

                         (BEAT)
          Actually, no. Not really at all.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          12.

          MR. RIVERS
          The blind baby kangaroo opens its mouth
          and knows its momma's teat is just always
          there, ready to suckle. But at the same
          time, momma kangaroo's still a wild,
          dangerous creature.

                         PHIL
          Sorry. Still not totally getting you.

          MR. RIVERS
          I've had a wife and a family. Three of
          them. It's hard to stay the fastest
          cheetah when you need to mind the pack,
          Phil. George lives in the city, doesn't
          have a family to worry about. He can rip
          the meat.

                         PHIL
          Listen, Mr. Rivers. I don't need to...
          I was ripping big bloody hunks of meat
          and eating them like tartare when George
          was still... in the jungle!

          MR. RIVERS

                         (BEAT)
          What does that mean?

                         PHIL
          I can't be demoted, Mr. Rivers. I just
          can't.

          MR. RIVERS
          Listen, nothing's set. It's just I gotta
          say that lately your leadership on this
          has felt a little... well... tame.

                         PHIL

                         (GETTING UP)
          That's all you needed to say, Mr. Rivers!
          I'll see you tomorrow.
          Determined, Phil marches out of Mr. River's office.

                         SCHOOL
          Clara talks on her cellphone as she picks up Ollie from
          school.

                         CLARA
           So it's OK if we drop him off at 7? Our
          reservation's at 7:45.
          She passes another MOTHER desperately searching for a
          Kleenex for her BOY with snot dripping from his nose.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          13.
          Without breaking stride, Clara reaches into her purse and
          hands the grateful mother a tissue, then takes out a mini-
          bottle of Purell and cleans her hands.

                         CLARA (CONT'D)

                         (INTO PHONE)
          Thanks Mom. I really appreciate it.

          FEMALE VOICE (O.S.)
          Mrs. Foster?
          Clara turns to see Ollie's teacher, the tight buttoned
          MRS. CARDIGAN, 45, walking toward her in the parking lot.

                         CLARA
          Oh, that's Ollie's teacher. I'll see you
          later.
          Clara hangs up her phone and greets Mrs. Cardigan with a
          warm smile.

                         CLARA (CONT'D)
          I've been meaning to tell you that you
          can just call me Clara, Mrs. Cardigan.

          MRS. CARDIGAN
          I'd prefer Mrs. Foster. Boundaries
          matter.

                         CLARA 1Ï¿½1

          OK...

          MRS. CARDIGAN
          Can we speak a moment? Alone?

                         CLARA
          Sure, sure. Ollie, go to the car.
          As Ollie does, Clara turns back to Mrs. Cardigan.

                         CLARA (CONT'D)
          Is everything OK?

          MRS. CARDIGAN
          Well, I'm afraid not. Oliver's been
          antagonizing the girls in the class a
          great deal lately. Especially Jenny
          Diggs.

                         CLARA
          Really? Oh no. Why do you think that's
          happening?

          MRS. CARDIGAN
          I'm going to leave that to you and your
          nd to figure out. But beyond that,
          ,i: overall attitude these days is
          just... sub par. E

          14.

          MRS. CARDIGAN (CONT'D)
          His penmanship is sloppy. He lacks
          motivation and tries to just "get by" o
          assignments. You know, this is a very
          competitive school, Mrs. Foster. In my
          opinion, maybe you should consider
          whether this is really the right
          environment for him.

                         CLARA
          (beat, stunned)
          Uh... wow. OK.
          Mrs. Cardigan starts away. Clara climbs into the car,
          watching Mrs. Cardigan.

                         CLARA (CONT'D)
          (under her breath)
          Wow. What a bitch.

                         OLLIE
          Did you just call Mrs. Cardigan a bitch?

                         CLARA
          (remembering Ollie's in the

                         BACK)
          No.

                         OL LIE
          Yeah you did.

                         Â¢

                         CLARA
          I didn't. I really didn't.
          Clara quickly pulls out.

          CAR PORT - LATER
          Phil SQUEEZES out of his drivers seat with folders full
          of RESEARCH. As he walks toward the house he spots the
          TONS of room on the other side of Clara's car and shakes
          his head.

                         PHIL
          Unbelievable!

          INT. OLLIE'S BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER

          Still carrying his research, Phil peeks in on Ollie, who
          packs a suitcase.

                         PHIL
          Hey buddy. Finally moving out? I gotta
          tell you it's about time.

          On a school night? Why?

          Clara?

          INT. PHIL AND CLARA'S BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER

          Phil marches into the bedroom.

          Clara? Cl-
          He stops in the doorway as he spots her. Made up in an
          evening dress in front of a full length mirror, Clara
          looks STUNNING as she finishes putting an earring on.

                         PHIL (CONT'D)
          Wow. Wow.
          Clara tns and smiles.

                          IS

                         CLARA
          I thought I could take you out to
          celebrate you finally getting that report
          in. A romantic dinner downtown like the
          old days, and teen...
          (raises :,er eyebrows)
           Ollie's going to stay at Mom's so we have
           the house all to ourselves. All night.

                         PHIL
          Wow... It sounds... great.

                         CLARA
          Great!
          She turns back and continues getting ready.

                         PHIL
          It's just... is there any chance we coul
          take a rain check?

                         CLARA

                         (TURNS)
          A "rain check"?

                         PHIL
          Yeah. Unfortunately I really need to do
          a bit of work tonight. E

                         

                         

                         

                         

          16.

                         CLARA
          I thought all the cramming was for this
          report today. Did something go wrong?

                         PHIL

                         (BEAT)
          Uh, no. Nothing like that. I just
          decided I could play with it a little
          more. Make it a little better.
          Clara takes him in a moment.

                         CLARA
          Oh. OK.
          Controlling herself, Clara starts putting her jewelry
          back in the case.

                         PHIL
          Listen, I'm sorry...

                         CLARA
          You don't need to apologize, Phil.

                         PHIL
          Listen, if I had more warning-

                         E C
          Then something else would have come up.
          You know it. That's the thing, Phil. We
          used to do things on the spur of the
          moment all the time. Even after Ollie
          was born. Now we never do anything
          together.
          They stare at each other, then Phil breaks

                         PHIL
          Listen... any other night.

                         CLARA
          OK. Maybe another time. Let me just get
          out of this and call my Mom then.
          As Clara heads into the closet, Phil looks after her,
          feeling terrible. About to leave, he notices that around
          the room, Clara's SET UP CANDLES in anticipation of their
          romantic night. He looks down again at the papers in his
          hand and sucks in, conflicted.

          INT. CLOSET - MOMENTS LATER

          As Clara starts to take her dress off, Phil scoots past
          her, humming to himself. She looks over to see him
          choosing a tie and jacket from his side. Clara looks
          him, still unsure.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          17.

                         PHIL
          That dress really wasn't playing fair,
          Clara.
          With a smile, Clara watches Phil tie his tie.

                         PHIL (CONT'D)
          Well get a move on, girl!
          She zips her dress back up.

          A DOORBELL RINGS.

          INT. RUTH'S FRONT DOOR

          RUTH, Clara's mother, opens her front door and brightens.

                         RUTH
          (to Clara and Ollie)
          Hey sweeties.

                         (SUDDENLY COLD)
          Phil.

          Ruth.

                         RUTH
          Nana rented us a special treat tonight
          before bed, Ollie! The Wizard of Oz!

          PHIL,
          Wow. Wizard of Oz. Don't you think
          that's a little scary for a 5 year old?

                         RUTH
          (not looking at him)
          No, Phil, I don't.

                         PHIL
          OK... not so sure about that.

                         RUTH

                         PHIL
          Clara? What do you think?

                         RUTH
          (putting her pressure on)
          Yeah, Clara. What do you think?

          EXT. FRONT OF HOUSE

          Phil's flustered as he and Clara head out the door
          towards Phil's car.

                         CLARA
          I'm sorry, Phil. I just felt like she's
          doing us a favor tonight.

                         PHIL
          fine. Fine.
          oust as they climb into the car, Clara stops.

                         CLARA
          You know, I should pee before we go.

                         PHIL

                         (BEAT)
          OK. Sure.
          As Clara runs back to Ruth's house, Phil plops down in
          the driver's seat.

                         PHIL (CONT'D)
          I'll just wait in the car as you go back
          E inside to pee. Again.

          EXT. EISENHOWER PARKWAY - SUNSET

          As the sun sets, Phil and Clara sit in BUMPER TO BUMPER
          TRAFFIC. It extends for MILES toward the center of the
          city.

          CAR - S
          Phil turns on the air conditioner and adjusts the vents.

                         PHIL
          You gotta almost feel sorry for Mayor
          Diggs. Tries to widen all the highways
          to get reelected, but all everyone's
          going to remember when it's time to vote
          is all this mess.

                         CLARA
          You're hot?

                         PHIL
          Yeah. That's why I turned on the air.

          Clara shuts the passenger side vents which causes AIR to
          GUST out of Phil's vents, into his face. He glances at
          Clara, oblivious, then reaches over and turns down the
          air.

                         CLARA (CONT'D)
          You know, Mrs. Cardigan told me today
          that Ollie's been antagonizing his
          daughter.

                         PHIL
          Antagonizing? How does a five year old
          "antagonize?" I'm sure she wouldn't have
          mentioned it if it wasn't "the Mayor's
          daughter."

                         CL
          She also went on that Ollie's
          penmanship's sloppy and he's not
          motivated enough.

          He looks over to see that Clara looks out of the wiF n,,
          not responding - a response in itself. He sucks in.

                         PHIL (CONT'D)
          I think he's fine.

                         CLARA
          She actually had the gall to suggest we
          should think about sending him somewhere
          else.

                         PHIL
          Maybe she's right if the school has that
          kind of attitude.
          Clara's about to object bit stops herself and takes a
          breath, playing affection-.-ely with the back of Phil's
          hair.

                         CL RA
          You know what? All we ever end up
          talking about is Ollie or work. Let's

          Right now? Traffic.

                         CLARA
          Oh. Well, I heard this unbelievable
          story from Jane today.

                         PHIL
          Yeah?

                         CLARA
          She has this old classmate who went into
          labor with her second child the other
          day. She's totally healthy and
          everything's normal with the pregnancy.
          So she goes into labor and walks into the
          emergency room, and the second the nurses
          and attendants see her come in, they go
          into a panic and start yelling A,LA! ATMiA!

          AMA!

                         PHIL
          What's AMA?

                         CLARA

          That's unbelievable!

          Beat. Clara looks out the window.

                         CLARA (CONT'D)
          The funny thing is she's my age,
          actually.
          Suddenly, Phil's smile fades as he realizes the possible
          ulterior motive.

                         PHIL
          Huh.

          Clara picks up on his change and figures out what he's
          thinking. A bit flustered, she opens her vents again.
          Phil looks over at her.

                         PHIL (CONIT'B)
          I thought you were cold.

                         CLARA
          I was, but then you turned it down and I
          got hot.

                         PHIL
          But I turned it down because... you see
          when you open and close your vents it
          makes my... never mind.
          Phil reaches over and turns up the air again. Tapping
          his fingers on the wheel with a sigh, he gets fed up,
          suddenly veering the car to the shoulder and speeding
          toward the exit.

                         CL AAA
          What are you doing?

                         PHIL
          I'm just gonna take a shortcut.

                         CLARA
          Phil, please don't. You think they're
          shortcuts but they always take longer.
          And we're already-

                         PHIL
          Clara, please just trust me, OK
          They zoom ahead for a moment in silence. Frustrated,
          Clara shuts her vents, once again sending a POWERFUL GUST
          OF COLD AIR onto Phil's face. Biting his tongue, he just
          leaves it blowing on him as they drive.

          INT. THE SIGNATURE ROOM

          Phil and Clara rush off the elevator and enter the
          Signature Restaurant on the 95t Flcor of the John
          Hancock Center, with dramatic s- Lng views over
          skyline of downtown Chicago and Lake Michigan.

          faster. I promise!

          What?

                         PHIL
          Nothing.
          As Clara hurries off, Phil, shaking his head, makes his
          way through the crowds to the SUPERMODEL HOSTESS.

          Good evening. Welcome to the Signature

          Foster... Oh, I'm sorry. We just had
          give away your table.

                         PHIL
          You gave away our table? We're just ten
          minutes late!

          OK. But don't you guys have, like, some
          kind of grace period or something?

                         SUPERMODEL HOSTESS
          have an eight minute grace period.

                         PHIL
          You have an eight minute grace period?
          How did you come up with an eight minute
          grace period?

          I just work here,

                         PHIL
          So what if someone's 9 minutes late?

                         SUPERMODEL HOSTESS
          We're allowed to give a two minute grace
          on the grace.

          OK. Which adds up to ten minutes! We're
          11 minutes late. That's just one minute
          later than the grace on the grace.

                         SUPERMODEL HOSTESS
          I'm sorry sir, but management
          specifically said no grace on the grace
          on the grace. After ten minutes, we send
          a host around calling your name and if
          there's no answer, we give the table
          away. Sorry.

                         PHIL
          So how long's the wait for another table?

          down a LONG LIST OF WRITE-IN NAMES. As she turns to the
          next page...

                         PHIL
          Oh boy.

          INT. WOMEN'S BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS

          Even the bathroom has sweeping views of Chicago. As
          Clara leaves a bathroom stall, she notices a NERVOUS
          YOUNG WOMAN washing her face over and over.
          A knock and a SLICK LOOKING MAN quickly peeks his head in
          the Women's room.

          SLICK LOOKING MAN
          We've gotta leave now.

                         (SPOTTING CLARA)
          Whoops. Sorry.

                         CLARA
          It's OK.
          The Nervous Woman quickly leaves the bathroom with the
          Man. Clara looks after them a second, then washes her
          hands.

          INT. BAR - MOMENTS LATER

           Clara finds Phil at the bar, downing handfuls of peanuts.

                          CLARA
          How lc= -until they seat us?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          24.

                         PHIL
          Two hours. They gave away our
          reservation. Peanut?

                         CLARA
          What?!? Did you tell them that we hit
          traffic?

                         PHIL
          They wouldn't care, Clara. If they call
          your name at the bar and you don't
          answer, they give your table away. So
          how about a nut?
          A YOUNG HOST (not the Hostess) mills around the bar.

                         YOUNG HOST

          GALE PARTY?
          Clara sighs, frustrated.

                         CLARA
          I mean, did you try something like
          telling her it was our anniversary, or my
          birthday, or slipping her some money-

                         PHIL
          Oh, I see. Lying and graft were the
          answer!
          Clara shakes her head, then notices the YOUNG HOST
          searching for the party and starts focusing on him
          instead of Phil as she thinks.

                         YOUNG HOST

          GALE PARTY?

                         PHIL
          I'm sure if you had been there instead of
          peeing again you would have done it
          better.

                         YOUNG HOST

          GALE PARTY?

                         CLARA

                         (WATCHING HOST)

                         PHIL
          You're not even listening to me, are you?

                         CLARA
          (repeats, still watching)
          Yeah I am. You're sure if I had been
          there instead of peeing again I would
          have done it better.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         25
          Clara, Just because you can repeat the
          words I say doesn't mean you're-

                         YOUNG HOST

          LAST CALL! GALE-

                         CLARA
          Sorry! We're right here!

                         PHIL
          Wait. What are you doing?

                         CLARA
          Shhh!
          The Young Host approaches.

                         YOUNG HOST
          Gale party of three?

                         CLARA
          The third's running a little
          going to start without them.

                         YOUNG HOST
          eat. Follow me.
          Phil shoots Clara a look, but she ignores it. He falls
          into line after her as she follows the Young Host to th
          restaurant.

          INT. ANOTHER PART OF THE SIGNATURE ROOM - MOMENTS LA

          hields his face as they pass the Supermodel Hos
          at the Greeting Station. The Young Host leads them
          secluded table right by the windows - THE BEST TABLE

          THE RESTAURANT.

                         YOUNG HOST
          (handing them menus)
          Enjoy your dinner.
          The Young, Host leaves.

                         CLARA
          See? Was that so hard to do, Phil?
          bad to be the Gales, eh?
          Clara opens her menu as looks nervously around the
          restaurant.

                         CLARA (CONT'B)
          Look Phil! It's white truffle season!
          I'm totally doing it!

                         PHIL
          We can't do this, Clara.

                         CLARA
          I'm taking you out.

                         PHIL
          Not the truffles.

                         (DEAD SERIOUS)
          This is stealing.

                         CLARA

                         (CHUCKLES)
          Stealing? You're kidding, right.

                         PHIL
          We're not the Gales.

                         CL ARA
          So? You said yourself - if you don't
          answer at the bar they give your table
          away.

                         PHIL
          Well, what if they show up now?

                         N CLAR 2
          u get spanked'

                         PHIL

                         CLARA

                         (SIGHS SADLY)
          I don't know. What if they do, Phil?
          Clara picks up her menu and reads, shaking her head.

                         PHIL
          What?

                         CLARA
          It's just... I don't know. You used to
          be the one who would think up stuff like
          this all the time.
          This hits Phil. He takes in his wife reading the menu
          for a beat.

                         PHIL
          You know what? You're absolutely right.
          Clara lowers her menu and they look at each other for
          what feels like the first time tonight.

                         PHIL (CONT'D)
          I'm sorry, Mrs. Gale.

          It's OK, Mr. Gale. And might I add you
          look very handsome tonight?

                         PHIL
          You're not looking too shabby yours
          Mrs. Gale.

           GRUFF VOICE (O.S.)
          Mr. Gale?
          They turn, surprised, to see TWO BURLY MEN in suits at
          their table. The Older of the two politely speaks to
          them.

          OLDER BURLY MAN
          We need to have a word with you both.

                         CLARA
          What's this about?

          OLDER BURLY MAN
          k you know what this is about.
          you could please come with us.

                         PHIL N
          Why can't we talk here? u

          OLDER BURLY 'MAN
          (beat, smiles)
          I think it would save everyone a lot of
          embarrassment.
          (gestures with hand)
          Please...
          The Younger Burly Man comes behind Clara's chair to pull
          it out. Getting up, Phil shoots Clara an "I told you so"
          look as he follows the older Burly Man through the
          restaurant toward the kitchen doors, the Younger Burly
          Man walking behind them with Clara.

          INT. BACK KITCHEN AREA - MOMENTS LATER

          The Burly Man leads them through the kitchen. A WAITER
          stops, surprised.

                         WAITER
          Can I help you?
          OLDER s _ ï¿½'LY MAN
          Nah. We're fine Â®
          Walking to the rear service elevator, the Older Burly Man
          pushes the down button. The elevator opens.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          28.

                         PHIL
          Whoa. Wait a minute. Where are we
          going?

          OLDER BURLY MAN
          Get in, please.
          The Younger Burly Man coming up behind them crowds them
          into the elevator.

                         CLARA
          Hey! Jesus!
          The elevator doors shut and the older Burly Man pushes
          the G Floor then nods to his partner. They reach in
          their pockets.

                         PHIL
          Listen, this is all getting out of hand,
          OK? I admit we maybe did something a
          teeny bit wrong, but-
          Suddenly, they grab Phil and Clara, putting HANDKERCHIEFS
          over their noses and mouths. Phil and Clara veil and
          struggle for a moment, then PASS OUT.

          E CLOSEUP ON PHIL'S NOSE
          An AMMONIA STICK waves back and forth under Phil's nose
          and he startles awake, disoriented, to see he's TIED TO A
          CHAIR in the middle of a GIGANTIC MEAT LOCKER. A VIDEO
          CAMERA on a tripod aims at their faces and across the
          room, the Younger Burly Man sorts through items from
          Clara's purse and Phil's wallet scattered all over the
          table.

                         PHIL
          Whoa. What the hell is this?
          Tied in the chair next to him, Clara jumps as the Older
          Burly Man waves the stick under her nose.

                         CLARA

                         (FREAKED)
          Phil?!? What's going on?

                         PHIL
          I don't know.
          A VOICE speaks from a speakerphone on the table

                         SPEAKERPHONE
          The chloroform may make you feel dizzy
          for a few moments, but it will go away.

          Listen... you can just have all our
          money, OK? Whatever's there, it's yours.
          We're not looking to cause problems or
          put up any kind fight. We'll just walk
          away and not report anything, OK? All we

          We need to discuss your little stunt
          tonight first, Mr. and Mrs. "Gale." Or
          should we say... what is it Harry?
          HARRY, the Younger Burly Man reads Phil and Clara's IDs,
          which he's grabbed off of them.

                         HARRY

                         SPEAKERPHONE
          You think this is a joke?
          Phil looks at the faces of the two thugs. No one's
          joking.

                         PHIL

          Wait a minute. I think there's been a

          Gales.

                         SPEAKERPHONE

          No, Phil. I think they think we're
          actually "the Gales" who made the
          reservation tonight.

          yelling the Gales' name and no one
          answered, my wife said that we were them.

          I know that seems really weird. Listen,
          I agree, that's what I said to her.

                         FRANK
          One problem with your story. When I came
          over to the table - and you guys were all
          alone - you were still calling each other
          Gale.

                         PHIL
          That was just... we were... no, you don't
          understand...

                         SPEAKERPHONE
          We'll need to move things along, Frank.
          With a nod, Frank reaches into his pockets, slowly taking
          out a GUN and a handful of BULLETS. He loads the gun as
          Phil and Clara watch.

                         PHIL
          Wait a minute. What's going on?

                         CLAW
          I don't t don't like
          this.
          Clicking the loaded gun, Frank and Harry both come toward
          Phil and Clara.

                         1Ï¿½1

                         

                         

                         

                         

          32.

                         SPEAKERPHONE
          If in ten seconds you don't tell us where
          the photos are, you lose a knee, Mr.
          Foster. Ten more seconds, you lose
          another. Then we go to your wife.

                         PHIL
          Please! You can't do this! We're not
          lying!

                         SPEAKERPHONE
          One... two... three... four...
          Frank clicks the loaded gun at Phil's knee.

                         PHIL
          Oh Jesus. Don't do it!

                         SPEAKERPHONE
          Five... six... seven... eight...

                         PHIL
          Jesus!

                         CLARA

          OK FINE! FINE! YOU WIN! YOU CAN HAVE

          THE GODDAMN PHOTOS!

                         Â¢
          Everyone looks over. Phil's surprised.

                         CLARA (CONT'D)
          But we can't just tell you where they
          are. We have to take you to them.

          EXT. WAREHOUSE DISTRICT - A LITTLE LATER

          In the middle of the deserted warehouse district, Clara
          and Phil exit the meat packing plant behind Frank, who
          carries Clara's purse, Harry holding a gun as he follows
          them. As they head toward a Towncar, Frank throws the
          keys back to Harry.

                         FRANK
          You drive with her in front.

                         PHIL

                         (WHISPERS)
          So what's your plan here?

                         CLARA

                         (WHISPERS)
          I don't have a plan Phil.

                         PHIL

                         (WHISPERS)
          You don't have a plan?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          33.

                         CLARA E

                         (WHISPERS)
          No. I was just trying to keep our knees
          for the time being.

                         PHIL

                         (WHISPERS)
          Well, if we end up in that car with them
          we're as good as dead.

                         FRANK
          Quiet!

                         CLARA

                         (WHISPERS)
          Well, any time you want to help...

                         PHIL

                         (WHISPERS)
          What's that supposed to mean?

                         FRANK
          I said quiet!
          They continue walking toward the Iowncar, Phil thin ing
          hard. Suddenly, his expression changes and he star s
          weaving dizzily, putting his hand to his forehead.

                         CLARA
          Phil?
          He drops to the ground.

                         PHIL
          Whoa.

                         CLARA
          Phil? What is it?

                         PHIL
          I'm... not feeling so great...

                         HARRY
          's wrong with him?

                         CL:
          I don't know.

                         PHIL

                         (BREATHING HARD)
          I didn't... eat dinner and when I don't
          my blood sugar... Hypoglycemic...

                         CLARA
          You're not hypoglycemic.
          Phil shoots Clara a quick LOOK OF

                         

                         

                         

                         

          34.

                         CLARA (CONT'D)

                         (CATCHING ON)
          You're diabetic! You never get the terms
          right, Phil! Oh no! This is bad, guys.

                         PHIL
          I just can't... go any further.
          Harry and Frank look at each other, not sure what to do.

                         HARRY
          Should we call Mr. Stockton?

                         FRANK
          Don't say his name, you idiot!

                         HARRY
          Sorry! I was just-

                         FRANK
          We'll just throw him in the back and have
          her show us.
          hey move over to pick up Phil. Clara thinks fast.

                         CLARA
          Wait! In my purse there's a Luna Bar.
          If you give it to me I can find it for
          him.
          With a sigh, Frank hands Clara her purse. She rummages
          inside...
          and quickly WHIPS OUT her MINI 409 SPRAY, spritzing
          Frank right in the eyes. With a shriek, he falls back
          grabbing his face and dropping his gun. Clara makes a
          dash and grabs it. As Frank blindly lunges after her,
          she KNEES HIM IN THE BALLS. He collapses on the ground,
          whimpering in pain. She spins and points the gun at
          Harry.

                         CLARA (CONT'D)
          Drop the gun and the keys.

                         PHIL
          oa! Clara! No
          Harry drops them, raising his hands. Phil gets up and
          grabs the gun and keys, then awkwardly hits Harry as hard
          as he can on the back of the neck with the butt of the
          gun.
          Harry looks at him, confused.

                         HARRY
          Ow! Why, man?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          35.

                         E

                         PHIL
          Sorry. i was trying to knock you out.

                         HARRY
          Why,

                         PHIL
          ought that's what you do when-

                         CLARA
          Phil! Just c'mon!

                         PHIL

                         USHING OFF)
          Sorry.
          Befuddled, Phil meets Clara at the car and they climb in
          and speed away.

          PHIL (V.0.) (CONT'D)
          OK, let me just start from the very
          beginning...

          INT. POLICE STATION INTERVIEW ROOM - A LITTLE LATER

          Phil excitedly chatters next to Clara at a table in an
          interrogation room in the police station. Across the
          table, a YOUNG POLICE OFFICER takes their statement

                         PHIL
          We got to the restaurant late because we
          hit all this traffic on the highway-

                         CL AAA
          the shortcut.

                         PHIL
          What?

                         CLARA

                         UGS)
          I just think we might have made it on
          time if we stayed on the highway. Your
          shortcuts end up being long cuts most o
          the time.

                         (BEAT)
          OK, are you going to tell the Policeman
          or and I gonna tell him?

                         CLARA
          You can tell him.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         PHIL
          Because you always interrupt me when I
          try to tell stories, and every time you
          do it disrupts my flow.

                         CLARA
          Fine, you tell it. I won't say another
          word.

                         PHIL
          Fine.

                         (BEAT)
          See, now I've totally lost where I was.

          CLARA AND YOUNG POLICEMAN
          You got to the restaurant late-

                         PHIT
          Yeah. Even using my shortcut which, by
          the way, was a shortcut - and they gave
          away our reservation. So we were at the
          bar and the host was calling out for
          these other people over and over-

                         CLARA
          Which is what they do right before they
          cancel a reservation anyway.

                         PHIL
          I thought you said you weren't going to
          interrupt me, Clara.

                         C
          I just want him to understand we weren't
          really "stealing" someone else's

                         RESERVATI
          Across the table, the Young Police officer, eyebrows
          raised, watches Phil and Clara volley back and forth.

                         PHIL
          Do you think he really cares, Clara?
          were just kidnapped, CHLOROFORMED and
          almost shot! I don't think he's going
          turn around and book us for reservation
          theft! Am I right?

          YOUNG POLIO OFFICER
          Please. Go on.

                         PHIL
          So all of a sudden Clara yells out that
          we're these other people.

                         YOUNG POLICEMAN

                         (SURPRISED)
          You just took someone else's reservation?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          37.

                         PHIL
          Yeah. I know! Even the guy on the
          speakerphone couldn't believe it!

                         CLARA
          You two kinda bonded over that, didn't
          you?

                         PHIL
          We didn't "bond" over it. I'm just
          saying, speakerphone guy obviously
          thought it was weird to do.

          YC JG POLICEMAN
          Guys, you lost We were in the
          restaurant.

                         CLARA

                         (IGNORING HIM)
          Ah, you mean the speakerphone guy who's
          kidnapped and drugged us thinks it's
          weird to do so it's weird to do?

                         YOUNG POLICEMAN
          Guys?
          You're new "buddy."

                         PHIL
          Oh c'mon!
          And we found out speakerphone guy's name,
          Phil. It's Mr. Stockton.
          The Young Policeman looks up, interested.

                         OF FTCER
          Mr. Stockton? Hold on a minute.
          The Officer dials an extension on the phone.

                         OFFICER C'-D)

          He hangs up.

                         OFFICER (CONT'D)
          Lieutenant Manning likes to be notified

                         PHIL
          Wait. So you already know about this
          guy? You know who he is?
          A knock at the door and a handsome man in his late 40's,
          LIEUTENANT MANNING, enters the room with a smile. He
          reaches over and shakes their hands.

                         LIEUTENANT MANNING
          How do you do. Lieutenant Manning.
          The Officer offers him his note pad.

                         LIEUTENANT MANNING

                         (CONT'D)
          Nah, as long as they're here might as
          well get everything from the horse's
          mouth, right?
          As the Officer heads out of the room, Lieutenant Manning
          sidles down into his seat.

                         LIEUTENANT MANNING

                         (CONT'D)
          Can I get you guys anything to drink?
          Coffee? Water? Maybe a shot or two of

                         1 1

                         PHIL
          That sounds more like

                         LIEUTENANT MANNING
          So why don't you tell me all about your
          incident with Mr. Stockton.

                         PHIL

                         CLARA
          Oh, don't be like that, Phil. Please.

                         LIEUTENANT MANNING
          Guys... you've obviously been through
          something traumatic tonight. Thankfully
          it's over and you're both safe and sound.
          Maybe you should cut each other a little
          bit more of a break.
          Phil and Clara look at each other, each letting out air.
          Manning's right.

                         PHIL
          Seriously, Clara. You tell him.

                         CJ __
          Well, we never a. t_::ally "met"

          CLARA (CONT`B)
          He was in another room on a speakerphone
          where these guys who kidnapped us took
          us. But he was obviously the one pulling
          the strings.

          LIEUI N'T' MANNING

                         (WRITING)
          Let me fill you in on all that later.
          Now, why would he have wanted to kidnap
          you two?

                         CLARA
          Honestly, you wouldn't believe this, but
          it's because we sat down at the wrong
          table tonight for dinner.

                         LIEUTENANT MANNING
          (looks up, interest
          Really? The wrong table?

                         CLARA
          We pretended to be someone else who
          didn't show up for their reservations.
          My idea. And it turned out that these
          people must have something this Mr.
          Stockton wants.

                         1Ï¿½1

                         LIEUTENANT MANNING
          Do you know what?

          Photos.
          Lieutenant looks up, interested, then writes again.

                         LIEUTENANT MANNING
          That's all you know?
          Phil and Clara look at each other. Nod.

                         LIEUTENANT MANNING-

                         (CONT'D)
          OK. I'm just confused about one thing.
          When you took this other reservation, how
          did you know for sure that the real Gales
          weren't going to show up late?

                         CLARA

                         (BEAT)
          Excuse me?

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         ENANT MANNING
          How were you so sure the Gales weren
          going to show up if you don't know the
          at all?
          Clara looks down at the table, furrowing her brow.

                         PHIL
          Clara?

                         CLARA
          Sorry. I... I lost my train of thought.

                         PHIL
          Well, I can pick things up then.
          Phil notices Clara giving him a LOOK.

                         PHIL (CONT'D)
          What? Why are you looking at me like
          that?

                         CLARA
          (intensifying the look)
          I'm not looking at you like anything.
          doesn't pick up on it. Shrugs.

                         1Ï¿½1

                         PHIL
          OK, well, I had the same question for her
          when we sat down, which she thought was

                         CRAZY-
          Rubbing her forehead, Clara KICKS Phil's leg HARD under
          the table.

                         PHIL (CONT'D)
          OW! Jesus!
          Clara stink-eyes Phil AGAIN, trying to get the message
          across.

                         PHIL (CONT'D)
          And there's that look again!

          CLARE?
          look! No. Looking. At all.
          RINGING. Lieutenant Manning reaches into his jacket
          pocket and checks the number on the cellphone. He hops
          up.

                         LIEUTENANT MANNING
          Can you excuse me a moment?

          utenant Manning gets up and exits the room. Clara
          does to the window in the door and watches him walk down
          the hall to his office as he talks on the phone. Phil
          puts his leg on the table, pulling up his pant leg to
          inspect.

                         PHIL
          OK, I'm not dense, Clara. That was not
          an accident and if those weren't looks-

          He's in on this. He's got something to
          do with it.

          What do you mean?

                         CLARA
          He said, "How did you know the Gales
          weren't coming." I never told him that
          was the name of the reservation we

          How do we get out of here?

          Uh huh. I know you don't. It will be
          contained. Right now.
          Hanging up the phone, Manning walks quickly back through
          the police station to the interview room. He stops in
          the doorway...
          .it's EMPTY. Confused, he turns to an OFFICER outside
          at the desk.

                         LIEUTENANT MANNING

                         (CONT'D)
          Where'd they go?

                         OFFICER
          They said you were done with them.
          Manning walks quickly back to his office.
          Sitting behind his desk, Manning enters a password on his
          computer and starts typing out an ALL POINTS BULLETIN.

          Clara drives as Phil scans the rearview mirror from the
          passenger seat.

                         CLARA
          We can't just go to another police
          station, Phil! We don't know how big
          this is! It might not just be Manning!

                         PHIL
          Well then we're screwed! Who do we go
          to? The FBI? The CIA?

                         CLARA

                         (SHAKES HEAD)
          They're not going to believe us over a
          Police Lieutenant!

          Shit. This is their car, Phil. We gotta
          lose it too.
          Searching the street, Clara spots a OPEN PARKING SPACE.
          She whips the wheel around, trying to parallel park into
          the space.

          Dammit! I hate this!

                         PHIL
          It's all right. You just should have
          spun it when I told you to.
          Flustered, she pulls back out and tries again.

                         PHIL (CONT'D)

                         CLARA
          Would you stop it? You're stressing me
          out!
          Angry, Clara whips the car back into the spot, NAILING
          the car behind them and setting off a loud CAR ALARM WITH

          Yeah, the "environmental thing," Phil.
          As they walk into the apartment in their socks, they
          notice the whole place is filled with reclaimed and
          recycled furniture and LIT WITH CANDLES.

          know, all you "Phil"-i-stines in the
          suburbs.
          Holbrooke chuckles. Phil's about to say something when a
          look from Clara reminds him to bite his lip. Holbrooke
          gestures to some cardboard furniture.

                         HOLBROOKE (CONT'D)
          So have a seat.
          Holbrooke starts to sit down himself, then makes a show
          of taking a LARGE GUN out of his shoulder holster and
          putting it on the table.

                         PHIL
          Whoa. You carry that around at home?

                         HOLBROOKE
          Yeah. I'm supposed to sleep with her
          under my pillow.

                         (SHRUGS)
          Wish I didn't have to, but I just see it
          as... I carry the weight so citizens like
          yourselves don't have to.

                         1Ï¿½1

                         CLARA
          It's so funny. I always knew you'd end
          up doing something in public service.

          Phil looks to Clara - can you get a load of this guy, but
          Clara's focused on Holbrooke.

          HOLBROOKE (V.0.) (CONT'D)
          Yeah, unfortunately, Terrence Stockton is
          not a man you want to get on the wrong
          side of.

          INT. HOLBROOKE'S LIVING ROOM - LATER

          Phil watches as Holbrooke licks the salt allllll the wav
          around his Margarita glass with his extra long tongue.
          Clara listens intently, eating some jicama slices from a
          platter on the table in front of them.

                         HOLBROOKE
          He's like a Nicaraguan turtle - keeps his
          head deep in his shell unless he
          absolutely has to stick it out. Those
          photos must be really important to him.

          Holbrooke picks up the plate and Margarita glass, then
          crosses to his INDOOR COMPOSTER, adding the extra liquid
          and scraps.

          What does Stockton do?

                         HOLBROOKE
          Officially, he runs a bunch of these
          exclusive private clubs downtown where
          his high powered friends go to let their
          hair down. Has one place called Le
          Passage, another called The Rainbow-

                         CLARA
          e Rainbow! Stockton asked how we

                         (NODS)
          Interesting. I've had some of my guys
          looking into Stockton for years, but
          nothing ever sticks to him. He's very
          careful - ties up his loose ends and
          covers his tracks. But with this... he
          might have accidentally left himself
          open.

                         CLARA
          And she of you.
          As it comes out of her mouth, Clara realizes and guiltily
          looks over at Phil BRISTLING. Holbrooke goes to a pile
          of already used sheets of paper and picks one up along
          with a pen.

                         HOLBROOKE
          I'll just need your full names and your
          socials so I can get the paperwork
          started at the bureau. Not yours, Clara.
          Know that by heart.
          Both Phil and Clara are taken aback.

                         HOLBROOKE (CONT'D)

                         (CHUCKLES)
          Just kidding. But I'm sure Phil-a-buster
          knows 'em both, right?
          Phil looks on both sides of the paper Holbrooke hands
          him.

                         PHIL
          Uh... there's already writing all over
          this.

          Does another tree really need to die for
          me to get your socials, Phil?
          Phil bites his tongue yet again, squeezing the writing
          into a side of the paper.

                         HOLBROOKE (CONT'D)
          So just one kid, guys? What's keeping
          you? Clocks ticking Clara - tickety tock
          tuck.

          Yeah, well, that's a topic for another-

                         HOLBROOKE
          It's just that by now, you and I woulda

                         PHIL
          (under his breath)
          That's... charming.
          Phil scoots the paper back to Holbrooke, who squints and
          dramatically turns it sideways.

          Holbrook. makes a big show of putting his gun back
          holster as he gets up.

                         HOLBROOKE
          We'll have you stay at the bureau for the
          night. Safer for you.

                         CLARA
          Thank you so much, Holbrooke.

          I feel like we're in good hands for the E
          first time tonight.
          As Holbrooke goes into the other room to call, Clara lets
          out a sigh of relief then notices Phil's mood.

                         CLARE
          What's wrong?

                         PHIL

          Phil's really had enough with this guy.
          Your goodness... where does it end?
          Clara shoots Phil a look he back, but Holbrooke
          doesn't get his sarcasm.

                         HOLBROOKE

                         (SHRUGS)
          How I roll. Now for some reason they

          He makes a big show of putting his gun back in his
          shoulder strap before getting out of the car.

          INT. FBI WINDOW

          Through the window, we see Holbrooke, Phil, and Clara
          walking toward the back of the building.
          In the foreground, A SHADOWY GUY watches them, then
          whispers into his walkie.

          FBI BUILDING - MOMENTS LATER
          Holbrooke uses a KEYCARD on his keychain with a flourish
          to enter the rear of the building, then leads Phil and
          Clara through the doors. Suddenly he stops and Phil and
          Clara FREEZE behind them.
          At the other end of the hallway, an FBI UNIT in
          bulletproof gear trains their weapons on the three of
          them. AGENT #1 in the center, obviously the agent in
          charge, yells to them.

          Holbrooke looks nervously between the Agents and Phil and
          Clara. He turns to them, taking Clara's arm.

                         HOLBROOKE

          All right. Didn't want to have to-
          Holbrooke reaches into his holster to whip out his gun...
          .but BOBBLES it and it falls to the ground, right at
          Phil's feet. Looking down, Phil instinctively GRABS IT,
          holding the gun to Holbrooke's head.

                         PHIL
          All right! Nobody move or he gets it!
          Clara's STUNNED. The Agents look at each other, but
          don't seem overly concerned.

                         AGENT #1
          Holbrooke has a gun? Why does he even
          â¢ have a gun?

                         HOLBROOKE

          Listen, man. I'm not that important.
          I'm really not. I'm not the IT guy but
          I'm just one step above him! No reason
          to do something rash, all right?

                         HOLBROOKE
          He's not screwing around! He's not
          screwing around!
          Pulling a terrified Holbrooke, Phil and Clara back toward
          the rear exit of the building. They try the door, but
          it's locked.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          55.

                         PHIL
          Keycard.

                         HOLBROOKE
          What?

          A FEW FBI AGENTS
          He wants your keycard.

                         PHIL
          Thanks. He and I, the communication
          isn't great...
          Getting the keychain from Holbrooke, Phil uses the
          keycard then lets it fall to the floor as the door
          unlocks and they back outside.

          EXT. FBI BUILDING - CONT

          Phil and Clara back away, keeping Holbrooke between th
          and the agents. Through the door, Agents slowly creep
          down the hallway after them, guns trained.

                         HOLBROOKE
          Seriously, Phil. I'm a bad shield. I
          promise.

                         CLARA
          Wow, Phil!
          Phil feels a little pumped up with Clara's praise.

                         PHIL
          Just give me your car keys, Holbrooke.
          When we're about to drive off we'll let
          you go.

                         HOLBROOKE
          Uh, they were on the keychain.

                         PHIL
          What?
          HOLB'?n`_
          The key chain you dre-,~_d with the keycard
          inside. The keys were on that.
          And so the hero falls...

                         PHIL
          Shit.

                         CL AA
          we'll never outrun them.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          56.
          Searching around, Phil eyes the KEYCARD PANEL outside the
          entrance. He aims the gun and FIRES, MISSING BADLY.
          Both he and Holbrooke cover their ears.

                         HOLBROOKE

          AH!

                         PHIL
          YOW! Man is that loud!
          As the Agents run toward the door, Clara quickly grabs
          the gun from Phil and shoots, nailing the lock.

                         PHIL (CONT'D)
          (stunned, looks at her)
          How are you so good at that?
          The Agents try the door, but are LOCKED IN. Agent #1
          tells his men to stand back and tries shooting the glass,
          but it's BULLETPROOF. He gestures and all the Agents
          rush around to the front.

                         CLARA
          gotta get going! Quick!

                         PHIL
          Where?
          They both look around, unsure.

                         HOLBROOKE
          Across the bridge a few blocks down that
          street there's an entrance to the Green
          Line subway. Get on it and you can get
          anywhere in this city.
          Phil and Clara look at him, confused.

                         PHIL
          Aren't you supposed to be our hostage?

                         HOLBROOKE

                         (SIGHS)
          Whatever. I don't know. Sure. What's
          the difference? I'm never gonna get
          behind that desk now anyway.
          my gun! I dropped it in front of
          everybody!

                         PHIL
          It wasn't so much of a drop. it was more
          of a... bobble.

                         CLARA
          Yeah, a bobble's bad...

                         

                         

                         

                         

          57.

                         HOLBROOKE
          Listen, if you just leave me here I can
          tell them you ran the other way. It'll
          buy you time to get there. And maybe I
          can work on clearing all this up for you.
          Phil and Clara look at each other, then start to run
          away. Suddenly Phil stops, thinking.

                         CLARA
          What?

                         PHIL
          Let me have the gun.
          As Clara gives it to him, Phil quickly runs back and
          hands it to Holbrooke

                         PHIL (CONT'D)
          Here. Tell them you got it back from us.
          Holbrooke takes back his aun, grateful.

                         HOLBROOKE
          Thanks, Phil.
          As Phil runs back, Clara takes in the nice gesture of
          husband.

          EXT RIDGE - A FEW MINUTES LATER
          A lit up raucous PARTY BOAT in a canal starts to pass
          under a roadway bridge up ahead as Phil and Clara, trying
          to stay in the shadows, walk quickly toward it. Phil
          glances back over their shoulders - the road is DESERTED.

                         PHIL
          it's just on the other side of that
          bridge. I think we're going to make it.
          He notices Clara looking at him.

                         PHIL (COND
          What?

                         CLARA
          Nothing. That was just nice of you, back
          there.

                         (BEAT)
          This is crazy, but you know what I'm,
          reminded of right now?

                         PHIL
          Bourne identity?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          58.

                         CLARA
          I'm talking about right now. When we
          used to walk home late at night after
          going downtown to the clubs. We couldn't
          ever find a cab, remember? We'd grab
          those "healthy" dogs and cheese fries at
          the Weiner's Circle and go to the Adler
          Planetarium to watch the sunrise.

                         PHIL
          Where I held your hand for the first
          time.

                         CLARA
          I can't believe we used to stay up all
          night like that.

                         PHIL
          It's because we could sleep 'til noon.

                         CLARA

                         (SMILES SLYLY)
          If I remember correctly, we weren't
          always "sleeping."
          Beat as they share the moment together, walking.

                         PHIL
          I just don't understand when we got so...
          I don't know...

                         CLARA
          Old.

                         PHIL
          No, I was thinking numb. When did we
          become one of those couples that we used
          to look at in restaurants back then and
          think were so sad?

                         CLARA
          We're not that bad, Phil. I just think we
          haven't been that honest with each other
          recently.
          Phil doesn't understa

                         CLARA (CONT'D)
          Not big things. Just little things
          keep adding up and putting this thing
          between us.

                         (BEAT)
          Like the fact I know you never want to
          talk about us having this other baby.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          59.

                         PHIL
          It's not that I don't want another kid,
          Clara. It's just... I used to be the
          whole pie with you. And now with Ollie
          and your work, I'm barely even a piece of
          the pie anymore. I'm, like, maybe a
          pecan on a piece of the pie! So part of
          me's not jumping at the chance of having
          the little pecan I have left of your
          attention going into some new baby's
          mouth!

                         CLARA
          But that's crazy, Phil. When you're home
          you're the one who seems like your hardly
          even there! It's all about your work.
          Believe me, if you-
          Clara suddenly notices a POLICE CAR, lights off, drive
          past them over the bridge.

                         CLARA (CONT'D)
          Shit!

                         PHIL
          I think we're OK. Just play cool and
          keep walking.
          The patrol car continues across and down the street. 1ï¿½1
          Phil and Clara breathe a sigh of relief.
          Then suddenly, a few blocks down, BRAKE LIGHTS. The
          patrol car turns around and TURNS ON ITS LIGHTS, zooming
          back toward them.

                         PHIL (CONT'D)
          Now you can say shit.
          Phil looks around - they're in the middle of the bridge
          with no place to run. Then he notices the lit up PARTY
          BOAT coming out the other side of the bridge beneath
          them.

                         PHIL (CONT'D)
          e 's only a few feet.

                         CLARA
          What u high? No way.
          But looking main at the patrol car speeding toward them,
          Phil grabs Clara and dashes for the side of the bridge.

                         CLARA (CONT'D)

          AH!

                         1Ï¿½1

                         

                         

                         

                         

          60.
          As she's YANKED OVER THE SIDE, Clara CLUTCHES onto the
          railing. With Phil hanging onto her other arm, they
          DANGLE above the water and the boat.

                         CLARA (CONT'D
          Ahhh! Are you CRAZY!?!

                         PHIL
          Let go, Clara!

                         CLARA
          A GROUP of DRUNKEN PARTIERS on the boat, spotting them,
          cheer below. Some even take FLASH PICTURES. Phil looks
          down - if they don't let go soon they're literally going
          to miss the boat.

                         PHIL
          go or I'm going to tickle you!

                         CLARA

                         (DEAD SERIOUS)
          No you're not, Phil. We have a rule!
          tickling. I'm not-
          He reaches up and TICKLES Clara under her arm. She
          giggles.

                         E

                         CLARA (CONT'D)

                         (LAUGHING)
          Ah! Stop it, Phil! Ah! It's not funny!
          I mean- Stop it! Ah!
          Clara can't hold on any longer...

          EXT. BOAT

          They land - THUMP! - onto the top deck of the boat, both
          groaning as they roll back and forth while the Drunken
          Partiers CHEER and FLASH PHOTOS.

                         PHIL
          Ow! I think I broke my butt.

                         CLARA
          OW! OW! Dammit, Phil! What's our rule
          about tickling?

                         PHIL
          I'm sorry! I didn't do it for pleasure!
          What is our rule?

                         0

                         CLARA
          Right! And guess what? It wasn't funny
          for me, Phil!
          Clara gets up and storms off, clutching her arm. Walking
          down the side of the boat, she passes a MAN down on one
          knee in front of an EXCITED WOMAN, who nods, accepting
          his proposal.

                          CLARA (CONT'D)

          They look at her, stunned.

          Phil limps along, finally finding Clara alone and calmed
          down, looking out over the rear of the boat. He comes
          next to her. Beat.

                         PHIL
          Maybe we could just hide or something
          until this all blows over.

          Imagine what it's going to be like for
          Ollie when everyone hears about this
          tomorrow. I bet our pictures are going
          to be all over the papers.
          Phil nods, gazing out. Then suddenly an idea comes to
          him.

                         PHIL
          Wait. What if we found the pictures?

                         PHIL
          These pictures that everyone's after.
          we could get them we'd have some kind o
          bargaining chip to get out of this.

                         CLARA
          But then we'd have to find the Gales.

          Yeah, but even so, Holbrooke said these
          clubs are so secret you have to know
          where they are and how to get in-
          Clara rummages through her purse and grabs her phone,
          dialing, then notices Phil looking out, shaking his head.

                         CLARA
          What?

                         PHIL
          You're not listening to me again!

                         CLARA
          "You have to know where they are and h
          to get in-"

                         PHIL
          That's great. Clara wanna cracker?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          63.

                         C LARA
          I'm calling because of what you said,
          Phil. I know who can help us.
          Clara dials the number.

                         CLARA_ (CONT'D)
          Hey Jane, it's Clara.

                         (LISTENS)
          Where am I?
          (beat, looks around)
          I'm... I'm on a party cruise around
          Chicago. Oh yeah. It is turning into
          quite a night. Listen, we need to go to
          this club called the Rainbow later. Do
          you know how we can get in?
          Clara looks at Phil, excited, and nods as she plugs her
          ear and listens. Phil watches her until he notices the
          boat IS TURNING. He looks around the side.
          A slew of POLICE CARS on the shore. He taps Clara.

                         PHIL
          ara...
          Clara turns and looks.

                         CLARA
          Oh shoot. You know what Jane? I've
          actually gotta jump off right now.

          INT. TOUR BOAT - LATER

          POLICE swarm all over the tour boat, checking every
          compartment. A DRUNKEN PARTIER shows Lieutenant Manning
          SNAPSHOTS of Phil and Clara landing, groaning, and
          arguing on the back of his digital camera. A POLICEMAN
          comes up to Manning and shakes his head.

                         LIEUTENANT MANNING
          Check again.
          Manning pockets the camera and starts to walk away.

                         PARTIER
          Hey! That's mine, man!

                         LIEUTENANT MANNING
          Evidence.
          The Partier mumbles "Asshole" as he stumbles
          Manning si i.s and looks out over the wa

                         

                         

                         

                         

          64.

                         E

          EXT. STREET - LATER

          It's WINDY and COLD as Phil and Clara, soaked, squeak and
          slosh down the street. Clara, missing one heel, dumps
          water out of her purse as she checks her cellphone.

                         CLARA
          Mine's totally shot too.

                         PHIL
          You got the info from her though, right?

                         CLARA
          Yeah, but we can't get in looking like
          this, Phil.

                         PHIL
          I don't think we have a choice. Not a
          big shopping hour.
          They walk past the 24 CHICAGO FITNESS CENTER, lights
          blazing. Windows show machines filled with young
          HARDBODIES working out.

                         PHIL (CONT'D)
          Now if we wanted to do a little cardio,
          on the other hand. Who knew that many
          people worked out at 1 in the morning?
          Clara thinks a moment, then stops in her tracks and looks
          back up at the building.

                         PHIL (CONT'D)
          You wanna do a little cardio?
          Clara smirks at him, then Phil, thinking, gets it. He
          shakes his head.

                         PHIL (CONT'D)
          OK, now that's scary. You know you're
          starting to think like a real criminal?
          You know that, don't you?
          Clara waggles her eyebrows. We hear Devo's "Secret Agent
          Man" over a TrC _ GE .

          INT. 24 HOUR FITNESS CENTER - MONTAGE

          - Phil and Clara walk up to the front counter, where the
          GYM GREETER boredly watches TV. They say something and
          the Greeter waves them through without looking up. As
          they hurry on, the Greeter's TV goes to a PROMO TEASER
          for the local late night news: a SNAPSHOT of Phil and
          Clara from the boat with a caption that reads: BONNIE AND

          CLOD?!?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          65.

                         1Ï¿½1
          - In the MEN'S LOCKER ROOM, Phil pulls at the COMBINATION
          LOCKS, searching for an open locker. Unable to find one,
          he picks up a bench to throw it at them when TWO JOCKS in
          workout clothes walk in and look at him strangely as he
          holds the bench. Phil moves the bench back and forth,
          pretending it's part of his EXERCISE ROUTINE.
          - In the WOMEN'S LOCKER ROOM, Clara, wrapped in a towel,
          blows out her hair at the mirror. An ATTRACTIVE THIN
          WOMAN walks behind her toward the showers and they smile
          at each other in the mirror. As the THIN WOMAN
          disappears behind the shower glass, Clara makes a MAD
          DASH for the lockers.
          - Back in the MEN'S LOCKER ROOM, Phil lingers as a MAN IN
          A DARK SUIT undresses, getting ready to work out. As the
          man is about to lock his locker, Phil rushes up to him,
          excitedly telling him something and pointing outside.
          The man, confused, exits, and Phil MOVES IN, quickly
          undressing.
          - The Attractive Thin Woman comes back to her locker and
          opens it. Her face drops. Inside hang CL A"S DRIPPING

          CLOTHES.
          - OUTSIDE THE GYM, Phil, looking slick in a colored shirt
          and black suit, walks quickly around the corner, then
          stops, stunned. Clara, waiting for him with her hair
          blown out and in a tight fitting RED FLAPPER DRESS with â¢
          RED HEELS, looks AMAZING. From her expression, she feels
          the same about Phil.

          EXT. ALLEY - LATER

          Looking both ways, Phil and Clara walk nervously down a
          dark, derelict alley.

                         PHIL
          Down here?

                         JANE
          It's what she said.

                         PHIL
          And if you die, does Jane get your
          commissic-l on the open house?
          Up ahead, a TWO S:_=:Y LOOKING CHARACTERS huddle near a
          bunch of GARBAGE CANS watching them, a SMALL FIRE nearby.
          Nervously, Clara approaches.

                         CLARA
          Excuse me?
          Men shoot her a fierce look.

                         E

                         

                         

                         

                         

          66.

                         CLARA (CONT'D)
          Um... do you know which is the way back
          to Kansas?
          They eye her, then inspect Phil up and down. One of them
          LUNGES, and Phil jumps back...
          but he's moving aside some trash cans, revealing a
          RAINBOW COLORED STAIRWAY going down.

                         SHADY GUY #1
          Welcome to the Rainbow.

          INT. THE RAINBOW - LATER

          Reaching the bottom of the stairway, Phil and Clara,
          amazed, take in THE RAINBOW.
          It's a CAVERNOUS ABANDONED SUBWAY STATION that's been
          converted into a GLAMOROUS CLUB. The place is PACKED
          with an elite looking CROWD. Everything in the room -
          the carpet, the tapestries, the clothes of the waitstaff -
          is EMERALD GREEN.
          Phil and Clara nod at each other then separate,
          disappearing into the mix.

          INT. ANOTHER PART OF THE RAINBOW - SAME

          Phil looks around, amazed as he wanders between BLACKJACK
          and BACCARAT tables, where well-to-do OLDER guests gamble
          large sums of money, fast looking WOMEN cheering them on.

          VOICE (O.S.)
          If you wanner be pissed at anyone about
          it, be pissed at Stockton...
          Hearing the name, Phil spots a BALDING MAN talking to 2
          other MEN at one of the tables. He lingers closer.

                         BALDING MAN
          You know, rumor is he's behind the whole
          mess. Raking it in on both ends.
          What do you mean?

                         BALDING MAN
          Hush hush shell companies he owns. One
          of them hires all the construction
          inspectors. Another he's got rents all
          the construction equipment. The more one
          slows things down with violations,
          more the other takes to the bank.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          67.
          The Balding Man leans in and speaks more quietly, causing
          Phil to lean in even more.

          BALDING MAN (CONT'D)
          My guess is he's trying to screw up Mayor
          Diggs' reelection. Imagine what someone
          like him could do if he got someone less
          "squeaky clean" in the Mansion.
          The Balding Man suddenly notices Phil listening. Phil
          pastes on an excited face.

                         PHIL
          you! Gale, right?

                         BALDING MAN
          What?

                         PHIL
          Sorry. From the side... confused you
          with somebody else.
          Phil quickly moves on.

          INT. ANOTHER PART OF THE RAINBOW -

          Clara talks to a BUSY BARTENDER at the bar as he
          scrambles to fill drink orders.

          BA --Y_-_.
          really get s,-.y names.

                         CLARA
          Thanks any-way.
          With a sigh, Clara starts away from the bar, when she

          FREEZES.
          ough the crowd, FRANK and HARRY walk right toward her -
          but they haven't seen her yet. Clara spots the KITCHEN
          DOORS nearby and rushes through.
          INT. KITCHEN - C vUOUS
          Clara peeks out through the double door windows. Frank
          and Harry continue through the crowd, unaware.

          VOICE (O.S.)
          Watch it!
          Clara quickly hugs a large bulletin board covered with
          pictures and time schedules as a WAITER carries a large
          tray of food past her.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          68.
          As she moves off the wall, some papers drop. Clara pins
          them back on, when something else on the bulletin board
          catches her eye...
          .Among all the snapshots of staff scattered on the
          bulletin board is a picture of a backyard party with a
          whole group of laughing young people, and the middle of
          the picture, smiling at the camera...
          . is THE NERVOUS WOMAN FROM THE SIGNATURE ROOM

          BATHROOM.
          Clara pulls the picture off the wall. She catches a
          WAITRESS coming back through the double doors.

                         CLARA
          Excuse me. Does she work here?

                         WAITRESS
          Dora? I guess she still does. Hasn't
          been showing up lately, though.

                         CLARA
          Do you know where I can find her?

                         WAITRESS
          You could try back tomorrow, see if she-

                         C
          I need to find her tonight.

                         WAITRESS
          Did you try Ray's place?

                         CLARA
          Ray?

                         WAITRESS
          That sleazebag boyfriend of hers. He's
          got that place a few blocks from here
          where he used to throw those after work
          parties.

                         CLARA
          Do you remember where it is?

          ANOTHER PART OF THE RAINBOW
          Phil scans the crowds, back and forth.

          MALE VOICE (O.S.)
          Phil!
          Hearing his name, Phil nervously turns. MR. RIVERS and
          GEORGE stand together in a corner.

                         (TO HIMSELF)
          hit.

          MR. RIVERS
          This is a surprise! What are you doing
          down here?

                         PHIL
          Uh... well, same thing as you guys, I
          would guess. Working those "extra
          hours," right?

          CLARA (O.S.)
          Phil!
          Clara, looking amazing in her red flapper dress, weeds
          through the crowd. Mr. Rivers and George take her in,
          obviously impressed.

                         CLARA (CONT'D)
          Phil, we gotta go. I found out where-

          Clara, you remember Mr. Rivers?
          Clara suddenly notices Phil's boss.
          Oh. Oh. Yeah.

                         GEORGE
          And I'm George.

                         CLARK
          Sorry, but I've got to steal him. We've
          gotta be somewhere else right now.

          MR. RIVERS
          At 2 in the morning? Where are you guys
          headed?

                         PHIL

                         (BEAT)
          I'm sorry, Mr. Rivers. We really can
          talk about it.
          Phil and Clara move off quickly through the crowd as Mr.
          Rivers watches the hand_ï¿½__e, dressed up couple,
          intrigued.

          MR. RIVERS
          Phil Foster with places to go he can
          talk about at 2 in the morning.

          MR. RIVERS (CONT'D)
          You know what makes kangaroos so damn
          dangerous, George? They look so sweet
          and tame, so you forget they're wild
          animals. Lethal when they want to be.
          George, not fully understanding, chuckles and holds out
          his hand for another handshake, but Mr. Rivers, still
          watching Phil, LEAVES HIM HANGING.

          A TV MONITOR IMAGE of Phil and Clara making their way
          through the crowd to the exit.
          In the dark room, Frank and Harry look expectantly to the
          well dressed man in a dark suit, who absently twirls with
          two metal balls in his hand.

          MR. STOCKTON
          See where they take you.

          EXT. RUN DOWN ROW HOUSE - A LITTLE LATER

          Phil and Clara knock on the door of a the deserted
          looking row house. No answer. Clara tries the door...

                         PHIL
          That never really-
          OPENS. She shoots Phil a look.

          OK. Never mind.
          Phil and Clara inch insi

          RUN DOWN HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
          As they start down the dark hallway to the living room,
          Phil hunches over, hugging the wall.

                         CL

                         (SHRUGS)
          OK. Fine. I was just asking.
          Clara walks quietly behind crouching Phil. Reaching the
          living room, they spot TWO PACKED SUITCASES on the couch.
          Suddenly, the DOOR SLAMS behind them and RAY holds a gun
          to Phil's head, DORA nervously next to him.

                         RAY
          Talk! Who are you?

                         PHIL
          You know, that's like the 5th gun I've
          had to my head tonight! Just lower that
          thing and cool it, OK?
          Off guard from Phil's reaction, Ray, confused, does.

                         DORA
          She was in the bathroom at the
          restaurant!

                         RAY
          Who are you?

                         PHIL
          Who are we? Good question! Well,
          everybody thinks we're "the Gales"
          because we were lucky enough to take your
          reservation tonight!

                         RAY

                         (CONFUSED)
          What? Why would you take our
          reservation?
          Phil shoots Clara a look.

                         CLARE
          Don't.

                         RAY
          Both of you. Stand ov there in the
          corner. Dammit Dora, ere's your
          goddamn brother? He was E,.--,-Dc.-zed to b
          here an hour ago!
          I don't know, Ra_, He's not answering
          his phone.

                         RAY
          Yeah, well, if these guys found u
          long do you think it's gonna take
          other guys? We're dead! DEAD!

                         

                         

                         

                         

          72.

                         E

                         CLARA
          Excuse me.
          In the corner, Clara raises her hand. Ray eyes her
          strangely.

                         CLARA (CONT'D)
          Sorry. I have to pee.

                         RAY

                         (FLUSTERED)
          You have to nee?
          Clara nods. Phil shrugs.

                         PHIL
          That's my wife.
          Flustered, Ray waves Dora to take Clara.

          INT. BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS

          Dora talks to Clara as she washes her face in the sink.

                         DORA
          You must just think I'm awful.

                         CLARA
          I don't think anything about you. I just
          want this to be over.

                         DORA
          Ray saw Mr. Stockton making all this
          money blackmailing people at the club.
          When he found out who was interested in
          me... he said it would be so easy. We'd
          never have to work again.

          RAY (O.S.)

          HOW LONG DOES IT TAKE TO PEE, GUYS?!?

                         DORA
          We're coming!

          INT. LIVING ROOM - SAME

          Ray peeks nervously out of the window, searching the
          street.

                         PHIL
          Listen, it looks like things didn't turn
          out the way you planned, but I think all
          Stockton wants is his pictures back. As
          soon as he gets them I bet-

                         

                         

                         

                         

          73.

                         RAY E
          Stockton's pictures? You.think they're
          Stockton's pictures?

                         (SMIRKS)
          You really have no idea what you've
          gotten into, do you?
          BOOM! The window SHATTERS and Ray and Phil hit the deck.
          As Ray starts blindly firing back, Phil crawls on his
          knees and elbows across the floor toward the bathroom.

          CLARA (O.S.)

          PHIL?!?!

                         PHIL
          I'm OK! I'm OK!
          Ray spots Phil crawling away and gets up, turning to him.

                         RAY
          Hey! Get-
          Suddenly, Ray is SHOT IN THE ARM through the window. He
          drops to the ground in pain, yelling and clutching his
          arm.

                         RAY (CONT'D)
          Ahh!

                         Â¢
          Phil crabs along even faster.

          INT. BATHROOM

          Clara rushes to the bathroom door, pulling Phil inside
          and locking it.
          As Clara focuses on Phil, Dora thinks fast, taking an
          ELOPE out of her purse and putting it into Clara's
          bout them seeing.

                         CLARA
          Oh God! Are you hit?

                         PHIL
          No... just... a little ... winded...
          that... crawling's... tough... on the
          core...

          INT. LIVING ROOM - SAME

          As Harry kicks the gun away from Ray, moaning on the
          floor, Frank comes to the bathroom door. He lightly raps
          on it, then speaks softly.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          74.

                         LJ

                         FRANK
          How about you guys let me in before
          someone gets really hurt?

          INT. BATHROOM

          Dora quickly opens the window and gestures for Phil and
          Clara to climb through. Just as they squeeze outside...
          BAM! The door handle's BLOWN OFF and Frank kicks the
          door in. He grabs Dora, rushing toward the window, but
          Phil and Clara are GONE.

                         FRANK
          Dammit!
          Frank eyes Dora, then SHOOTS HER IN THE FOOT, sending
          screaming to the ground in pain.

                         FRANK(CONT'D)
          You stay put.
          He hurries back through the house.

          FRONT OF RUN DOWN HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
          Phil and Clara sprint to the street as a BUICK pulls up
          in front and a confused looking CHUBBY GUY steps

                         CHUBBY GUY
          Hey? Which is 357 Maple Street?

                         PHIL
          You're Dora's brother?

                         CHUBBY GUY
          Who are you?

                         PHIL
          You're late!

                         CHUBBY GUY
          OK sorry! The roads are all screwed
          with all this construction-
          BOOM! They wince as a SHOT hits the rearview mirror of
          the car. All three spin to see Frank aiming his gun and
          marching toward them, Harry right behind him.

          CHUBBY GUY (CONT'D)
          Hey!
          Phil quickly pushes Dora's brother aside as he and Clara
          hop into the Buick and PEEL OUT.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          75.
          Frank and Harry SPRINT for their Towncar down the block.

          INT. CAR - CONTINUOUS

          Phil screeches the car around the corner.

                         CLARA
          Phil! Careful!
          Phil WHIPS the car around another bend.

                         CLARA (CONT'D)
          Please, Phil! It's not going to do any
          good if you-

                         PHIL
          (taking another sharp turn)
          Clara! Please! Just leave the driving
          to me, OK?!? I know what I'm-
          SMASH! - they HIT something head-on, SHATTERING the
          windshield.
           Shaking glass off himself, Phil peers forward. They're
          face to face - nose to nose - with another broken
          windshield. In the driver's seat of a SOUPED UP HONDA
          h fiber-optic colored lights, a YOUNG BLACK DUDE â¢
          stares at them in shock.

                         BLACK DUDE
          No no no. Tell me you did not just do
          that.

                         PHIL
          Shit!
          The Black Dude gets out of his car to inspect, head in
          hands.

                         BLACK DUDE
          Oh, man! You did not just do that!
          Whew, you gonna be payin' for this!

                         PHIL
          owe you one.
          Phil throws the car into reverse, but his tires just
          screech smoke, the wheels spinning in place.
          Looking out his window toward the front, Phil sees that

          THE SMASHED FRONT GRILL OF THEIR CAR HAS INTERLOCKED WITH

          ASHED FRONT GRILL OF THE BLACK DUDE'S HONDA. _-M
          The Black Dude comes toward him.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          76,

                         BLACK DUDE
          Oh no no no. You're gonna get outta this
          car and hand me over a license and some
          insurance. We gonna do this right. Man,
          I think I got whiplash and shit.
          A SCREECH. Phil looks back to see FRANK AND HARRY'S
          TOTnNCAR coming around the corner.

                         PHIL
          Shit.
          Thinking fast, Phil jumps out of his car and hops into
          the Black Dude's souped up Honda.

                         BLACK DUDE
          Hey! HEY! What do you think you're
          doing?
          The Black Dude chases after him, trying the driver's
          door, but Phil's LOCKED it. Phil yells to Clara.

                         PHIL

          PUT IT IN REVERSE AND GUN IT, CLARA!

                         CLARA
          What? That's insane!

                         E
          Frank and Harry's car SPEEDS TOWARDS THEM. It will smash
          into them in seconds...

                         PHIL

          I KNOW IT IS! BUT DO IT!
          Freaked, Clara hops to the driver's seat and switches to
          reverse, and guns it. At the same moment, Phil steps on
          the gas.
          The Black Dude, hanging onto the driver's door, SCREAMS
          as he's THROWN ONTO THE HOOD. The conjoined cars SHIMMY
          SHAMMY BACKWARD, just in time to dodge the Towncar. The
          Black Dude scrambles for his life through the windshield
          into the passenger's seat next to Phil.

                         BLACK DUDE

          JESUS CHRIST! WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH

          YOU?!!

                         PHIL

          NOW PUT IT IN DRIVE!

                         CLARA
          Huh?

                         BLACK DUDE

          JESUS! JESUS!

                         

                         

                         

                         

          77.

                         PH IL

          PUT IT IN DRIVE NOW!

                         CLARA
          Phil, this is-

                         BLACK DUDE

          JESUS JESUS!

                         PHIL

          DO IT!
          (to Black Dude)

          AND YOU! CUT THE JESUS!
          Mumbling angrily, Clara puts her car in drive and steps
          on it. Their cars lurch then burn asphalt as the wheels
          smoke and speed up in the OTHER DIRECTION. They race
          past Frank again, who angrily whips the Towncar around in
          pursuit.
          Looking over his shoulder, Phil tries to steer their
          conjoined cars down the middle of the street, but he and
          Clara are out of sync and their attached cars veer :ildly
          back and forth. They hit the curb at an angle and -JcK
          DOWN a whole row of mail boxes until Phil spins h--'-s v;:-reel,
          getting them back into the street.

                         BLACK DUDE
          Just let me out, OK? You can have it! 1ï¿½1
          You can have it!

                         PHIL

                         (IGNORING HIM)

          DAMMIT! TRY TO KEEP IT STRAIGHT CLARA!

                         CLARA

          STOP YELLING AT ME!

                         PHIL
          I'm not yelling! I'm just talking in an
          very animated voice!
          Looking back over his shoulder again, Phil sees they're
          approaching the lar
          ge intersection with Michigan Avenue.

                         PHIL (CONT'D)
          OK, now when I say so, spin your wheel!

                         (BEAT)

          NOW!
          On his command, Clara spins her wheel sharply to t1-
          right., but it's the wrong way and their cars JACK
          across the road. An ONCOMING SUV honks desperately.

                         PHIL (CONT'D)
          Ahhhh! Other way! Other way!

                         

                         

                         

                         

          78.
          Flustered, Clara WHIPS her wheel in the other direction,
          and their two cars tilt up on four wheels (out of eight),
          barely screeching past.
          Landing again and taking in a deep breath, Phil shoots
          her a pissed off look.

                         CLARA
          What? You just said spin the wheel,
          Phil! You didn't say which way.

                         PHIL
          Yes I did!

                         CLARA
          No you didn't!

                         BLACK DUDE
          She's right! You di

                         CLARA

                         (VINDICATED)
          God! Thank you! Can we take him home?
          I need him!
          Both Phil and the Black Dude sees that the Towncar's
          turned onto Michigan Avenue and is still right behind
          E them.

                          BLACK DUD
           Aw man!

                         PHIL

                         (TO CLARA)
          I say our best chance is to reverse
          again, then use both engines to floor
          as fast as we can all the way down
          Michigan.

                         CLARA
          Why stay on Michigan?

                         PHIL
          Why stay on Michigan? Because it's a
          wider street.

                         LARA
          It's also a busier street! I think it
          would be better to try to branch off.

                         PHIL

                         (SIGHS)
          Why do you have a problem with every
          route I take?
          Flustered, Phil turns to the Black Dude next to him to
          commiserate, unaware that his STEERING WHEEL DRIFTS.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          79.

                         1Ï¿½1

                         PHIL (CONT'D)
          She does this wherever we go! Every
          time!
          Phil doesn't notice the LIGHTS GROWING BRIGHTER behind
          him..

                         CLARA

          PHIL!
          LOUD HONNNNNNNKKKKKK. Phil and the Black Dude look over
          their shoulders to see they're heading straight for a

          DELIVERY TRUCK.

          PHIL, CLARA AND BLACK DUDE

          AHHHH!
          Phil SPINS the wheel sharply and they go SIDEWAYS,
          jumping the curb and soaring into MILLENNIUM PARK.
          In their car following them, Frank and Harry's -mouths
          drop.

          EXT. MCCORMICK ICE RINK

          The conjoined cars sail across the
          grass and SMASH
          THROUGH a barrier, landing on the MCCORMICK ICE RINK.
          Their cars PINWHEEL OUT OF CONTROL across the ice. Phil,
          Clara, and the Black Dude are all WIDE EYED as the world
          is a SPINNING BLUR around them.
          Finally, they hit the other side. Getting his bearings,
          Phil sees the Towncar has entered the park after them.
          He searches where to go next, then spots something.

                         PHIL
          Clara! Reverse it, keep it straight
          put your foot to the floor. Give it
          everything!
          Clara reverses and Phil puts the car in drive and floors
          it. The car goes faster... faster...

                         BLACK
          Oooh. I really woulc_n.'t be doing that.

                         CLARA
          Doing what? What are you doing?!?
          Clara glances over her shoulder. Their heading strai
          toward a CONCRETE STAIRWAY.

          CL. (CONT'D)
          Oh God.

                         1Ï¿½1

                         PHIL
          Just trust me!
          The conjoined cars HIT the steps and their wheels SMOKE
          as the TWO ENGINES POWER TOGETHER ALL THE WAY UP THE

          STAIRWAY!
          The Towncar tries the follow them, but its single engine
          doesn't have enough power. Swearing under his breath,
          Frank reverses back down the steps.

          EXT. CLOUD GATE

          Phil and the Black Guy both look back over their
          shoulders as they speed by Anish Kapoor's large metallic
          CLOUD GATE. No sign of the Towncar. The Black Guy holds
          up his hand for Phil.

                         BLACK DUDE
          Ha HA! That last move was wicked, man.
          Wicked.
          They try to give each other a fancy handshake, but Phil,
          the WHITEST MAN EVER, muddles it up.

                         PHIL
          â¢ Sorry.

                         BLACK DUDE
          s cool.

                         CLARA

                         (SPOTTING SOMETHING)
          They're back.
          They peek again over their shoulders. The Towncar's
          driven around and is now BACK ON THEIR TAILS.

                         BLACK DUDE
          Jesus! What the hell are you guys in
          trouble for?

          EXT. GREAT LAWN

          Phil and Clara's conjoined cars barrel across the gr ss
          of the Great Lawn in Millennium park, then SPIN onto
          Columbus Drive, the Towncar giving chase.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         81

          EXT. COLUMBUS DRIVE

          Phil peeks back over his shoulder then sighs, looking at
          Clara.

                         PHIL
          Can we just try to work together at this?

                         CLARA

                         PHIL-

                         PHIL
          I'm not blaming you. Please?
          Clara nods.

                         PHIL (CONT'D)
          Now whatever direction I give you, take
          your normal version of it and tone it
          down like 85 percent, OK?

                         CLARA
          35 percent. Fine.

                          PHIL
          OK. Small left. Now!

                          E
          Clara breathes deeply and turns her wheel slightly lefts
          They ZOOM around the corner.

                         PHIL (CONT'D)

                         (LOOKING BACK)
          Yes! That was awesome! Perfect, Clara!
          Now give me a medium right. Do it!
          She does and they veer sharply and perfectly onto another
          street.

                         CLAA
          Yes!

                         BLACK DUDE

          They make the slightest turn.

                         PHIL
          Yes!
          (spotting something ahead)
          No.

                         BLACK DUDE
          Oh no.

                         CLARA
          What?
          Clara turns around to look. LIGHTS FLASH as a BARRIER
          comes down across the road - A DRAWBRIDGE ahead is slowly
          rising.
          Phil looks behind - the Towncar's got them closed in.
          The Black Dude peeks back as well, then turns to Phil.

                         BLACK DUDE
          say we can pop you guys up and over.

                         PHIL

                         H

                         CLARA
          Excuse me? What are you talking about,
          "pop you guys up and over?"

                         E

                         BLACK DUDE
          You climb over, then we both reverse it
          and leadfoot the motherfuckers. Send you
          flying over the top.

                         CLARA
          What?
          Sucking in a breath, Phil hands control of the car back
          to the Black Dude. As the conjoined cars zoom toward the
          drawbridge, Phil CRAWLS ON THE ATTACHED HOODS FROM ONE
          WINDSHIELD TO THE OTHER, sitting next to Clara.

                         CLARA (CONT'D)
          Phil, don't even think of it.

                         PHIL
          can do it. Clara.

                         CLARA
          No, Phil. We can't! It's suicide!

                         BLACK DUDE
          Here we go now... One... two... THREE!

                         CLARA

          NO!

                         

                         

                         

                         

          83.
          But Phil reaches over and switches the gear to reverse,
          stepping on Clara's foot to GUN IT.

                         CLARA (CONT'D)

          AHHHH!
          The two cars SMOKE as their wheels spin in opposite
          directions, then DISLODGE. Phil and Clara's car flies
          reverse UP ONE SIDE OF THE DIAGONAL DRAWBRIDGE...
          .and LANDS SPINNING IN A FLURRY OF SPARKS OVER ON THE
          OTHER SIDE, causing AIR BAGS to deploy all around Phil
          and Clara.
          The Black Dude spins his steering wheel, jack-knifing his
          Honda across the road, and PUTS ON HIS SEAT BELT. Frank
          and Harry's eyes go wide as Frank jams on his brakes, but
          the Towncar CRASHES right into the Honda.
          ugh his broken window, the Black Dude grins at Frank
          and Harry.

                         BLACK DUDE
          Hope you all got insurance.
          Hitting a button, he starts a FIBER-OPTIC LIGHT SHOW on
          his Honda.

          INT. PHIL AND CL ARA' S CAR - CONTINUOUS

          As their car comes to a SMOKING, SPINNING STOP in the
          middle of the deserted road, Phil sandwiched in air bags,
          catches his breath.

                         PHIL

                         (INVIGORATED)
          We did it! We did it!
          A DOOR SLAM. Phil moves an air bag aside to see Clara
          MARCHING AWAY down the street.

          EXT. OTHER SIDE OF THE BRIDGE - CONTINUOUS

          Phil rushes after Clara, trying to catch up.
          Where are you going?

                         CLARA
          I want to make sure that at least one
          our son's parents survives tonight!

                         PHIL
          What?

          84.

                         CLARA
          You almost just got us killed!

                         PHIL
          I see. I almost got us killed. Forget
          about the people chasing and shooting at
          us all night long because of the
          reservation you stole.

                         CLARA
          There's a difference between fleeing from
          people shooting at you and knowingly
          driving a car in reverse over an open
          drawbridge!

                         PHIL
          Unbelievable! You know, all you complain
          about is that I don't take risks anymore.
          Then the second I do, you get mad at me
          for doing it! I can't win with you!

                         CLARA
          Poor Phil! You have i so bad, don't
          you!

                         PHIL
          Oh, you have no idea! Every single day
          from the moment we wake up you're bossy,
          â¢ disapproving, inconsiderate-

                         CLARA
          I'm inconsiderate? I'M INCONSIDERATE?!?
          Have you ever seen our bathroom in the
          morning after Tsunami Phil's blown
          through? The floor! The sink! You use
          my toothbrush.

                         PHIL
          What's the difference? Afraid you're
          gonna get my cooties?

                         CLARA
          I want my own toothbrush, Phil! Sue me!
          And how many years have I asked you to do
          a simple thing like put the toilet paper
          in right?

                         PHIL
          Listen to yourself! You have problems
          with how I pqt in the toilet paper!

                         C
          Because under makes no sense, Phil!
          Under makes no sense! When it's under it
          doesn't pull off right! It just keeps
          spinning and spinning and doesn't cascade
          properly!

                         CLARA (CONTVD)
          After ten years of asking you to have
          roll the right way, you still can't do
          it!

                         PHIL
          Yeah, how about the fact that I have not
          woken up with our comforter over me once
          in those 10 nears! You steal the whole
          thing away from me every night and
          mummify yourself.

                         CLARA
          What? Phil, I do not "steal" the
          comforter. It just happens when we're-

          I see your hock leg lock maneuver. Don't
          think I don't!

                         (ILLUSTRATING)
          You wrap that leg around and lock the
          comforter down then reeeeel it in so I
          can't pull it at all.

          be the one to "finish" it and replace it?

          You're right. I do that. You know why
          do that, Clara?

                         CLARA
          Because you don't want to haul your

          What? No aspirin in the wonderpurse?
          How could it be?
          Clara, furious, HURLS her purse at Phil's head. He ducks
          and the contents spill all over the road.

                         CLARA
          Screw you, Phil!

                         PHIL
          Yeah, fine! Sure! Screw me ! Even if I
          survive tonight I'm screwed all around
          anyway! Screwed with you! Screwed with
          my job!

                         CLARA
          What are you talking about, screwed with
          your job?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          87.

                         1Ï¿½1

                         PHIL
          was supposed to spend all tonight
          guring out a new brilliant plan for the
          fund so George wouldn't take it over
          tomorrow. Doesn't look like that's gonna
          happen!

                         CLARA
          Why didn't you tell me?

                         PHIL
          I don't know, Clara. Maybe because I
          didn't want you chiming in on how Mr.
          Rivers was right. He wants the new guy
          for all the reasons you complain about
          me! Someone who doesn't "play it safe."
          Someone who'll "take a risk."

                         CLARA
          I can't believe that's what you think
          do.

                         PHI
          Yeah, well...

                         (BEAT)
          You know, when you set up this whole
          "magical" night, in that dress... I got
          this glimmer that it was going to be like
          it used to be with us. But... I don't
          know. I guess we're just not those
          people anymore.

                         CLARA

                         (BEAT)
          I guess we're not.
          Shaking his head, Phil turns and walks away do-- the
          street. Clara, trying to hold it together, h
          and starts to gather the items from her purse
          something catches his eye. She picks up the
          ENVELOPE that Dora put in her bag.

          EXT. ROADWAY - MOMENTS LATER

          As Phil walks along, Clara comes running up behind him.
          Phil! Phil!
          She steps in front of him, trying to catch her breath.

                         PHIL
          I think we said all needs to be said
          right now, Clara.
          Panting, Clara holds out the manila envelope.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          88.

                         CLARA
          This... this... this...

                         PHIL
          What?

                         CLARA

                         (PANTING)
          Side cramp... Wow.
          She hands Phil the manila envelope and bends down, trying
          to stop her cramp. Confused, Phil opens it and looks at
          the pictures inside. His brow furrows.

                         PHIL
          What is it?
          Clara looks over his shoulder, shakes her head and TURNS
          THE PICTURE THE OTHER WAY AROUND. Phil's eyes go wide.

                         PHIL (CONT'D)
          Oh jeez. It's... it's...

                         C
          It's the Mayor.
          Phil looks at Clara, taking it all in.

          PHIL (V.0.)
          I bet this didn't have anything to do
          with Stockton at first.

          EXT. DESERTED STREETS - LATER

          Phil and Clara walk quickly down the street as they piece
          things together.

                         PHIL
          The Mayor must have gone to Stockton's
          club one night. He saw Dora working
          there and obviously gave some sign that
          he was interested.

                         CLARA
          So much for "Mr. Squeaky Clea

                         PHIL
          Her sleazy boyfriend Ray finds out and
          convinces her to take him up on it so
          they could photograph it and blackmail
          him.

                         CLARA
          They knew it was an election year and he
          would have to pay them whatever they
          asked.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          89.

                         PHIL
          But somehow Stockton found out about the
          photos too and wanted that power over the
          mayor himself.

                         CLARA
          So he sent his guys to the restaurant to
          intercept the Gales and get the photos.

                         PHIL
          But Ray and Dora spotted them and bailed
          before the Mayor even had a chance to
          show up.
          Phil thinks. He snaps his fingers.

                         CLARA
          What?

                         PHIL
          If we could find some way to get in touch
          with the mayor directly, without anyone
          else knowing, there actually might be a
          way out of this for us.
          Clara thinks for a moment. A light comes to her eyes.

                         CLARA
          can.

          DOORMAN BUILDING - LATER THAT NIGHT
          Phil and Clara walk into the lobby of the doorman
          building and start toward the elevator, straight past the

          NIGHT DOORMAN.

                         DOORMAN
          Whoa whoa whoa. Where do you
          you're going?

                         CLARA
          Oh, we're guests of Apartment 605
          The Doorman picks up the phone to call the apartmen

                         DOORMAN
          And you are?
          looks at him in shock.

                         CLARA
          Are you crazy? It's 4 in the morning!
           We were lust out for dinner. Trust me

          there.

                         CLARA
          Please. Just look at us!
          The Doorman looks at Phil and Clara - a white, well
          dressed suburban couple.

                         DOORMAN
          OK. Yeah. Go ahead.
          The elevator door opens and they get inside.

                         PHIL
          Have a nice night.

                         DOORMAN
          You too.

                         ELEVATOR
          As the elevator doors close, Phil and Clara look at each
          other, then simultaneously slip PAPER BAGS with EYE and
          MOUTH HOLES over their heads.

          INT. MRS. CARDIGAN'S APARTMENT - MOMENTS LATER

          Mrs. Cardigan, in her frilly nightgown with her eyemask
          pulled up on her forehead, walks through her dark living
          room toward the POUNDING on her front door.

          PHIL (O.S.)

                         (THROUGH DOOR)

          GAS AK LADY! OPEN UP!

          MRS. CARDIGAN
          All right. All-
          As Mrs. Cardigan opens the door, Phil and Clara, in their
          masks, BUM RUSH her. Screaming, Cardigan dodges, running
          back to her desk. Phil and Clara give chase, but
          Cardigan grabs a LARGE METAL YARDSTICK and starts
          WHOPPING PHIL over and over on his paper bag head,
          screaming the whole time.

           MRS. CARDIGAN (CONT'D)

          AHHHHH!

                         PHIL

          OW! OW! OW!
          Clara grabs her from behind, bringing her down.

                         1Ï¿½1

          Having put Cardigan's eyenask back over her eyes, Clara,
          bag off, holds Cardigan in a chair as Phil comes back
          into the living room holding two spools of FUZZY YARN.

                         PHIL
          I can't find any rope. Only yarn.

                         CLARA
          Yarn? Fine. Just use that. I'll start
          looking.
          Phil gets to work, wrapping the yarn over and over, tying
          Cardigan's arms to the back of the chair, while Clara
          searches Cardigan's desk.

          MRS. CARDIGAN
          You two weren't very prepared.

                         PHIL
          Excuse me?

          MRS. CARDIGAN

                         E
          You should have been more prepared.
          Thought ahead and brought the rope
          you.

          across her throat.

          If you're done tying her up, come over
          and help.
          Phil crosses the room and starts going through notebooks
          on the desk.

          MRS. CARDIGAN
          The name's Cardigan, not Rockefeller, if
          you haven't figured it out yet! What

          Phil picks up and flips quickly through a notebook, when
          he spots something and doubles back, starting to read.
          His brow furrows.
          Clara, deep in her own workbook, suddenly brightens.

                         CLARA (CONT'D)

          She notices Phil's expression.

          CLARA (CONT ' D )
          What?
          hands the book to Clara to read. She does and

          go home, Mr. Mayor.

          INT. MAYOR'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

          The Mayor looks over nervously as his wife stirs. She
          goes back to snoring and he whispers into the phone
          again.

                         MAYOR DIGGS

          If you really can get me... what I was
          supposed to receive earlier without this
          getting out, I promise you I'll take care
          of your safety.

                         PHIL (PHONE)
          But now the police think that-

          Clara sees Phil furrow his brow, confused.

                         CLARA
          is it?
          Phil's concentrating hard on something. Thinking.

          MAYOR DIGGS (PHONE)

          The Mayor rubs his forehead.

          Of course. And... thank you.
          Click. The Mayor hangs up the phone and quietly leaves
          the bedroom.

          INT. MAYOR D'S HOME OFFICE

           Downing a glass of scotch, the Mayor sits at his desk and
           lets out a sigh of relief. Beat. He picks up his desk
          phone and dials.

          ON STOCKTON'S MONITOR in front of him we see that Frank
          and Harry hold a wounded Ray and Dora in the meat locker.

          MAYOR DIGGS (PHONE)
          They thought you were stealing the photos
          from the Gales to try to blackmail me
          yourself.

          Phil and Clara sit silently on the steps of the
          beautiful, old Alder Planetarium looking at dawn hitting
          the CHICAGO SKYLINE.

          Probably the last time we were here.

          Who needs white truffles when you've got
          a lemon zest Luna bar.
          Clara breaks it in two and hands half to Phil. They
          click the halves together, toasting each other, then
          silently chew, looking out. Phil shakes his head and
          starts GIGGLING.

                         CLARA (CONT'D)
          What?

          OK, what happened to us tonight?

          Clara starts laughing too.

          It's not funny.

                         PHIL
          No, I know it's not funny. It's not
          funny at all.

                         CLARA

                         PHIL
          Why are you laughing?
          They're both cracking up... then Phil notices a moment
          later that Clara's laughter has turned to

          don't even have a plane! No plane! I'm

          help whenever you feel like it is. With
          Ollie. Whatever. You just never act
          like you need me to.

                         CLARA
          That's because as it is you see us as a

          You think I see you guys as a

          You don't understand... I have this wife
          who does everything better than anyone
          I've ever known. And the greatest son.
          You want to know why I obsess so much
          about my stupid job? Because I want to
          feel like... like I can do something good
          enough to deserve someone like you. I
          mean, I look at you and I jest don't

          That's crazy, Phil. You do. You're a
          god man. You're the best man I know.

          with that guy, Phil. I just... want us
          to be on the same team again.
          As Clara sniffles, Phil takes this in for a beat. He
          nods.

                         PHIL
          Listen, you know what I said before,
          about not being the people we used to be?

                         CLARA
          Phil, we were angry-

                         PHIL
          No, Clara. It's true. We're not. And I
          know I'm going to drive you crazy again,
          and you're definitely going to drive me
          crazy. But I wouldn't want to do it with

                         CLARA
          Yeah, we did. You know the worst part
          about not talking about all this
          recently?

                         PHIL
          What?

                         CLARA
          We missed out on a lot of make up sex.

          They get up and start walking down the steps to meet him.

          EXT. BOTTOM OF STEPS - MOMENTS LATER

          Phil and Clara meet the Mayor at the bottom of the steps.
          Clara takes the manila envelope out of her purse, handing
          it to him.

                         PHIL
          This is what you're looking for. I've
          tten down our information inside.

                         MAYOR DIGGS
          And that's it?

                         PHIL
          That's it. We're going home now.
          The Mayor nods, and Phil and Clara start walking past him
          toward the parking lot. Mayor Diggs stays behind,
          nervously tapping the envelope in his hand.
          As Phil and Clara get halfway to the lot, ALL THE MAYOR'S
          CAR DOORS OPEN, and Manning, Frank, Harry, and Mr.
          Stockton climb out. Frank and Harry pop the trunk and
          grab SHEETS OF CLEAR PLASTIC. Phil's eyes go wide.

                         PHIL (CONT'D)
          Oh God. Run, Clara!
          Phil and Clara start to run, when a GUNSHOT hits the
          ground in front of them. They turn, when ANOTHER SHOT
          rings out.

                         LIEUTENANT MANNING
          The next one won't be a warning shot.
          They look over to see Manning training a gun as he and
          Stockton walk toward them, Harry and Frank behind with
          the plastic.

          MR. STOCKTON
          (to Harry and Frank
          Let's do it over there.
          y and Frank quickly throw the plastic sheets down on
          the grass nearby.

          As Mayor Diggs starts to walk back to the parking lot, he
          opens the manila envelope. Manning gestures for Phil and
          Clara to walk to the plastic sheets.

                         PHIL

          Resigned, Phil and Clara sadly look at each other, then
          walk to stand in front of the plastic on the ground.

          Phil, scared, holds out his hand to Clara. She takes
          looking back at him and they kneel in front of the
          plastic, side by side.
          Mr. Stockton nods to Lieutenant Manning, who checks his
          gun.

          Mr. Stockton's face blanches.

          MR. STOCKTON

          Why do you keep interrupting, Terrence?

                         PHIL
          Maybe because according to the paperwork
          you've got there, he owns Falconwood.

                         CLARA
          Not only that, you'll see those other
          pages that he also owns a cc=rpany called
          Eurostruct - which rents the city all of
          its construction equipment.

          MR. STOCKTON
          Frank, Harry!
          Frank and Harry reach for their guns, but Manning turns
          his gun on them.

          103.

                         PHIL
          The more violations Falconwood finds, the
          longer Eurostruct rents the equipment.
          That turns into big bucks, Mr. Mayor.
          I'm sure that's not a moral problem for
          you, but he's kind of screwing you in an
          election year, isn't he? Some of us are
          pretty pissed off about the roads.
          Mayor Diggs flips through the documents, taking it all

                         MAYOR DIGGS
          You did this to me? I don't get it,
          Terrence. Why? How much do you need? I
          have the Lieutenant here watch your back
          on all of your gambling clubs-

          MR. STOCKTON
          Oh, do you mean the ones that you gamble
          at? Where I cover your debts? Those
          clubs?

                         MAYOR DIGGS
          I slipped your company 5 no-bid
          foreclosed buildings for a dollar each
          downtown.

          MR. STOCKTON â¢
          You think that pays for what I do for
          you? The girls I have to pay off? The
          jet charters? And let's not even get
          into your "re-election fund"! Let's not
          even go there!

                         PHIL

                         ( `TIKES HEAD)
          Listen to them.
          Stockton angrily pulls his own the gun out of his jacket
          pocket, shoving it against the back of Phil's neck.

          MR. STOCKTON
          How did you get this? How?

           HOLBROOKE (O.S.)

          Manning tried to object, pulling out his bad

                         HOLBROOKE (CONT'D)
          Yeah, yeah. I know all about you, buddy.
          With a smile Phil and Clara get up, disconnecting the
          WIRES under their clothing. Seeing them hand over the
          wires to Holbrooke, it hits Mayor Diggs what he's just
          revealed.

                         MAYOR DIGGS
          Aw fuck.

                         HOLBROOKE
          Yeah. They just need me downtown in half
          an hour for a news conference with the
          Deputy Mayor. Want it for the morning
          shows.

                         PHIL
          Don't think they're going to be calling
          you the IT guy any-more.

                         HOLBROOKE
          Listen guys, I feel weird about not even
          acknowledging you two.

                         CLARA
          Don't.

                         HOLBROOKE
          But you should be up there with me. You
          handed this whole case to me.

          (smiles, winks)
          Yeah, well-, that's how we roll.

          EXT. DOORSTEP - DAWN

          As Clara opens the front door, Phil slowly bends down,
          picking up the morning paper.

          CHAZ (O.S.)
          Hey hey! Up bright and early, aren
          Phil looks over to see his overly cheery neighbor Chaz in
          his jogging suit. He smiles, appreciating Chaz for the
          first time.

                         PHIL
          Yep. We sure are.
          As he joins Clara on the doorstep, they take each other
          in.

          Yeah. You know, I think I'm gonna be OK.

          I had a good time tonight.

          Yeah. Me too. It was fun.

                         CLARA
          It was.

                         PHIL
          So... let's do this again sometime?

                         (SMILE)
          like that.
          For the first time the whole night, THEY KISS.
          Interlocking fingers, they head inside, closing their
          front door behind them.

          FACE OUT.

EXT. KIDNET STUDIO -C - EVENING

A man in a puffy foam-rubber rhinoceros costume dancing
under the bright friendly lights of a television studio.
Another rhino and various foam-rubber animals dance
behind him to the happy MUSIC. The rhino finishes his
number and takes a bow. A bleacher full of kids bursts
into wild applause.


INT. BACKSTAGE - MOMENTS LATER

After the taping. The rhino lumbers down the hallway
toward wardrobe. He is suddenly grabbed by two large men
and dragged out through the exit into...


INT. DARK PARKING GARAGE

... where several   thugs in overcoats emerge from the
shadows and start   beating him with lead pipes. One of
the men pulls out   a GUN and SHOOTS the rhino several
times. The SHOTS    REVERBERATE through the empty garage.

INT. TELEVISION STUDIO - DAY

It's the taping of another children's show -- "Rainbow
Randolph and the Krinkle Kids." RANDOLPH SMILEY, a
clean-cut man with a happy face and yellow bow tie,
dances through Rainbowland with the "Krinkle Kids"
(little people in top hats). He sings one of his
signature songs: "Friends Come In All Sizes." One of
the main Krinkle Kids -- ANGELO PIKE -- dances behind
him.

                         RANDOLPH
                 (singing)

MONTAGE - RAINBOW RANDOLPH MERCHANDISE

"Sugar Rainbows Cereal," plastic toys lined up on store
shelves, kids playing with Randolph dolls, kids eating
"Rainbow Potato Chips" and "Rainbow Candies." A "Rainbow
Burster," a kind of gun that shoots plastic rainbows.
Marquees announcing upcoming live appearances, etc. We
get the picture. Rainbow Randolph is the king of the
kid shows.


INT. DIMLY-LIT BAR - NIGHT

A suburban-looking HUSBAND and WIFE enter. They find
Rainbow Randolph sitting alone, drinking a Scotch. Hair
slicked back, sans bow tie, the friendly face no longer
looks so friendly. He nods for them to sit down. After
a nervous beat, the Husband puts a briefcase on the table
and slides it to Randolph. Randolph takes a gulp of his
Scotch. He unsnaps the briefcase and opens it. Five
grand stares him in the face.

                     HUSBAND
             So... uh... you'll make sure my
             boy dances up front, right? Where
             he'll get the most camera time?

Randolph slams the briefcase shut, startling the couple.

                     RANDOLPH
             You want your kid on the show?

                                       (CONTINUED)

                                                           3.

             Of... of course.

                     WIFE
             Yes, very much.

                     RANDOLPH
             Then don't tell me how to run my
             fucking business.

                     HUSBAND
             No, no, we were just --

Randolph rises. He takes a final gulp of his Scotch and
picks up the briefcase.

                     RANDOLPH
             I'll call you if a spot opens up.

He starts to walk off. Suddenly, the Husband and Wife
jump up from the table holding guns.

                     HUSBAND
             Freeze, you cocksucker!

                     WIFE
             Drop the briefcase!

Federal agents storm into the bar and surround Randolph.


EXT. TIMES SQUARE - DAWN

Bundles of the morning editions are tossed onto the curb
from passing trucks.   The various headlines blare:

"RAINBOW RANDOLPH BUSTED ACCEPTING BRIBE"

"FCC PROBES KID SHOW BIZ"

"CORRUPTION IN KRINKLELAND"


INT. TELEVISION STUDIO - DAY

The Rainbow Randolph/Krinkle Kid set is being dismantled.
Backdrops are rolled up and the giant rainbow centerpiece
is wheeled off. Workers with push brooms sweep up tons
of glittery "magic Rainbow dust."

INT. NETWORK BOARDROOM - KIDNET - DAY

We are TIGHT ON the sweating face of a MAN who looks like
he's about to be executed.

STOKES

is standing at the end of a long conference table as the
NETWORK BRASS glares at him.

                        STOKES
             (addressing the brass)
          Gentlemen, let me be the first to
          say, in all sobriety, that I'm as
          shocked and outraged as all of --

The network CEO, a hog of a man, cuts him off.

                  CEO
          Save it for the papers, Stokes.
          We've got nervous sponsors and an
          angry public -- a combination
          uglier than two monkeys fucking.
          What are you doing about it?

                  STOKES
          Well, sir, I'm currently in the
          process of compiling a list of
          viable replacements and it's my
          hope...

                  CEO
          Clean replacements?    With
          background checks? I assure you,
          Mr. Stokes, this network cannot
          survive another Rainbow Randolph.
          The goddamn P.R. department looks
          like the Jim Jones camp.

Another EXECUTIVE chimes in.

                  EXECUTIVE #1
          Remember, Stokes, this was your
          dog that crapped on our rug.

                        EXECUTIVE #2
          We trusted you, Frank. And now
          we're in a tight spot. We have to
          post our quarterly earnings next
          month, for Christ's sake.

                   CEO
          Whoever takes that slot has to be
          a straight arrow. Clean as a
          whistle.

                  EXECUTIVE #3
          Right. Someone who'll take the
          heat off. One of those sweater
          types. Any chance of luring Fred
          Rogers away from P.B.S.?

                     EXECUTIVE #4
             Yeah, if we back up the Brinks
             truck.

                           EXECUTIVE #1
             No way. The idea now is to stop
             the hemorrhaging.

                           EXECUTIVE #2
             You better fix this, Stokes. Get
             us a white bread replacement,
             fast. Bland, milk toast. Not a
             speck of controversy.

A giant hand slams on the table. All heads snap.
The CEO drags his fingers along the shiny mahogany.
Deafening sound.

                     CEO
                (calm and measured)
             Squeaky fucking clean.


INT. STOKES' OFFICE - DAY

Stokes sits behind his mahogany desk, sipping a glass of
wine as he goes over potential Randolph replacements with
NORA BISHOP, his pretty protege.

                     STOKES
             Bumble Bee Billy?

                     NORA

             Wife beater.

                     STOKES
             Square Dance Danny?

                     NORA
             Still appealing the mail fraud
             thing.

                     STOKES
             Skippy Black and the Tippy Trolls?

                     NORA
             Black was deported, and the
             trolls... well, who gives a shit.

Nora kicks the table in frustration.

                                        (CONTINUED)

                                                          6.

CONTINUED:

                     NORA
             This is impossible. If I ever see
             that Rainbow Randolph again I'll
             strangle him. Choke the life out
             of him. Squeeze his scrawny neck
             until his eyes pop out of his
             skull and bounce off the walls...

                     STOKES
             Before indulging such cheery
             fantasies, let's just concentrate
             on saving my job. Shall we?

                     NORA
             Sorry, Frank.

Stokes flips through a thick stack of files.      He suddenly
stops at one.

                     STOKES
             What's going on with Sheldon Mopes
             these days.

Nora laughs.

                     NORA
             Oh my God. Have we sunk to that
             level already? Smoochy the Rhino?
             What a sap.

                     STOKES
             Sap's just the pill we need right
             now. Mopes is a straight arrow.
             Always has been.

                     NORA
             The guy can't get arrested, Frank.
             He can't even break into the
             birthday party circuit. Last I
             heard he was working hospitals and
             nursing homes. He's a joke.

Stokes stands up and walks around the room.

                     STOKES
             The truth of the matter is, a
             successful children's show has
             always depended on two simple
             elements: a fuzzy costume and a
             lot of hype. Strip away the foam
             rubber and the network money and
             they're all jokes. Marginal
             talents.. cabaret acts... off-
             Broadway runoff...

             I probably have ten acts in my
             development file -- acts I've been
             cultivating -- that are more
             deserving than Sheldon Mopes.

                     STOKES
             And each one a moral question
             mark. Something I can't risk at
             the moment.

                     NORA
                (frustrated)
             We can do better than this guy,
             Frank. He brings nothing to the
             table.

                     STOKES
             Except ethics. With Mopes,
             there's never been a whiff of
             controversy. The man's an
             ethical, harmless, cornball. In
             short, a glass of milk on two
             legs.

Stokes stops pacing.

                     NORA
             Don't ask me to do it. You know
             I'll do anything for you, but
             please... not this...

Stokes gazes out the window at the city.

                     STOKES
             Go find Smoochy.


EXT. CONEY ISLAND - EARLY EVENING

The lighted Ferris wheel spins CENTER FRAME. We CRANE
DOWN and eventually LAND ON a side street with the
amusement park looming in the b.g. We're in FRONT of a
small building. The half-lit neon sign reads: CONEY
ISLAND METHADONE CENTER. We DRIFT THROUGH the double
doors THROUGH the reception area where random junkies
loiter and fill out paperwork. We CONTINUE DOWN a
narrow hallway as the faint sound of someone SINGING and
playing the GUITAR INCREASES. We finally burst THROUGH
another set of doors marked "Treatment Room." The
singing now fills our ears as we PUSH IN ON the
"performer" -- a big, puffy, orange rhinoceros. Smoochy.
Or to be more specific, SHELDON MOPES.

                                       (CONTINUED)

                                                          8.

CONTINUED:

Smoochy sits on a stool with his guitar and sings to the
patients as they stand in line before a sliding glass
window, where a nurse hands each person a little cup of
methadone which they immediately drink.

The Smoochy costume is a mass of misshapen orange foam
rubber that exposes Sheldon's painted face in the front.
A multi-colored horn protrudes from his forehead.

                     SMOOCHY (SHELDON)
                (singing to the tune
                 of 'She'll be Comin'
                 round the Mountain')
             'We'll get that monkey off your
               back,
             Yes we will, yes we will
             We'll get that monkey off your
               back,
             Yes we will...'

             'We'll get that monkey off your
               back
             And get your life right back on
               track
             If you'll just give up the smack
             Yes you will, yes you will!!'

The song ends.       A few baffled junkies applaud.

                     SMOOCHY
             Thanks, fellas. I'm rooting for
             you!

We PAN AWAY FROM Sheldon TO the exit.      Standing there in
her coat, looking mortified, is Nora.


INT. RECEPTION AREA - SHORT WHILE LATER

Nora sits in the reception area. Sheldon emerges in his
street clothes. He carries Smoochy's body on a hanger
over his shoulder and carries a large shopping bag which
holds Smoochy's head.

                     NORA
             Mr. Mopes?

Sheldon stops.

                       SHELDON
             Yeah?

                                          (CONTINUED)

                     NORA
             I, uh, saw your performance
             tonight. Very...
                (searching)
             ... spirited.

                      SHELDON
             Really? Thanks. I would've done
             a longer set if that guy hadn't
             pulled a knife on the security
             guard. Once the pepper spray
             starts flyin', that's it for the
             encores.

                     NORA
             Yes, that did put a damper on the
             evening, didn't it?

                     SHELDON
             Are you a new patient?   On the
             juice, as we say?

                     NORA
             Ah, no. But it's sweet of you to
             assume so.

She hands him her card.     He reads it.

                               SHELDON
             'Nora Bishop. V.P. of
             Development. Kidnet.'
                    (to Nora)
             Good gravy. You work for Kidnet?

                     NORA
             As stated.

Sheldon grabs her hand and shakes it.

                     SHELDON
             Well, it's a pleasure to meet you,
             Nora. A real honor. Hey, you
             hungry?


EXT. CONEY ISLAND BOARDWALK - NATHAN'S HOT DOGS - SHORT
WHILE LATER

Sheldon and Nora stand at the crowded counter at
Nathan's. Sheldon ravenously eats his sloppily-
garnished, oddly colored hot dog. Nora winces as
she watches him.

                     SHELDON
                (with full mouth)
             Soy dogs... never thought I'd
             live to see the day. Organic,
             rich in natural protein, and
             nobody gets killed. Although I
             do feel bad for the beans. Just
             kidding. Sure you don't want one?

                     NORA
             Believe it or not, no.

He takes another bite.

                     SHELDON
             So anyway, like I was saying,
             people always tell me, 'You gotta
             network, Sheldon... you gotta sell
             yourself... or you'll be playing
             the drug clinics and shopping
             centers the rest of your life.'
             And you know what I tell 'em?

                     NORA
             I haven't the foggiest.

                     SHELDON
             I tell 'em, it's not about the old
             handshake and back slap game.
             It's not about adding fuel to the
             shlock machine. It's about doing
             good work. Having integrity.
             Making people happy and delivering
             a positive message. Foundations
             are built with concrete, not
             plaster of Paris!

He pulls the stained, misshapen Smoochy head from the
shopping bag.

                     SHELDON
             This is concrete!   This is
             integrity!

                     NORA
                (calmly)
             I can see that.

Sheldon realizes his voice was getting too loud.

                     SHELDON
             Sorry. As you can imagine, living
             by your convictions can be a
             little stressful at times.

                                           (CONTINUED)

             We all have our cross to bear.

                     SHELDON
             See, I was raised by my
             grandfather, and Grandpop paved
             driveways for a living...

                     NORA
             Are we going into a story?

                     SHELDON
             Thing is, he didn't really pave
             them. Just covered them with
             black paint. Of course, once the
             first rain came along, people
             realized they'd been swindled. I
             vowed to myself back then that I'd
             never make a living through
             deception. Never. Whadda ya
             think of them apples?

Nora looks glassy-eyed.      She takes a deep breath.

                     NORA
             The reason I'm here today, Mr.
             Mopes, as fate would have it,
             Kidnet is currently looking for a
             performer with... convictions.
             And integrity. Someone like...

She almost chokes on the word.

                     NORA
             ... yourself.

Sheldon laughs.

                     SHELDON
             Yeah, right. Got any more jokes?

                     NORA
             I don't think I could top that
             one.

                     SHELDON
             Hold the phone. You're telling me
             that Kidnet is finally ready to do
             a show of Smoochy quality? Of
             Smoochy caliber?

                (dryly)
             Yes... I believe we're ready to
             push ourselves to that level.

                     SHELDON
             I knew this day   would come!
             After all these   years I finally
             meet someone in   the business who
             gets what I do.    Who gets what I'm
             all about. You    get me, don't you,
             Nora?

                     NORA
             I'm afraid so.

                     SHELDON
             Well, Miss V.P. of Development...
             let's go make history!

                                         CUT TO:


PREP MONTAGE

KIDNET STUDIO WARDROBE ROOM. A team of designers and
seamstresses cut, sew and shape endless sheets of orange
foam rubber. Sheldon stands on a wooden box as he's
measured from head to toe. On the wall is a blueprint
labeled "Smoochy the Rhino -- REDESIGN."

A costume designer walks over with the new Smoochy head
and places it on Sheldon.

As seamstresses fit him with the new Smoochy costume,
various signs and billboards FLOAT THROUGH the FRAME,
trumpeting copy like: "IT'S ALMOST SMOOCHY TIME!"
"GET READY TO BE SMOOCHED, AMERICA!" "ONLY TWO MORE
WEEKS TILL SMOOCHY!"


KIDNET STUDIO -C.

Sets, props, and camera equipment are rolled into the
studio. Through a SERIES of DISSOLVES we see the
Smoochyland Magic Jungle take shape.


KIDNET STUDIO -C - LATER

A choreographer maps out a number for Smoochy and the
"Rhinettes." (The Rhinettes are the former Krinkle Kid
little people with horns strapped to their foreheads.)

Nora and Stokes watch from the wings with a mixture of
uncertainty and disgust.

                                         DISSOLVE BACK TO:


WARDROBE ROOM

A seamstress zips up the back of the finished, redesigned
Smoochy costume. Sheldon stands proudly before the
design team. Smoochy is now television ready: smoothed
out, more colorful, less lumpy and exuding sunshiny
happiness.

                                        DISSOLVE TO:


STUDIO -C - BACKSTAGE

Smoochy is about to enter with the Rhinettes.      ANGELO, a
former Krinkle Kid, stands beside him.

                           SMOOCHY
             Angelo, you were always my favorite
             Krinkle Kid. The way you'd click
             your heels during the 'Jellybean
             Jam.' Real artistry. I'm honored
             to have you as a Rhinette.

                               ANGELO
             A job's a job.


STUDIO -C - PRACTICE TAPING

Suddenly lights up in all its multi-colored Smoochyland
glory. The bleachers are full of children.

                     ANNOUNCER (O.S.)
             Hey, kids! Who's your favorite
             rhino?

The kids in the bleachers all scream in unison.

                        KIDS
             Smoochy!

Smoochy bounds out on stage followed by the Rhinettes who
form a dancing circle around him.

                     SMOOCHY
             Hiya, kids!

                                        (CONTINUED)

             It's gonna be a fantabulous day in
             Smoochyland!!

The kids cheer as Smoochy and the Rhinettes featuring Angelo
Pike, go into their "It's a Fantabulous Day in Smoochyland"
number -- a catchy, bouncy song and dance routine that plays out
in the sugar-coated jungle of Smoochyland.

                     SMOOCHY
                (singing)
             'Ohhhh... it's a fantabulous day
             in Smoochy-land/Let's have a great
             big cheer for the Smoochy-land
             band/We'll dance with our jungle
             pals, won't that be grand/Oh, it's
             a fantabulous day in Smoochy-
             land!'

Smoochy dances right UP TO the CAMERA, FILLING the FRAME
with his friendly, puffy face.

END of prep MONTAGE.


EXT. DOCK BY RIVER - NIGHT (POURING RAIN)

A disheveled Randolph paces on a deserted dock. The
Brooklyn Bridge looms in the b.g. A car pulls up in the
b.g. Stokes gets out. Randolph moves under an awning.

                     RANDOLPH
             I was starting to think that maybe
             you weren't coming.

                     STOKES
             I agreed to meet you, didn't I?    I
             had a dinner engagement.

Randolph takes a swig from a flask.

                     RANDOLPH
             Really? You know, I used to have
             dinner engagements. Sometimes
             four, five a night. Dinner...
             drinks... I was the toast of the
             fucking town.

                     STOKES
             Don't start, Randolph.   Please.

                                        (CONTINUED)

                                                     15.

                     RANDOLPH
                (voice rising)
             Cars, boats, whores and horses, I
             had 'em all. When I walked into a
             restaurant, ten guys reached for
             my hat. When I stood up to take a
             piss, they cleared the rest room.
             I'd walk down the street and
             traffic stopped, mouths gaped.
             You know why? You know why,
             Frank?
                (now shouting)
             I was Rainbow fucking Randolph!
             That's why!

                     STOKES
             Are you through?

                     RANDOLPH
             What? You're in a hurry? You
             don't have time for me? The guy
             who earned for you? The guy who
             put those fucking suits on your
             back and the pheasant au vin in
             your Brooklyn mouth?

                     STOKES
             I think it's fair to say we helped
             each other.

Randolph suddenly breaks down.

                     RANDOLPH
                (pleading)
             You gotta fix it, Frank. You
             gotta get me my slot back.

He now clings to Stokes' lapels.

                     RANDOLPH
             How can I sit around while that
             rhinoceros... that horned
             carpetbagger gets a free ride on
             my dime? You and I have history,
             Frank! Please!

Stokes pries Randolph's hands from his overcoat.

                     STOKES
             There's nothing I can do for you.
             Nothing. You're a pariah. I
             can't even be seen with you.

                                       (CONTINUED)

                     RANDOLPH
             Don't do this to me, Frank. I'm in
             deep, deep shit. They kicked me out
             of the corporate penthouse... I got
             bookies breathing down my neck.
             I'm homeless! Don't you hear what
             I'm saying? I'm not gonna make it!
             The clock's ticking! Put yourself
             in my shoes, for Christ's sake!

                     STOKES
             The ugly truth is, your shoes have
             become my shoes. As long as the
             rhino's on the air, everything's
             by the book. No skim, no
             percentage. Nothing. The network
             wanted squeaky clean and they got
             it. And believe me, Mopes is
             sparkling.

He looks Randolph squarely in the eye.

                     STOKES
             You're totally broke? You don't
             have a dime left to your name?

                           RANDOLPH
             Yes! Exactly! That's what I'm
             trying to tell you!

Randolph looks at him hopefully as Stokes straightens his
tie.

                     STOKE
             Don't contact me again, Randy.
             Ever.

Stokes walks off.    Randolph watches him disappear through
the mist.

                           RANDOLPH
             You'll get yours, Frank! The rhino
             too! Do you hear me?! The wheels
             are turning!

Stokes is gone. Randolph takes a swig from his flask and
wipes his chin with his sleeve. He stares out at the
river.

                     RANDOLPH
                    (quietly to
                     himself)
             Sooner or later, even a guy who's
             squeaky clean falls into mud.

THUNDER CLAP.

INT. NORA BISHOP'S OFFICE - CLOSE ON LITTLE MECHANICAL
SMOOCHY THE RHINO - DAY

as it erratically limps forward before DROPPING OUT OF
FRAME.


WIDER

The wind-up Smoochy lays upside-down on the carpet next
to Nora's desk, legs grinding lamely in the air. Various
Smoochy items are spread out on her desk top. A
restless-looking Sheldon and a few members of Nora's
staff are in on the meeting.

                   NORA
           Again, these are just prototypes.
           I've been assured by FunZone that
           all the bugs will be worked out
           before Christmas.

Sheldon raises his hand.   Nora ignores him and looks at
her watch.

                   NORA
           Okay, so let's recap before we
           break up...
              (refers to notes)
           Yes to the Smoochy ice pops. No to
           the Smoochy string cheese. And
           we're in a dick-measuring contest
           with Brown & Brown over the
           shampoo split.

Sheldon suddenly stands up.

                   SHELDON
           Okay, time out, people! If I may
           interject, I think we're putting
           the cart before the horse here...

Nora throws him an icy look.

                                      (CONTINUED)

                                                         18.

CONTINUED:

                     SHELDON
             Smoochy's still earning the trust
             of the kids. We don't want to
             compromise that by asking them to
             buy shampoo and cheese. How 'bout we
             just concentrate on doing the best
             show possible. Huh? Without all
             the bells and whistles and
             rickata-rackita. What do you say,
             guys?

Nora casually picks up a Smoochy Frisbee from her desk
and sails it toward the open door. It lands in the
hallway.

                     NORA
                (monotone)
             Oh, damn.

                     SHELDON
             No problem, I'll get it.

He walks out to the hallway.

                     NORA
                (to staffer)
             Shut the door please, John.

John shuts the door.

                     NORA
             Now lock it.

He locks it.

                     NORA
             Thank you.


EXT. KIDNET BUILDING - NIGHT

Nora emerges from the revolving door of the Kidnet
building which is located in the heart of Times Square
and heads down Broadway. Sheldon emerges from the
building.

                     SHELDON
             Hey, Nora, wait up.

She keeps walking. Sheldon catches up and walks
alongside her, occasionally getting jostled by passersby.

                                        (CONTINUED)

                                                        19.

CONTINUED:

                     SHELDON
             Good meeting today. I thought we
             tackled some hot issues.
             Although, I'll be honest, there
             were a few times that I felt my
             voice wasn't being heard.

                     NORA
             I think that's a conservative
             estimate.

                     SHELDON
             I just want the show to have some
             weight, you know? Some substance.
             Silly songs, sure -- but with a
             message. Pop quiz: How many
             original compositions are in the
             Smoochy songbook?

                     NORA
             Do you sense my complete lack of
             interest?

                     SHELDON
             Try two thousand. Covering every
             topic from how yummy vegetables
             are to the importance of donating
             plasma. Don't you get it, Nora?
             I'm a valuable resource. Use me.

Nora stops.    She looks Sheldon in the eye for the first
time.

                     NORA
             Can I make this real easy for you?

                     SHELDON
             Sure.

                     NORA
             The only reason you're on TV right
             now is because Rainbow Randolph is
             a degenerate scumbag. I didn't
             discover you, I delivered you.
             Like a bag of groceries. I have a
             bigger emotional investment in my
             nail polish. So don't peddle your
             sap to me, rhino. Your job is
             just to smile and nod your head.

She walks off.

                                                        20.

INT. PATSY'S - NIGHT

Sheldon sits at the bar in the restaurant, nursing a
drink and talking to the BARTENDER. He seems slightly
drunk.

                  SHELDON
          ... No, no, you misunderstand me.
          It's not that I'm literally
          comparing Captain Kangaroo to
          Jesus Christ. I'm just saying
          that the Captain, like Christ, was
          someone you could believe in.
          Those guys didn't care about bells
          and whistles and rickita-rackata.
          It was all about the work.
          Especially Jesus. Forget about
          it.

The Bartender nods and starts to pour Sheldon another
drink.

                  SHELDON
             (waving him off)
          That's okay, my good man.    Three's
          my limit.

                  BARTENDER
          I never saw anyone get loaded on
          orange juice before.

                  SHELDON
          Back in my college days I could
          put away a carton of the stuff.

A sharply-dressed man, BURKE BENNETT, sits down next to
Sheldon.

                  BURKE
             (to Bartender)
          Gimme a Five Crown.

The Bartender nods.    He looks over at Sheldon.

                   BURKE
          Smoochy the Rhino.    Wow.   I'm a
          big fan.

                  SHELDON
             (flattered)
          Gee, thanks. I usually don't get
          recognized without my horn.

Burke extends his hand.

                  BURKE
          Burke Bennett.    I represent kid
          show talent.

                                                   21.

INT. PATSY'S - SHORT WHILE LATER

Sheldon and Burke now sit at a corner table.

                  BURKE
          Look, Shel, Frank Strokes ain't in
          the business to make you rich.
          He's in it to make Frank Stokes
          rich. That's how these network
          goons operate.

                  SHELDON
          That's so sad. Is it just me, or
          is that sad?

                  BURKE
          You know, years ago, a client of
          mine, Dicky Gimble, was having a
          problem...

                  SHELDON
          Wow, you represented Dicky Gimble?

                  BURKE
          Yeah, before the asshole found
          religion. Anyway, Stokes was
          trying to screw my boy out of some
          merchandising points. Claimed he
          had a warehouse full of Dicky
          dolls that weren't moving. Now
          Frank and I are old friends, so I
          say to him, 'Okay, cock, show me
          the warehouse' -- see, I know the
          fucking warehouse is in the Bronx,
          and I know it's emptier than my
          wife's head.
             (chuckles)
          To make a long story short, I walk
          out with a check for a hundred
          grand and Stokes is sitting there
          with his thumb up his ass.

Burke laughs.

                  SHELDON
          That's very amusing, but I don't
          care about Smoochy dolls and
          Smoochy floor wax... I just want
          more creative input. This rhino
          came from my womb. I bore him, I
          nursed him, and dammit...

He pounds his fist on the table.

                                     (CONTINUED)

                                                        22.

CONTINUED:

                     SHELDON
             I should be the one who raises
             him!

                     BURKE
             Shel, it's all about the dough.
             After you get the money, you get
             the power. And after you get the
             power, you can have Smoochy walk
             on stage with a hard-on if you
             want.

                     SHELDON
             It's funny, that never crossed my
             mind.

Burke downs the rest of his drink and stands up.

                     BURKE
             Unfortunately, until then...
             you're just another puppet in the
             prop room.

He hands Sheldon his card.

                     BURKE
             Give me a call when you're ready,
             kid. I'll cut the strings and
             open the magic door for you.


EXT. PATSY'S - CONTINUOUS ACTION

Randolph peers through the restaurant's front window. He
shivers from the cold as he watches Sheldon and Burke
shake hands. Burke heads for the exit. Randolph quickly
ducks into the shadows. A moment later, Burke exits the
club and walks down the street. Randolph pops out.

                     RANDOLPH
             I saw you! I saw you in there...
             at my table... talking to him.

                     BURKE
             Yeah, so what do you want?    A
             parade?

                     RANDOLPH
             You're my agent! Or did you
             forget that?

                                          (CONTINUED)

                                                      23.

CONTINUED:

                     BURKE
             Not anymore, pal. You're a
             cigarette butt. Go lay in the
             gutter.

Burke walks off.


EXT. ALLEY - NIGHT

In the litter-strewn alley, we PAN ACROSS several grocery
bags, broken egg shells, flour bags, butter wrappers,
mixing bowls and other baking ingredients. The PAN ENDS
ON Randolph, who stands over a barrel fire, holding a
spatula. A cookie sheet rests on the barrel. Randolph
removes the cookie sheet and gazes at it gleefully. We
now see that the cookies are phallic-shaped.

                     RANDOLPH
             Ah! They're beautiful! A perfect
             batch of cock cookies for a very
             special rhino.

He sets the tray aside.

                     RANDOLPH
             Oh yes, you're going to learn
             about shame, my dear Smoochy.   And
             I'm your professor.

He laughs.


INT. KIDNET STUDIO - STAGE B - DAY

It's thirty minutes before a Smoochy taping. Dozens of
giddy children are led into the studio where they take
seats on the bleachers.


BACKSTAGE

Sheldon, in the Smoochy costume, sans head, lumbers up to
Nora. He holds a rundown for that day's show.

                     SHELDON
             Excuse me, Nora. Why was the
             'Please and Thank You Song' cut?

                     NORA
             Because it's sappy and it takes
             away from the 'Cookie Song.'

                                       (CONTINUED)

                                                       24.

CONTINUED:

                     SHELDON
             Takes away? It enhances it! The
             cookie song is a meaningless piece
             of fluff without the 'Please and
             Thank You' coda! That's the moral
             anchor! That's where the lesson
             is! You can't sell the sizzle
             without the steak!

                     NORA
             It's cut. And I want the 'Cookie
             Song' lyrics changed back to the
             way they were originally scripted.

                      SHELDON
             I can't do that. I will not
             condone children consuming endless
             amounts of refined sugar. I have
             to look myself in the mirror every
             morning.

                     NORA
             This is network television, not a
             sprout farm. We're here to sell
             sugar and plastic. That's what
             keeps the lights on.

                     SHELDON
             You're treating me like a puppet.
             You know that? Well, guess
             what? I am not your puppet.

                     NORA
             Since when? Now get your spongy
             orange ass out there and dance
             for the cameras.

An angry Sheldon storms off in frustration, but then
stops. He looks back at her.

                           SHELDON
             We have different eyes, Nora.
             When I go out there I see kids.
             You see wallets with pigtails.

He moves on. Nora stares at him as he walks away. He
obviously got to her. As Sheldon heads toward the
studio, he doesn't notice the two beady eyes staring
at him from under the stairwell. After a beat,
Randolph emerges and slinks backstage. He's
clutching a duffle bag.

                                                       25.

INT. PROP ROOM - CONTINUOUS ACTION

Randolph sneaks into the prop room and shuts the door.
He scurries over to the prop shelf and locates Smoochy's
multicolored "magic cookie bag." He opens it and tosses
the cookies into the trash can. Reaching into his
pockets, he pulls out his special homemade cookies. He
chuckles as he dumps them into the magic cookie bag.

                  RANDOLPH
          Bon soir, la Smoochy.   Welcome to
          fatty Arbuckle-land.

He cackles to himself. He then notices a box in the
corner of the room. Scribbled in magic marker on the
side are the words: "Rainbow Randolph crap." He walks
over and pulls the box out. He slowly opens the flaps.
Inside is his old costume. He pulls it out and clutches
it lovingly. He smells it. The ECHOEY SOUND of his
THEME SONG comes flooding back to him for a moment,
along with the sound of CHILDREN LAUGHING.

                        RANDOLPH
                 (softly to himself)
          Don't worry, little ones. Rainbow
          Randolph will return...

He holds up Smoochy's magic cookie bag.   He then stuffs
his old costume into his duffle bag.


INT. STUDIO B - LATER

The "Smoochy Show" is in the middle of a taping. The
Smoochyland Band is playing a fast, jazzy number ("Doin'
the Jiggy Ziggy") as Smoochy, the Rhinettes, and several
kids dance frenetically. The kids in the bleachers are
in hysterics as Smoochy shakes his body spastically. The
song finally ends. The kids in the bleachers jump to
their feet, cheering and applauding.

                  SMOOCHY
          Boy, all that jiggyin' and
          ziggyin' sure makes a fella
          hungry! Now if only I had my
          super duper, super secret, super
          special...

The kids in the bleachers erupt in unison:

                  KIDS
          Magic Cookie Bag!

                                     (CONTINUED)

                                                      26.

CONTINUED:

                     SMOOCHY
             Right-o-riffic!
                (looks skyward)
             Magic Cookie Bag, I command thee!
             Come to your lord and master!

The lights dim as the Smoochyland Band plays the "2001
theme." Smoochy's Magic Cookie Bag is lowered from the
ceiling by a filament wire. The kids go crazy.

                     SMOOCHY
                (singing)
             'Lookie, lookie, lookie, here
             comes the cookies! Fresh and
             organic, no need to panic! Right
             from the soil, no tropical oils!
             Sweetened with juice, for an
             energy boost! Fiber galore,
             you'll be askin' for more...'


ANGLE ON NORA

She looks pissed, but then looks over at the kids in the
bleachers. Their faces are filled with laughter. For
the first time she feels the connection Smoochy has with
them.


ANGLE ON RANDOLPH

He peers out from his hiding place backstage. His eyes
widen with delight as the Magic Cookie Bag continues its
descent.


ANGLE ON SMOOCHY

The cookie bag finally reaches Smoochy. He holds the bag
high above his head in a religious ceremonial fashion as
the Rhinettes and the kids crowd around him.

                     SMOOCHY
             Oooh... just the smell of
             unprocessed flour makes my tummy
             do somersaults!


ANGLE ON RANDOLPH

                     RANDOLPH
                (under his breath)
             Whatever that means, you fucking
             retard.

                                       (CONTINUED)

SMOOCHY

His puffy orange hand reaches for the bag's clasp as the
MUSIC reaches its CRESCENDO.


RANDOLPH

He's practically shaking as he suppresses an insane
laugh.

                     RANDOLPH
             Give 'em a cookie... give 'em a
             cookie...


SMOOCHY

He reaches into the bag, and with a grand flourish, pulls
out a flaming red penis cookie. The cookie is somewhat
misshapen and not perfectly formed. Smoochy gets a big
grin.

                     SMOOCHY
             Wow! Look at this cookie, kids!
             A rocket ship!

The kids "ooh" and "ahh."


ANGLE ON RANDOLPH

He looks confused.

                           SHELDON
             What a special day with such
             special cookies!


BACK ON SMOOCHY

Smoochy pretends to "zoom" the penis cookie through the
air.

                     SHELDON
             Rrrrrrrr! Look at me, kids! I'm
             flying to the moon! I'm flying to
             Mars! I'm flying to --

Randolph, whose face is now bright red, can't take it
anymore. He runs onto the stage. He grabs the rocket
cookie from Smoochy.

                                       (CONTINUED)

                                                       28.

             cock! Not a space ship! Cock!
             Cock!


INT. STAIRWELL - MOMENTS LATER

Three burly Kidnet security guards drag Randolph down the
stairwell. They beat the shit out of him and toss him
through the exit door.

Burke sits on the couch next to Sheldon, reading the
paper. He shakes his head in disgust. Nora sits in a
chair near Stokes.

                     SHELDON
             Thank you all for coming. I just
             wanted to iron out a few wrinkles
             I feel we're having in the
             communication department. No
             finger-pointing. Lord knows when
             you start pointing fingers,
             someone gets poked in the eye.

Sheldon laughs.    Stokes and Nora sit stone-faced.

                     SHELDON
             Anyhoo, I'd like to turn the floor
             over to my new agent, Mr. Burke
             Bennett. So... heeeeeere's Burke!

Sheldon applauds.    Burke stands.

                     BURKE
             As you can imagine, my client has
             many concerns, not the least of
             which is studio security, but we
             can address that later.

He pats Sheldon's head like a dog.

                     BURKE
             See this guy, Frank? Take a good
             long look, 'cause this prick saved
             your life. Without him you'd be
             sitting in Kaplan's right now,
             sucking club soda through a paper
             straw.
                (to Nora)
             And, you -- you'd be organizing
             puppet shows for the brats at
             P.S. 86. Excuse me, honey.

                     NORA
             There's no excuse for you.

                     SHELDON
             Man, I love club soda.

Sheldon laughs, trying to lighten the mood.       Burke gives
him an affectionate slap.

                     STOKES
             We've always managed to come to
             some sort of arrangement, Burke.
             Why the fireworks?

                     BURKE
             'Cause I'm holding all the
             gunpowder. I represent the man
             who created, owns, and controls
             every square inch of Smoochy the
             Rhino.

Burke pours himself a drink from Stokes' private bar.

                     BURKE
             God created Adam and what did he
             get? A fucking dud. My guy? He
             breathed life into a winner. And
             anyone who does a better job than
             God is gonna have a price.

                     SHELDON
             Burke, of course, is in no way
             comparing me to God.

                     BURKE
             Yes I am.

                     NORA
             You seem to forget that we went
             out and found 'your guy.' Dug up
             his corpse. Handed him his own
             show when he couldn't sell his
             face to a photo booth.

                     SHELDON
             To be fair, Nora, I was booked to
             open a car wash in Montauk.

                     BURKE
             Oh, so you were doing him a favor?
                (chuckles)
             Allow me to untangle this web of
             shit! I don't care what his
             resume was, I don't care where you
             found him, I don't care if his
             last job was juggling apples for a
             hut full of Pygmies on the
             outskirts of the Congo... the fact
             is, he fits a bill and you need
             him. Like a hungry baby needs a
             big tit. And that, my friends, is
             why you're in a box with no
             ventilation. And that is why the
             rhino is going to get what
             he deserves.

                     STOKES
             What is that, exactly?

Burke walks over to Stokes' desk and leans across it.
He's an inch from Stokes' face.

             between.

             To the star and new executive
             producer of the Smoochy show! May
             your reign be a long and healthy
             one!

They clink glasses.

                     SHELDON
             I'm still in shock. Complete
             creative control, part ownership
             of the show, discretion over
             merchandising and a dressing room
             with a toilet! Am I dreaming or
             what?

                     BURKE
             And don't forget the corporate
             penthouse. It took me six years
             to get that for Randolph.

                     SHELDON
             Boy, imagine... me, living in a
             penthouse. Who'd a thunk it.

                     BURKE
             It's called the high life, kid.
             Get used to it. Pretty soon
             you'll be burnin' one hundred
             dollar bills just to see
             Franklin break a sweat.

                     SHELDON
             Jeez, I hope not. I have a deep
             respect for money. Not to mention
             Ben Franklin who had some
             remarkable achievements in his
             lifetime.

Burke pulls out a paper bag and hands it to Sheldon.

                     SHELDON
             What's this?

                     BURKE
             That's your graduation present.
             Something you're gonna need now.

Sheldon reaches in the bag and pulls out a revolver. He
recoils in horror and immediately drops it back in the
bag.

                     BURKE
             Think of it as a tool of the
             trade.

                     SHELDON
             I've never owned a gun, I've never
             touched a gun, and I don't believe
             in guns. When I played cowboys
             and Indians as a kid, I was always
             the Chinese railroad worker.

                     BURKE
             Trust me, Shel. It's a handy
             accessory in this business. Even
             if you don't load it, have it for
             show. Sometimes that's all you
             need. Especially with a creep
             like Randolph lurking around.

Burke and Sheldon look up and notice the hulking,
grinning figure of SPINNER DUNN standing over them.
Spinner has the smile of a little boy despite his
crooked nose and scarred face. He extends his hand.

                      SPINNER
             Hiya, Smoochy! I'm Spinner!
             Spinner!

             proudly march into the record books
             for taking more blows to the head
             than any fighter in history.

A bloodied, defeated Spinner happily holds up the arm of
his opponent after a match. He then hugs the referee.
He jumps down from the ring and hugs the three judges.

             retire with a record of 81-59 and
             wind up the Governor. But on the
             upside, he's got the disposition
             of a collie.

Spinner is still pumping Sheldon's hand.

             You know what I love, Smoochy? I
             love when you do the Jiggy Ziggy

             Wanna see me do it?

                     SHELDON
             Well, I don't know why if there's
             enough room here to...

Spinner starts Jiggying and Ziggying for Sheldon. He
bangs into a table and knocks over someone's drink.

                     BURKE
             Okay, champ, don't get overheated.

Spinner stops, out of breath.       He leans over and hugs

                      TOMMY
             Spinner, come over and meet the
             Senator!

Spinner dutifully hurries over to Tommy.

                     SHELDON
             He seems pretty popular. It must
             take real talent to run a place
             like this.

                     BURKE
             Spinner? The guy couldn't run a
             water faucet. He's just a mascot.
             It's his cousins, a bunch of Irish
             mob boys, who really run the
             joint.

He shakes the Senator's hand as Tommy and a few other
tough Irish guys stand around. Spinner looks over

             Don't go anywhere, Smoochy! I'll

Spinner releases the Senator's hand and rushes off.

INT. ANGELO PIKE'S RUNDOWN APARTMENT
(LOWER EAST SIDE) - NIGHT

We met him backstage with Smoochy... innocent face...

Angelo stirs a pot of soup in the worn-down but tidy
apartment. A "Rhinette" costume is draped over one of
the chairs. There is a sudden LOUD POUNDING on the door.
Angelo puts the spoon down and reaches behind some spices
on the shelf above. He pulls out a revolver. The
POUNDING continues.

                  ANGELO
          Yeah, who is it?

                  RANDOLPH (O.S.)
             (friendly)
          Open up, buddy! It's me,
          Randolph! It's been a long time!

Angelo puts the gun in his waistband and walks to the
door. He slowly slides the chain off and opens the door
a crack. Peering in at him are the bloodshot eyes of
Rainbow Randolph.

                   ANGELO
          Randy?

Randolph suddenly kicks the door open and tackles Angelo.
Randolph sits on top of the little man.

                  RANDOLPH
          You fucking traitor! My body's
          barely cold and already you work
          for the rhino?

                  ANGELO
          I don't know what you're talking
          about.

                  RANDOLPH
          Don't lie to me! I heard all about
          it! You strapped that horn on
          faster than a cheerleader gets the
          clap!

                  ANGELO
          I gotta eat, don't I?

                  RANDOLPH
          You're a Krinkle Kid!   Not a
          Smooch-bag! Say it!

                  ANGELO
          Rhinette!

                                       (CONTINUED)

                                                       36.

CONTINUED:

                     RANDOLPH
             Say it: I am a Krinkle Kid! Say
             it, before God! On the soul of
             Jesus Christ! Say what you are!

Angelo punches Randolph in the mouth and flips him over.
He now sits on Randolph, pointing the revolver to his face.

                     ANGELO
             I'm a Rhinette. Got that? The
             Krinkle Kids are ten feet under.
             With you.

Randolph starts crying like a child.

                     RANDOLPH
                (blubbering)
             I missed you so much. Can I stay
             here? I got no place to go.

Angelo sighs and puts the gun away.


INT. ANGELO'S APARTMENT - SHORT WHILE LATER

Angelo and Randolph sit at the small kitchen table.
Angelo watches as Randolph ravenously eats a bowl of
soup.

                     RANDOLPH
             ... They kicked me out of the
             corporate penthouse. Big
             surprise. Sons-a-bitches. That's
             how I got this beauty.

He points to a nasty bump near his eye.

                     RANDOLPH
             And of course, there's this...

He yanks his lip back to reveal a missing tooth.

                     RANDOLPH
             That happened after my little
             visit to the studio the other day.
             Network security. Fucking savages.

He slurps another spoonful of soup and spits a bay leaf
on the floor.

                                       (CONTINUED)

                                                         37.

CONTINUED:

                     RANDOLPH
             I got liens, back taxes, lawyer's
             bills, threats against my life...
             I basically got the whole fucking
             world up my ass. It's okay, I got
             a loooong memory, son.
                (Amos and Andy dialect)
             What dey sow, dey gonna reap.

He cackles insanely as he picks up a bottle of gin and
takes a deep swig. He passes out and falls off the
chair. Angelo leans down and lifts his head off the
floor.

                     ANGELO
             Stop doing this to yourself!

Randolph doesn't respond.    Angelo slaps his face.

                     ANGELO
             Wise up! You hear me? Don't piss
             your life away like this.

                     RANDOLPH
                (half-conscious)
             It's the rhino, Angie. He's been
             sent by the devil. Sent from hell
             to destroy me. Smoochy... is the
             face of evil.


EXT. BROADWAY (TIMES SQUARE) - MORNING

We are ON the smiling goofy face of Sheldon, whose
picture graces the front page of Variety under the
headline, "MOPES TO EXECUTIVE PRODUCE SMOOCHY SHOW." The
subhead reads, "TENURE TO BEGIN TODAY." A dollar bill is
slapped down over the picture.

We WIDEN OUT to see Sheldon buying the magazine at the
newsstand in front of the Kidnet Building. He turns and
walks toward the Kidnet entrance. He stops and looks up
at the building. Smiling, he takes a deep breath and
enters.


INT. KIDNET HALLWAY - FEW MOMENTS LATER

Sheldon whistles as he walks down the hall, giving
cheerful "hellos" and "good mornings" along the way.   He
enters Nora's office.

                                                        38.

INT. NORA'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS ACTION

Nora is on the phone. She pretends not to notice him.
Sheldon bides his time by inspecting knickknacks,
examining photos on the wall, etc. Finally, he half-
whispers/half-mouths to her:

                  SHELDON
          Whenever you get a chance... I
          just need a second.

                  NORA
             (into the phone)
          Listen, can I call you back?
          Yeah, some asshole's screaming in
          my ear. Thanks.

She hangs up.

                  SHELDON
          I'm sorry, you didn't have to hang
          up.

                  NORA
          If I didn't you'd still be here.

                  SHELDON
          But I am still here.

                  NORA
          I'm hoping to correct that.

                  SHELDON
          Nora, I want us to start off on
          the right foot. I want you to
          know that I value your input and I
          don't want you to feel intimidated
          just because the power structure
          has changed a bit. I consider you
          a partner.

                  NORA
          Great. That'll come in handy if
          we're ever at a square dance.

                  SHELDON
          Well, I was never much of the
          do- se-do type, but what I would
          love to do is take you out to lunch
          one day. You know, just two
          colleagues chewing the fat...
          forming a mutual respect...
          planting the seeds of
          cooperation...

                                     (CONTINUED)

                                                         39.

CONTINUED:

                        NORA
             No.

                     SHELDON
             Fair enough. If you change your
             mind --

                        NORA
             I won't.

Sheldon just nods and starts to exit.

                     SHELDON
             Okay then, I'll be in my office if
             you need me. If you want to
             brainstorm about anything. Ideas
             and so forth.

He passes a plant by the door.

                        SHELDON
             Ficus?

She ignores him.      He exits.


INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS ACTION

Sheldon walks slowly down the hallway.     He no longer has
a bounce in his step.


INT. SHELDON'S NEW OFFICE - MOMENT LATER

Sheldon enters his plush new office, awkwardly walks over
to his new desk and sits behind it for the first time.

                               SHELDON
             Wow...

                           TOMMY (O.S.)
             My cousin Spinner's take quite a
             shine to you.


Sheldon jumps. He's surprised to Tommy from Spinner
Dunn's restaurant. Tommy's crew, ROY, DANNY, JIMMY and
SAMMY occupy the sofa.

                     TOMMY
             Ever since you came in the
             restaurant. He can't stop yakkin'.

                                         (CONTINUED)

                                                        40.

CONTINUED:

                     SHELDON
             Well, he's a very nice man. Very
             sweet disposition for someone that
             size.

                     TOMMY
             So, I was wondering if maybe you
             could give him a little floor
             space.

                     SHELDON
             I'm sorry?

                     TOMMY
             You know, a little part on the
             show. You're the executive
             producer now. You call the shots,
             right?

                     SHELDON
             Uh, that's a very sweet offer, and
             I love Spinner, but TV is a
             complicated medium and... I mean,
             that would be like me getting into
             the ring with a prizefighter.
                (laughs)
             Can you imagine such a thing?
             Boom. K.O.! What's the alphabet,
             Mommy?

Sheldon laughs again.       Tommy gets quiet.

                     TOMMY
             This makes me sad.    Very, very,
             sad.

                     DANNY
             What's wrong, Tommy?

                        TOMMY
             Nothing.     I'm just very sad right
             now.

                     SAMMY
             Who made you sad, Tommy?

                     TOMMY
             I don't want to mention names.

The guys look menacingly at Sheldon. They rise and walk
around his desk until they're on either side of him.

                                          (CONTINUED)

                                                           41.

CONTINUED:

                     SHELDON
             You know what? Maybe I can find
             Spinner a little something to do
             on the show. That's probably the
             best solution.

Tommy now smiles and walks over to Sheldon.       She musses
Sheldon's hair.

                     TOMMY
             You're a good boy, Mopes. Don't
             think we don't remember favors.

                                       SWISH PAN TO:


INT. SHELDON'S OFFICE - SHORT WHILE LATER

Sheldon is in a meeting with a man, SONNY GORDON.

                     SHELDON
             Look, I appreciate the visit, but
             I'm just putting together a little
             petting zoo segment. Nothing
             fancy -- a few kittens... maybe a
             duck...


ANGLE ON SONNY

                     SONNY
             If you're looking to bring in that
             many pieces I gotta put a crew
             together. Plus, we're lookin' at
             transpo, a few leash handlers, a
             cleanup boy and a doper to keep
             the inventory quiet.

                     SHELDON
             Jeez, this all sounds awfully
             elaborate. I might have to forgo
             the union and just borrow a few
             animals from a pet shop.

                     SONNY
             I wouldn't recommend it. Miss
             Carol from Romper Room tried that
             once and she's still limping.

SWISH PAN TO --

                                                         42.

INT. SHELDON'S OFFICE - SHORT TIME LATER

A frazzled-looking Sheldon is meeting with BEN FRANKS.

                  BEN
          On behalf of FunZone Toys, I'd
          like to congratulate you on your
          recent promotion, and present you
          with a small gift.

SUPERIMPOSE:   BEN FRANKS, V.P., FUNZONE TOYS

Ben reaches into his breast pocket and drops a large wad
of money on Sheldon's desk that lands with a thud.

                  SHELDON
          Uh... that's nice of you, Ben, but
          a card would have been fine.

                  BEN
          FunZone Toys would very much like
          the Smoochy contract, Mr. Mopes.

                  SHELDON
          Is this... I mean... are you
          offering me a bribe or something?

                  BEN
          FunZone Toys would very much like
          the Smoochy contract, Mr. Mopes.

Sheldon picks up the money and tosses it back to Ben.
Sheldon rises from his desk.

                  SHELDON
          Normally, sir, we take the trash
          out at the end of the day, but I
          think I'll make an exception in
          your case.

Sheldon escorts Ben out the door and slams it shut.   The
PHONE RINGS. Sheldon walks over and picks it up.

                   SHELDON
          Yes?

                  ASSISTANT (V.O.)
          A Mr. Feedlepepper on line two.

                   SHELDON
          Who?

                  ASSISTANT (V.O.)
          He says he's an old friend.

Sheldon punches line two.

Sheldon hangs up stunned.       Nora walks in holding the daily
news.

                           NORA
             Congratulations on your little ice
             show.

                           SHELDON

             What happened to your precious

INT. SPINNER DUNN'S - EVENING

We are TIGHT ON the feet of an Irish dancer doing a sort
of Riverdance. We WIDEN OUT and the rest of the dancers
come INTO FRAME. Spinner and the mob ar clapping and
whooping.

Sheldon and Burke sit at a table in the dark club having
a conversation.

                        SHELDON
          Burke, I never agreed to do an ice
          show.

                        BURKE
          Shel, do you know what kind of
          cash we'll take in between the
          gate and concessions? A venture
          like this gets you money and
          muscle. Times twenty.

                        SHELDON
          Ice shows represent everything I'm
          against. They're mindless
          spectacles whose main purpose is
          to sell overpriced sugar-water and
          cheap plastic toys that splinter
          in a kid's mouth on the ride home.

                        BURKE
          Look, I know you got this fetish
          for ethics, but now's not the time
          to fly that kite. No one's ever
          refused a shot at an ice show.

Sheldon tears the contract in half.

                        SHELDON
          Until now. Smoochy doesn't sell
          out, Burke. You should be proud
          of that. Proud that you represent
          a client who paves driveways, not
          paints them over.

                        BURKE
          I'm thrilled, Shel. Knocked out.

Burke just sits there, stunned.   A waitress, SANDY,
passes by the booth.

                        SHELDON
          I'll have a pineapple juice,
          Sandy.

                           SHELDON
             I'm feeling feisty tonight.


INT. TELEVISION STUDIO - DAY

We are now on a drum solo. Ernie the Elephant of the
Smoochyland Band works it. The animal band plays a
sloppy version of "Pop Goes the Weasel." End on Spinner
Dunn -- the newest and by far largest member of the band.
Spinner holds s cowbell and seems to be concentrating
intently on the proper moment to hit it. Unfortunately,
his rhythm is off, which throws the rest of the band off
as well.

We WIDEN OUT to see Smoochy and the Rhinettes attempting
to dance to the off-kilter rhythm. The song finally
ends. The Rhinettes glare at Spinner. Smoochy addresses
the camera.

                           SMOOCHY
             Boy, wasn't that fun? In an
             awkward kind of way? Anyhoo, how
             'bout a big round of applause for
             the newest member of the
             Smoochyland Band... former
             heavyweight contender, Spinner
             Dunn!

Spinner stands up to take a bow and almost knocks the
entire bandstand over. There is a smattering of confused
applause from the kids in the bleachers. Spinner drops
the cowbell and it clangs on the studio floor.

                              SPINNER
             Shit.   Sorry.


INT. BACKSTAGE - AFTER SHOW

A beaming Spinner runs up to Sheldon, who's still in
costume.

                           SPINNER
             Did I do good, Sheldon, huh?   Did I
             do good?

                                        (CONTINUED)

                                                            46.

CONTINUED:

                           SHELDON
             Yeah, that was great, Spinner.
             Just watch your elbow next time.
             Pinky's probably gonna lose that
             tooth.

                            SPINNER
             Okey doke.   I'm gonna go get drunk
             now.

Spinner skips off humming "Pop Goes the Weasel" and
banging his cowbell. Nora passes Sheldon backstage.

                           NORA
             Nice job. Casting the show with
             mental patients, I like that.

                           SHELDON
                    (snapping)
             He is not a mental patient. He's
             an ex-boxer and nightclub owner
             who happens to have the sweet
             innocent brian of a five-year-old!

                           NORA
             Excuse me for not making the
             distinction.

She leaves.


EXT. BROADWAY (TIMES SQUARE) - NIGHT

Sheldon exits the Kidnet building and walks to the curb
to hail a cab. A friendly-looking man in a suit and bow
tie approaches him. This is MERV GREEN.

                     MERV
             Hi there.

                       SHELDON
             Hi.

A limo pulls up in front of them.     Merv opens the back
door.

                       MERV
             Get in.

                     SHELDON
             Thanks anyway, but I'm going
             uptown.

                                        (CONTINUED)

                                                      47.

Merv pulls his jacket back to reveal a revolver tucked in
his waistband.

                     MERV
             Humor me, rhino.


INT. LIMOUSINE - CONTINUOUS ACTION

Sheldon slides into the back seat of the limo. A big
thug in an overcoat, HENRY, is already sitting there.
Merv gets in behind him and shuts the door. Sheldon is
now wedged between the two men as the limo heads down
Broadway. Merv extends his hand.

                     MERV
             Merv Green, Sheldon. It's a
             pleasure to meet you.

                     SHELDON
             If you're hoping for an autograph,
             the gun's a bit much. The whole
             'catch more flies with honey'
             thing -- it really holds water.

Sheldon laughs nervously.

                     MERV
             Sheldon, I represent the Parade of
             Hope Foundation. Maybe you've
             heard of us.

                     SHELDON
             You raise money to build
             children's hospitals, right?

                     MERV
             We've been known to add a brick or
             two, sure.

Merv and the thug laugh.

                     MERV
             Sheldon, let me get right to the
             point -- there's talk on the
             street that you're pulling out of
             the ice show. Is that true?

                                       (CONTINUED)

                                                  48.

                      SHELDON
                     (big sigh)
             You know, I never agreed to an
             ice show, nor would I ever agree
             to do an ice show, and let me add
             that none of this is your concern,
             sir.
                (shakes his head)
             Sheesh.

                     MERV
             Listen carefully, son: Parade of
             Hope has sponsored every Kidnet
             ice show since 1964. We take a
             piece off the top and everybody
             walks away happy. So let's not
             buck history.

                     SHELDON
             Well, I appreciate the offer, but
             for the gazillionth time, I'm not
             doing an ice show, so we have
             nothing to discuss. Now, if
             you'll just pull over, I'll get
             out and we'll say our toodley-dos.
                (to driver)
             Far corner, please.

                     MERV
             Allow me to be less murky.
             Starting tomorrow, Smoochy the
             Rhino raises his baton for Parade
             of Hope. Benefits, banquets,
             fund-raisers, I want it all.
                (to driver)
             Pull over, Terry.

The car pulls to the curb.

                           MERV
             And as far as the ice show goes...
             I recommend you start shopping
             for skates.

The door pops open and Sheldon is tossed out.

                                                       49.

INT. CORPORATE PENTHOUSE - NIGHT

A troubled-looking Sheldon stands on his balcony looking
out at the city. He drinks orange juice straight from
the carton.

Sheldon is on the phone with Burke.

                  SHELDON
          This is unacceptable, Burke!    I'm
          calling the authorities.

                  BURKE (V.O.)
          Don't do it, Shel. You rat on
          Parade of Hope and you'll be lucky
          if they find your toenails. These
          guys are the roughest of all the
          charities.

                   SHELDON
          I was threatened by an
          organization that's supposed to
          help children! What kind of world
          is this?

                   BURKE (V.O.)
          The real one. My advice?
          Consider the ice show and stay
          healthy.

Burke hangs up. After a beat, Sheldon's DOORBELL RINGS.
He walks over to the door and opens it. To his surprise,
Nora is standing there.

                       NORA
          May I come in?

                  SHELDON
          Sure.

Nora enters. She seems a little wobbly.    Sheldon notices
she's holding a pint of whiskey.

                  SHELDON
          Uh... are you okay?

                  NORA
          I'm getting drunk and I'm not used
          to it.

                  SHELDON
          Oh. Well, not to make you feel
          worse, but with alcohol you're
          also consuming empty calories.

Nora looks at him for a moment.

                                      (CONTINUED)

                                                           50.

CONTINUED:

                     NORA
             It's just that... I want to
             apologize, actually. And on those
             rare occasions when I feel the
             need to apologize for something,
             it helps if I'm, you know... shit-
             faced.

                      SHELDON
             Wow.   I'm honored.

Nora trips slightly.     Sheldon takes the whiskey from her.

                     SHELDON
             Why don't we get some air?

He leads her out on the balcony.    They look out at the
city.

                     NORA
             I... I may have been a little
             harsh when we spoke the other day.
             A little out of line.

                     SHELDON
             Well, it wasn't as bad as the week
             before when you called me a pasty-
             faced, no-talent hack.

                      NORA
             Yes, that was probably insensitive
             as well.
                 (looks at him)
             I heard you're not doing the ice
             show. I find that... incredibly
             admirable. Why didn't you tell
             me?

                     SHELDON
             I guess I didn't want to spoil
             your fun. You look so content
             when you're berating me.

Nora looks down.

                     NORA
             I'm afraid I have become a bit
             hardened over the years.
             Sincerity's an easy disguise in
             this business. It's hard to know
             who's on the level.

                                          (CONTINUED)

                                                           51.

                      SHELDON
             Believe me, I'm learning that more
             and more every day.
                     (wistfully)

             'Rickets the Hippo'?

                     SHELDON
             You remember Rickets?

                     NORA
             That was my favorite show when I
             was a kid. Rickets was the one
             face I knew I could trust.

                     SHELDON
             That's how I felt! Rickets had
             real depth. He was my inspiration
             for Smoochy.

                     NORA
             Really? He was my inspiration to
             work in children's television.

                     SHELDON
             I can't believe it. I never met
             anyone who even remembers Rickets.
             Do you remember the Klunky-Wunky
             dance?

                     NORA
             Remember it?   I did it at my first
             communion.

Sheldon starts doing the rather insane-looking Klunky-
Wunky dance. Nora does it with him. They both stop and
look at each other. Sheldon impulsively leans in and
kisses her.

                     SHELDON
             I'm sorry. That was a mistake,
             right? I didn't mean for that to
             hap--

Nora grabs his head and pulls it toward her.       They begin
kissing passionately.

             the others, are you?

                       SHELDON
             No, no.

                     NORA

             Yes, yes.

                     NORA
                (through the kisses)
             I mean, I couldn't tell... First I
             thought it was an act... and then
             I just thought you were a simp or
             something...

                     SHELDON
             Shhh... you don't have to
             explain...

They continue to kiss.      Nora abruptly stops.

                     NORA
             I should go.

                       SHELDON
             Why?

Nora exits the balcony and collects her coat and purse.

                     SHELDON
             What's wrong? Is it the whiskey?
             If you have to throw up, be my
             guest. Anywhere you like.

                     NORA
             It's just getting late.

Sheldon follows her to the door. She stops and looks at
him for a moment. The PHONE starts to RING. Neither of
them says anything for a beat.

                     NORA
             Better get that.    Good night.

She exits. Sheldon shuts the door and sighs. He goes to
the bar to pour himself another orange juice before
picking up the phone.

ANGELO'S APARTMENT

We GO TO a HORIZONTAL SPLIT-SCREEN. Randolph is on the
BOTTOM HALF. He lies on his bed in Angelo's apartment
wearing a bathrobe with a towel wrapped around his head.
His head dangles off the bed as he talks on the phone.
The SHOT is reminiscent of Bye Bye Birdie.

                     RANDOLPH
             Hello, Mr. Mopes? My name is
             Benjamin Kunklepeck and I'm
             calling on behalf of 'Parents for
             Decency in Children's Television,'
             perhaps you've heard of us?

                     SHELDON
             No, but I like where you're coming
             from. It's an issue very close to
             my heart. Why just yesterday I
             was commenting --

                     RANDOLPH
             Sir, we're having a banquet
             tomorrow and we'd be honored to
             have you perform for us. We would
             also like to present you with a
             plaque for your ongoing commitment
             to children's television. The
             presenter will be a young orphan
             with mild asthma. Can you attend?


EXT. VERRAZANO NARROWS BRIDGE - NEXT MORNING

A black Lincoln Town Car travels across the bridge toward
Staten Island.


                    SHELDON (V.O.)
             Thanks for picking me up, Mr.
             Kunklepeck. It's very nice of
             you.


INT. TOWN CAR - CONTINUOUS ACTION

Sheldon is in the back seat. The Smoochy costume is next

             piggy-back through a bed of hot
             rusty glass if I had to.

                     SHELDON
             Well, it's always a pleasure to
             help out a worthy cause. And
             believe me, I've learned lately
             that it's not all sunshine and
             daffodils in the land of non-
             profit.

                     RANDOLPH
             I just looove your show, by the
             way. It's such a refreshing
             change of pace from that dreadful
             embezzler... what's his name
             again? Rainbow something or
             other?

             Randolph.

                     RANDOLPH
             Yes. Rainbow Randolph. What a
             scoundrel! He's probably gay too.

                     SHELDON
             Oh, I don't know. I feel sorry
             for him, actually. He obviously
             has problems or issues that he
             needs to sort out.

                     RANDOLPH
                (getting frustrated)
             Yeah, yeah, yeah, but don't you
             take particular glee in that you
             basically stole his time slot?
             Helped shovel dirt onto his
             miserable corpse, as it were?

                     SHELDON
             No, I would never take pleasure in
             someone's downfall. You know the
             old expression about walking a
             mile in another man's shoes?
             Well, that really holds water.
             Just try to imagine --

                                                          55.

CONTINUED:

                     RANDOLPH
                (snapping)
             Come on, he's a fucking asshole!
             You hate him! Admit it!

                     SHELDON
                (uncomfortable)
             Uh... can we listen to the radio?


EXT. WAREHOUSE - SHORT WHILE LATER

The Town Car is parked behind an old warehouse in the
middle of nowhere. Sheldon is now in costume. Randolph
rushes out of the door, very excited.

                     RANDOLPH
             Okay, they're ready for you!

                     SHELDON
             I gotta say, this is a first -- I
             never performed in a tractor parts
             warehouse before.

                     RANDOLPH
             Well, we like to do these things
             no-frills. It's all about the
             kids.

                     SHELDON
             Amen to that.

Randolph opens the door a crack and listens.      We hear an
O.S. VOICE from inside.

                     VOICE (O.S.)
             It gives me great pleasure to
             introduce our very special
             guest... a supporter of the cause
             and a friend to the brotherhood.
             Please welcome, the one, the
             only... Smoochy the Rhino!

We hear APPLAUSE.    Randolph quickly opens the rusty door.

                     RANDOLPH
             Knock 'em dead, kid!

He shoves Sheldon inside.


INT. WAREHOUSE - CONTINUOUS ACTION

Sheldon runs in and immediately starts singing and
dancing on the makeshift stage.
                                     (CONTINUED)

                                                         56.

CONTINUED:

                     SMOOCHY
             'Well, how-do-you-do, my   good
             friends! How do-you-do,    my pals!
             It's so nice to see good   friends!
             Sing along with me now!    How do
             you do, my good -- '

Sheldon abruptly stops singing as a look of shock comes
over him. PUSH IN ON his troubled face.

INT. WAREHOUSE - SHELDON'S POV

Several hundred men in Nazi uniforms in a warehouse
draped in swastikas. They all start chanting:

                      NAZIS
             Heil Smoochy!    Heil Smoochy!   Heil
             Smoochy!

A huge swastika banner unfurls behind Smoochy, framing
him like Patton in front of the American flag.
Flashbulbs go off. The "Heil Smoochys" continue. A
GERMAN MARCH starts to BLARE from the SPEAKERS. Looking
stunned, Sheldon slowly leans into the mic. He clears
his throat. The MUSIC STOPS. Everyone quiets down. He
searches for just the right words, and finally...

                     SHELDON
             It's my sincere hope that I'm
             dreaming right now, but in the
             event that I'm not... what's the
             deal with the swastikas?

Suddenly, a sea of policemen bursts into the warehouse.

                     LEAD COP
             This is an unlawful assembly, you
             kraut sons-a-bitches! You're all
             under arrest!

Pandemonium ensues us all the Nazis run for cover.
Sheldon stands in the middle of it all, unsure what to
do.


EXT. WAREHOUSE - SHORT WHILE LATER

Sheldon is led from the warehouse in handcuffs and is
barraged with questions from waiting REPORTERS.
Flashbulbs go off as they shout out questions.

             Hitler your personal hero?

                     REPORTER #3

             This is a mix-up! I'm innocent!
             I don't hate anyone!

                           REPORTER #4
             Does that mean you don't hate
             Nazis?

                            SHELDON
             Wait!   I didn't say that!   I --

Sheldon is shoved into the back seat of a squad car.     It
drives off, SIRENS BLARING.



MONTAGE

EXT. TIMES SQUARE - NIGHT

The squad car drives through Times Square. The headlines
on the zipper marquee GLIDE THROUGH the FRAME: "Smoochy
the Rhino Arrested at Nazi Rally... Cops Raid Warehouse
During Rhino's Performance... Aryan Brotherhood Declares
Smoochy 'One of us.'... President Condemns 'Smoochy the
Fascist'..."


INT. SQUAD CAR - CONTINUOUS ACTION

Sheldon stares out the window as the dark city passes by.
We SLOWLY MOVE IN ON his eyes as we...

EXT. KIDNET BUILDING - LOBBY - DAY

The Kidnet CEO stands before a cluster of reporters and

marquee THROUGH the glass doors behind him.

Headlines read: "Congressional Committee Probes Nazi
Ties to Kid Biz"... "Smoochy Photos Removed From City
Elementary Schools"... "Jewish Groups Plan 'Day of
Outrage'"... "Rhino in Bronx Zoo Pelted With Eggs"...

                   CEO
           Here at Kidnet, Smoochy the Rhino

           a suitable replacement.

             cartoons. Thank you.

The reporters furiously scribble down his statement.

END OF MONTAGE.


EXT. CITY STREET - DAY

Randolph dances down the street like Gene Kelly. He
whistles a happy tune and tips his hat to everyone who
walks by. As he dances along, he pets a dog...

                     RANDOLPH
             Hi there, poochy!

Coos at a baby in a stroller...

                     RANDOLPH
             Well, aren't you the cutest little
             boo-boo in the world!

And grabs a rose from a flower vendor before handing it
to an old lady...

                     RANDOLPH
             For you, my dear!   May you live to
             be a hundred!

He continues to dance onward, waving back at everyone.
Unfortunately, he doesn't realize he's heading straight
for a light pole and slams into it with a sickening
smack.

                     RANDOLPH
             Fuck!


EXT. KIDNET BUILDING - NIGHT

Nora exits the revolving door of the Kidnet building and
heads down Broadway. Sheldon pops out from a store
front. He's wearing a knit cap and sunglasses to
disguise himself.

                     SHELDON
             I have to talk to you.

Nora keeps walking.

                                        (CONTINUED)

                                                    60.

CONTINUED:

                     NORA
             We have nothing to talk about.

                     SHELDON
             Don't tell me you believe what
             they're saying!

                     NORA
             I don't have to believe anyone.
             The picture in the paper said it
             all. No one forced you to perform
             at that rally.

                        SHELDON
             Perform?     I barely sang one song.

                     NORA
             Well maybe next time you'll do
             a longer set.

                     SHELDON
             Nora, I had no idea that was a
             Nazi function. None whatsoever!

                     NORA
             Funny, you'd think the fifty-foot
             swastika you were standing in
             front of might've given you a
             hint.

                     SHELDON
             The papers are blowing that out of
             proportion. It was nowhere near
             that big.

Nora stops and looks Sheldon in the eye.

                     NORA
             Look, the fact of the matter is, I
             don't know you, okay? Not really.
             So don't expect me to go out on an
             emotional limb here.

Sheldon looks crushed.

                     SHELDON
             But what about the balcony? What
             about the Klunky-Wunky dance?

                      NORA
             I was drunk.    Don't read too much
             into it.

She looks at him for a moment and then walks off.

                                                          61.

EXT. TIMES SQUARE - DAYS LATER

A disheveled and unshaven Sheldon wanders the streets,
looking dazed. He's stuffing a cupcake into his mouth
and swigging from a bottle of root beer. He passes a
construction site and notices some graffiti on a wall --
a crudely-drawn goose-stepping Smoochy in a Nazi uniform
and Hitler moustache. Sheldon keeps walking. He
descends the subway stairs at 42nd Street.


EXT. CONEY ISLAND STATION - STREET LEVEL - LATER

Sheldon comes up from the subway.    We see the Cyclone
from Astroland in the b.g.


EXT. SIDE STREET (CONEY ISLAND) - FEW MINUTES LATER

Sheldon stands in front of the methadone clinic he used
to perform at. It's boarded up. He just stares at it.
An OLD VAGRANT walks up to him.

                  OLD VAGRANT
          If you're lookin' to get a cup of
          juice, the well's dried up, son.
          City shut her down. Bastards'll
          put a new pair of tits on the
          Statue of Liberty, but they won't
          help a poor hophead.

The Vagrant shakes his head sadly.

                  OLD VAGRANT
          Just once I wish I had a little
          clout. You know? I'd set things
          straight in this town, believe me.
                 (sighs)
          Hell of a world.

He walks off.

                  SHELDON
             (to himself)
          Hell of a world.

                                                      62.

INT. STOKES' OFFICE

On a large screen TV the smiling Asian face of Takashi
Yamashita, who's singing Cole Porter's "I Get a Kick Out
of You" in Japanese.

CUT BACK to reveal Takashi wearing a white sequined
tuxedo with tails as he plays a white grand piano. He
looks like an Asian Liberace. He is circled by a group
of Japanese children who sing along with him.

                        CHICK (V.O.)
          'Takashi Sings Tin Pan Alley for
          Youngsters' is the hottest show
          on Japanese television. The sweat
          shops are working overtime trying
          to keep up with the demand.
          Record albums, toys, cereal, tee
          shirts, you name it...


INT. STOKES' OFFICE - DAY

Several tough-looking Asian men -- CHICK, SAMBO, and TOBI
-- Takashi's management group -- sits in Stokes' office.
Takashi sits quietly in the corner. Stokes sits behind
his desk, sipping his trademark glass of wine.

                  CHICK
          Look, Stokes, let's cut the
          bullshit. We want Takashi in
          that Smoochy slot and we're willing
          to do whatever it takes to get it.

                  STOKES
          Pardon me for saying this, but for
          a non-resident of this country,
          you speak impeccable English.

                  CHICK
          I'm originally from Teaneck.

                  STOKES
          Ah.

                  CHICK
          We own every hair on this bastard's
          head and we're willing to share a
          few strands... if you get my drift.

                  STOKES
          Well, it's not that simple. I
          have an executive board to answer
          to. I wish I could just snap my
          fingers and make a deal but --

                     CHICK
             You mean like this?

Chick snaps his fingers and Tobi, the third Asian guy,
walks over and drops a duffel bag on Stokes' desk.

                      STOKES
             Oh my.   And what is this on my
             desk?

                      CHICK
             Two hundred grand in a Louis
             Vuitton duffle bag. Get our boy
             the slot and we'll round it off to
             a million. And you can keep the
             luggage.

Stokes stares down at the bundle of opportunity on his
desk.

                     CHICK
             You're dealing with an honorable
             culture, Frank. We know how to
             play ball.

Stokes unzips the bag and gazes at the money.     He looks
up at Chick and smiles.

                     STOKES
             Gentlemen, I suddenly feel
             invigorated and full of hope.

Chick smiles.


INT. NORA'S LIVING ROOM - EVENING

On Nora's TV screen, we see the black and white image of
Rickets the Hippo doing the "Klunky-Wunky Dance." Nora
sits on the couch and stares hypnotically at the screen.
There is a KNOCK at the door. She gets up and ejects the
"Best of Rickets" tape. She opens the door. To her
surprise, Randolph is standing there.

                     RANDOLPH
             Hiya, cutie!

Before she can respond, he enters the apartment and takes
off his jacket.

             So here's the good news: Yes,
             I'll be happy to end my sabbatical
             and return to my old slot. I know
             you and Frank are in a bind, so
             I'll start Monday. Call wardrobe,
             call props, tell 'em the R man is
             back and he's ready to start
             whistlin' dem happy tunes for da
             little chillens.

He flops down on the couch.

                     RANDOLPH
             Ahhh. Who do ya gotta blow to get
             a Scotch around here?

He laughs.

                     NORA
             You've got three seconds to pry
             your ass off my couch and get out.

Randolph jumps to his feet.

                     RANDOLPH
             Dammit, Nora! The rhino's gone!
             You need that slot filled and
             I'm ready to reclaim what's
             rightfully mine.

                     NORA
             Just in case you forgot, you're a
             criminal and a scumbag.

                     RANDOLPH
             Okay, so maybe I commandeered a
             stray shekel or two. Big deal!
             Compared to what Smoochy did
             that's like jerking off in the
             supermarket.

                     NORA
             Where do you shop?

Randolph walks over and puts his hands on her shoulders.

                     RANDOLPH
             Come on. Have you lost all
             affection for me? After what we

             That was a long time ago.    I was
             young and stupid.

                     RANDOLPH
             Why we broke up I'll never know.

                     NORA
             You turned into an asshole and I
             didn't love you.

                     RANDOLPH
             We could've worked through all
             that.

He leans in to kiss her and she shoves him away so
violently he almost falls over the coffee table.

                     RANDOLPH
             Damn it, Nora! The public is
             clamoring for me! I'm a fucking
             patriot! Mopes is a Nazi! He's
             evil! He's probably even gay!
             You should've seen the way he was
             checking me out in the car!

                     NORA
                (suddenly suspicious)
             What does that mean?

                     RANDOLPH
             What does what mean?

                     NORA
             You said he was checking you out
             in the car. What car?

                     RANDOLPH
             No... it's just a vibe! A Nazi
             homosexual vibe! It emanates from
             the television! The whole Smoochy
             costume... with the erect horn...
             I mean, what's that all about?

Nora starts to walk closer to him.       He backs up.

                     NORA
             You're talking awfully fast,
             Randolph.

                     RANDOLPH
             I still love you!   Let's go on a
             date!

             Were you at that rally? Tell me!
             Did you have something to do with
             this?

She backs him against the wall and looks him in the eye.

                     NORA
             Did you set Sheldon up?

Randolph just looks at her.

                      RANDOLPH
             You know, now I remember why we
             broke up. Always with the
             accusations. Bitch, bitch,
             bitch...

Nora hauls off and punches him in the jaw.


INT. SPINNER DUNN'S - NIGHT

A morose-looking Spinner Dunn sits alone at the end of
the bar in the nightclub. Tommy walks over.

                     TOMMY
             What's wrong, kid? The mayor of
             Patterson's here with his wife.
             They wanna meet ya.

                     SPINNER
             I don't wanna meet no one. I miss
             Smoochy! He never woulda done the
             things they say he done. He ain't
             no Nazi. Someone's making stuff
             up. I just know it, Tommy.
             Someone's making stuff up!

Spinner starts violently pounding his head on the bar,
causing GLASSES to RATTLE.

                      SPINNER
             I want Smoochy back! I want to be
             on TV again! I want to play my
             cowbell!

Nora enters the restaurant.    She looks around and
approaches Tommy.

                     NORA
             Hi, Tommy. Hi, Spinner.   Has
             Burke been in tonight?

             Damn it.

                     TOMMY
             Something I can help you with?

                      NORA
             I have to talk to him.    It's about
             Sheldon.

Spinner lifts his head from the bar.

                        SPINNER
             Sheldon?     What about Sheldon?


INT. ANGELO'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Randolph is napping on Angelo's couch with an ice pack on
his sore jaw thanks to Nora's fist. There is a sudden
LOUD POUNDING at the door. Randolph startles awake.

                     RANDOLPH
             I'm trying to sleep, asshole!
             Read the fucking meter some other
             time!

After a beat, the door is kicked open and Tommy and his
crew are standing there.

                     TOMMY
             You wanna tell me about the rhino?

                     RANDOLPH
             Hey, this is private property,
             creep! And you're trespassing!

                     TOMMY
             Danny, go give Mr. Smiley a little
             back rub.

Danny advances toward a shaking Randolph, fist clenched
and rolling up his sleeve.


RANDOLPH'S POV - DANNY

approaches. He cocks his arm and throws a punch.
Danny's fist FILLS the FRAME, TURNING IT BLACK as we hear
the PUNCH.

                                                        68.

EXT. TIMES SQUARE - SERIES OF DISSOLVES - BEFORE DAWN

Newspaper trucks pull up to various newsstands and toss
out bundles of the morning editions. As each bundle
lands on the curb, we see headlines that span over the
next few days:


SMOOCHY SET UP - SMILEY BEHIND NAZI PLOT


PLANNED TO DESTROY RHINO'S REP


POLL:   RAINBOW RANDOLPH MOST HATED MAN IN AMERICA


PUBLIC OUTCRY:   "WE'RE SORRY SMOOCHY!"


EXT. POLICE PRECINCT - DAY

Randolph, bruised and battered, emerges from the police
station with his LAWYER. REPORTERS and photographers
rush forward.

                   REPORTER #1
           How does it feel to be voted the
           most hated man in America,
           Randolph?

                   RANDOLPH
           In a country like this, where your
           average citizen is a fuckin'
           Neanderthal, I wear it as a badge of
           honor.

                   REPORTER #2
           What about Ms. Bishop's charge that
           you have an unhealthy obsession
           with Sheldon Mopes?

                   RANDOLPH
           Listen, I barely know that broad.
           She's a wacko. An opportunist.
           I'm the most accused man since
           Jimmy Hoffa.

Someone throws an egg and it hits Randolph in the face.

                   RANDOLPH
              (on verge of tears)
           That was unfair! Who threw that?
           That was mean and uncalled for!

                                      (CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:

                     LAWYER
             My client is not answering any
             more questions. Between his
             dwindling cash flow and mounting
             legal bills he's sinking into a
             deep psychotic depression. Please
             stop antagonizing him. Thank you.

He pushes a sullen Randolph through the cluster of
people.


INT. BACKSTAGE - STUDIO C - DAY

A makeup woman dabs Sheldon's forehead as he's about to
go on. Nora stands next to him. A LOW TYMPANY ROLL is
heard from the stage.

                           SHELDON
                    (to Nora)
             I wouldn't be back here if it wasn't
             for you.

                           NORA
             I'm just sorry I didn't believe
             you... that I got swept up in the
             frenzy of anti-Smoochyism.

                           SHELDON
             Well, this town's a house of mirrors
             sometimes. It's hard to know what
             you're looking at.

He takes a couple of pre-show deep breaths.      A STAGEHAND
approaches.

                           STAGEHAND
             They're ready for you, Sheldon.

Sheldon exits backstage.


INT. STUDIO C - CONTINUOUS ACTION

The lights in the studio dim.

                      ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
             Ladies and gentlemen... boys and
             girls...
                (dramatic pause)
             Who's your favorite rhino?

An explosion of enthusiasm from the kids in the
bleachers.

                                       (CONTINUED)

                                                       70.

CONTINUED:

                     KIDS IN BLEACHERS
             Smoochy!!!

The lights come up as the Smoochyland Band plays a
strong, dramatic version of "Battle Hymn of the
Republic." After a moment, Smoochy slowly rises from a
lift under the stage. A giant sign above the jungle
lights up and emits a pyrotechnic shower of sparks. It
reads: WELCOME HOME SMOOCHY!


ANGLE ON SMOOCHYLAND BAND

A beaming Spinner Dunn enthusiastically bangs his cowbell
to the music as tears stream down his cheeks.


BACK ON SMOOCHY

He majestically stands center stage and nods to the kids
who are giving him a standing ovation. The song
crescendos with a rousing final chorus from the
Smoochyland Band who sing, "His truth is marching on!"

Thunderous applause from the bleachers. Smoochy walks
over to a stool and takes a seat. It's very quiet in the
studio now. Smoochy, looking uncharacteristically
serious, picks up a microphone as the lights go down.
He's in black limbo.

                     SMOOCHY
             Thank you. It's good to be back.
             You know, kids, sometimes life in
             the jungle can be unfair. A place
             where nice guys don't just finish
             last... they get their heads cut
             off.

Gasps from the bleachers.

                     SMOOCHY
             That pretty world you think you
             know is just props and scenery.
             Lollipop trees with roots in
             venom!

                     SMOOCHY
             So look around you, boys and
             girls. Every day. Be diligent!
             Stand strong! As the old proverb
             says: Beat a dog one time too
             many and you get a wolf! Let's
             start howling! Howl for me, boys
             and girls!

The kids in the bleachers howl along with Smoochy.

                     SMOOCHY
             Okay, I just wanted to get that
             off my chest. Who wants to do the
             Hokey-Pokey?!

The kids cheer as the Smoochyland Band launches into the
Hokey-Pokey song and Smoochy starts dancing. The kids
pour out of the bleachers onto the jungle set. Everyone
is dancing and having a ball. Nora is clapping to the
music offstage. Sheldon and Nora exchange affectionate
glances.

INT. ANGELO'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Randolph sits in front of the TELEVISION in a daze. He's
wearing a ratty bathrobe and absentmindedly tosses cheese
curls onto the floor from a bag on his lap. ON the TV,
an "Entertainment Tonight"-type show with two perky hosts
is covering Smoochy's return to the airwaves. The hosts,
Tara and Hunter show Smoochy's dynamic entrance and the
standing ovation he got during the taping that day.

                     TARA (V.O.)
             Well, Smoochy's back and boy did
             we miss him. Hundreds of well-
             wishers stood outside Kidnet
             Studios today hoping to catch a
             glimpse of their favorite rhino.

                     HUNTER (V.O.)
             That's right, Tara. Smoochy's
             popularity is stronger than ever
             thanks to his recent exoneration
             as a Nazi sympathizer. In fact,
             several movie studios are offering
             big bucks for a chance to bring
             the Smoochy story to the silver
             screen...

CONTINUED:

The BROADCAST CONTINUES. Smoochy images flash across the
screen. Randolph has been mumbling the whole time.

                     RANDOLPH
                (quietly to himself)
             Bad... very bad... too much for
             brain... pressure building... ears
             ringing... eyes burning...
             contempt overflowing...

He jumps up and kicks the TV over.    He picks up a lamp
and starts beating the TV.

                     RANDOLPH
             I hate you! I fucking hate you!!!
             You devil-horned mind fucker!
             Die, die, die!!

Angelo, who was cooking in the kitchen, runs out.       He's
wearing an apron.

                     ANGELO
             What are you doing?! That's a
             Zenith!
                (notices cheese curls)
             Look at this place!

He grabs the lamp from Randolph.

                     ANGELO
             That's it! I want you out of
             here!

                     RANDOLPH
                (suddenly scared)
             Where am I supposed to go?

                     ANGELO
             I don't care!
                (pointing to door)
             Out!!


INT. SPINNER DUNN'S - NIGHT

Spinner's massive arms envelope Sheldon in a bear hug,
practically lifting him out of his seat. Burke, who's
having dinner with Sheldon, holds onto the table before
it gets knocked over.

                     SHELDON
             Easy, Spinner. Watch the ribs,
             buddy.

                                          (CONTINUED)

                                                            73.

                           SHELDON
             I missed you too, champ.

He drops Sheldon and pulls out his cowbell.

                     SPINNER
             I've been practicing and
             practicing and I got real good,
             Sheldon. Real good!

He starts banging on it with a butter knife.      Sheldon
cringes.

                     SPINNER
             Wanna see me march?

                     SHELDON
             Sure, why not.

Spinner starts marching through the restaurant, clanging
the cowbell. People who are trying to eat their dinner
look annoyed. Sheldon sits back down at his table.

                     BURKE
             So you were saying you had some
             good news?

                     SHELDON
             Yes. Some very good news. After
             giving it a lot of thought... I've
             decided to do the ice show.

Burke gleefully slaps Sheldon on the shoulder.

                     BURKE
             Finally! I got me a bar mitzvah
             boy. Today you are a man!

                     SHELDON
             I realize now it's a sin to waste
             your power.

                     BURKE
             Like they say, rock bottom's a
             college education.

                                        (CONTINUED)

                     SHELDON
             But here's the really good news:
             I'm doing it myself. No sponsors,
             no vendors, no crooks. Not one
             dirty hand will touch this. Not
             one person will make a dollar off
             these kids. Smoochy on Ice will
             be a study in purity.

Burke's grin suddenly fades.

                     SHELDON
             As far as food concessions go,
             I'll supply the refreshments. For
             free. Low sodium, whole wheat
             pretzels and apple slices. Healthy
             stuff. Now are you ready for the
             best part?

                     BURKE
             I'm holding my breath.

                     SHELDON
             All profits from ticket sales will
             be used to built a state-of-the-
             art methadone clinic in Coney
             Island.

Burke looks pale.

                     SHELDON
             I'm not just talking a run-of-the-
             mill clinic... I'm going to build
             a methadone palace. A place where

             Sheldon, you can't do an ice show
             and cut out the vendors. And more
             importantly, you can't cut out the
             Parade of Hope. It's suicide.

                     SHELDON
             You always told me, when you've
             got muscles you make the rules.
             Well, I'm feeling pretty strong
             right now.

Sheldon rises and tosses his napkin down.

                                       (CONTINUED)

                                                           75.

CONTINUED:

                     SHELDON
             All this time I was letting the
             business use me. Well, I think it's
             time I start using the business.
             I've got my clout back and I'm not
             gonna waste it this time. Take care
             of it, Burke.

Sheldon exits.    Burke sits there, looking very concerned.

On his way out the door, Tommy stops Sheldon.       Spinner's
COWBELL CLANGING continues.

                     TOMMY
             Shel, you gotta help me out. He
             bangs that goddamn thing from
             morning till night. I got a
             headache that goes from my eyes to
             my ass.

                     SHELDON
             Whatever I can do, Tommy, just say
             it. You know I love Spinner. And
             I owe you.

                     TOMMY
             Give the boy something else to do on
             the show. Anything. Just as long
             as it don't clang, chime or honk.

Chick, the Asian representative of Takashi, holds a

             I don't like complications, Frank.
             You got one week to get Takashi that

                     STOKES
             Don't you understand? My hands are
             tied. The rhino's been exonerated.
             The show's more popular than ever.

             and dump him in the woods.

Sambo and Tobi start to advance on Stokes.

                     STOKES
             All right! I'll take care of it!
             I just need time!

Chick leans into Stokes' face.

                     CHICK
             One week, Jeeves. Got that? Or
             I get a blender and make an Orange
             Julius with your feet.

They exit.


EXT. STREET - DAY

A down-and-out Randolph shuffles along in ratty bedroom
slippers. He passes a MAN who sits behind a small table
on the sidewalk. The table has a huge photograph of a
rhinoceros taped in front of it. Literature and
pamphlets depicting the black rhino are spread out on the
table.

                     MAN
             Save the rhino! Before it's too
             late! Make a donation! Save the
             rhino!
                (to Randolph)
             Hey, mister, ya wanna help save
             the rhino?

Randolph just looks at him for a moment. He looks at all
the rhino-related imagery. He starts shaking and
suddenly jumps over the table and attacks the Man.

                     RANDOLPH
             I'm the one who needs to be saved!
             Me. I'm broke! I lost my lawyer!
             My only friend kicked me out! I'm
             a fucking peanut shell in the
             shape of a man! Save the
             Rainbow! Save the Rainbow!
             Save the Rainbow!

                      MAN
             Help!   Someone call a cop!

Randolph grabs the collection can and runs off.

                                                      77.

EXT. CENTRAL PARK - DAY

It's a chilly, grey afternoon. Stokes and Burke walk along
the lake framed by the New York skyline.

                        STOKES
          Your client is suffocating me. To
          make matters worse, he's caused me
          to veer into a hazardous situation.
          A situation that otherwise could
          have a very happy ending.

                  BURKE
          Tell me more about the Asians.

                  STOKES
          They're ruthless. Unwavering.
          Unprincipled. And best of all,
          they know how the game is played.
          They respect our delicate
          ecosystem of mutual benefit.

Stokes stops walking and grabs Burke's arm.

                  STOKES
          I'd bring you in on this, Burke.
          You'd be my partner on the Takashi
          deal. Split down the middle. We
          have an opportunity to get back on
          track here. Back to the way it
          was.

                  BURKE
          The good old days.

                  STOKES
          Pre-rhinoceros.

The two men look at each other as thoughts pass silently
between them.

                  BURKE
          This is very sticky ground we're
          about to walk on.

                        STOKES
          Well, you're used to a little
          glue on your shoes.

Burke smiles.

                        BURKE
          Let me poke around. Sift through
          the possibilities.

EXT. ALLEY OFF ND STREET - THEATER STAGE DOOR -
EVENING

A slender young man in a Peter Pan costume in being held
by a big thug as another thug beats him up. A girl
dressed as Tinkerbell (also being restrained) looks on in
horror. Merv Green (Parade of Hope) steps INTO FRAME.

                  MERV
          This is what happens to guys who
          keep secrets, Johnny.

                  JOHNNY
          I'll give you the rest next week!
          I promise!

                  MERV
          It's not me you're fucking over,
          it's sick kids. You got something
          against sick kids, Johnny?

The thug punches him in the stomach again.

                   JOHNNY
          No!   I love sick kids!

Merv nods to one of the thugs who releases Peter Pan.   He
slumps to the ground. Merv kneels down and lifts his
head from the pavement.

                  MERV
          And you tell that fat producer of
          yours, if he ever gives me a low
          head count again, he'll lose the
          other thumb.

One of Merv's thugs leans in, whispers something to
Merv, who looks up to see.

Burke standing in the mouth of the alley.

                  BURKE
          Merv Green. How's tricks, kid?

                  MERV
          Well, if it ain't smilin' Burke.
          Whose bones are you pickin' today?

                  BURKE

EXT. ND STREET - MOMENTS LATER

Burke and Merv walk along 42nd Street. A poster
advertises Peter Pan "Sponsored by Parade of Hope --
Giving Children the Gift of Promise!" Merv's
thugs trail behind.

                   MERV
          No one freezes me out of an ice
          show. No one. I don't care how
          many fucking clinics he's trying
          to save.

                  BURKE
          Look, I'm chokin' on the same bone
          as you.

                  MERV
          If you're trying to aggravate me,
          you're doing a hell of a job.

                  BURKE
          I'm not here to aggravate, just
          educate. I think Mopes might be
          talking to people he shouldn't be
          talking to.

                  MERV
          That's an ugly string of words.

                  BURKE
          He's got it in his head that he's
          gonna clean up the way we do
          business.
             (beat)
          Truthfully? I wouldn't be
          surprised if he's wearing a wire.

Burke looks at his watch.

                  BURKE
          Jesus, I got a thing across town.

He steps off the curb to hail a cab.

                  BURKE
          Let's keep talking, Merv. There's
          oughta be some kind of solution.
          Don't you think?

Burke hops into a cab.   Merv watches the cab pull away.

EXT. TIMES SQUARE - OUTSIDE KIDNET BUILDING - TIGHT
SHOT - LEGS OF SMALL CARD TABLE - MORNING

SNAP open. The table is set on the sidewalk. A man's
legs ENTER the FRAME and shakily climb on top of the
table.


WIDER

Randolph stands on the table directly in front of the
Kidnet Building. He raises the megaphone to his mouth.

                        RANDOLPH
          Attention, New Yorkers! You are
          about to hear a shocking story
          of injustice!


WIDER

Randolph stands on the table directly in front of the
Kidnet Building.

                        RANDOLPH
          I urge you to listen! It has a
          surprise ending you won't want
          to miss!

A crowd starts to form on the sidewalk.

                        RANDOLPH
          It's the story of a venomous rhino
          and his aggressive campaign to
          slander, vilify, defame, denigrate
          and villainize my good name! But
          one thing he can't do, is take my
          life from me. No, friends, only I
          have the power to do that!

He reaches down and picks up a can of gasoline.

                             RANDOLPH
          This is what Smoochy has done to
          me! He's brought me to this! I
          can no longer live in a world
          where the innocent suffer and
          the wicked thrive!

Randolph raises the can over his head and pauses
dramatically.

                  RANDOLPH
          Where is God??!!

CONTINUED:

He drenches himself with gasoline. The crowd grows
larger. He holds up a pack of matches.

                     RANDOLPH
             I'm sorry to do this, people.
             Don't try to talk me out of it.

The crowd starts to applaud.     Randolph looks baffled.

                      MAN IN CROWD
             Do it!   Light it!

                     RANDOLPH
             Our guest of honor will be here
             any moment! This is for his eyes!
             For his conscience. He'll have to
             live with this imagine for the
             rest of his miserable life!


INT. LIMO - CONTINUOUS ACTION

Sheldon sits in the back of a limo on his way to work,
reading the paper. The headline blares: "SMOOCHY

"ALL PROCEEDS TO BENEFIT BROOKLYN CLINIC."

             with it.

                      LESTER
             Sound advice, Mr. Mopes. If I
             ever get any power I'll give that
             a whirl.

                 up ahead)
             Hey, what's going on up there?

Sheldon glances up from his paper.

                     SMOOCHY
                (casually)
             Looks like a street performer of
             some sort.

He goes back to his paper.


EXT. TIMES SQUARE - CONTINUOUS ACTION

Randolph sees the Kidnet limo approaching.

                                        (CONTINUED)

                                                      82.

                     RANDOLPH
             This is it, folks! It's showtime!
             I'm sorry to do this, but he's
             left me no choice!

Randolph tries to light another match, but it's wet from
the gasoline. The crowd laughs and starts taunting him.

                     RANDOLPH
             Shut up, you hillbilly assholes!
             You're borough trash! Go back to
             your huts across the river!

Randolph keeps trying to light the match. Finally, after
several attempts, it lights. He holds it up. The crowd
burst into applause.

                     RANDOLPH
             Fuck you! Fuck all you people! I
             was the last of the Mohicans!
             You'll never see another Rainbow
             Randolph in this lifetime! You
             had me and you blew it! All of
             you!

He turns and faces the approaching limousine.

                     RANDOLPH
             This if for you, Smoochy!
             Remember this! As long as you
             live, remember this image! You
             did this to me!

He brings the match closer to his gasoline-soaked body.
The limo continues to approach. The crowd taunts him to
do it. He tries to bring the match closer, but his hand
is shaking. Suddenly, a LITTLE GIRL pushes through the
crowd. Everyone quiets down as she looks up at
Randolph.

                     LITTLE GIRL
             Whatcha doin', Rainbow Randolph?

Randolph freezes as he looks down at the Little Girl. A
slight look of hope comes over his face. She smiles
sweetly at him, walks over, and blows out the match.
Randolph is overcome with emotion. Just then, Sheldon's
LIMO WHOOSHES past him. The crowd cheers.

                           CROWD
             Smoochy!!!

CONTINUED:

They all run away from Randolph and over to Sheldon's
limo as it pulls in front of the Kidnet Building.
Randolph stares at them blankly. He looks down. The
Little Girl is gone. Sheldon gets out of the limo.
The crowd cheers him as he waves to them before going
inside.

A look of utter frustration now comes over Randolph.


OVERHEAD SHOT

Randolph drops to his knees on the table, looks skyward,
and screams.

                     RANDOLPH
             What does it all mean??!!

The CAMERA RISES ABOVE him as he lets out an anguished
howl that REVERBERATES through the skyscrapers.

Sheldon gently tries to break the news to Spinner who's
on the verge of tears.

                     SHELDON
             You're too talented for the

             I ain't no baby!

                     SHELDON
             That's right. You're a fully
             grown man. With whiskers... and
             scars... the whole sha-bang.
             That's why you deserve a bigger
             role on the show. A more
             important role...

Spinner's face starts to perk up.

INT. STUDIO C - SHORT WHILE LATER

It's the middle of a Smoochy taping. Smoochy and the
Gang are wrapping up a song entitled, "My Stepdad's Not
Mean (He's Just Adjusting.)" The kids in the bleachers
are singing the chorus.

                        KIDS
          'Stepdads are people too/ They
          have bad days, like we all do/
          Be patient and help them through/
          Stepdads are people too...'

Smoochy continues the song.

                       SMOOCHY
             (singing)
          ... 'So three cheers for the man
          that I proudly call Stan... He's
          not quite a dad or a brother...
          Yes, he gets cross, but still he's
          the boss... And besides he takes
          care of my mother!'

The song ends. The kids in the bleachers applaud.
Smoochy addresses them.

                  SMOOCHY
          Remember, kids. First
          impressions, good or bad, are not
          always what they seem. Just like
          a new puppy, new dads need to
          adjust to their surroundings. So
          give 'em time! But always
          remember... if he becomes abusive
          to you or Mommy... what are the
          magic numbers?

                  KIDS IN BLEACHERS

          And now, boys and girls, I have a
          special surprise. I'd like to
          introduce the newest member of the
          Magic Jungle... my cousin...
          Moochy the Rhino!

CONTINUED:

The Smoochyland Band plays a happy little song as Spinner
Dunn, in costume as Moochy, runs on stage. The Moochy
costume is identical to Smoochy only it's a darker
orange instead of bright orange.

                     SMOOCHY
             Howdy, Moochy! Welcome to the
             Jungle! You wanna say howdy to
             the kids?

Spinner freezes.       He stares at the camera.

                       SMOOCHY
             Moochy?

                     SPINNER
             My name is Moochy.

                     SMOOCHY
             That's right. We've established
             that.

                     SPINNER
                (leaning into Sheldon)
             Sheldon, this costume's makin' my
             nuts itch.

Sheldon looks horrified. The Smoochyland Band quickly
launches into some music. Smoochy, Moochy and a few
other jungle animals begin to dance. Moochy's lumbering
movements are in stark contrast to the choreographed
steps of the others. As a bonus, he occasionally
scratches his crotch.


INT. SHELDON'S DRESSING ROOM - AFTER THE SHOW

A happy Spinner (still in costume as Moochy) pokes his
head into Sheldon's dressing room. Sheldon, still in
costume as well, looks drained after the difficult
taping.

                     SPINNER
             That was fun! Was it bad when I
             done that thing, where I tripped
             and knocked over the Flamingo and
             then he knocked over the cameraman
             and then those lights fell down on
             that lady's head?

                     SHELDON
             It's fine, Spinner. We'll edit it
             out. But tomorrow in rehearsal
             we're gonna work on a new thing
             called 'the importance of hitting
             your mark.'

                       SPINNER
             Great!    I get to hit something!

Spinner dances off. A beat later, Nora enters and shuts
the door. There's an awkward beat of silence.

                       NORA
             Hi.

                       SHELDON
             Hi.

                     NORA
             I read about the ice show.

                     SHELDON
             Yeah, the papers seem to be really
             covering it.

                     NORA
             I think it's great. What you're
             doing for that clinic.

                       SHELDON
             Thanks.

She nods.

                     NORA
             I just need some clarification...

                           SHELDON
             Don't worry. Spinner just needs
             a little more rehearsal. I'll get
             him there.

                           NORA
             No I mean about us.

Sheldon looks uncomfortable.

                           NORA
             Ever since you've been back I just
             feel like there's something that's
             not connecting.

             I guess I'm still readjusting a
             little. Like a guy who's come
             back from the war. Not that I'd
             equate my misfortune with the

             brave men and women who protect
             us overseas.

                           NORA
             I just thought we were on our way
             to something... granted, my
             mistaken belief that you had ties
             to Neo-Nazis might have put a
             damper on our relationship, but
             I'm sorry for --

Sheldon suddenly jumps up and grabs her. He kisses her
passionately. Nora immediately starts ripping off his
costume as they make out. They fall to the floor in
a lustful embrace.


INT. STUDIO - BACK HALLWAY - SAME TIME

Spinner, humming to himself, lumbers down the hallway on
his way to the wardrobe room. Halfway down the hall, he
hears a voice call out to him.

                     VOICE (O.S.)
             Hey -- rhino.

Spinner turns around. The door to the fire exit swings
open. Two of Merv's thugs emerge and grab Spinner (who's
still in full Moochy costume) and drag him into the
stairwell.


INT. UNDERGROUND PARKING GARAGE - MOMENT LATER

Spinner is dragged into the garage and knocked to the
pavement. Several more thugs emerge from the shadows,
including Henry, Merv's main henchman. They start
beating him with lead pipes. Henry pulls out a REVOLVER.
He SHOOTS the rhino several times. A sedan trunk is
popped open and Moochy is thrown inside. The CAR
SCREECHES up to the street.


INT. CHINATOWN - NIGHT

We CRANE DOWN FROM a Chinese banner that stretches across
two tenements. We LAND ON the seedy, deserted street
below as the SEDAN BARRELS INTO FRAME and SQUEALS to a
stop.

CONTINUED:

Two thugs emerge from the car. They pull Spinner/Moochy
from the trunk and toss his body by some garbage cans,
knocking a few over. They get back in the car and speed
away. Moochy's lifeless foam body rolls into the gutter
and lays motionless. Blood seeps through his foamy
torso.


LOW OVERHEAD SHOT

of Spinner/Moochy. We SLOWLY START TO RISE UP as we LOOK
DOWN AT the rhino's body. The WIND WHISTLES through the
empty street as we get HIGHER. The Chinese banner
rustles THROUGH the FRAME. As we get HIGHER AND HIGHER,
we hear the intermittent CLANG of a PRIZE FIGHT BELL.

EXT. SAME STREET - HOURS LATER

In the same frame, detectives and uniformed cops are now
at the scene gathering evidence. Where Spinner once lay,
there is now a bright yellow chalk outline in the shape
of a rhinoceros.


INT. PARADE OF HOPE OFFICES - NEXT DAY

FULL FRAME ON a TELEVISION screen.    A local news anchor
is reading the top story.

                     ANCHOR (V.O.)
             Former heavyweight contender and
             restaurateur Lawrence 'Spinner'
             Dunn was found shot to death in a
             rhinoceros outfit early this
             morning in Chinatown. Dunn, a
             frequent performer on 'Smoochy's
             Magic Jungle,' was pronounced dead
             at the scene. Police are

A hand ENTERS FRAME and violently slaps the TV OFF.


WIDE

An enraged Merv Green glares at his henchmen, Henry and
MITCH.

                     MERV
             How could you hit the wrong
             rhino?!

                     HENRY
             Who knew Smoochy had a cousin
             Moochy? They look fucking
             identical.

                     MERV
             Smoochy is bright orange, Moochy
             is burnt rust! Read the papers!
             Do I gotta take you back to
             fucking kindergarten?

                     MITCH
             All you said was 'hit the rhino.'
             You never specified the color.
             I'm not taking the blame for this
             one.

Merv's anger builds. He turns to a picture of Smoochy
which is tacked to a bulletin board along with other kid
show personalities that the foundation extorts. Merv
picks up a letter opener and violently thrusts it into
the picture.

                           MERV
             I'm not through with you yet,
             rhino! Your time will fucking
             come!


INT. ANGELO'S APARTMENT - SHORT WHILE LATER

Cops rummage through Angelo's apartment. In the b.g.,
a detective, ELLIS, interviews Angelo. Another
detective, McCALL, is looking through some papers he
found.

                           McCALL
             Ellie, over here.

Ellis walks over. McCall shows him some scribblings he's
found in a notebook of Randolph's. The crude drawings
depict Smoochy with his head cut off... with a knife in
his heart... being pissed on by Randolph, etc. "Die,
Rhino, Die" is scrawled hundreds of times, filling page
after page. The two detectives look at each other and
nod.


INT. SPINNER DUNN'S RESTAURANT - DAY

Spinner sleeps forever in an open casket, clutching his
cowbell. Dozens of Spinner's relatives are at the wake.

A bagpipe player plays "Amazing Grace." Sheldon stands
at the casket, fighting back tears as he stares down at
his old friend. Nora has her arm around him.

                           SHELDON
             It's my fault. He'd still be
             alive if it wasn't for me. He
             would have been so proud to be in
             the ice show.

                     NORA
             There was nothing you could have
             done. Don't torture yourself.

                     SHELDON
             I'm sorry, Spinner.   I'm so sorry.

Tommy and the boys walk over. Tommy puts his arm around
Sheldon as he gazes somberly at Spinner.

                     TOMMY
             He really loved you, Shel. And
             this I guarantee -- that fucking
             Randolph has seen his last
             rainbow. We're gonna find him,
             cut off his balls, and shove 'em
             up his ass.

                     SHELDON
             Maybe you better leave it to the
             police.

                     DANNY
             They won't do the ball thing.
             It's against procedure.

                     TOMMY
             Don't forget -- that hit was meant
             for you, Shel. So from now on,
             everywhere you go, we go.

                     SHELDON
             That's okay, Tommy.   I'll be fine.

                     TOMMY
             Fine, nothin'. And as Christ is
             my witness, no one's touchin' a
             hair on your fuckin' head.
             Spinner would have wanted it that
             way.

Tommy's crew nods and agrees.

             Alright, boys, let's get shit-
             faced. For Spin.

They head for the bar.    Nora and Sheldon look down at
Spinner in silence.

                     SHELDON
             Didn't Rickets the Hippo have a
             song about death?

                     NORA
             'The Last Nappy Time.' It gave me
             a lot of comfort when my mother
             died.
                (sings quietly)
             'When doggies stop barking
             And fish cease to swim
             And Grandpa lays silent, from his
               head to his limbs
             Sadness will find you

air: "MANHUNT UNDERWAY FOR RAINBOW RANDOLPH... SUSPECTED

SHOOTING, DRENCHED IN GASOLINE AND ACTING PECULIAR..."

We CRANE DOWN FROM the zipper ONTO the sidewalk.
Randolph is talking on a pay phone. We hear Angelo on
the other end.

                           RANDOLPH
             Mastermind? I can barely figure
             out how to unzip my pants these
             days. Just taking a piss is a
             logistical nightmare.

                           ANGELO (V.O.)
             I believe you, Randy. But you
             can't come back to my place.
             They'll find you. You gotta go
             underground.


EXT. LIBERTY FLOUR AND BISCUIT FACTORY - NIGHT

We are outside the long-abandoned Liberty Biscuit and
Flour factory. The Liberty sign with its Statue of
Liberty logo is eroded and partially missing.


INT. LIBERTY BISCUIT AND FLOUR FACTORY - CONTINUOUS
ACTION

Inside the massive dormant factory, rats scurry around
and pigeons occasionally fly from window sill to window
sill. A makeshift living area has been set up in the
middle of it all -- a chair, lamp, small table, hot
plate, etc. Randolph lays on the dilapidated conveyor
belt, huddled under a blanket.

Angelo enters the factory through a rusty door, carrying
provisions.

                     ANGELO
             It's heatin' up out there. Every
             cop in New York is looking for
             you. And Tommy Cotter's boys are
             combin' the streets. You're gonna
             have to stay put for a while.

Randolph sits up on the conveyor belt, blanket draped
over his shoulders. He's a physical and emotional wreck.

                     RANDOLPH
             I was an altar boy once. Did you
             know that? I wanted to be a
             priest. Do you believe in angels,
             Angie?

             There was a little angel in
             pigtails. She was the only one
             who cared about me. She saved my
             life.

Angelo hops up on the conveyor belt to console Randolph.
Randolph rests his head on Angelo's shoulder.

                     ANGELO
             You didn't want to kill yourself,
             Randy. You know that.

                     RANDOLPH
             Perhaps it's time to heal. To
             accept the fact that Smoochy has
             won and gracefully march forward.
             True, I'm currently wanted for a
             murder I didn't commit. But I
             have faith. Faith that justice
             will prevail.

                     ANGELO
             Now you're talkin', kid. This is
             a big step... I'm proud of you.

He strokes Randolph's head.

                     RANDOLPH
             Did you bring lunch?

                       ANGELO
             Yes.

             Chicken and stars?

             Just like you asked for.

             Can I have some, please?

                     ANGELO
             For a smile.

Randolph sniffs and manages a small pitiful smile.
Angelo musses his hair.

Angelo lifts one of the grocery bags onto the conveyor
belt.

                     ANGELO
             Here, I got you some crossword
             puzzles and stuff to read.

Angelo hops off the conveyor belt and turns on the hot
plate. He starts to open a can of soup. Randolph
reaches into the bag and pulls out a copy of the New York
Post. The lead article's headline reads, "WAKE FOR
SPINNER." A large photograph shows mourners leaving the
restaurant after the wake. Clearly visible are Sheldon
and Nora. They have their arms around each other.
Randolph's eyes widen. He starts to hyperventilate.
Angelo looks up.

                     ANGELO
             You okay? Randy?

Finally, Randolph expels a blood-curdling scream that
ECHOES through the factory.

                     RANDOLPH
             Motherfucker!!!!!!!

Angelo drops the soup.      Birds in the factory flutter from
the rafters.


INT. MADISON SQUARE GARDEN - ICE RINK

Sheldon and the Rhinettes work on some choreography for
that night's show. Nora watches from the sidelines. As
Sheldon skates on the ice rink, Merv enters with Roy and

too.

                           TOMMY
             Big news, Shel.

                            SHELDON
             What's that?

                           TOMMY
             It wasn't Smiley who killed
             Spinner. It was Parade of Hope.

                            NORA
             Merv Green?

                           SHELDON
             Are you sure? The cops have tons
             of evidence on Randolph.

             We did our own investigation.
             Cousin Ian from down at the
             morgue... you met him at the

FLASHBACK - INT. SPINNER DUNN'S - DAY

Tommy is at the bar listening intently to a man, IAN,
who is pointing to certain details on a photograph.

                           IAN
             See the neck? Snapped like a
             twig. Animals... Parade of Hope's
             calling card. When they do a guy,
             they like to sign the tab.

                     TOMMY
             What's that guy's name over there?
             Green?

                                 LEON
             Yeah, Merv Green.

                           TOMMY
             This was one time they shoulda
             left the tab blank.


INT. ICE RINK (PRESENT)

                           NORA
             I knew Merv Green was a scumbag
             from the day he grabbed my ass at
             a 'Feed the Children' benefit.

                           SHELDON
             Well, God help those guys now.
             They're gonna get a first-class
             ride through the criminal justice
             system, and I'm buying the
             tickets.

                           TOMMY
             It's all taken care of, Shel.

                           SHELDON
             What does that mean?

                                                        96.

FLASHBACK - INT. WAREHOUSE - NIGHT

A bloodied Merv Green is tied to a chair in the middle
of the warehouse as he begs Tommy for his life. Merv's
two henchmen lay dead nearby. Roy, Jimmy and Sammy --
Tommy's guys -- stand behind her.

                  MERV
          It was a mistake! An honest
          mistake! All I'm trying to do is
          help children.

                  TOMMY
          You like kids, huh?

                   MERV
          Yes!   Of course!

                  TOMMY
          So you must know a few fairy
          tales. Danny, tell him the one
          about the worthless prick who gets
          his head chopped off.

Danny, holding a hatchet, advances toward Merv. Tommy
casually walks away. We STAY WITH Tommy. Merv is NO
LONGER IN FRAME.

                  MERV (O.S.)
          No... no... no!

He SCREAMS.

We hear the sound of the HATCHET HITTING its target.
Merv's pleading stops.

                  TOMMY
          Now you know why charities go
          under sometimes.


INT. ICE RINK (PRESENT)

                        SHELDON
          Do we really need to hear this?
          I don't want to hear this.

                          JIMMY
          A clean cut.

                          SHELDON
          Okay, got it.

                                     (CONTINUED)

                           SHELDON
             Thank you! Specifics about his
             head are superfluous at this
             point.


INT. STOKES' OFFICE - EVENING

Nora is alone in Stokes' office, rearranging cards on
the giant cork board that displays the network schedule.
She is startled to hear a deep voice behind her.

                            VOICE (O.S.)
             Where is he?

She turns around. Chick, Tobi, and Sambo are standing
there. Chick walks over to the cork board. He scans a
row of cards that all read "Smoochy."

                           NORA
                    (attitude)
             Can I help you with something?

                           CHICK
             Yeah, honey, you can help us
             with something...

He rips a Smoochy index card from the board, walks over
to her and waves it in her face.

                           CHICK
             You tell that boss of yours he
             better take care of the rhino
             problem. In my culture we honor
             deals or invite consequences.

                           NORA
             I don't know what you're talking
             about and your cologne's making
             me nauseous. Other than that,
             you're great company.

Chick looks at his boys and chuckles.

                           CHICK
             Spicy little thing, isn't she?

                                           (CONTINUED)

                                                      98.

CONTINUED:

He suddenly pulls out a switchblade and holds it to
Nora's throat.

                           CHICK
             Takashi gets that time slot. You
             hear me, girly? Tell that boss of
             yours we'll kill everyone at this
             fucking network if we have to.
             Starting with the pretty ones.

He removes the knife from her throat and hurls it toward
the bulletin board. It lands -- sticking right in the
middle of a Smoochy card.

                           CHICK
             Auf Wiedersehen, honey.

They exit.


INT. SHELDON'S PENTHOUSE - NIGHT

Nora is pacing.    Sheldon sits by the fire.

                     NORA
             It's Stokes. He's behind the
             whole thing! He cut some kind of
             deal for the Smoochy slot!

                     SHELDON
             What are you talking about?

                     NORA
             He wants you out so he can put
             Takashi in!

                     SHELDON
             Who's Takashi?

                           NORA
             Jesus, Sheldon! Don't you ever
             pick up a copy of International
             Performer? He's the hottest kid
             show host from Asia.

Sheldon's head is swimming. Suddenly the front door to
to the penthouse bursts open. Randolph, dressed like
he's about to do his old show, stumbles in waving a gun.

                                       (CONTINUED)

                                                          99.

CONTINUED:

                           RANDOLPH
             Ah! How very cozy. Like two logs
             in a little bonfire. All we need
             is a few sticks and some wienies.

He almost trips as he stumbles over to Sheldon.      He
waves the gun in his face.

                           RANDOLPH
             I had her before you! Pachyderm!
             I was in love with her! In love!
             And you snatched her away! Like
             a common thief! You're the bad
             guy! Not me! He's the bad guy,
             Nora. He's incapable of
             understanding the love we once
             had! Tender, yet passionate.
             Old-fashioned, yet experimental.
                    (cackles)
             Tell him about a few of our
             experiments, Nora! Tell him!

Sheldon looks stunned.    Nora hangs her head.

                            SHELDON
                    (to Nora)
             Is this true? Please tell me it's
             just the confused ramblings of a
             diseased mind.

She looks at him, but doesn't say anything.

                           SHELDON
             Holy mother of Toledo. When
             exactly were you planning to let
             me know about this?!

                           NORA
                    (turns to Sheldon)
             Listen, there was a time -- and
             I'm not proud of this -- but there
             was a time when I was a bit of
             a... kiddie-host groupie.

                           RANDOLPH
             You're just another action figure
             for her collection!

                           NORA
             That's not fair!

                           RANDOLPH
             Tell him about Jingle Jackson!

                                       (CONTINUED)

                                                          100.

CONTINUED:

                           SHELDON
             You dated Jingle Jackson?

                           RANDOLPH
             The bells turned her on. Hey,
             tell him about Jumbo Johnny!
             There's a tale for ya! A whale
             of a tale!

She looks down, somewhat ashamed.      A look of utter shock

comes over Sheldon.

                           SHELDON
             Oh good Lord in Heaven.

                           NORA
             Look, what I did before I met you
             is none of your business.

                            RANDOLPH
             Shut up!   Both of you! This is
             my show!

He waves the gun threateningly as he backs up to an
armchair and sits down.

                                RANDOLPH
             Do you fully understand the power
             of a condemned man? Do you? I'm
             already wanted for one murder, why
             should I give a flaming horse's
             twat if I commit two more?

                           SHELDON
             I... uh... read once that the best
             way to diffuse a tense situation
             is with a little humor. To that
             end, would you like to hear a
             funny joke?

                            RANDOLPH
                     (rolling his eyes)
             Oh, please. Go blow yourself,
             Martha.
                     (waves gun again)
             Fix me a beverage, woman. Make me
             one of those drinks that used to
             make us all warm and fuzzy before
             bouncy-bouncy time!

                           NORA
             Fix it yourself, asshole.

             Remember, I have Mr. Boomy.

                           SHELDON
             I'm telling you, you'd love this
             joke. It revolves around Santa
             Claus and the Easter Bunny getting
             into a fender bender.

Nora rolls her eyes and goes to the bar.

                           RANDOLPH
                    (to Sheldon)
             You know, when I lived here I used
             to have a big painting above the
             fireplace. A naked chick holding
             a pumpkin. It was very tasteful.
             No bush...

                           NORA
             Look, Randolph. We know it
             wasn't you who killed Spinner.

                           SHELDON
             We'll go to the police, first
             thing tomorrow... straighten
             everything out.

                                          RANDOLPH
             Oh!  Goody-goody gumdrops!
                    (to Nora)
             Vodka straight up is fine, sugar
             babe!

He grabs the bottle out of her hand. He rises from the
chair. He takes a CD, "PARTY TIME WITH RAINBOW
RANDOLPH," from his pocket and puts it into an
audio system on the fireplace wall.

                           RANDOLPH
             Did you put on a little weight,
             honey? That's okay, you're still
             a hot little brood mare. I bet
             you miss the sweet sting of my
             riding crop. Giddy up, pony!

The THEME SONG from his show starts to PLAY. He flicks
a switch and a spotlight goes on. He sings and dances.

                                       (CONTINUED)

                                                       102.

                 'Ol' MacDonald)
             'Rainbow Randolph is the man.
             Yes he, yes he, is.
             He's the Prez of Rainbowland.
             Yes he, yes he, is.
             With some fun, fun here, and a
               laugh, laugh there.
             Here a dance, there a song,
             Everything is fun, fun.
             Rainbow Randolph is the King, the
               King of Rainbowland!'

Randolph takes another drink from the vodka bottle.
Sheldon suddenly lunges at Randolph and tries to grab
the gun. Randolph shrieks. The two men wrestle on the
floor, but Randolph is not much of a fighter. He
screams as Sheldon rolls him toward the fireplace.

                     SHELDON
             Is this what you want? A Hansel
             and Gretel ending?! You want to
             be the big bad wolf?

                     RANDOLPH
             Stop! It's too hot!    The heat!
             It's driving me mad!

Randolph rolls Sheldon to the bottom. Nora reaches for a
fireplace poker and whacks Randolph with it. Randolph
cries out and drops the gun. Sheldon grabs it and points
it at Randolph who lies on the floor, blubbering like a
child. He's bleeding.

                     RANDOLPH
             Go ahead, kill me! Finish me off.
             My life's over anyway. Everything
             I touch turns to shit. Put me out
             of my misery.

Sheldon slowly takes the gun away from Randolph's head.

                     SHELDON
             You're not nothing. You're
             bitter, misguided and I'm guessing
             a raging alcoholic, but you're
             still Rainbow Randolph. Despite
             everything that's happened, you
             once made children happy.

Randolph sits up and looks at Sheldon through watery
eyes.

                                        (CONTINUED)

                                                         103.

             Sure.

                           RANDOLPH
                    (to Nora)
             You too?

                              NORA
             I guess.

                           RANDOLPH
             Sorry about the brood mare stuff.

Randolph throws his arms around Sheldon and cries into
his shoulder. Sheldon pats his back. He glances down at
Randolph's gun and sees that it's a toy.

Nora pours vodka onto a small pillow she's taken from
one of the chairs. She kneels next to Randolph and blots
the gash on his head with the vodka soaked pillow.
Randolph lets out a blood curdling scream.

Sheldon loads his gun as Randolph is curled up on the
couch like a little puppy. Nora hands him a cup of tea.

                           RANDOLPH
                    (a pitiful child)
             Thank you.

She walks over to Sheldon.

                           NORA
                    (re: gun)
             What are you doing?

Sheldon continues to load the gun.

             Just making the playing field
             even. I'm tired of running this
             race with one leg.

                           NORA
             You're letting them drag you down
             to their level.

                           RANDOLPH
                    (from couch)
             She's right, Sheldon. Don't make
             the same mistakes I did. Keep
             your dignity intact.

He accidentally spills some hot tea on himself.

                           RANDOLPH
             Son-of-a-bitch!

                           SHELDON
             I appreciate everyone's concern,
             but I can take care of myself.

Nora and Randolph look at each other.

                           RANDOLPH
                    (mouthing to Nora)
             I tried.

Sheldon stuffs some extra bullets in his pocket.

                     SHELDON
                    (to Randolph)
             Okay, buddy, we have to get down
             to the Garden. You're welcome to
             stay here as long as you like.
             Just don't leave until I get
             things squared away.

Randolph gets up and walks over to him.

                                RANDOLPH
             Be careful, Sheldon. Remember
             what I told you -- you've only
             scratched the surface of this
             scummy business. You have yet to
             strike oil.

Randolph looks at him for a moment before turning to
Nora.

                                         (CONTINUED)

                                                      105.

                      RANDOLPH
             You're lucky to have a guy like
             Smoochy.

                           NORA
             You just rest, Randolph.

                     RANDOLPH
             He's the real thing. Smoochy's the
             real thing. And I've been a fraud.
             A wicked man doing wicked acts.

Sheldon slaps the cylinder into place and tucks the gun
in his waistband.

                     SHELDON
             Well, we all have our bad days.

He exits.


INT. HAWAII KAI - LATER THAT EVENING

A hula dancer performs on a tiny stage in the nightclub.
A small Hawaiian string band plays behind her. Burke
and a nervous-looking Stokes sit in a booth.

                           STOKES
             Things are getting out of hand.
             We have to cover our tracks.

                           BURKE
             Relax, everything's gonna work
             out.

                           STOKES
             Relax? They found Merv Green's
             head on the Grand Concourse!
             Excuse my concern.

                           BURKE
             Look, we can cover all the tracks
             we want, but in the end we still
             got the same problem. We gotta
             finish what we started.

                              STOKES
             God help us...

Stokes shakily takes a sip of his drink.

                                        (CONTINUED)

                                                        106.

CONTINUED:

                           BURKE
             It'll all be over tonight.
             Buggy's gonna take care of
             everything.

                           STOKES
             Buggy? Buggy Ding-Dong? The guy
             who hosted 'Buggy's Bumpy
             Railroad'?

                           STOKES
             Yeah, until he discovered the joys
             of Turkish black mule heroin. For
             the right price he'll do anything.
             It's amazing the guy's still alive.

Stokes buries his head in his hands.

                           STOKES
             I don't know, Burke... this whole
             thing...

A shadow falls across their table.    Burke looks up.

                           BURKE
             Speak of the devil. Have a seat,
             Bug.

Buggy Ding-Dong's hand ENTERS the FRAME and snubs out his
Camel. Stokes looks up.

                           STOKES
                    (attempting to
                     sound cheerful)
             Buggy. You're looking good.



ANGLE ON BUGGY

A man who looks like he would first kill you then eat you
for dinner, slides into the booth next to Stokes.

                           BURKE
             It's time we put this thing to
             rest, Frank. And the way I see
             it... the rhino's up past his
             bedtime.

Burke hands a folded envelope to Buggy who puts it into
his jacket pocket. He lights another Camel.

                                                         107.

EXT. MADISON SQUARE GARDEN - AERIAL SHOT - EVENING

"SMOOCH ON ICE -- SOLD OUT!" flashes on the electronic
marquee.


EXT. MADISON SQUARE GARDEN - ENTRANCE - CONTINUOUS
ACTION

Men, women and children flood in through the turnstiles.


INT. MADISON SQUARE GARDEN - CONTINUOUS ACTION

Ushers, costumed as Rhinettes, help people to their
seats. People mull about the concession stands which
are adorned with signs that read: "Complimentary Apple
Slices!" "Have a Salt-Free Pretzel!" "Enjoy a Soy Dog
on Smoochy!" "Fresh Squeezed O.J. -- Have a Glass!"
"Sugar Free Brownies -- They're Not as Bad as they
Sound!" "Free! Everything is Free!" "Keep Your
Wallet in Your Pocket!" "Friendship is More Important
than Money!"


INT. ANGELO'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Angelo's place looks like a cyclone hit it. Angelo
works free from the ropes that have bound his wrists.
He has been hit over the head and is groggy as he
reaches for the phone.


INT. SHELDON'S PENTHOUSE - CONTINUOUS ACTION

A freshly showered Randolph is wearing Sheldon's robe and
has a pink towel wrapped around his head as he lounges on
the living room sofa. He's eating grapes and reading
National Geographic. The PHONE RINGS. He picks it up.

                   RANDOLPH
             (sing-songy)
          Hellooo!

We GO TO a SPLIT-SCREEN with Angelo.

                  ANGELO
          Randy, is that you?

                                       (CONTINUED)

                                                      108.

                     RANDOLPH
             Yes, Angelo, my little Twinkie,
             shouldn't you be getting ready for
             the big show?

                     ANGELO
             Listen, Buggy's been here.

                     RANDOLPH
             Buggy Double D's?   The Dong Man?

                      ANGELO
             Yeah, he lifted my backstage pass
             and he's braggin' that he's
             doing some kind of job for Burke
             Bennett.

Randolph thinks.    He suddenly looks very worried.

                     RANDOLPH
             Sheldon's in trouble.   I gotta get
             down to the Garden.

                     ANGELO
             The place is crawling with cops.
             They'll jump on you like a
             trampoline.

                     RANDOLPH
             I don't care.

He rips the towel from his head.

                     RANDOLPH
             I have to warn the rhino.


INT. MADISON SQUARE GARDEN - BASEMENT

Buggy, in his ill-fitting Rhinette costume, emerges from
the sub-basement carrying a thin suitcase. As far as
anyone's concerned, he's just another usher. He heads
for the stairwell.


INT. MADISON SQUARE GARDEN - CONTINUOUS ACTION

Every seat in the arena is occupied. The lights are
lowered. A slow rolling TYMPANY is heard. After a
moment, the Rhinettes skate out to enthusiastic applause.

                                                      109.

BACKSTAGE

Sheldon, looking very intense, stands alone in the wings.
He takes a couple of deep breaths. We TILT DOWN and see
the bulge of the revolver under his Smoochy costume.


ICE RINK

The Rhinettes have formed a line across the middle of the
rink.

                    ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
            And now... it gives us great
            pleasure to introduce America's
            favorite rhino... ladies and
            gentlemen... boys and girls...
               (dramatic pause)
            Heeeeere's Smoochy!

Smoochy skates out to thunderous applause. The entire
arena is on its feet. The Rhinettes part as Smoochy
skates through them and stops in the middle of the rink.
The applause and cheering don't stop for several moments.
One of the Rhinettes hands Smoochy a microphone.

                    SMOOCHY
            On behalf of myself, the
            Rhinettes, and the soon to be
            restored Coney Island Methadone
            Center, I thank you all for
            coming.


NETWORK BOX

Burke and Stokes roll their eyes.


BACK ON SHELDON

                    SMOOCHY
            It was my original intention that
            tonight's performance would be a
            benign mix of Smoochy songs and
            ice dancing. But as an artist, I
            believe I must convey to you, my
            fans, what I'm feeling at any
            given moment in my life. To do
            otherwise would be dishonest. Art
            is communication. It's something
            we learn and hopefully grow from.
            With that in mind... I hope you
            enjoy the show.

                                      (CONTINUED)

                                                         110.

CONTINUED:

More applause as Smoochy skates over to the Rhinettes.
They form a circle around him and slap hands in
solidarity.

                     SHELDON
             This is for Spinner.

The lights go down. A full orchestra begins to play the
overture to WAGNER's Tristen et Isolde. The lights come
up as a soprano -- a heavyset woman in a modified rhino
costume -- skates out through the fog and begins singing
the opera. Smoochy -- now wearing a peasant's frock --
skates an interpretive dance in the b.g. with a few
Rhinettes who are also dressed as peasants. A beautiful
fairy princess floats down (on filament wire) from the
rafters and takes Smoochy's hand. She skates away with
him as he waves good-bye to the Rhinettes.


HIGH ANGLE

LOOKING DOWN AT the opera. The CAMERA PANS OVER TO the
catwalk high above the rink.


CATWALK

Buggy Ding-Dong, still in his Rhinette costume, settles
into his assassin's roost. He begins to assemble the
rifle and check the scope.


EXT. MADISON SQUARE GARDEN - FEW MINUTES LATER

Randolph emerges from a cab and runs through the crowd
outside the Garden. A few people recognize him.

                     MAN
             It's Rainbow Randolph!   Someone
             stop him!

Randolph finds a side exit and slips into the arena.


INT. MADISON SQUARE GARDEN - FEW MINUTES LATER

The "Opera on Ice" continues. The soprano continues
singing as Smoochy reenacts the incidents of his recent
life. The fairy princess brings Smoochy to a room with a
gleaming white desk. Smoochy takes a seat behind the
desk. The fairy princess places a crown on his head,
bids him good-bye, and floats away. Smoochy sits proudly
in his new world.

                                        (CONTINUED)

                                                        111.

CONTINUED:

Suddenly, Rhinettes dressed as devils glide in and skate
in a circle around the desk. They throw money at Smoochy.
He jumps up and skates away, but the Rhinette devils
pursue him with daggers. The music from the orchestra
intensifies as the drama plays out.


NETWORK BOX

Nora continues to watch the opera, totally entranced.
Stokes and Burke look a little on edge. Burke glances at
his watch.


CATWALK

Buggy finishes loading the rifle. He shines the barrel
with his sleeve and looks through the scope as Smoochy
and company continue to perform below.


POV THROUGH RIFLE SCOPE

Atmospheric fog created by the smoke machine is so thick
that Buggy has difficulty FINDING Sheldon THROUGH the
cross-hairs. Occasionally, Smoochy skates through a hole
in the clouds only to disappear again. BUGGY CURSES in
frustration.


ARENA

Randolph pushes his way past Garden security and runs
toward the rink. Several cops working the event spot
him. A few spectators scream in horror.


ICE RINK

The soprano's mournful aria reaches its crescendo as
Smoochy is now pursued by Rhinettes dressed as Nazis.
They hold signs with words like "SCANDAL" and "SHAME."
Smoochy skates to a section of the rink resembling
Chinatown where he lands over a fallen "Moochy." He
cradles Moochy's head in his arms as the Nazis glide past
him and disappear into the fog.


NETWORK BOX

Nora wipes a tear from her eye as she watches the tragedy
play out. Burke and Stokes glance skyward. Nora notices
this.

                                                         112.

RINK'S EDGE

Randolph reaches the rink as cops push their way toward
him.

                     RANDOLPH
             Sheldon!!!

But Sheldon can't hear over the orchestra.   The soprano
hits a high note.


CATWALK

Buggy aims the rifle.


POV THROUGH RIFLE SCOPE

Smoochy glides THROUGH the cross-hairs followed by a
Rhinette.


TIGHT ON BUGGY'S FINGER

as he quickly squeezes off a SHOT.


RINK

The MUFFLED sound of GUNSHOT is absorbed by the intense
music. A wounded Rhinette falls to the ice, but no one
notices. Smoochy, oblivious, continues to skate toward
the "gates of heaven" with the angel Moochy. Giant white
gates slowly swing open at the rink's far end as floating
angels open their arms to welcome Moochy.


OUTER RINK

Randolph runs around the rink's perimeter, trying to get
Sheldon's attention. Cops and security push their way
towards Randolph. He suddenly notices the felled
Rhinette on the ice and looks skyward. He can make out
a rifle barrel protruding from the catwalk.


NETWORK BOX

Stokes and Burke notice a commotion in the audience.
They now see Randolph running through the crowd on his
way to the stairwell.

                                     (CONTINUED)

             What's he doing here?! He's going
             to screw everything up!

Nora notices the distressed look on their faces and
follows their gaze to the rafters. She now sees the
rifle barrel.


ANGLE - NORA

jumps to her feet.      FAST PUSH IN TO Nora's mouth.

                     NORA
                (screaming)
             Sheldon!!!

She starts to climb out of the box but Burke stops her.

                       BURKE
             Nora...

                     NORA
             You're in on this, aren't you!
             You sold him out! You fucking
             snake!

Stokes tries to put his arm around her.

                     STOKES
             Nora, please. It's not what you
             think. I'm grooming you. You're
             going to run the division one
             day...

She pushes him. He goes down hard. She starts to climb
out of the box. Burke tries to grab her, but she spins
around and punches him. She runs for the rink.

Stokes stands in the box looking dumbstruck as pande-
monium plays out around him. People are running in all
directions, cops are everywhere.

                     STOKES
                (frightened; to Burke)
             What now? What do we do now?!

                     BURKE
             Survival of the fittest!

Burke runs off through the panicked crowd. Stokes looks
around and heads off in the opposite direction.

                                                      114.

OUTSIDE RINK

Tommy and her boys notice the commotion in the audience.
They see cops pursuing someone. They realize it's
Randolph. Tommy, Jimmy and Sammy take off after him.


CATWALK

Buggy, in position again, looks through the rifle scope.


POV THROUGH RIFLE SCOPE

As the soprano reaches for an impossibly high note, the
fog dissipates slightly and Smoochy's foam rubber head
COMES perfectly INTO VIEW.


BUGGY

smiles.


RINK'S EDGE

Nora screams.

                  NORA
          Sheldon!!! Get down!!!


CLOSE ON BUGGY'S FINGER

He's about to squeeze the trigger.


CATWALK

Randolph reaches the catwalk as the orchestra plays a
dramatic series of smashing notes. He tackles Buggy just
as he squeezes off the SHOT.


RINK

The top of Smoochy's foam rubber head is blown off. In
SLOW MOTION, Smoochy's tattered horn sails through the
air and lands softly on the ice.


WIDE

Everyone in the arena screams and heads for the exits.
It's pandemonium. Thanks to Randolph, Buggy's shot was
too high and just missed Sheldon's skull.

                                     (CONTINUED)

                                                         115.

CONTINUED:

A confused Sheldon bends over to pick up a chunk of the
Smoochy head.

Nora, who's entered at the opposite end of the rink,
tries to reach him, but it's impossible. Panicked
audience members run across the rink, heading for the
exits. It's chaos. People slip, Rhinettes get trampled.


CATWALK

Randolph tries to get the rifle away from Buggy. They
struggle on a narrow beam high above the rink. The cops
have reached the outer edge of the catwalk now. Tommy
and the boys get there a second later. They all stand
back -- the catwalk is too unstable.

                     RANDOLPH
             Give me that gun, you fucking
             wacked-out freak!

Buggy manages to shove Randolph off him. He raises the
RIFLE and SHOOTS at the cops. Randolph grabs him. Both
he and Buggy lose their footing and slip from the
catwalk. Randolph is able to grab onto the edge and hold
on. Buggy clutches Randolph's leg which threatens to
bring them both down. They dangle 80 feet above the
rink. Randolph desperately tries to hold onto the
catwalk as Buggy clings to Randolph's ankle.


CLOSE ON RANDOLPH'S FINGERS

His knuckles turn white as his fingers start to slip from
the beam.


ANGLE ON BUGGY

Still clutching Randolph's ankle, he starts to lose his
grip. He desperately grabs Randolph's foot, but
Randolph's shoe slips off and Buggy begins his long
plunge to the next life.


INT. RINK - HIGH OVERHEAD SHOT

Buggy screams the whole way down, still holding onto
Randolph's shoe.


RINK

Buggy crashes into the middle of the rink, cob-webbing
the ice around him.

                                                        116.

CATWALK

Tommy and his boys runs off to find Sheldon. The COPS
help Randolph off the catwalk. He's a nervous wreck.

                  COP #1
          You okay?

                  RANDOLPH
          I don't know. I'm kind of fucked
          up in general, so it's hard to
          gauge.

They pat the dazed Randolph on the back.   He passes out.


RINK

People continue to run through the rink. Felled
Rhinettes litter the ice like broken dolls. Smoke fills
the air. Sheldon is helping a random woman to her feet
as Nora finally reaches him. She embraces him.

                  NORA
          Burke's with Stokes.   He's been in
          it all along.

Sheldon looks toward the network box. Beyond it, through
the smoke, he sees Burke shoving his way through people
who jam the exit trying to escape. Sheldon reaches into
his costume and pulls out his gun.

                  NORA
          No, Sheldon, don't!

Sheldon runs off leaving Nora.


EXIT

Burke is almost through the cluster of people. He
glances over his shoulder and sees Sheldon heading
toward him. He shoves even harder now and finally
gets through.


EXT. MADISON SQUARE GARDEN - CONTINUOUS ACTION

Burke makes a run for it down 33rd Street. A moment
later, Sheldon emerges from the building. He sees Burke
in the distance and takes off after him. He's still in
his skates and wearing the partially-blown-off Smoochy
head.

                                                        117.

FURTHER DOWN STREET

Burke looks behind and sees the nightmarish image of a
disfigured Smoochy chasing after him. He quickly rounds
the corner.


EXT. STREET

A few moments later Sheldon rounds the corner. He looks
down the street and sees no sign of Burke. He notices an
alley by an abandoned building.


EXT. ALLEY - CONTINUOUS ACTION

Sheldon walks slowly into the alley, gun drawn.
Suddenly, Burke jumps out from behind some boxes. He
whacks Sheldon's head with a garbage can lid. The gun
goes flying. Burke goes for it, but Sheldon is quickly
on his feet and pounces on him. The two men fight it
out. Burke manages to get on top of Sheldon and starts
to strangle him.

                        BURKE
          You fucking point a gun at me? A
          gun I gave you as a gift?! Where's
          your fucking etiquette?

Just as Sheldon begins to lose consciousness, we hear a
GUNSHOT. Burke looks up. Nora stands there, pointing
Sheldon's gun directly at him.

                           NORA
          Let him go.

Burke just looks at her.

                        NORA
          Now. Before I pump one in that
          Grecian Formula scalp of yours.

Burke smirks as he releases Sheldon. Sheldon jumps up
and takes the gun from Nora. He shakily points it at
Burke.

                  BURKE
          You know something, kid? You've
          turned out to be an incredible
          pain in the ass.

Burke slowly stands up, brushing off his suit.

                             SHELDON
          You were behind the Spinner hit,
          weren't you?

                                     (CONTINUED)

                                                        118.

CONTINUED:

                     BURKE
             That was a tragic mistake.
                    (shakes head sadly)
             If only one could turn back time...
                    (beat)
             But what the hell, it's just one
             less mick in the world.

He laughs.

                           NORA
             You son-of-a-bitch.

Sheldon cocks the gun.

                     BURKE
             Oh my. What are you gonna do?
             Kill me? That wouldn't be very
             Smoochy-like behavior.

                      SHELDON
             You're right. There's just one
             thing...

Sheldon tears off the remains of his tattered costume and
steps out of it.

                     SHELDON
             I'm not Smoochy.

Sheldon is shaking as he extends the gun to Burke's head.

                     SHELDON
             I finally realized we're living in
             a different jungle.

Burke suddenly looks fearful, as does Nora.

                             NORA
             No, Sheldon.

Sheldon closes his eyes as he tries to summon up the
courage to pull the trigger.

                             NORA
             Sheldon!

Suddenly, there's a voice from behind.

                           VOICE (O.S.)
             Don't do it, Shel.

Sheldon turns around.       It's Tommy and her boys.

                                          (CONTINUED)

                                                     119.

CONTINUED:

                     SHELDON
                (sternly)
             Stay out of it, Tommy.   This is my
             business.

Tommy walks closer to Sheldon.

                     TOMMY
             No more killin', Shel. Enough's
             enough. Don't destroy who you are
             for this piece of shit. You mean
             something to the kids. Don't take
             Smoochy away from the kids.

Tommy extends her hand for the gun. Sheldon looks down
at the gun. He can't believe he's even holding it. He
hands it to Tommy.

                           SHELDON
             I don't know how I got pushed this
             far.

                           TOMMY
             You're only human, Shel. The
             important thing is... you never
             went over the cliff. You're a
             good boy. For some of us... it's
             too late.

Tommy pats Sheldon's shoulder affectionately.

                     TOMMY
             We'll take it from here, kid, you
             run along with your girl. Get on
             with your life.

Sheldon looks over at Burke, who's petrified.

                           SHELDON
             Tommy, you're not going to --

                           TOMMY
             Don't worry. Sometimes even a
             rat deserves a little mercy.

Sheldon and Nora take a final look at Burke before
walking out of the alley. Burke is wide-eyed with fear
as Tommy's boys advance on him. Just as they round the
corner there is the sound of TWO GUNSHOTS. Sheldon looks
at Nora.

                             NORA
             Bus backfire.

She pats him on the back.

                                                          120.

EXT. MADISON SQUARE GARDEN - CONTINUOUS ACTION

Stokes finally makes it out of the arena. He runs toward
his waiting limo and hops in the back seat. He barks to
his driver through the glass partition.

                  STOKES
          Get out of here!

The car doesn't move.   Stokes pounds on the partition.

                  STOKES
          Move this thing!

No response. Stokes frantically pushes the button that
lowers the partition. It slides down.

                  STOKES
          Are you deaf?! I said --

The driver turns around. Stokes recoils in horror. It's
Takashi. He smiles as the back doors open and the
Japanese thugs -- Chick, Sambo and Tobi -- pile in with
Stokes. They slam the doors shut.

                  CHICK
          I wish I could tell you it'll be
          quick and painless, Frank, but you
          know how these things go...

Stokes lets out a small whimper. Chick nods to Takashi
who steps on the gas as he sings "Anything Goes" in
Japanese.


EXT. TH AVENUE - CONTINUOUS ACTION

The car heads into the night, passing Sheldon and Nora,
who have exited the alley. This will be Frank Stokes'
final limo ride.


EXT. STREET - CONTINUOUS ACTION

Sheldon and Nora pause on the street.    Sheldon looks
around him.

                        SHELDON
          You know, a little grime here and
          there doesn't change the fact...
          it's still a beautiful city.

He looks at Nora.

                                        (CONTINUED)

                                                             121.

CONTINUED:

                     NORA
             Let's go home, Smoochy.    Show's
             over.

Sheldon gazes back at her.

                     SHELDON
             No it's not. It's just beginning.

They kiss passionately as MUSIC SWELLS and the CAMERA
CRANES HIGH ABOVE the rink.

                                                 FADE OUT.


FADE UP ON:


INT. MADISON SQUARE GARDEN - ONE YEAR LATER

SUPERIMPOSE:    ONE YEAR LATER

The Garden is sold out.    The lights go down.    Through the
P.A. we hear...

                     ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
             And now... it gives us great
             pleasure to introduce America's
             favorite rhino... ladies and
             gentlemen... boys and girls...

There's a dramatic pause; TYMPANY ROLL.

                     ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
             Heeeeeere's Smoochy!

Smoochy skates out to thunderous applause.

                     ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
             With his partner and comrade...
             the one, the only... Rainbow
             Randolph!

Randolph skates out, somewhat shakily, to huge applause.
Sheldon puts his arm around him. The audience is now on
their feet. Randolph especially basks in the adulation.

                     ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
             All proceeds from tonight's
             performance, will benefit the
             Rainbow Randolph Center for
             Alcoholism and Delusional

Sheldon pats Randolph on the back. MUSIC BEGINS as
Rhinettes and Krinkle Kids skate out. The show starts
and the audience goes wild. Nora smiles from the stands
as Smoochy and the others glide across the ice. (SMOOCHY

          EXTREME CLOSE ON A CELL PHONE
          resting face up on a black surface. A beat of silence           -- is
          broken by its abrupt RING... RING... RING... Move in tighter
          on the phone's LCD DISPLAY. A number comes up:                  555-3827
          RING... RING... RING... A hand enters frame. We follow it to
          a pad and pen we now discover to the left of the phone. The
          hand picks up the pen, brings it to the pad, on which we find
          a list of handwritten numbers. At least fifty. To this series
          is now added 555-3827. RING... RING... RING...

          FADE TO BLACK.

          FADE IN:

          EXT. MANHATTAN - LATE NIGHT

          We pan across the city skyline, a beautiful sight -- over
          which we hear the CLACKING of computer keys.

          INT. A CONFERENCE ROOM (RUTHERFORD STERN)                       - LATE NIGHT

          A wall of glass offers a letter-boxed view of a sleek
          conference room. Amber sconces illuminate an enormous table,
          empty save for & YOUNG MAN at the far end - a lonely figure
          hunched over a laptop.
          Steadily tighten on JONATHAN MESSER (late 20s), trim build
          not entirely at ease in a suit. Likeable features suggest a
          gentle, intelligent demeanor.
          Grids of numbers from the laptop screen reflect off his
          glasses. Tired, he rubs his eyes, continues typing.

          INT. RUTHERFORD STERN LAW OFFICES - LATE NIGHT

          Briefcase in hand, Jonathan walks a vacant corridor of empty
          cubicles. In a few offices lights are still on; the figures
          of YOUNG MEN AND WOMEN at work are blurred like photos out of
          focus behind the frosted-glass of closed doors.

          INT. TIMES SQUARE SUBWAY STATION - LATE NIGHT

          Waiting for his train, Jonathan pauses at a news kiosk.

          JONATHAN
          Do-you have tomorrow's Times yet?
          The grizzled OLD MAN behind the counter doesn't look up.

          OLD MAN
          It is tomorrow.

          Right. I forgot.
          The Old man grudgingly bends to cut the plastic on a fresh
          stack of newspapers. As he does, Jonathan glances at numerous
          porn magazines on display. Naked women smile back at him --

          OLD MAN
          Anything else?

          JONATHAN
          Uh - no. No that's it, thanks.

          EXT. BROOKLYN - LATE NIGHT

          Jonathan descends an above-ground subway stop. Neighborhood
          streets are vacant, the clopping of his shoes the only sound.
          Jonathan turns a corner, heads for a humble duplex, the first
          floor marked by unlit neon: "FLEURS DE SOLANGE." He ascends
          the steps, his keys out --

          WOMAN'S VOICE                                                   (O.S.)
          Jonathan!
          The voice from nowhere startles him - he spins to find
          SOLANGE                                                         (50), a vibrant Haitian woman with a thick accent,
          standing in the doorway below, bundled in a ski jacket.

          JONATHAN
          Solange, you're up so late?

          SOLANGE
          So early, Jonathan. We open in one hour.

          (GRINS)
          So tell me, you have been out with a lady
          friend, oui?

          JONATHAN

          (SMILES)
          Je suis desole, madame, mais no.

          SOLANGE
          But why else does a young man come home at
          such an hour?

          JONATHAN
          Just working late, that's all.

          SOLANGE
          Every night working late, working late.
          (teasing him)
          Ah, you can't fool me. You are Mister
          Mischief maker - I know this! You come by

          friend, oui?

          INT. JONATHAN'S APARTMENT - LATE NIGHT

          Very modest. Furnishings are nice, but sparse. Jonathan hangs
          his suit jacket in a closet of empty hangers.

          INT. JONATHAN'S BEDROOM

          Not much decoration other than a dated Jimmy Connors poster
          and an old tennis trophy. Jonathan lies in bed, flipping
          channels on a small TV. Typical late night stuff:
          infommercials; CNN; a Brazilian soccer match; "Channel J"
          (public access) on which X-rated clips advertise phone sex.
          Jonathan lingers a moment on these explicit ads                  - then clicks
          back to, the roaring soccer crowd. He closes his eyes and
          drifts off to the frenetic Portuguese of an unseen announcer..

          INT. RUTHERFORD STERN LAW OFFICES - COFFEE LOUNGE - MORNING

          TWO CORPORATE LAWYERS are talking shop while pouring coffee.

          JONATHAN                                                         (0.S.)
          Excuse me.
          Fixing his coffee, Jonathan reaches past them. They barely
          give him a glance as they continue their conversation.

          LAWYER 1
          So, the Knicks win last night?

          LAWYER 2
          I'm pretty sure, yeah.

          JONATHAN
          Actually, they lost by 4.
          Both pause, turn to Jonathan. Jonathan smiles awkwardly.

          JONATHAN
          It was supposed to be a good game though.

          LAWYER 1
          Oh.
          (back to Lawyer 2)
          Hey, so. did you get a chance to look over
          that memo from Watkins?

          INT. RUTHERFORD STERN CORRIDORS - MORNING

          Bustling - yet here too Jonathan is ignored as he carries his
          coffee past ASSISTANTS and LAWYERS talking shop. He smiles

          (CONTINUED)

          

          

          

          

          4.

          CONTINUED:
          politely at those he passes; few bother to smile in return.

          INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - MORNING .

          Again Jonathan works alone at one end of the long table,
          rapidly typing, eyes ping-ponging from files to laptop,
          beside him a meticulous arrangement of pastel-colored post-
          its on which are scribbled various calculations. He strikes
          us as extremely good at his job, tackling the overwhelming
          array of numbers and data with methodical assurance.
          Taking a break, he pauses to peer out the glass wall before
          him. Behind the glass, employees pass like fish in a tank.

          INT. MEN'S WASHROOM -- DAY

          In a stall, Jonathan is staring sleepily at patterns in the
          stall's marble door -- when a sudden KNOCK-KNOCK on the
          divider to his right startles him. He peers down and over, to
          expensive black wingtip shoes, a Wall St. Journal spread on
          the floor. Another KNOCK-KNOCK. Confused, Jonathan turns to
          address the divider:

          JONATHAN
          Yes?

          MALE VOICE                                                      (O.S.)
          Take a look at this.
          The voice sounds youthful, energetic. Its owner slides his
          Journal along the floor halfway between the marble division.

          MALE VOICE                                                      (O.S.)
          The Japanese are developing a toilet that
          can analyze your urine for glucose levels,
          kidney disease, even cancer. They're
          referring to it as the "super bowl."

          JONATHAN
          That certainly is                                               - something.

          MALE VOICE (O.S.)
          Of course if you've ever been to Japan,
          you know they're nuts about their toilets.
          I'm talking web sites, symposiums...
          Jonathan chuckles.

          MALE VOICE                                                      (O.S.)
          You think I'm kidding. They have bowls
          over there that cost more than a piano.
          What I want to know is how you're supposed
          to retrieve this analysis - you know, from
          your super bowl.

          Maybe they're developing a fly with a
          nursing degree. A superfly.

          (LAUGHS)
          Who's in there anyway?

          JONATHAN
          Uh, Jonathan Messer.

          MALE VOICE                                                      (O.S.)
          Messer... What department?

          JONATHAN
          None. I'm from Worth and Berman. I've been
          over here a few wee--
          A FLUSH from the next stall cuts him off. The sound of
          zipping up, of a belt buckled, then of a stall door opening.

          MALE VOICE                                                      (O.S.)
          So you're an accountant?
          Jonathan follows the FOOTSTEPS, now addresses his stall door.

          JONATHAN
          Audit manager, yeah.

          MALE VOICE (O.S.)
          So how's it work, Rutherford Stern hires
          Worth and Berman to give their blessing to
          our books, and they send you?

          JONATHAN
          Have laptop, will travel. What about you?

          MALE VOICE (O.S.)
          What about me?

          JONATHAN
          Well, I didn't get your name for one.th--
          The SOUND OF A FAUCET RUNNING drowns him out.

          MALE VOICE                                                      (O.S.)
          .ose.

          JONATHAN

          I said it's Wyatt. Wyatt Bose.
          Jonathan FLUSHES, buckles his belt, opens his stall door -
          - only the men's room is now empty.

          COMPUVOICE                                                       (SOUND ADVANCE)

          INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

          Alone again, Jonathan listens to voice-mail on his cell
          phone. We..find two more batteries sitting ready in a charger.

          PETERSON                                                         (O.S.)
          Jonathan? Chet Peterson. Just wanted to-
          confirm you're wrapping up over there at
          Rutherford Stern because the controller at
          Clancey has been on me to get someone in
          there by Thursday. I told him how
          brilliant you are, said you're the best
          auditor we've got. Anyway, I forwarded you
          some documentation...
          Jonathan clicks his mouse - to find 27                           a-mails ending in
          worth&berman.com. He reaches for his palm pilot, clicks on a
          day planner, stylus writes "Clancey" into next week. Other
          than places he'll be working, days-are-all entirely blank.

          INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - NIGHT

          Jonathan still working. Only a few of the post-its now remain
          on the tabletop. Yawning, he glances at his watch -

                                                                                               MALE VOICE   (O.S.)

          Startled, Jonathan turns to a well-dressed young man in the'
          doorway - penetrating eyes, playful smile, familiar voice:

          WYATT
          Sorry if I scared you. I was heading home
          and saw the lights. We met before, in the
          can...

          JONATHAN
          Sure. It's Wyatt, right?
          WYATT BOSE nods as he steps into the room. There's something
          very likeably "on" about him.

          (CONTINUED)

          

          

          

          

          7

          CONTINUED:

          WYATT
          So do you normally work this late?

          JONATHAN
          Pretty much. I'm supposed to be out of
          here by tomorrow so I'm just trying to
          finish up. What about you?

          WYATT
          You kidding? This is an early night. Hard
          to believe that once upona time a man's
          success was measured by how little he had
          to work. You know in Sweden the average
          worker gets 7 weeks a year vacation?
          (regards his stacked files)
          Do-you like accounting?

          JONATHAN
          It's all right, if you enjoy working with
          numbers. Do you like being a lawyer?

          WYATT
          It's all right. If you enjoy working with
          assholes.
          Jonathan laughs, glances at his monitor screen.

          WYATT
          Well, I'm probably disturbing you -

          JONATHAN
          No - it's okay. Really.

          WYATT
          So Worth and Berman, huh? Don't you have
          to like be in Mensa to work there?
          Jonathan smiles, shrugs modestly.

          WYATT
          Been with them long?

          JONATHAN
          Since my senior year of college. They
          subsidized my graduate degree.

          WYATT
          Really. So you were poor?
          Jonathan is given pause by the bluntness of the question.

          (CONTINUED)

          

          

          

          

          S.

          CONTINUED:

          JONATHAN
          Well - I guess you could say that. I was
          raised by a single mother, and she died
          when I was nineteen, so... yeah. It wasn't
          so bad though. I'm sure a lot of people
          have had it worse.

          WYATT
          Not around here. Practically every suit I
          know is Harvard by way of Andover.

          JONATHAN
          Are you?

          WYATT
          Me? Hell no... I'm Princeton. By way of
          Exeter.
          Jonathan laughs. Wyatt smiles, takes a few idle paces.

          WYATT
          So. Jonathan.

          (GRINS)
          What do you say to a break?

          CUT TO:
          CLOSE ON A SCREENSAVER OF SWIMMING FISH. Tilt up from
          Jonathan's laptop screen to Wyatt and Jonathan, sitting on
          top of the expensive conference-table, passinga joint,
          staring out at the rain hammering the far windows.

          JONATHAN

          (STONED)
          .It's just sometimes I feel so - I don't
          know - removed. I mean, I work for one of
          the biggest accounting firms in the world,
          and.there's not so much as a desk there to
          prove it? They've decided all we need are
          cell phones and laptops. Messages are
          voice-mailed, documents e-mailed, salary's
          deposited online. Chet Peterson, my senior
          manager? I swear he wouldn't recognize me
          if I was sitting in his chair.
          Jonathan pauses, takes another drag, train of thought drifts:

          JONATHAN
          I don't know... I used to have friends.
          But it's like I've spent so much time
          trying to prove myself, working these
          hours                                                           - you can only do it so long before
          you look up and realize you've lost

          everyone. Just - fell out of touch. With
          everyone... And I try to meet people at
          work. I do. But it's always the same. To
          the accounting staff I'm a pain because
          for two weeks they have to hold their
          breath and hope I don't pick up on any of
          their screw ups. And to everyone else, I'm
          just a temporary fixture, so why bother?
          The truth is, this is the first meaningful
          conversation I've had in I don't know how
          long. It's like if I disappeared tomorrow,
          I'm not .sure anyone other than Solange
          would even notice - she's my neighbor. I
          live on what must be the only block in
          Brooklyn that still isn't hip.

          (EXHALES)
          I guess I just never counted-on the
          isolation. It's like sometimes I look
          through that glass, and I see life
          literally passing me by.
          Jonathan stares out the glass wall in stoned silence.

          WYATT
          Jonathan?

                                                                          JONATHAN
          Yeah?

                                                                          WYATT
                                                                          By the clock on the wall there? You've
          just talked for                                                 37                                       minutes straight.
          Wyatt looks at Jonathan -- and cracks up. Jonathan hesitates,
          then he too starts to laugh so now they can't stop, their
          laughter filling the expansive room -- until it's drowned by
          the SOUND ADVANCE OF POURING RAIN...

          EXT. MIDTOWN - STREET - LATE NIGHT

          Jonathan hurries in the cold. rain for the Times Square
          subway. He's just about to descend - when across                7th Avenue
          he spots a beautiful YOUNG WOMAN in a camel hair coat,
          clutching a slim briefcase, waiting to cross the street.
          Jonathan gazes at her, almost gasping. She's surrounded by
          pedestrians with umbrellas., she's the only one without one
          and she's DRENCHED. But she seems content to entertain
          herself drawing a pattern in the drops collecting on the
          umbrella in front of her.
          Jonathan watches, intrigued - and then the rumble of the
          subway below reminds him he'd better move.

          

          

          

          

          10.

          INT. TIMES SQUARE SUBWAY STATION - LATE NIGHT

          Jonathan stands in a long line to buy a Metrocard, his
          glasses steamed up. He takes them off to wipe the lenses.
          JONATHAN'S POV: the entire station is a blur, all unfocused,
          muted colors, no object discernible from another -
          - until his glasses return his POV to immediate focus, and he
          sees the same Young Woman in'the camel.hair coat, a pair of
          dollar bills in her hand, entering the station.
          Jonathan can't help but stare again. Despite her business
          attire, there's an almost childlike lightness. to her step.
          Jonathan notices her slim briefcase. Beneath her hand, he can
          make out the first letter of a monogram: "S."
          She checks out the long line for Metrocards, considers
          waiting, then decides life's too short. She continues past,
          headed for the turnstiles.
          Jonathan continues to observe as she raises her briefcase,
          then proceeds to wriggle her slender frame through the narrow
          gap in the turnstile.
          A PANHANDLER on the other side watches her with amusement.
          Glancing up, she catches his eye, and blushes a mischievous
          smile. Once she's through, she drops her money into his
          collection - and slips out of view.
          ANGLE ON JONATHAN, still stuck on line, staring at the space
          she vacated.

          INT. SUBWAY PLATFORM -- SHORT TIME LATER

          Jonathan arrives as an N train pulls away, the platform now
          practically. empty.
          Weary and still a bit stoned, Jonathan peers sleepily into
          the dark expanse of tunnel, yawns -
          And then he sees "S" is waiting on the same platform. Ten
          yards away. He gazes at her. She's unwrapping some GUM. He
          watches as she puts a piece in her mouth.
          The sound of an ARRIVING N TRAIN. "S" heads for it, Jonathan
          follows...
          The train halts. The door before him is the last of its car,
          the door before her the first of the next.
          The doors open.

          CONTINUED:

          II S â¢ II
          (turns to Jonathan)
          Excuse me, is this the train for canal
          Street?
          It takes Jonathan a second just to find his voice. She's even
          more arresting up close.

          JONATHAN
          Uh,.either one is                                               -- I mean the N and the
          R both stop there so, you know, either
          way, I mean, this is the right train. Yes.
          SOS Of
          Thanks.
          "S" enters her car. Jonathan wavers, wants to follow into her
          car but doesn't have the nerve. He enters a different car.

          INT. SUBWAY CAR - LATER

          Jonathan's slumped against a window, annoyed. at himself for
          not getting in her car.
          He can see 'S'. She sits in the other car chewing her gum. He
          studies her, he's absolutely knocked out by her.

          CONDUCTOR (O.S.)
          Next stop Canal Street. Canal is next.
          He sees "S" rising to join the small crowd gathering by a
          door.
          Jonathan stands up - his last chance. Determined, he braces
          himself and rises, grasping his briefcase.
          The screeching of brakes as the train grinds into "CANAL ST.

          STATION."
          A sudden JOLT of the braking train.causes Jonathan to stumble
          slightly and his briefcase BANGS against a seat and SNAPS
          OPEN - contents tumbling out. His cell phone hits the floor.
          Jonathan quickly bends for his phone - when the train lurches
          to a halt, nearly knocking him over, and sliding his cell
          phone a few feet along the grimy floor.
          O.S. we hear the hiss of the doors opening as Jonathan grabs
          for his phone a second before it's stepped on. He hurriedly
          stuffs it in his pocket, shoves his files and papers and
          paraphernalia back into his briefcase and rises to his feet -
          - to find the doors closing, and "S" gone.

          12.

          CONTINUED:
          Devastated, he hurries to a window, searching the platform as
          the train begins to depart... He can just glimpse the back of
          her camel hair coat as his car is sucked back into a tunnel.
          He stands helpless, just shuts his eyes and lowers his head.

          INT. RUTHERFORD STERN - COFFEE LOUNGE - MORNING

          Jonathan is pouring coffee when he brightens on hearing Wyatt
          enter, talking animatedly with Lawyers                          1   and 2. Caught up in
          telling his joke, Wyatt doesn't seem to notice Jonathan.
          Only when the lawyers burst out laughing does Wyatt glance
          up. His eyes meet Jonathan's. Jonathan smiles in greeting -
          but Wyatt just nods coolly, returns to his fellow lawyers.
          Jonathan's smile falters. He exits wordlessly.

          INT. RUTHERFORD STERN - DAY

          Jonathan hands over files and CD-Roms to a less than sociable

          ASSISTANT CONTROLLER.

          JONATHAN
          I guess that's it. then. Nice meeting you.

          ASSISTANT CONTROLLER
          Uh huh.
          Jonathan turns to go, takes two paces - then turns back.

          JONATHAN
          Listen - could you point me toward Wyatt
          Bose's office?
          The Assistant Controller looks up in mild annoyance.

          JONATHAN
          Wyatt Bose. He's an attorney here.
          She sighs, put upon, then slides out a desk drawer in which a
          laminated page of names and extensions is taped. Jonathan's
          eyes follow her lazy finger down the list --

          A GRUFF VOICE (O.S.)
          Hey, quit looking down her shirt!
          Jonathan instinctively leaps back from her desk, turns to
          find Wyatt grinning at him from down the corridor.

          WYATT
          Leaving, huh? So where to next?

          JONATHAN
          Clancey Funds on Thursday. Clute Nichols
          after that.
          Wyatt's about to reply - when ANOTHER LAWYER passes him in
          the hall. Wyatt taps the lawyer's shoulder.

          WYATT
          Hey, wait up a sec.
          (smiles back)
          Well, good meeting you, Jonathan.
          ,Wyatt turns and starts to walk off with the other lawyer.
          Jonathan bends for his briefcase -

          WYATT                                                           (O.S.)
          Wait, so you have off tomorrow?
          Jonathan looks up to Wyatt smiling at him from down the hall.

          WYATT
          You don't happen to have .a. decent
          backhand, do you?

          INT. MANHATTAN RACKET CLUB - DAY

          Beneath an enormous bubble dome, Jonathan and Wyatt play
          mixed doubles with two attractive YOUNG WOMEN (early 20's).
          Between points, we observe from Jonathan's side of the net
          Wyatt chatting up his partner. The rapport between Jonathan
          and his partner is markedly less comfortable; he wipes his
          brow, smiles at her, she forces a polite smile in return.

          SAME SCENE - LATER
          A good rally underway. Jonathan fires a backhand. Wyatt
          returns it with an audible grunt. Jonathan snaps the ball
          back to Wyatt's partner - only Wyatt intercepts, nailing it
          back. Jonathan returns it with equal force.
          A grin on Wyatt's face as he savors the battle, blasting back
          each ball. The women step aside. Jonathan lunges, barely
          managing to lob a return. Sensing victory, Wyatt raises his
          racket and with a guttural bark mercilessly smashes the ball.
          Jonathan dives, racket over-extended - and returns a
          near perfect shot just over Wyatt's head... but it lands two
          inches outside the opposite baseline.

          WYATT
          Out!

          (CONTINUED)

          

          

          

          

          14.

          CONTINUED:
          Jonathan curls forward, gasping for air. Silence - then
          Wyatt's SOLITARY APPLAUSE echoes in the humid space.

          WYATT
          Commiserations, Messer. Good game.
          They shake hands at the net. Jonathan is exhausted.

          WYATT

          (WARMLY)
          Develop akiller instinct and you'll beat
          the crap out of me.
          Jonathan turns to commiserate with his partner - but she's
          already gone to join her friend. Jonathan crashes out on the
          court. From his low angle he watches as Wyatt goes over to
          the girls and says something that causes a burst of laughter.
          The girls finally wave goodbye. Wyatt hops over the net.

          WYATT
          They asked if we'd fancy a post-game
          cocktail. Don't worry, I got us out of it.
          Jonathan is barely able to speak.

          JONATHAN
          Oh? I would've been happy to.

          WYATT
          Are you kidding? They're a couple of first
          years at Merrill. Screw that, we can do
          better. Hey, you OK?
          Jonathan nods as an amused Wyatt helps him to his feet.

          INT. RACKET CLUB LOUNGE

          Soft jazz plays as Wyatt leads Jonathan past the bar area.
          Wyatt is admiring Jonathan's weathered tennis racket.

          WYATT
          Man, I remember when these first came out.
          I think I was a frosh at boarding school.
          (chuckles; fingers a string)
          Jeez, are these strings natural gut?

          JONATHAN
          Actually, it's a hybrid weave: natural gut
          and Kevlar. They're pretty obscure now. I
          should replace them, they're all frayed...

          CONTINUED:
          Looking up, Jonathan abruptly slows his pace, his eyes
          suddenly fixed on a woman sitting at the far end of the bar.
          From behind, it looks remarkably like "S"...
          Only, as she turns, her profile proves otherwise.

          INT. LOCKER ROOK!

          Wyatt and Jonathan in towels, heading for the showers.
          Jonathan still deep in the 'S' moment -

          WYATT
          Have you ever considered contacts?
          Jonathan halts, confused to find Wyatt studying his face       -
          his eyeglasses in particular.

          JONATHAN
          Huh? Oh - yeah, I tried once, but I was
          allergic to something in the solution.

          WYATT
          Too bad. You have an attractive face. Your
          eyes especially.
          Jonathan looks self-conscious in his towel.

          WYATT
          It's not a come on, just an observation.
          (considers him a beat)
          You don't get much, do you.

          JONATHAN
          What - you mean sex?

          WYATT
          No, flood insurance. How many women have
          you slept with?

          JONATHAN
          Oh, I don't know, not a whole-

          WYATT
          Of course you know. Everyone knows.

          JONATHAN
          Maybe - four.

          WYATT
          Maybe four?

          (CONTINUED)

          CONTINUED:

          JONATHAN
          Okay fine, just four. What about you?

          WYATT
          Me? I have no idea.

          JONATHAN
          What? You just said everyone -

          WYATT
          I meant everyone like you.
          Confused, Jonathan looks up -- as Wyatt disappears into a
          shower stall.

          SAME - MOMENTS LATER
          Jonathan emerges freshly showered, a towel around his waist
          as he walks toward the rows of lockers.

          WYATT                                                          (O.S.)
          Tonight?... Fine. I'm on the list?
          Jonathan finds Wyatt half-dressed, seated on a bench by a
          locker and talking on his cell phone.

          WYATT
          There better be.
          Wyatt hangs up, looks up to find Jonathan staring, puzzled.

          WYATT
          Something wrong?
          Jonathan reaches into his locker for his hanging jacket, and
          pulls out his own cell phone. It's identical to Wyatt's.

          JONATHAN
          We have the same phone.

          WYATT
          Oh - and you thought I was using yours?
          I can afford my own phone calls, you know.

          JONATHAN
          No, I wasn't                                                   -- of course you can-

          WYATT
          I'm pulling your dick, Jonathan.
          (grins, slams his locker)
          Actually, I was just firming up some plans
          for tonight. Are you free?

          JONATHAN

          (SURPRISED)
          Me? Sure, I guess                                               - but I don't want to

          INTRUDE-

          WYATT
          You're not. What do you say, are you in?

          JONATHAN
          I guess I could go home and change.

          WYATT
          To Brooklyn? Forget it, you can borrow
          something of mine.

          INT. WYATT'S BUILDING - EARLY EVENING

          A three-story brownstone in an expensive West Village
          neighborhood. As Wyatt leads Jonathan to the staircase, they
          pass a papery-faced GENTLEMAN                                   (50s) in a fine suit.

          WYATT
          t                                                               a                       uten Abend, Herr Kleiner.
          (glances back)
          This way, Jonathan.

          INT. WYATT'S APARTMENT

          Urban chic to a serious degree. Big terrace, funky furniture,
          framed snapshots of Wyatt with similarly hip and attractive
          young friends - and great art, including an entrancing image
          of a burning candle just slightly out of focus.

          WYATT
          Like it? It's a Gerhard Richter. Kleiner
          downstairs is a hot shot art dealer - he
          hooked me up with the gallery in Munich.
          Wyatt disappears into the next room. Alone, Jonathan wanders,
          pauses by the framed snapshots. The young people in them are
          like Wyatt -- beautiful, strong, wealthy. Jonathan pauses by
          one photo in which Wyatt looks a bit younger, his hair
          bleached blonde and loosely spiked.

          WYATT (O.S.)
          Talk about a bad look.
          Startled, Jonathan quickly turns to find Wyatt standing right
          behind him,. a slick, expensive SUIT draped over his arm.

          CONTINUED:

          WYATT
          Here, try this one.
          (off Jonathan's hesitation)
          What?

          JONATHAN
          Nothing, I just hope I can pull it off.

          WYATT
          You hope you can pull it off. You know who
          you remind me of? James Getz.

          JONATHAN
          Who?

          WYATT
          A guy I roomed with freshman year at
          Princeton.. Real smart                                 - witty too, when
          you loosened him up. Only from day one, he
          just didn't fit in. For starters, he was
          dirt poor. But it wasn't that. See, there
          was always this boundary - this wall -
          between Getz and everyone else. You could
          argue we laid the foundation, but he built
          it. Built it by believing the lie.

          JONATHAN
          What lie?

          WYATT
          That he was any different. The clothes,
          the money, the wry anecdotes - it's all
          one big masquerade. Anyone can get in,
          you've just got to wear a costume. But
          Getz never got that. He assumed he could
          never scale the wall, when the truth is he
          was the only one guarding it. It never
          occurred to him his anonymity could be an
          asset. No one gets over like the guy who's
          just a face, an impression. We are - all
          of us                                                  - only who we're perceived to be.

          JONATHAN
          So what happened to him?

          WYATT
          Who, James Getz? Oh - he killed himself.

          JONATHAN
          (hesitates a beat)
          You're pulling my dick, aren't you.
          Wyatt turns to him with a grave look... then smirks.

          WYATT
          With both hands.
          Jonathan can't help but laugh as Wyatt hands him the suit.

          CUT TO:
          CLOSE ON A BUFF YOUNG MAN                                       (EMCEE) in a vintage bowler hat.
          He struts up to us, thumbs in his suspenders:

          EMCEE
          And now, straight from the Cafe Germaine,
          the Velvet Rope is proud to introduce you
          to the lovely Miss Lu Lu Lamour!

          INT. THE VELVET ROPE - NIGHT

          An ultra-elite "new burlesque" nightclub in Manhattan,          1920s
          Parisian decor. Strictly UPSCALE PATRONS, male and female,
          sip from crystal barware, while on stage a BETTY PAGE TYPE
          performs an elegantly choreographed strip tease.
          Wyatt and Jonathan sit at a small table; each table is fitted
          with. an old-fashioned black rotary telephone, as well as a
          small monitor recessed into the tabletop on which old stag
          films play silently. All part of the wink-wink ambience.

          WYATT
          It's a little self-conscious, but I
          thought you'd get a kick out of it. How's
          that suit working out?

          JONATHAN
          Oh - great, actually.

          WYATT
          Keep it then. I've got two just like it.
          Jonathan's about to protest, when a WAITRESS arrives.

          WAITRESS
          Two Macallan 25 year. Enjoy, gentlemen.

          JONATHAN
          Isn't this like fifty bucks a glass?

          WYATT
          We'll try not to spill any.
          (regards the floor show)
          So what's the wildest thing you've ever
          done? Sexually, I mean.

          (CONTINUED)

          CONTINUED:

          JONATHAN
          The wildest thing? Oh I don't know, I've
          never been too adventuresome.

          WYATT
          All right, what's the lamest thing then?

          JONATHAN
          The lamest...
          Wyatt's focused on him, amused, eager to hear it.

          JONATHAN
          Actually, that was probably a few months
          ago. I was flipping through money magazine
          and saw this small ad in the back. It read
          something like "Are. you feeling all alone?
          Looking to meet women but have forgotten
          how?" And-there was this number.

          WYATT
          And you called it? So what happened?

          JONATHAN
          Nothing actually. The phone just kept
          ringing. And that's it.
          Wyatt stares at Jonathan a beat, then starts to crack up.

          JONATHAN
          Lame enough for you?

          WYATT
          You called a sex ad - from Money Magazine.
          That is beyond lame.
          Jonathan too starts laughing - when the phone at their table
          lights'up. Wyatt looks to Jonathan, raises a brow - then
          picks up. He listens a moment, smiles, hands it to Jonathan.

          JONATHAN
          .Hello?
          Wyatt taps his shoulder, directs his gaze to a SEXY BRUNETTE
          at a distant table, receiver to her ear, eyeing Jonathan.

          JONATHAN
          .All right... Goodbye.
          Jonathan hangs up, turns to Wyatt.

          JONATHAN
          She wants to dance.

          

          

          

          

          21.

          ON THE DANCE FLOOR - LATER
          Jonathan is slow dancing with the sexy Brunette to an old
          Edith Piaf ballad. He looks over her shoulder to his table,
          where Wyatt is sitting, talking on his cell phone.
          Glancing up, Wyatt's eyes meet Jonathan's; he flashes a proud
          smile. Jonathan continues dancing, truly enjoying himself.
          The Brunette leans in, whispers something in his ear...

          BACK TO WYATT AND JONATHAN'S TABLE
          Wyatt clicks off his cell phone, looks up to find Jonathan
          returning alone, looking deflated.

          JONATHAN
          She's a hooker.
          Wyatt shrugs, grinning.

          JONATHAN
          Hold on - you knew? What - are all the
          women here prostitutes?

          WYATT
          That depends on what you mean by that
          word. Stretch the definition and you could
          incorporate most of the men as well.
          (sips his drink)
          You know in Amsterdam prostitutes not only
          belong to a union, they have to pay taxes.

          JONATHAN
          You seem to possess quite a store of
          international trivia.

          WYATT
          Not really. I just get around... Jonathan,
          relax. It's not like she just shot your
          dog. I was only trying to help. Besides,
          what are you looking for - a relationship?
          As if you have time for one? This was your
          first day off in how long?

          JONATHAN
          Three weeks.

          WYATT
          Four for me. Face it, we've mortgaged our
          youth. Pimped out our twenties. But we
          still have needs. And there's nothing
          shameful about wanting them met.

          JONATHAN
          So you sleep with hookers?

          WYATT

          (LAUGHING)
          Me? Never.

          JONATHAN
          So how do you - meet your needs?
          Wyatt studies him a beat, another French love song drifting
          in the background as the Emcee introduces a new girl.

          WYATT
          What if I told you...
          (breaks off, laughs)
          Christ, I sound like an infommercial.

          JONATHAN
          What were you going to say?

          WYATT
          Listen. You don't think that women have
          these same urges? Young women, just like
          ourselves, successful and working their
          asses off to stay that way? You better
          believe they do.

          JONATHAN
          And?

          WYATT
          And - well - let's just say, there's a
          way...a way it can be taken care of.

          JONATHAN
          You make it sound like a mob hit.
          Wyatt smiles, and turns his attention back to the floor show.

          INT. TAXI CAB - LATE NIGHT

          Wyatt and Jonathan are in the back seat. A quiet beat.

          JONATHAN
          What you were talking about, before.
          Peoples' needs...
          Wyatt turns to Jonathan with a grin:

          WYATT
          Some other time.
          (to Cabbie)

          At the corner, please. The Rhiga Royal.
          (to Jonathan)
          Listen, I have to meet someone..

          JONATHAN

          (SURPRISED)
          Oh... okay.
          The cab pulls up before the RHIGA ROYAL HOTEL.

          WYATT
          Hey. You had a good time tonight?

          JONATHAN
          Yeah. Yeah I did. Thanks.

          WYATT
          I'm glad. Listen, that thing with the
          hooker, I'm really sorry if I                                   -

          JONATHAN
          Forget it. It was funny.
          Wyatt smiles warmly, pats Jonathan's shoulder.

          WYATT
          I'll give you a call tomorrow.
          Wyatt                                                           climbs out. Jonathan watches through the cab window as
          Wyatt disappears into the golden glow of the lobby.
          LATER: Driving in the cab, Jonathan catches his reflection in
          the glass. He smiles, liking how he looks in Wyatt's suit.
          Outside, rainy Manhattan passes by ina hypnotic blur.

          JONATHAN
          (To driver)
          Hey. Could you let me out at the next
          corner over there, on 7th Avenue?

          EXT. TIMES SQUARE SUBWAY - LATER

          Jonathan stands in the exact spot where he first saw "S".
          He buys a New York Times and a hot-dog.
          Pedestrians and theatre crowds pass by as he remains rooted
          to the spot,.hoping he'll see that face in the crowd.
          After a while he shakes his head at the ridiculousness of it
          and heads down into the-subway.

          INT. CLANCEY INVESTMENTS - A CONFERENCE ROOM - MORNING

          Clancey's stiff CONTROLLER                                      (50s) hovers nervously over
          Jonathan as he unloads files onto the huge conference table.

          24.

          CONTINUED:
          Beside him we see he's set up his laptop, phone charger,
          pencils and a fresh, unopened pack of pastel post-its.

          CLANCEY CONTROLLER
          Any problems, you'll want to see Julie
          Levinson, she's our assistant controller                       -
          or if she's busy, Scott Werner, our senior
          accountant. If Werner's unavailable, we
          have two staff accountants                                     - but like I
          said, I don't anticipate any problems. I
          mean we've never had any before, so...

          JONATHAN
          Right.I just need the access codes for
          the accounts and sub-accounts?
          The Controller suddenly looks uneasy.

          JONATHAN
          You've got account numbers, but no access
          codes. Without those I can't get the banks
          to authorize statement verification.
          (beat; smiles)
          Besides, how else can I steal the money?

          CLANCEY CONTROLLER
          What?

          JONATHAN
          Nothing, I was just pulling your-- leg. I
          do need those codes though, when you get a
          chance.

          INT. CLANCEY CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

          Other than Jonathan's suit and tie, the reduced number of
          post-its and the lighter stack of files                        - little has changed.
          Jonathan is hunched over his laptop. Like Rutherford Stern's
          conference room, this one too is designed with a glass wall.
          Jonathan peers out at workers passing in utter indifference
          to him. Slightly different tank, slightly different fish.
          CLOSE ON A BUSINESS CARD: a Rutherford Stern masthead,
          beneath it Wyatt's name and office number. Jonathan picks up
          his cell phone and dials it. RING... RING -

          WYATT (O.S.)
          Hey, Jonathan.

          JONATHAN
          How'd you know it was-

          WYATT (O.S.)
          You really ought to block your caller ID.
          So - same place as yesterday?

          EXT. ROCKEFELLER CENTER - DAY

          Along the entire square of ledge, throngs of SUITED BUSINESS
          TYPES bundled in scarves eating street vendor fare. It's here
          we find Wyatt and Jonathan, having a quick bite.

          WYATT
          I wonder what the Founding Fathers would
          make of this scene.
          Wyatt regards face after face of young men and women wearing
          expensive suits, wolfing down lunch so they can get back to
          work - a good 2/3 of them talking on cell phones as they eat.

          JONATHAN
          I'm just glad to be outside.
          (awkwardly heartfelt)
          I've got to tell you, this has been great,
          meeting up for lunch. I used to just-
          A cell phone RINGS. They both instinctively reach in their
          jackets, take out their identical phones. It's Wyatt's that's
          ringing. Jonathan rests his down on the ledge.

          WYATT
          Yes?... Shit. Okay, see if you can.gettme
          on the 6:15                                                     out of JFK tonight... Fine.
          Wyatt rests his phone on the ledge next to Jonathan's.

          WYATT
          Rutherford needs me to join him asap in
          London to paper some financing with
          Lloyds. I tell you about this?

          JONATHAN
          No - no you didn't.

          WYATT
          Yeah, I should be gone a few weeks.
          Jonathan tries to mask the wave of loneliness setting in.

          JONATHAN
          Sounds exciting.

          WYATT
          Nah, it'll be boring as sin.

          Wyatt studies him a moment, grabs his cell phone and rises
          from the ledge.

          WYATT
          Shit, I'd better get back. You ready?

          INT. CLANCEY INVESTMENTS - CONFERENCE ROOM - LATER

          Sitting before his laptop, Jonathan takes out his cell phone
          and punches in some numbers.

          COMPUVOICE                                                     (O.S.)

          I'RN-SORRY-THE-VOICE-MAIL-PASSWORD-YOU-

          ENTERED-IS-NOT-VALID-PLEASE-TRY-YOUR-
          He enters the numbers again, receives the same prerecorded
          message. He hangs up -- when it abruptly RINGS, surprising
          him. He stares at the phone a curious beat, then answers it.

          JONATHAN
          Jonathan Mess-
          CLICK. Dead air. More puzzled, Jonathan frowns a beat          - then
          replaces the battery with one fresh off the charger.

          INT. CLANCEY BUILDING - ELEVATOR - NIGHT

          As ignored as ever, Jonathan is squeezed among EMPLOYEES on
          their way home. TWO SECRETARIES speak in hushed tones:

          SECRETARY 1
          .That's just it. You caught him in a
          lie, so now everything he says you have to-
          RING of a cell phone. RING... RING... It's Jonathan's.
          Surprised, he takes out the phone, presses talk.

          JONATHAN
          Hello?
          A soft, electronic rustle from the other end... then:

          WOMAN'S VOICE                                                  (O.S.)
          Are you free tonight?

          JONATHAN
          Excuse me?

          WOMAN'S VOICE                                                  (O.S.)
          I asked if you're free tonight.

          Jonathan trudging home. He descends into the subway.

          INT. SUBWAY STATION

          Jonathan is heading for the DOWNTOWN N/R when:. RING...
          RING... His cell phone again. He steps aside and answers:

          JONATHAN
          Hello?
          The CRACKLE OF STATIC on the other end. Then:

          WOMAN'S VOICE                                                   (O.S.)
          Are you free tonight?

          JONATHAN
          Actually I am, but I don't think I'm who
          The static on the other end worsens.

          WOMAN'S VOICE                                                   (O.S.)
          I'm sorry, I didn't get that?

          JONATHAN
          I said I am free, but I                                         -

          WOMAN'S VOICE                                                   (O.S.)
          Could you be at the Plaza in one hour?

          JONATHAN
          The hotel? I - I guess, but -

          Beneath the Eloise portrait.
          THE ROAR OF A TRAIN pulling in. Only when the train passes
          can he hear the other end. But now there's no one there.
          Jonathan stares at his cell phone - and frowns.
          Close on the phone's display as Jonathan scrolls down its
          list of stored numbers. His expression says none are
          familiar. And NOW he gets it.

          INT. TAXI CAB - NIGHT

          A heavy-set CABBIE glances in his mirror at Jonathan in back,
          cell phone to his ear.

          Hi, it's Jonathan, I've got your cell! I
          guess you must have mine. I imagine you're
          in the air now, but call when you get
          this. if you do. Oh, and you got a call
          from someone who I'm...forget it, just
          call me.
          Jonathan hangs up.

          CABBIE
          So where ya visiting from?

          JONATHAN
          Excuse me?

          CABBIE
          You're from out of town, right?

          JONATHAN

          (PUZZLED)
          Me? No.

          CABBIE
          Huh. I can usually tell. You seem like a
          tourist.

          JONATHAN
          I've lived here all my life!

          CABBIE
          No offence, pal.
          The cabbie pulls over on Central Park South. Jonathan leans
          forward, peers up at the gorgeous French Renaissance facade.

          CABBIE
          Well, here ya are. The Plaza.

          INT. PLAZA HOTEL - LOBBY - NIGHT

          Sheer elegance. Wealthy GUESTS stroll, chat, lounge. Hotel
          STAFF in immaculate uniforms greet, assist, etc..
          Jonathan anxiously wanders the perimeter, then slows as he
          spies a PORTRAIT OF A PRECOCIOUS LITTLE GIRL grinning at him.

          SAME SCENE - SHORT TIME LATER
          Jonathan is standing awkwardly beneath the Eloise portrait,
          glancing at his watch, growing restless, unsure --

          Pardon me, but may I ask you something -
          personal?
          Jonathan quickly looks.up, to find standing before him an
          attractive BLONDE WOMAN. She's. around his age, slender to the
          point of stark, dressed in a chic grey business suit.

          THE BLONDE
          Are you waiting for me?

          JONATHAN
          I                                                                - think so, yes. You're here for Wyatt,
          right?

          THE BLONDE
          Excuse me?
          (hesitates, appraising him)
          I'm sorry, did we speak earlier?

          JONATHAN
          Yes. Yes we did -

          THE BLONDE
          Good. Let's go then.

          INT. PLAZA - ELEVATOR

          Jonathan and the Blonde stand in an elevator alongside an
          ELDERLY COUPLE. The couple smile at the handsome pair.
          Jonathan fidgets uncomfortably. The Woman is staring at the
          lit numbers. He notices a ROOM KEY in her hand.

          JONATHAN
          (whispers aside)
          Look, I don't think I'm -- I mean; you and
          I., we don't know each other...?
          She turns to him, the slightest smile on her thin lips.

          THE BLONDE
          No fooling.
          DING. The doors open. She steps out. A beat. He follows.

          THE HALLWAY
          Walls, carpeting - details all classically gorgeous. The
          Blonde keeps a quick pace, headed toward a room.

          JONATHAN
          What I mean to say is, I'm fairly certain
          there's been some kind of mistake.

          She stops dead in her tracks, her back to him.

          THE BLONDE
          You're not who I spoke with on the phone?

          JONATHAN
          No - I mean, yes, but -

          THE BLONDE
          You're not attracted to me?

          JONATHAN
          Oh no, it's not that at all, it's just                          -

          THE BLONDE
          It's just what... exactly?
          She turns, steps toward him. Jonathan opens his mouth to
          explain -- when she covers it with hers. It takes him a
          moment to succumb to her kiss... but not too long.

          INT. PLAZA -- A ROOM - LATER

          A smooth plane of pressed sheets creases as two bare bodies
          lower to them. The Blonde hovering over him, Jonathan's
          tentativeness is all but gone.
          Jonathan cradles her to him, her features softening under
          waves of pleasure as she gasps, and whispers in soft, slow
          annunciation as if it were the sweetest word in our language:

          THE BLONDE
          Fuck.
          LATER: Jonathan lies post-coital. A smile. And then a look of
          mild anxiety, 'what's going on'? He turns to the Blonde but
          she's fast asleep.

          INT. PLAZA - THE', ROOM - EARLY MORNING

          On the sound of a DOOR SHUTTING, Jonathan's eyes squint open.
          Still naked, he props himself up, leans over to find he's all
          alone. A clock radio reveals itself as the source of the
          FAINT CLASSICAL MUSIC we hear. The time reads:                  6:18   am.
          He rises, glances around the room. No sign of her.

          INT. PLAZA - RECEPTION DESK - MORNING

          Showered and dressed, Jonathan is talking with a DESK CLERK.

          checked out at                                                 6:20                                   this morning.

          JONATHAN
          Well could you tell me the name of the
          guest who was staying there?

          DESK CLERK
          I'm afraid we're not allowed to disclose
          information regarding our guests. If you
          give me her name, I can confirm if she was
          registered here.

          JONATHAN
          Actually, the thing is... it's okay.
          Forget it.

          EXT. CENTRAL PARK SOUTH - MORNING

          Jonathan exits to good tidings from the BELL STAFF. Lost in
          his thoughts, it takes him a moment to respond.
          He starts to walk. His cell RINGS. He answers.

          JONATHAN
          Hello?

          WYATT'S VOICE
          Hey, you're up early!

          JONATHAN
          Hi! How's London?

          WYATT'S VOICE
          Raining. So you've got mine-and I've.got
          yours?

          JONATHAN
          Yeah. Listen, last night...um...I met this-

          WYATT'S VOICE
          Damn! Sorry, I'm gonna have to call you
          back, they want me in a meeting. Hey, no
          long distance calls, okay!
          Wyatt hangs up. Jonathan shakes his head, amused. He hails a
          cab, glances back at the hotel. His lips curl into a vaguely
          proud, if still dazed, smile.

          

          

          

          

          32.

          INT. CLANCEY INVESTMENTS - DAY

          Jonathan sits alone at the long conference table, working but
          distracted. He pauses, eyes Wyatt's cell phone sitting there.

          INSERT - EXTREME CLOSE ON THE CELL PHONE'S DISPLAY WINDOW
          The numbers stored have no names associated with them. It's
          just a series of undesignated seven-digit sequences, a list
          of phone numbers that seems to go on and on.
          Jonathan clicks on a number at random. It highlights itself.
          Jonathan hesitates, then clicks again. The number is dialled.
          RING...RING - a woman with an elegant BRITISH ACCENT answers:

          BRITISH ACCENT                                                  (V.0.)
          Yes?

          JONATHAN
          Hello, um - I'm sorry to bother you                             -

          BRITISH ACCENT (V.O.)
          How did you get this number?

          JONATHAN
          Through a friend.

                                                                          BRITISH ACCENT                             (V.0.)

          if you'll excuse me                                             -

          JONATHAN
          wait -
          Jonathan fumbles for what else to say before she hangs up.

          BRITISH ACCENT                                                  (V.O.)
          Yes?
          CLOSE ON JONATHAN. What to say? And then:

          JONATHAN
          (braces himself, swallows)
          Are you free tonight?
          He shuts his eyes, ready for a hang up. A long silence.

          BRITISH ACCENT (V.0.)
          I can be.
          Jonathan opens his eyes half in disbelief.

          (CONTINUED)

          Where?

          JONATHAN
          Where. Right... The Plaza?

          BRITISH ACCENT (V.0.)
          I'm afraid that's a bit uptown for me.
          Perhaps the Mercer? Say by the
          Shakespeare, half past eleven?

          JONATHAN
          The Shakespeare?

          BRITISH ACCENT                                                 (V.0.)
          It should be fairly evident.

          INT. THE MERCER HOTEL - LOBBY - NIGHT

          The SoHo industrial motif is the antithesis of the Plaza. By
          a vintage book library we find a sleekly dressed YOUNG BLACK
          WOMAN perusing spines of Salinger, Scott, Sheherazade -

          JONATHAN                                                       (O.S.)
          Excuse me, um - I'm sorry to disturb you -
          She turns, regards him a moment, curiously - a copy of
          Shakespeare's "A Midsummer Night's Dream" in her hand.

          JONATHAN
          I'm - supposed to meet someone here and-

          BRITISH ACCENT
          You're rather new to this, aren't you?
          Jonathan falters. She smiles.

          BRITISH ACCENT
          That's okay. I like that.

          LOBBY ELEVATOR
          She enters first, then Jonathan. He waits for her.to push a
          button - only it seems she's waiting for him to do the same.

          JONATHAN
          I'm sorry, what floor?
          She rolls her eyes.

          BACK TO THE HOTEL LOBBY
          Jonathan and British Accent cross the lobby once more.

          (CONTINUED)

          CONTINUED:

          BRITISH ACCENT
          Frankly I'm surprised that whoever gave
          you access didn't explain more.

          (SIGHS)
          Right then, the rules: One,.no names, no
          jobs                                                           - no nothing. Two, latex is mandatory
                                                                         and non-negotiable.. Three, no rough stuff   -
          the only rule that's even remotely
          malleable provided there's mutual consent,
          although I say if that's your thing, take
          it elsewhere. And finally...
          She halts a few feet from the registration desk.

          BRITISH ACCENT
          The initiator is responsible for the room.

          JONATHAN
          (takes him a second)
          Oh - so I should...?

          BRITISH ACCENT
          Precisely.

          BACK IN THE ELEVATOR
          Jonathan is holding a key card. British Accent is leaning
          against the opposite wall, eyeing him with a slight grin. A
          moment. DING. The elevator doors open.

          INT. MERCER HOTEL - HALLWAY - NIGHT

          They are headed for a room as he ventures another question:

          JONATHAN
          So are there a lot of - people - who do
          this?
          She turns to him with a look of growing impatience -- when
          the CREAK OF A CART causes them to glance up: a ROOM SERVICE
          WAITER is crossing past the far end of the hall. Jonathan
          turns back to find her staring at him uneasily.

          BRITISH ACCENT
          How did you get into this?

          JONATHAN
          Well, a friend of mine -

          BRITISH ACCENT
          He uploaded your numbers but failed to
          explain the basics?

          (CONTINUED)

          He's                                                          - well, he was going out of town.
          (off her frown)
          I'm doing something wrong, aren't I?

          BRITISH ACCENT
          It's not that, it's just... well, you
          strike me as something of a stowaway. In
          fact if I were more suspicious, I'd say
          you didn't belong here at all.
          Flustered, Jonathan's about to offer some explanation ---

          BRITISH ACCENT
          But obviously somebody felt you did.
          The notion suddenly registers with Jonathan -- Wyatt!

          BRITISH ACCENT
          And I'm a sucker for bashful boys...
          She takes his wrist, traces a finger over his palm... and
          removes the key card from his hand.

          INT. MERCER HOTEL - HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

          Jonathan and British Accent having sex. She has his arms
          pinned back, writhing on top of him, clearly enjoying the
          control - Jonathan remains awed, just enjoying the ride.

          INT. MERCER HOTEL - BEDROOM- LATE NIGHT

          Jonathan lies in bed-beside British Accent.

          JONATHAN
          Can I ask you something? Why do you do
          this?

          BRITISH ACCENT
          Why are any of us doing this? For the
          economics of the arrangement.
          (rolls over, away from him)
          It's intimacy without intricacy.
          Jonathan's about to reply --

          BRITISH ACCENT
          Look, I've got a 7                                            a.m. breakfast, so...
          She says no more. Jonathan stares up at the ceiling a beat.

          JONATHAN
          Well - good night.

          INT. CLANCEY INVESTMENTS                                        - CONFERENCE ROOM - LATE DAY

          Jonathan.alone at his laptop, the stack of files down to a
          bare few. He dials a number on 'his' cell:

          JONATHAN
          (into phone)
          Hey, I never heard back from you. I guess
          you're busy.with stuff over there.
          (smiles to himself)
          I've been kinda busy too! I've been
          wondering - did you mean for me to take
          your phone?

          EXT. RHIGA ROYAL HOTEL - NIGHT

          Jonathan walks the carpet-draped sidewalk toward the entrance
          - then pauses, looks around in recognition of this same spot
          where Wyatt had gotten out of the cab that night.

          JONATHAN (V.0.)
          I've got a feeling you did. You dog! I can
          see you grinning right now.
          Jonathan returns the BELL STAFF's chipper greetings and steps
          inside --

          JONATHAN                                                        (V.0.)
          Anyway, I just wanted to say... thank you.
          SOUNDTRACK MUSIC SWELLING: to herald a MONTAGE:

          INT. THE BENJAMIN - LOBBY - NIGHT

          Jonathan seems somewhat more relaxed as he lingers in the
          lobby. A woman with a BOYISH HAIRCUT taps his shoulder.

          INT. THE REGENCY - A ROOM - NIGHT

          Jonathan and an ASIAN WOMAN having sex on a plush celadon
          carpet, two briefcases resting side by side a few feet away.

          INT. CLANCEY INVESTMENT SERVICES - CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

          Alone as usual, Jonathan now seems strangely contented in
          this isolated state. WORKERS pass in the wall of glass, but
          now he doesn't bother looking up.
          In his briefcase, we note the inclusion of a toiletries bag.

          At a registration desk, Jonathan hands his credit card to a
          DESK CLERK. A BELLHOP gestures to a luggage cart. Jonathan
          shakes his head, looking confidently past him to a TALL WOMAN
          seated inconspicuously among the various out-of-towners.

          INT. THE DRAKE - ROOM - MORNING

          Jonathan wakes up alone, his necktie knotted around a
          bedpost. He reaches for the phone, presses "Room Service."

          INT. WEISS MURPHY INSURANCE - COPY ROOM - DAY

          Jonathan is waiting to make some copies when the SECRETARY at
          the copier hands him a stack of paper...

          WOMAN'S VOICE (O.S.)
          Can you hold these?

          INT. THE MARK - ROOM -- LATE NIGHT

          .only the voice belongs to the woman Jonathan is having sex
          with - referring to her legs that she wraps around him.

          INT. THE FITZPATRICK - SUNDRY SHOP                              - MORNING

          Jonathan buys a bottle of O.J. and a 36-count box of condoms.

          INT. WEISS MURPHY INSURANCE - CORRIDOR DAY

          Carrying his coffee mug, Jonathan suddenly slows, his eyes
          locked on The Blonde with whom he'd first been at the Plaza.
          Her eyes fix on his as he.nears                                 - a flash of mutual
          recognition... then nothing as they pass without a word.
          Jonathan can't help but allow himself the slightest grin.

          INT. HOTEL ELYSEE - THE "CLUB ROOM"                             - NIGHT

          Jonathan wades confidently through a sea of YOUNG EXECUTIVES.
          He approaches a REDHEADED BUSINESSWOMAN. He asks her
          something. She looks up, confused ---
          -- when ANOTHER REDHEAD taps his shoulder. Her free hand
          slips into his,. their fingers interlocking...

          INT. THE PARAMOUNT - HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

          . PULL BACK from interlocked fingers to find Jonathan's
          hand entwined with ANOTHER WOMAN'S. We realize we're watching
          their image in a MIRROR when we PAN away from the mirror...

          to Jonathan and YET ANOTHER WOMAN having sex. The bed
          keeps banging against the night stand - a glass of water,
          moving closer to the edge with every bang. There's something
          almost rote about it, a numbness in the repetition... the
          glass FALLS, HITS the ground and BREAKS.
          MATCH CUT TO: Jonathan PLUNGES into water.

          INT. THE PENINSULA - HEALTH CLUB - MORNING

          Jonathan doing laps. He emerges from the pool, strides with
          confidence past the tourists flanking him on either side:
          OLDER COUPLES snoozing, PARENTS adjusting floaties on kids,
          BUSINESS TRAVELLERS with airport novels.
          He continues toward us, hair slicked back, like Wyatt's.

          MONTAGE ENDS/ CUT TO :

          EXT. BROOKLYN - JONATHAN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

          Jonathan arrives at his building's steps to find Solange
          hurrying out of her flower shop. She embraces him warmly.

          SOLANGE
          Jonathan, for so long I don't see you!

          JONATHAN
          J'ai ete tres occupe. with work.
          He's exhausted. And no longer so exhilarated by his nightly
          activities.

          SOLANGE
          Work? No, no. You believe you can trick
          me, Mr. Mischief Maker! I want to meet
          this lady friend of yours.
          Jonathan is about to protest -

          SOLANGE
          Ah., ah                                                        - ecoutez, I have beautiful winter-
          roses, just. arrived. She.will swoon...
          Jonathan smiles, but there's a reticence to it.

          JONATHAN
          Maybe later, okay?

          SOLANGE
          There is no later when it comes to love!
          If you find it, you must not let it go.

          Jonathan nods absently, continues up the steps                  - when she
          tugs his sleeve. He turns to her; she searches his eyes.

          SOLANGE
          There really is no one?
          Jonathan evasively shakes his head.

          SOLANGE
          There should be, Jonathan. It is not good
          for a young man to be too much alone.
          He gives her an uncomfortable smile. She smiles back, but as
          she heads inside, she looks both-sad and worried for him.
          Jonathan continues up the steps, opens the front door and
          disappears inside. We remain on the vacant street, hear his
          FOOTSTEPS climbing the steps - and then the muted RING of his
          cell phone. A beat, then another...
          .and the front door opens again as Jonathan steps back out
          into the night.

          INT. THE HUDSON HOTEL - LOBBY -- LATE NIGHT

          Checking his reflection in a mirror while he waits, Jonathan
          faintly hears what sounds like WYATT'S LAUGH. He quickly
          turns to the sound: a bar off the lobby. Through slotted
          glass he scans the backs of heads: a group of business men.
          Reflected in the mirror, a WOMAN appears behind him. Jonathan
          freezes, his eyes grow wide -

          WOMAN
          Excuse me...
                                                                          He doesn't breathe. Utterly stunned, he turns to confirm...
          It's her.                                                       -It's "S".

          INT. THE HUDSON - ELEVATOR

          Jonathan stares at her in sheer disbelief but she's
          oblivious, smiling casually back at him.

          INT. HOTEL ROOM

          "S" enters first, flips on the light, proceeds inside.
          Jonathan enters tentatively behind her, eyes still glued.
          "S" takes off her coat, drapes it over a chair. Jonathan
          remains still and silent, just watching. She undoes the
          wrists of her blouse, then the collar button.

          Jonathan is about to say something but can't. She undoes the
          next button. We can glimpse a bra. She undoes the next --

          JONATHAN
          Before we...um, the thing is                                   - I know you.
          She glances up, curious                                        - her hand lingering by the front
          clasp of her bra.

          JONATHAN
          Not 'know' exactly, but we sort of met
          before. In the Times Square subway
          station. It was raining...

          â S â

          (GRINS)
          In the subway?

          JONATHAN
          You had no umbrella. You were soaked.

          âC,.
          It's true, I don't have an umbrella.

          JONATHAN
          Then you asked me if the N train stops at
          Canal.
          She squints back at him, vaguely recalling him. She smiles
          warmly and continues to unbutton her blouse.

          JONATHAN
          Wait.

          âSÂ»
          Is something the matter?

          JONATHAN
          This just seems strange, that's all.

          SÂ
          Because you've seen me before?

          JONATHAN
          Maybe. I don't know, it's just                                 -

          (EXHALES)
          Ever since that night on the train, I've
          thought about how nice it would be to see
          you again. And now suddenly, here you are,
          taking off your clothes.

          Bingo! So what's the problem?

          She starts to button her blouse back up.

          âSâ
          Well, maybe some other time.
          Jonathan is thrown as she reaches for her coat -

          JONATHAN
          Wait - don't go.
          She glances back curiously.

          JONATHAN
          What I mean is, by any chance... are you
          hungry?

          INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR - PRE-DAWN

          A BELLMAN rolls a cart noiselessly down the carpet, placing
          early editions of the New York Times before each room.
          He pauses by a door, quietly leaves anewspaper. We can hear
          the sound of JONATHAN AND "S" TALKING AND LAUGHING...

          INT. HOTEL ROOM

          They sit across from each other Indian-style on the bed. The
          radio is tuned to a pop music station. They're finishing a
          meal of burgers and fries, getting along famously.
          You have some ketchup on your chin.

          JONATHAN
          sorry, I'm a messy eater.
          âsâ
          Me too.
          Jonathan rubs at his chin with a napkin, misses. she takes
          the napkin, dabs it in water and cleans him up.

          By the way, my name's-

          Don't!
          She puts her finger to his lips. A first touch. An
          electricity between them.

          âC/,
          (a playful smile)
          You know the rules. No names.

          JONATHAN
          The 'rules' seem to specify no
          conversation either.
          as.,
          They are a little rigid, aren't they? But
          I think we should obey the 'no names'.
          It'll be fun!

          JONATHAN
          Ah, but I know.yours begins with an 'S'.
          âSir

          Her face is an inch from his, the moment mysterious   and           sexy.

          'S' laughs.

          She makes a little sound of encouragement.

          Hmmm. Hmmm. The mysterious 'S' alighted
          from the train at Canal Street. She may
          well be from 'downtown'...hmm...ah! Of

          You first.

          JONATHAN

          Trust me, it's not a pretty sight.

          I'll be the judge of that.
          He hesitates, then takes her hand, rises to his feet, and
          starts to dance with her. He's self-conscious at first, but
          she's agile enough to guide him, and soon he's into it.

          perfect line of her jaw. The petite divot above her lip. The
          tiny pierced comma in a presently unadorned earlobe.
          And then he notices, in the far corner: her purse. He stares
          at it; her name and personal details less than 20               feet away.
          He hesitates, then tries to silently slide his arm out from

          CLOSE ON JONATHAN'S SLEEPING FACE. His eyes slowly open.
          JONATHAN'S POV: her purse is no longer on the chair.
          He raises his head, sees that she's gone. He stares at her
          pillow. The indentation where she slept. Smiles to himself.
          He gets out of bed and heads for the bathroom. There's a NOTE
          on the desk on hotel note paper:
          Frank - you snore like a tractor. Will
          call u later. Sunbeam xxx

          Hey! Are you back in town?

          WYATT (V.0.)

          JONATHAN
          Oh. Because I thought I saw you last night
          - at the Hudson.

          WYATT (V.0.)
          The Hudson, huh? Sounds like you've been
          enjoying my little gift.

          JONATHAN
          Yeah. I mean, I was. Only now - well, I
          met a girl. Not just any girl. The girl.

          WYATT (V.0.)
          That's fantastic! Who is the lucky gal?

          She's a member of your naughty little sex

          I'd like to say it's a long story but it's
          not. When you are coming back, you gotta
          meet her.

          WYATT (V.0.)
          So she's, what, a lawyer or something?

          JONATHAN
          I-have no idea, I don't know all that much
          about her. All I know is I can't wait to
          see her again.

          WYATT (V.0.)
          Listen, I don't want to dampen your
          spirits, but - be careful, okay?

          JONATHAN
          What do you mean by that?

          WYATT (V.0.)
          Nothing. I'm just saying, this club                         - who
          knows who anybody is, right?

          JONATHAN
          Yeah, yeah, yeah but - sometimes you just
          have to go with what you feel, don't you?

          WYATT (V.0.)
          True enough. Hold on a sec.
          Muffled sounds of Wyatt talking to someone else.

          WYATT (V.0.)
          It's non stop back-to-back bullshit here.
          Listen, I'll call you later. And hey -
          congratulations!
          Wyatt hangs up. Jonathan smiles. And then reads the note
          again - grinning.

          The morning crush of executives filing toward elevators.
          Among them we spot Jonathan, just slightly out of step, a
          sleepy smile lingering on his face.

          Jonathan is working on his laptop, clearly distracted. He
          looks at his cell phone, hoping it will ring, but it doesn't.
          He calls up the list of "Recent Calls: Incoming," scrolls up
          to the top number. It reads: "Number Unavailable."
          Jonathan looks worried, wondering how he can get a hold of
          her - when his cell phone rings. He immediately picks up.

          Hello?

          WOMAN (O.S.)

          I think you have the wrong number.

          EXT. STREET -- NIGHT

          Jonathan arrives at the subway station. He's a little anxious
          now, still hasn't heard from her. He lingers at the top of
          the stairs, not wanting to descend. Below him he can hear the
          lonely roar of a train pulling in below.
          only when the train quiets down does Jonathan realize his
          cell phone is ringing. He picks up.

          JONATHAN
          Hello?
          Intermittent static on the other end. And then what sounds
          like a WOMAN GASPING; it's unclear if it's a sound of
          pleasure or pain.

          JONATHAN
          .Hello?
          The Gasping comes faster; Jonathan debates hanging up - when
          the gasps halt,--replaced by the faintest whisp__of_ a female
          voice: "No... No please..." There's no mistaking the tone now
          it's fear - then. suddenly a shrill, terrified SCREAM...
          - and the line goes dead. Jonathan stares breathlessly at the

          He quickly checks the display: "Number Unavailable."
          Jonathan looks panicked with the possibility that it was "S"-
          - when the phone rings again. He hesitates, then picks up.

          Jonathan exhales in relief on hearing her voice.

          EXT. CHINATOWN - CANAL STREET - NIGHT

          Jonathan stands on a corner, looking out of place amidst the
          glistening neon and bustle of Asian faces. He peers anxiously
          down the.street, checks his watch, all anticipation             -
          - when something is wrapped around his eyes. He's startled,
          tugs it off and spins to find "S" smiling back at him.

          I bought you a present.
          She drapes the scarf around his neck. It's all striped,
          bright colors                                                   - all the more funky against his dark suit.

          I guess. I got a call-before yours                              - I'm
          not sure if it was real, or if it was even
          meant for me - but there was a woman who
          sounded like she was being - I don't know,
          hurt. Maybe worse.
          "S" seems instantly on edge. Something about this scares her.
          If SIP
          You don't know who she was?

          JONATHAN
          (shakes his head)
          It could've been a prank.

          A makeshift street market, everything from fish and meat to
          cheap electronics for sale in cramped stands. Jonathan and
          "S" walk arm in arm through the packed crowd, like a couple.
          Jonathan looks like we've never seen him before: a
          fascination with everything around him, especially her.
          They pause at a stall selling cheap trinkets, including a
          small metallic wind-up toy of a duck riding a bicycle.

          INT. A RESTAURANT - CHINATOWN - LATE NIGHT

          An intimate place, Jonathan and "S" are the only patrons at
          this late hour. They sit across from each other, grinning at
          "Duck On Bike" as it totters across the table, trips over a
          chopstick and flails on its side.
          /t S â
          Oh, poor Duck On Bike!
          She uprights the toy and it keeps on moving across the table.

          JONATHAN
          You gotta respect him; he just keeps at
          it.
          A WAITER arrives and sets down a laminated menu - entirely in
          Chinese. "S" points to the characters like an expert.

          We'll have this... and this... oh, and

          She lowers.her eyes.

          JONATHAN
          Sorry, I didn't mean to freak you out.
          She slowly looks up again, touched.

          JONATHAN
          And sometimes during.
          She laughs. The waiter brings them their drinks.

          JONATHAN

          interesting than where we've come from?

          JONATHAN
          Sure... but that didn't really answer my
          question.
          She reaches over and takes his hand, holds it tenderly.

          I know it seems like I'm holding out on
          you, but I'm not. It's just                                  - I turned
          thirty this year, and I made this vow to
          live only in the present. And it's good,
          you know? And yes, maybe it's because
          there are things in my past I don't care
          to think about - but that's the same for
          everyone, isn't it?
          He nods, still holding hands, loving every moment of this.

          Jonathan smiles, completely disarmed by her. The waiter
          brings their food and goes.

          JONATHAN

          It has its merits. At least I thought it
          did... until you came along.
          He beams, gazing at her. Blushing, she starts in on the food.
          Outside we can hear rain starting to fall...

          EXT. CHINATOWN RESTAURANT - LATER

          Jonathan and "S" step out into pouring rain, pause under the
          shabby awning. Waiters inside are putting chairs on tables.
          She fishes in her coat and pulls out a PACK OF GUM. The
          wrapper is entirely in Chinese. She offers him a piece.

          JONATHAN
          Oh - no thanks.

          JIS.11
          Don't let the wrapper intimidate you. I
          buy it at a store nearby. It has ginseng
          in it, you know, for energy. It's not bad,
          though it sort of tastes like hairspray.
          She chews her gum. He watches her; the jaw line, her lips.
          She looks at him and smiles, but there's something behind it:
          a sadness. Almost an uneasiness.

          JONATHAN
          Hey, are you all right?

          "SÂ
          I don't want to complicate your life.

          She wipes the lenses, then peering into his eyes, slowly
          leans in to return them to his face... only she presses her
          lips to his instead, the glasses still in her hand, the kiss
          itself at once tender and passionate.
          She absently lowers her hand, lost in the unexpected
          intensity of the kiss. Embraced, they accidentally step under
          the sheet of water falling off the awning. Jonathan guides
          her back beneath the awning's shelter.
          At S is
          (breathless whisper)
          Maybe you should go...

          JONATHAN
          Maybe you should stay.
          She smiles as he kisses her even more passionately. Again
          they feel the awning's drops, and Jonathan moves to shelter
          them -
          - only "S" leans into him instead, leading him out from under
          the awning, the falling rain suddenly drenching their faces
          as they continue to kiss, the moment purely exhilarating.
          wiping the rain from her face, Jonathan gazes at her, soaked
          and utterly beautiful, with something akin to awe - like he's
          just breathed for the very first time.

          As Jonathan exits the room, hold on the room number:            517.
          Jonathan runs down the long corridor to the ice machine. He's
          giddy with excitement. Passionately alive.
          At the ice machine: an eccentric OLD WOMAN in her night
          attire is slowly filling a bucket. Piece by piece.
          Her weak, gnarly hands plucking at the blocks not wanting to
          break her long nails.
          Jonathan hops around in an agony of frustration.
          She turns, looks him up and down - he feels a bit self-
          conscious in his robe and bare feet.

          JONATHAN
          Would you like some help, ma'am?

          I can manage, thank you.
          Finally, her bucket is full and she goes on her way.
          .Jonathan quickly fills his bucket with ice.

          59.

          CONTINUED:
          Returning down the empty hall, ice bucket in one hand, key
          card in the other, Jonathan hurriedly checks door numbers.
          We see Room 518                                                 has the DO NOT DISTURB sign on.
          Jonathan arrives back at room 517. He pauses and slips his
          robe from his shoulder, mock 'sexy'. He puts the card key in
          the lock, starts to open the door-- a small rectangular light
          blips RED. He tries the card again. Again red. He knocks on
          the door, calls out:

          JONATHAN
          I can't get the card to work.
          He tries the card again. Leaning in, he thinks he hears
          something behind the door. He peers down at the key panel:
          red.
          He knocks harder, waits for a response. None. Dead silence.

          JONATHAN
          Hello?... Hello?
          He jostles the door handle: it won't budge. He's getting
          anxious now, his breath quickening. He tries the key card
          again: red. He pounds harder, then slams his shoulder into
          the door. Nothing.
          Desperate, he tries the key card again -- and the light turns
          green.                                                          - A millisecond's surprised hesitation - then he jerks
          the handle, throws open the door and Jonathan tumbles into

          THE ROOM
          He peers up into the small entryway: empty. Ahead of him we
          glimpse the foot of the bed, its mussed blanket and sheets.
          Jonathan gets to his feet, starts for the bed, his breath
          quickening as he now notices a few red specks on the blanket.
          Panicked, he rushes forward to find BLOOD soaking the bed,
          splattered all over the crumpled sheets...
          Jonathan gapes, horrified, the world crashing in on him just
          as he senses something behind him and BANG!                     - something hits
          him to the back of the head -- he goes down like a sack of
          potatoes.

          BLACKOUT.

          TWO HOURS LATER
          THE ICE BUCKET on the floor. The ice has melted, a pool of
          water seeps out... follow the flow to arrive at Jonathan's

          fingers... slowly responding to the cold water... The TV
          playing a different film now.
          OVERHEAD OF JONATHAN lies on the floor. He groans a little.
          Rubs the back of his head. Checks his hand for blood.
          Pain etched in his face, he manages to get to his feet,
          shaky. He looks around the room. It's EMPTY. No sign of "S."
          He runs into the bathroom. Also empty.
          Back in the room, he tries the closets: empty. The CONNECTING
          DOOR between this room and the next: LOCKED.
          He looks to where she'd draped her clothes and bag - every
          trace of her is gone. He whips back to the bed - the sheets
          are still crumpled, only there's no blood an here on them.
          He runs to the window looks down at the street. It's four in
          the morning, no one around.

          INT. HOTEL HALLWAY

          Tripping over his own legs, Jonathan runs barefoot down the
          corridor. He rounds a corner, another stretch of narrow
          corridor. O.S. we hear the muted DING of an elevator.
          Jonathan tears off in its direction...
          He stumbles into the open square in which the elevators are
          located. He crushes the down button, peers up to the floor
          indicator overhead: "4" slowly creeps to "3".

          INT. STAIRWELL

          His bare feet pounding the cement steps, Jonathan takes each
          floor faster, sweat on his brow and his palms which slip
          their grasp on the railing -- he tumbles head first, crashing
          to the 2nd floor landing. He clutches his head, gets up and
          continues to dash down...
          BANG! of the stairwell's exit as Jonathan stumbles out; he
          lurches forward, finally looking up to find he's in

          THE LOBBY
          His undershirt tugged and misshapen, boxers twisted around
          his bare thighs, robe open, Jonathan scans the lobby, wild-
          eyed and shaking. It's utterly vacant at this hour, the only
          sound a piped-in muzak rendition of the Beatles' "Yesterday."

          SLAM! OF JONATHAN'S HAND ON THE FRONT DESK

          The Asian Clerk working there snaps his head up with a
          startled gasp. Jonathan barely manages to breathe the word:

          JONATHAN
          help...

          INT. HOTEL LOTUS -                                            5TH FLOOR HALLWAY - SHORT TIME LATER

          Two hotel SECURITY GUARDS take the lead as they near room
          517, Jonathan trailing, breathless and shaken...

          JONATHAN
          .I saw blood on the bed and then someone
          hit me. When I came to, she was gone.

          SECURITY 1
          This woman you were with. What's her name?
          Jonathan looks blank, his mind racing.

          SECURITY 2
          Sir?

          JONATHAN
          I don't know.
          (off their looks)
          It starts with an 'S'. I think.

          SECURITY 2
          Was shea prostitute?

          JONATHAN
          No! No, she's just a person. A friend.

          SECURITY 2
          A friend with no name.

          JONATHAN
          Of course she has a name! I just don't -
          we have to find her - something must have
          happened to her!

          INT. ROOM 517

          The two Security Guards are eyeing the bed.

          SECURITY 1
          I thought you said there was blood?

          JONATHAN
          I told you, whoever did this must have
          cleaned it up while I was out.

          Jonathan freezes, eyes darting to the night stand.

          JONATHAN
          My wallet and keys                                          - they're gone! They
          were right here...
          He looks over to the chair where his crumpled suit lies.    His
          SCARF is gone too.

          SECURITY 2
          Maybe she took them.

          JONATHAN
          What?!

          SECURITY 2
          It happens.

          JONATHAN
          She didn't do this, okay?! Something
          happened to her! You don't understand, we
          were... Wait!
          He sees something on the floor between the bed and night
          stand. He runs to to pick it up: a Chinese Gum Wrapper.

          JONATHAN
          This                                                        -- this was hers...
          Jonathan clutches it desperately, the lone trace of her
          existence. The Guards exchange a look like he's INSANE.

          SECURITY                                                    1
          Sir - are these your clothes?
          Jonathan nods absently.

          SECURITY 1
          How about putting them on.

          INT. LOBBY - LATER

          Jonathan arrives to find DETECTIVE RUSSO                    (female, mid-30s)
          waiting by reception with a UNIFORMED OFFICER. Seeing
          Jonathan, she sizes him up a moment, then approaches him.

          RUSSO
          Mr. Messer, I'm Detective Russo.

          INT. POLICE PRECINCT - RUSSO'S DESK - LATER

          Still shaken, Jonathan sits in a wooden chair across from
          Russo, amidst the din and traffic of the precinct.

          RUSSO

          (SCEPTICAL)
          And you don't know anything about her.
          Where she works? Where she lives?

          JONATHAN
          I told you how we met.

          RUSSO
          Through a sex group.
          Her flat words hang in the air. He guiltily avoids her eyes.

          RUSSO
          Does this group have a name?

          JONATHAN
          I don't                                                         -- it's not like that.

          RUSSO
          Mr. Messer, I spoke to the desk clerk. She
          only recalled seeing you check in.

          JONATHAN
          That's... that's the way it works.

          RUSSO
          All right. But now you're telling me that
          in addition to this mystery woman, there
          was another individual in the room?

          JONATHAN
          Not at first -- look, I know how it
          sounds, but I'm telling you, whoever hit
          me must have - I don't know -- taken her.
          Maybe even...
          He stops himself, shuddering to think of the implications.

          RUSSO
          Mr. Messer, have you had - experiences
          like this before? Taking any sort of
          medication?

          JONATHAN
          I'm not crazy, okay?! A woman vanished
          back there! There was blood all over the
          goddamn bed!
          He becomes very conscious that this sounds crazy - when A
          CELL PHONE RINGS: it's Russo's. She pauses, struck by the
          genuine desperation in Jonathan's face. She finally picks up.

          Yeah.
          (glances at Jonathan)
          No, I don't think it's necessary... Right.
          She hangs up and turns to Jonathan. He looks away, barely
          able to contain his devastation.

          JONATHAN
          What am I supposed to do?
          An awkward silence, then:

          RUSSO
          If you want to file a report regarding the
          items she -
          (corrects herself)
          - the items you claim were stolen...
          Jonathan shakes his head, crushed and exasperated.

          JONATHAN
                                                                          I'd like to go now. Is that all right? Can
          I just                                                          - can I go?

          EXT. JONATHAN'S APARTMENT - FIRE ESCAPE - MIDDLE OF NIGHT

          Jonathan climbs up to the landing, fishes in the dark for a
          boot. He tips it, a SPARE KEY falls out. As he starts back
          down, he feels something in his coat pocket. He reaches in,
          finds "Duck On Bike" where he'd pocketed it.

          INT. JONATHAN'S APARTMENT - BATHROOM - MIDDLE OF NIGHT

          Jonathan stands motionless beneath the shower, face buried in
          his elbow, completely overwhelmed by his loss and longing.

          INT. JONATHAN'S BEDROOM

          Jonathan enters, wanders for his bed -- when he pauses,
          staring at his dresser. He approaches, peering down at
          something that's caught his eye...
          HIS HIGH SCHOOL TENNIS TROPHY. Nothing unusual - except for a
          small square outlined in dust three inches from the trophy
          base, the wood around its perimeter far more faded than the
          exposed area                                                    - as if the trophy had recently been moved.
          Jonathan swallows tensely, staring at the cryptic dust mark -
          (SOUND ADVANCE) BANG! of a file cabinet drawer yanked open in

          

          

          

          

          65.

          A SPARE BEDROOM
          Used for storage, including an old, gun-metal grey filing
          cabinet. Phone to his ear, Jonathan rapidly sifts through
          faded file folders crammed with papers and documents.

          JONATHAN                                                          (INTO PHONE)
          .Your ad says                                                     24-Hour Locksmith... Well
          how soon could you-... Fine.
          He opens a file: it's where he keeps his passport. He stuffs
          it in his back pocket, keeps searching, pulls a folder marked
          "CREDIT CARDS." Sorting through old statements, he finds the
          line: "To report a card lost or stolen..."

          INT. JONATHAN'S BATHROOM - PRE-DAWN

          CLOSE ON JONATHAN'S HAGGARD FACE in the mirror of a medicine
          cabinet as he pulls it open. Be fishes around, finds what
          he's looking for: a SMALL BLACK CANNISTER for film. He pops
          the cap to reveal a fat roll of emergency money.
          Jonathan exits the bathroom, crosses the living room to the
          foyer, where we find a LOCKSMITH finishing changing the lock.

          INT. JONATHAN'S BEDROOM - DAWN

          Jonathan lies awake, staring at his muted TV, his face tear-
          stained, his eyes clouded.

          JONATHAN (V.O.)
          This is Jonathan Messer. I won't be able
          to come in today. I'm - pretty ill...
          'Duck on Bike' sits on his nightstand next to his glasses.

          Jonathan seated, resting against the window, drifting off

          Next stop Canal Street. Canal is next.

          Jonathan jerks awake. A few stares from nearby passengers.

          EXT. CANAL STREET - DAY

          Jonathan emerges from underground to hectic Chinatown. What
          once felt romantic now feels cold and exclusionary, a
          bustling mix of ASIANS and map-clutching TOURISTS. He surveys
          the area,-overwhelmed, eyes searching for anything resembling
          a clue. Foreign faces return only cold, blank stares.

          INT. CHINESE MARKET - DAY

          Cramped and dingy. Jonathan makes his way to the counter,
          where an OLD WOMAN sits smoking. He holds up the wrapper.

          JONATHAN
          I was told you sell this gum here?
          The Old Woman studies him a wary beat, then gestures to a
          candy display. In one box is the same gum.

          JONATHAN
          A woman - a white woman - buys this brand
          of gum. I need to find-
          The Old Woman interrupts him in raspy Chinese.

          JONATHAN
          I'm sorry, I don't                                              -- Do you know the
          woman I'm talking about? A white woman...?
          Please, it's very important that I                              --

          My grandmother doesn't speak English.
          Jonathan spins around to find a CHINESE GIRL.(13) in a smock.

          JONATHAN
          Can you ask if she knows the name of the
          white woman who buys this gum?
          The Girl questions the old woman in rapid Chinese. She takes.
          a dragon her smoke, then gives a lengthy answer. The girl
          nods, finally turns to an anxiously waiting Jonathan.

          GIRL
          She says they sell that gum in practically
          every store in Chinatown.

          Jonathan is struggling with his stiff new key, hearing his
          PHONE RINGING inside.

          Creepy and drab. Jonathan enters, approaches a RECEPTIONIST.
          The Receptionist nods, points across the lobby to Detective
          Russo. Jonathan looks very worried.

          The elevator descends with an unnerving rattle as Jonathan
          rides down with Russo.

          RUSSO
          The body came in late last night, although
          time of death's still unclear. She was
          found in a taxi: driver was in a .coffee
          shop on his break, came back to his cab
          and there she was in the back seat.
          The elevator shudders to a metallic stop.

          RUSSO
          Her purse was recovered from a dumpster
          about a block away, so we've got a name.
          Jonathan tenses as the elevator doors BANG OPEN.

          Simone Forester.
          Jonathan looks sick with fear.

          INT. MORGUE

          Russo leads Jonathan into the harsh fluorescent lights of the
          morgue. A MEDICAL EXAMINER                                      (50s) looks up from a deli
          sandwich, takes one last bite and waves them over.
          As they approach, Jonathan notices the TWO UNIFORMED OFFICERS
          stationed down here. They recognize Russo, nod in recognition
          - and eye Jonathan with hard, careful stares.

          CLOSE ON JONATHAN beside Russo. He turns instantly pale, lip
          quivering as he stares in disbelief, our CAMERA SLOWLY COMING

          CONTINUED:
          THE VICTIM'S FACE: it's not "S". But we do recognize her.
          It's the Blonde: the first woman he'd been with, the one he'd
          passed without a word in an office some days later.
          She looks the same, only death-pale and naked - and her neck
          marred by a thin, discolored line where she's been strangled.

          RUSSO
          Mr Messer...?
          He tries to speak, but can hardly breathe, let alone answer.

          RUSSO
          Was this the woman you were with last
          night?
          She frowns, suspicious of Jonathan's hesitation. His tense
          eyes whip across the morgue: the two cops still idling there.
          They're out of earshot, but their mere presence amps tension.
          Angle on the guns in their holsters. The handcuffs dangling --

          RUSSO
          Mr. Messer?

          JONATHAN
          No - she's not. Not last night... no.
          Russo studies his strained expression a suspicious beat.

          EXT. MEDICAL EXAMINER BUILDING - SHORT TIME LATER

          Jonathan exits behind Russo as they step onto the sidewalk.

          RUSSO
          I figured it was a long shot. The only
          reason I called you down is she was last
          seen with a man in the bar of the Hudson
          hotel.

          JONATHAN
          (suddenly tenses)
          The Hudson?

          RUSSO
          You mentioned this group of yours meets up
          at various hotels. I thought it was worth
          a shot.
          Russo glances up at him, trying to read him - something about
          his reaction not sitting right with her.

          Mr. Messer, is there anything else you
          want to tell me?
          Nervous and torn, Jonathan manages to shake his head.

          EXT. MORGUE/ STREET - NIGHT

          Jonathan exiting the morgue, talking low into his cell phone.

          JONATHAN
          Wyatt, it's me. I need to talk to you.
          Call me, OK? Please.

          A pleasant RECEPTIONIST smiles up from her expansive desk.

          RECEPTIONIST
          May I help you?
          Jonathan is standing across from her.

          JONATHAN
          Yes, I need to get in contact with one of
          your attorneys, Wyatt Bose - it's
          extremely important. He's working out of
          the London office right now. If I could
          speak to his assistant or someone who'd
          know how-to reach him immediately...

          RECEPTIONIST
          Of course. Just a minute.
          The Receptionist types into her PHONE SYSTEM. She shakes her
          head, confused.

          INT. RUTHERFORD STERN - CORRIDOR

          Jonathan walks alongside Ms. Pomerantz.

          POMERANTZ
          Are you sure you have the right firm?

          JONATHAN
          Yes                                                             -- yes, I'm                         --- He works here. I've seen

          When was this?

          JONATHAN
          A few weeks ago. Wyatt Bose. Wait... here.
          He hands her Wyatt's business card with the Rutherford Stern
          masthead on it. She studies it with a look of confusion.

          POMERANTZ
          I don't know what's going on, but I can
          assure you, there is nobody here named-

          Ms. Pomerantz abruptly frowns, when Jonathan spots a LAWYER -

          This Lawyer and another laughing at Wyatt's punch line.
          Jonathan runs over to the Lawyer, grabs the man's arm.

          Jonathan smiles in greeting... but Wyatt just nods coolly.

          LAWYER
          I crack jokes with a lot of people.

          JONATHAN
          Hold on, you're telling me you don't--

          LAWYER
          Hey - easy with the hands, okay?
          Jonathan realizes he's got the man's sleeve in his fist. He
          lets go, spins back to Ms. Pomerantz.

          JONATHAN
          He said he was in London with Mr.

          Jonathan spins to find Ms. Pomerantz scowling at him. A beat.

          MS. POMERANTZ
          Mr. Rutherford is presently recovering
          from hip surgery. In New Jersey.
          Jonathan glances around, to find everyone - lawyers,
          assistants, mail clerks                                         - all staring at him.

          Breathless, Jonathan bolts up a set of stairs, knocks on a
          door. No answer. He knocks harder. From within we hear a set
          of FOOTSTEPS. Sound of a lock turning, the door is opened...

          JONATHAN
          Wyatt -
          .by a MAN in his early 60's, his WIFE behind him; both
          strike us as wealthy, downtown patron-of-the-arts types.

          In this building? He must be new. See,
          we've been out of town the past2 months -

          Not in this building - in this apartment.

          Young man, we've owned this apartment
          going on thirty years now.

          But... I was right-here-with him...
          The Man takes a step back, catching his wife's equally wary
          expression, his hand making for the chain lock.

          JONATHAN

          (DESPERATE)
          Wait!! That painting there, it's                              a Gerhard

          downstairs?

          But Wyatt smoke to him.

          MAN
          Unless it was in Italian I doubt he got
          very far.
          Jonathan steps back, looking like he's losing his mind.

          Jonathan stumbles out, breathing hard as he tries to grapple
          with this                                                      - when he slams up against a man's shirtfront. Two
          hands grasp his arms, we glimpse a pair of black wingtips      -
          - and whip tilt up to the papery face of "Herr Kleiner"        (aka
          Mr. Moretti).

          "HERR KLEINER"
          Sono spiacente.

          INT. SUBWAY CAR - EVENING

          Jonathan sits slumped against a window, the world around him
          is ceasing to make sense. Across the aisle, a YOUNG BOHEMIAN
          COUPLE sit side by side, her headon his shoulder. On
          Jonathan's face there's a sense of loss that is almost
          overwhelming.
          Jonathan takes the crinkled Chinese gum wrapper from his
          pocket, smoothes it in his hands, stares down at it with a
          look of longing...
          . when his eyes suddenly widen. He sees something inside,
          something he hadn't noticed. He unfolds it to reveal two
          words written in a feminine hand on the white underside:
          I'm sorry
          Jonathan quickly looks up, as if expecting someone else to
          share in this haunting discovery. of course, no one does.
          He stares back. down at it, bewildered, stunned - chilled.

          EXT. SUBWAY STATION - CANAL ST., CHINATOWN - LATER

          Jonathan runs out from the subway station. Determined, he
          walks down Canal street, his eyes suddenly land on a COPY
          SHOP across.
          TIGHT ON JONATHAN as we see something click in his head -

          INT. RUTHERFORD STERN - LOBBY - LATE DAY

          Jonathan steps off the elevator, heads straight for the
          Receptionist. She immediately looks nervous.

          We do all freelancers, it's policy.

          Oh - I'm not sure I'm allowed to-

          JONATHAN
          You have to.
          She looks at him', sees his desperation.

          SAME - MOMENTS LATER
          Jonathan is flipping through the stack of photocopies, then
          halts on one. He stares at it. The Receptionist peers over.

          RECEPTIONIST
          That's him? He was real cute. Only he
          wasn't a lawyer. He was a systems analyst,
          I think. He was here for a few days to
          work on the computers.
          RECEPTIONIST'S POV: of the photocopy in Jonathan's hand. It's
          of a Massachusetts Driver's License. Staring back up at us is
          Wyatt's smiling face.

          RECEPTIONIST
          I thought you said his name was Wyatt?
          PAN TO THE NAME beside the photo: Sansky. WilliamR.
          Jonathan is already running for the EXIT.

          CLOSE ON JONATHAN'S LAPTOP SCREEN as an internet search
          engine runs the name: "Bansky, William." A page of some 200+
          matches is returned. Jonathan readies himself, then dives in.
          Beside the keyboard rests the receptionist's photocopy of
          William Bansky's Massachusetts driver's license. We see
          Detective Russo's business card resting a few inches away.

          ON JONATHAN - MOMENTS LATER
          Checking URLs site by site. He finally pauses on one. It's an
          article from the Boston Herald. The headline: "POLICE HAVE
          FEW CLUES TO YOUNG EXECUTIVE'S DISAPPEARANCE." As Jonathan

          ORIG. FROM CHICAGO -- $$ TROUBLE
          He sticks the post-it to the photocopy of Bansky's ID. He
          steps back, stares at it a beat - when he notices something
          on his desk,,resting under the phone: a manila file folder.
                                                                          He frowns at it - clearly out of place here. He picks the
          file up, opens it... to a series of                             8X10                                                        photographs?
          Heart racing nervously, he takes one out: it's of Jonathan
          standing in the Plaza lobby by the Eloise portrait. Confused,
          he quickly flips to the next one: in it, a Blonde now stands
          there with him -- the Blonde found murdered. Simone Forester.
          Jonathan's rapidly breathing as he shuffles through more
          photos. They're in sequence, taken by telephoto lens.
          Jonathan and Simone Forester getting in the elevator. Opening
          the room door. Undressing. Screwing. In one, Jonathan has his
          hands on her neck...
          He's sweating with anxiety- when suddenly the phone rings,
          startling him. He eyes it warily, then slowly picks up.

          (an unsettling silence)
          And you weren't at the Hudson two nights
          ago?

          JONATHAN
          I don't                                                    -- why are you-

                                                                     RUSSO             (O.S.)
          Turns out among credit card charges made
          that night, there was one with your name.
          The card was declined.

          JONATHAN
          I cancelled them all, the day they got
          stolen.

          RUSSO (O.S.)
          I see. I figured it didn't mean much -
          cards move quickly. It just struck me, you
          know.. The coincidence.
          Jonathan can hear the suspicion in her pause.

          RUSSO                                                      (O.S.)
          By the way, the morgue confirmed
          strangulation as cause of death. He found
          trace fibres of Kevlar in her neck wound.

          JONATHAN
          Kevlar?

          RUSSO (O.S.)
          It's used in certain kinds of rope and
          string.
          Jonathan's eyes suddenly go wide; whip pan with his gaze   to
          the hall closet door.

          (PAUSE)
          Well, I won't keep you. You have a good
          night.
          Jonathan slowly hangs up, his panicked gaze returning to the
          hall closet as he paces toward it, throws open the door.
          In the far corner rests his racket bag. He grabs it, yanks
          open the zipper... his face draining of all remaining color
          as he peers into his empty racket ba                           . His racket is gone.

          SAME - MOMENTS LATER
          Jonathan pacing the floor, paranoid. He holds Detective
          Russo's card. Knows he should call back. He abruptly reaches
          for the phone, and dials... another number.

          JONATHAN
          I know, okay? I know your name isn't Wyatt
          Bose. I know you killed that woman. And I
          know you're trying to frame me for it, so -
          so - WHY? What the hell is going on? And
          where is she?! If you hurt her I swear to
          God I'll...
          Jonathan falters, unsure where he's going with this and
          realizing he's now talking to himself.

          JONATHAN
          It's me. I need to talk to you.
          He hits pound. Breathes. At least he's done something.
          Suddenly from O.S. a faint creak. Jonathan spins, scans the
          room, grabs the nearest blunt object: his tennis trophy.
          QUICKLY CUT SHOTS of Jonathan searching his apartment, his
          trophy raised as a makeshift weapon.

          Jonathan whips to the phone - it sounds like Wyatt ---

          I understand you were out today. I left
          messages on your cell but never heard
          back, so I thought I'd try you at home.
          He slowly lowers his trophy as he listens, staring out the
          window at the dark night and empty street below.

          PETERSON                                                       (O.S.)

          INT. SUBWAY CAR - MORNING

          Jonathan sits in a crowded car, dressed for work.

          PETERSON                                                       (V.0.)
          They're our biggest client, so needless to
          say, make them your top priority...
          Jonathan takes out the crinkled Chinese gum wrapper. He
          stares at it with a look of longing: this is his Priority-

          EXT. CHINATOWN -- DAY

          A series of shots: Jonathan asking around about "S." The
          street vendors. The receptionist at the hotel. The waiter at
          the restaurant where they ate... They all shake their heads.
          Heading back for the subway, dejected, he steps on.a
          discarded page from the newspaper's Metro section, sees a
          headline: "STILL NO SUSPECT IN MURDER OF YOUNG EXEC." The
          photo is of Simone Forester.

          INT. CLUTE NICHOLS BROKERAGE - CORRIDORS                        - LATE DAY

          Intensely preoccupied, Jonathan walks alone past assistants
          and execs. In his eyes a sense of paranoia, a mistrust of
          every strange face.

          INT. A CONFERENCE ROOM - NIGHT

          Isolated behind yet another wall of glass, Jonathan just
          stares bleary-eyed at his laptop, unable to work.

          EXT. CLUTE NICHOLS BUILDING - NIGHT

          Jonathan exits, starts toward the sidewalk -- but hears
          something: sandpaper SHUFFLE of shoes on pavement. Be spins     --
          No one there. Just one of many large stone pillars adorning
          the building. Jonathan peers anxiously at the pillar,
          wavering. He steps closer, trying to glimpse behind it -
          RING! of his cell-phone breaks the stillness. RING... RING...
          He catches his breath, quickly picks up. A silent beat.

          A WOMAN'S VOICE                                                 (O.S.)
          Are you free tonight?... Hello?
          He hangs up, chilled. Turns again to the pillar, steps closer
          - no sound. He hesitates... then turns and walks off.

          INT. TIMES SQUARE SUBWAY STATION - NIGHT

          People heading home from work. Jonathan among them, utterly
          desolate. Sliding his MetroCard, he suddenly feels watched
          again. He spins, peers anxiously behind him. Only strange
          faces passing through turnstiles.

          INT. SUBWAY STATION - CORRIDOR

          A narrow, curved stretch of grimy walls of ads and graffiti.
          Jonathan keeps a quick pace, feeling vulnerable.
          We lag back, following him from an ANONYMOUS POV; glance up
          at a sign for stairs to the N & R trains.

          INT. SUBWAY PLATFORM

          Jonathan is waiting for his train, eyes nervously glancing
          around, still feeling watched -
          When he sees a young woman standing all the way across on the
          opposite platform, waiting for a train. She casually turns
          her head, and Jonathan's eyes go wide...

          It's "S."
          Jonathan just gapes across the divide of two subway tracks;
          he can't believe he's seeing her again...
          . when she starts to back away, almost as if she might run.
          Confused, Jonathan rushes to the edge of his platform.

          JONATHAN
          wait! Wait, right there!
          Jonathan stands on the edge reeling, desperate to get,to her.
          He looks around, hears the distant: .nimble of afar. off train,
          and suddenly he does something we'd have never thought him
          capable of: he jumps onto the tracks!
          He lands hard, nearly breaking his ankle, but quickly
          scrambles to his feet, splashing in the sludge between rails,
          eyes darting along the track, anxious to avoid the third
          rail, ears attuned to the sound of that distant train as he
          races for

          THE CENTER DIVIDER
          He reaches the grimy rungs and quickly climbs up.
          He gets to his feet on the center divider - now only one lane
          of track separating him from the platform she was standing on
          - only she's no longer there?
          He scans the people waiting, no sign of "S" among them - and
          then suddenly he spots her, heading for the exits.

          JONATHAN

          STOP!
          She glances back, utterly stunned to find Jonathan standing
          on the center divider, feet soaked in muck.
          Neither speaks for a moment, just staring at each other
          across the solitary track. Then:

          JONATHAN
          I thought you were dead!
          She looks like she wants to say something, but doesn't. And
          all at once he's hit with a crushing realization:

          JONATHAN
          You are in on this, aren't you?!
          She holds his eyes a moment longer, fighting back emotion -
          then she abruptly turns and starts back for the exit again.

          Jonathan looks confused; she's struggling to stay composed
          but looks like she could break down at any moment.

          âSâ
          He asked if I wanted to make some real
          money. All I had to do was get involved
          with you, and not ask any questions.
          Jonathan just stares, devastated.

          JONATHAN
          So everything between us - was nothing?
          She fights back tears.

          ., S
          No - no... After that first night I tried
          to call it off, he said he'd kill me if I
          didn't go through with it.

          JONATHAN
          Go through with what?

          âC,.
          The plan. Get you out of the hotel room,
          slip out and meet up later for my money.
          Only I ran instead. He's been looking for
          me ever since. I have to leave the city -

          JONATHAN
          Then why didn't you?

          SÂ
          Because I needed to see you again. I
          needed to be sure you were all right.
          Despite his conflicting emotions, Jonathan is moved          by   this.
          S,f
          I didn't know how to find you - you were

          Did you go to the police?

          JONATHAN
          I can't. He's framing me for murder.
          What?

          JONATHAN
          He killed a woman from the club, someone
          I'd been with.
          "S" is shocked., instantly terrified. Clearly she had no idea.

          Jonathan, you have to leave! Do you
          understand? You need to get the hell out
          of here, he's going to kill you!
          The roar of the incoming train is growing LOUDER...
          Don't you understand? He's going to kill -
          - when the INCOMING TRAIN completely drowns him out... and
          swipes "S" out of Jonathan's view.
          Jonathan struggles to peer through the train windows but its
          passengers prevent him from getting a look at her. Just then
          the TRAIN DOORS OPEN WITH THE NOISE of passengers getting on
          and off. Panicked, Jonathan cranes his neck, trying to see
          her through the windows.

          JONATHAN

          STOP!
          He boards the train; using it as a bridge, he pushes through
          passengers, desperate for an open door to the other side.

          -- only she's nowhere in sight. Jonathan spins frantically as
          the doors close and he hears the TRAIN START TO PULL AWAY.
          He runs alongside the train - desperately searching for a
          glimpse of her                                                  - no sign of her in any of the windows...

          the rear observation window, her hand pressed to the pane,
          her tearful expression bidding him a heartbreaking goodbye.
          He stumbles to a devastated halt, eyes pleading vainly as he

          He hangs up again. But his face bears a blank, eerily driven
          expression. He hits redial again as he opens the door to

          INT. JONATHAN'S APARTMENT

          Jonathan enters, phone still to his ear.

          COMPUVOICE                                                      (O.S.)

          WORTH-AND-BERMAN-VOICE-
          Jonathan hangs up and just stares at the phone in his hand,
          on the verge of something like a scream. He takes a breath.
          Presses redial once more. Only now it RINGS. Jonathan
          freezes. RING... RING... RING... RING... RING -- a CLICK of
          someone picking up, then SILENCE and faint wisps of static.

          JONATHAN
          Hello...?
          Not a word from the other end. We barely make out BREATHING.

          JONATHAN
          Wyatt? Is that you?
          Jonathan takes a tentative step forward, as if fearful that
          the least movement will cost him this connection.

          JONATHAN
          Say something damn it!
          From the receiver we hear a well-exhaled breath. And then:

          Reeling, Jonathan grips the phone tighter to his ear.

          Jonathan SLAMS the phone down, tension in his face joined by
          a new emotion, something closer to. fury.

          JONATHAN
          I'm going to find you.

          EXT. MIDTOWN MANHATTAN - STREET - DAY

          Jonathan is heading for the Clute Nichols building, that same
          focused tension on his face -

          WOMAN'S VOICE
          Mr. Messer?
          Jonathan is too lost in thought to hear it.

          what's she doing here? He has no choice but to meet her.

          RUSSO
          I was gonna call, but I was in the area.
          Just doing some follow-up.
          Jonathan tries to mask his uneasiness.

          JONATHAN
          Follow-up?

          RUSSO
          On that missing girl of yours. The.one
          whose name began with. an "S." Have any
          luck finding her?
          Jonathan absently tightens his grasp on his briefcase.

          JONATHAN
          No. No luck.

          RUSSO
          I see. That's too bad.
          she studies him a cryptic beat, then smiles flatly.

          RUSSO
          Well, who knows, maybe she'll turn up yet.
          You have a good day, Mr. Messer.
          Jonathan nods tensely, then walks off, feeling her watching
          him from the curb as he goes.

          INT. CLUTE NICHOLS - CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

          Employees pass by the glass behind which we see Jonathan - a
          lone figure at his laptop, surrounded by files and post-its.
          Close on Jonathan as he scribbles on a post-it: "Yesterday -
          Beatles?" Widen to find the post-its organized with his usual
          fastidiousness                                                  - only scribbled with words, not numbers:
          "Wyatt Bose = William Bansky" and other random scribblings.
          He's trying to apply his mathematical mind to his crisis,
          hoping to conjure some kind of pattern or logic to it all.
          Reverse angle through the glass: to anyone passing, he looks
          like your typical overly meticulous, isolated auditor.
          Closer on Jonathan as he clutches the table, looks seconds
          away from utterly losing it -- when something suddenly occurs
          to him. He whips around, gaze fixing on

          INT. THE KITANO HOTEL - LOBBY - NIGHT

          Jonathan waits anxiously by a Botero sculpture of a rotund
          dog. A young woman in a BLUE PASHMINA approaches.

          INT. THE KITANO - ELEVATOR

          Blue Pashmina enters first, Jonathan follows her into an
          empty elevator. The doors close.

          JONATHAN
          Do you know Wyatt Bose?

          BLUE PASHMINA
          (immediately guarded)
          Excuse me?

          JONATHAN
          What about William Bansky? Does that name--
          She darts.for the "Door Open" button, but he blocks her path.

          BLUE PASHMINA
          I swear to God I'll scream.

          Please, I'm not trying to scare you, I

          very important that I find him.
          she tries to push past him, again Jonathan blocks her.

          JONATHAN
          He does this too - or he did. someone had
          to give him the numbers. Someone let him
          in. If I can-'find who it was that knew
          him, they might know where he's                                 --
          she suddenly kicks him in the shin with a spiked heel.
          Jonathan grasps his leg - she presses the button and is out
          the opening doors before he's even looked up.

          CLOSE ON JONATHAN alone at the end of the conference table,
          eyes scanning files absently, fingers typing on auto-pilot.
          His gaze holds a new determination, as the CLACKING OF KEYS

          INT. HOTEL CASABLANCA - LOBBY - LATER

          Jonathan anxiously escorts ANOTHER YOUNG WOMAN past the quasi-
          Moroccan motif. Asking her something, he takes out a folded
          paper from his pocket, shows it to her: it's the photocopy of
          Bansky's license with the image of Wyatt's face. She quickly
          shakes her head, her eyes searching for the exit.

          INT. THE LOMBARDY - BAR - NIGHT

          Jonathan trails a TALL WOMAN as she bee-lines for the exit.
          He grabs her arm, thrusts the photocopy into her hands. She
          halts, looks up at him... and tears it in two before handing
          it back and hurrying off, her glare full of paranoia.

          TNT. THE SHERRY-NETHERLAND - LOBBY - NIGHT
          Jonathan rises from a couch to greet YET ANOTHER YOUNG WOMAN.
          He gets no more than a few seconds into his question when she
          about-faces without a word. Jonathan has a relentless look in
          his eye. Takes out his cell, calls another number...

          INT. VARIOUS HOTELS - LOBBY COUCHES - NIGHT

          Rapid jump cuts of A DOZEN DIFFERENT WOMEN'S FACES, all
          indicating twenty different kinds of "no"; with each cut the
          women occupy the exact same position in frame, only their
          faces and the hotel backgrounds behind them change.

          Room key in hand, Jonathan rides up with a woman in a BLACK
          BUSINESS SUIT - a tall, attractive business-type. Jonathan
          stares at his shoes, trying to mask his. utter exhaustion.

          Jonathan and Black Business Suit come in. She starts to

          to her. She freezes, eyes fixed on the license photo.
          Jonathan braces himself for her departure                       - when she stares
          back up at him in scared but clear recognition.

          SAME SCENE - MOMENTS LATER
          Seated on the edge of the made bed, Black Business Suit
          shifts uncomfortably as she lights a cigarette.

          BLACK BUSINESS SUIT
          I was in Chicago on business, a little
          over a year ago. I was out.to dinner with
          one of our Chicago partners,.a man named
          Holloway. That's how I met him.
          TIGHT ON JONATHAN as we SMASH TO:

          INT. EXPENSIVE CHICAGO RESTAURANT - NIGHT

          A slightly older man                                            (HOLLOWAY) sits with his back to us.
          Across from him sits Black Business Suit. A YOUNGER MAN steps
          into frame, rests his hand on Holloway's shoulder.

          BLACK BUSINESS SUIT                                             (V.0.)
          At first I assumed he was a junior
          executive at their firm. But he wasn't.
          That's not to say he didn't work for
          Holloway, but clearly in a more intimate
          capacity...

          TNT. THE MICHELANGELO - ROOM - NIGHT
          Black Business Suit takes a cool drag on her cigarette.

          BLACK BUSINESS SUIT
          I wasn't shocked. Besides, obviously I'm
          no prude. Even back then, I'd been doing -
          you know, this thing -- for a while.

          INT. EXPENSIVE CHICAGO RESTAURANT - NIGHT

          Wyatt is talking, entertaining his two companions - but
          clearly more focused on Black Business Suit, flirting it up.

          BLACK BUSINESS SUIT                                             (V.0.)
          I was simply curious. More so when he
          apologized, explaining that he'd forgotten
          about another engagement.
          Wyatt's knuckles just barely stroke Black Business Suit's
          thigh as he rises to leave. They exchange a knowing glance...

          BACK TO MICHELANGELO ROOM

          BLACK BUSINESS SUIT
          I was intrigued. He was intelligent,
          informed about everything from law to art
          to politics. I'd never met anyone so in
          command of his own charm. He said that
          he'd come from nothing, that everything he
          learned, he learned from his tricks. He
          claimed that Holloway was even grooming
          him for a position at his company.
          She lights another cigarette with her old one.

          BLACK BUSINESS SUIT
          In a way, I felt for him. But I also
          admired him. It sounds silly,. but he had a
          way of making me feel - close to him, you
          know?
          This clearly hits home with Jonathan. He barely nods.

          BLACK BUSINESS SUIT
          So I found myself telling him things..
          Personal things. And, next thing I knew -

          JONATHAN
          You told him. About this.
          A beat, and she nods, crushing out her other cigarette.

          BLACK BUSINESS SUIT
          He seemed fascinated by it. Wanted to know
          all the details.

          (EXHALES)
          I suppose I'd had too much to drink. And I
          was distracted... I was thinking about
          what a great lay he was going to be.

          INT. FOUR SEASONS CHICAGO -.SUITE BEDROOM - LATE NIGHT

          Wyatt and Black Business Suit go at it with animal
          aggression. She's on all fours, arching lustily, pleasure
          nearly unbearable, eyes clenched shut as she climaxes.
          Exhausted, her body goes limp.
          TILT UP to his face: an eerily blank, driven stare, devoid of
          real pleasure. She struggles, tries to protest - when his
          hands grip her shoulder blades, thrusting harder, violently
          pinning her down, her sudden fear stifled by the mattress --

          Only afterwards I discovered two of my
          credit cards were missing. As was my cell
          phone. Of course I couldn't say anything
          to Holloway. And Jamie must have known I'd
          never report it to the police.

          (BEAT)
          So I just put the incident out of my mind.
          I all but forgot about it, until one
          night, maybe two months ago -

          Black Business Suit is crossing the lobby for a portrait of
          Hearst and A SUITED MAN lingering beneath it... when the man
          looks up. It's Wyatt.

          BLACK BUSINESS SUIT                                            (V.0.)
          I almost didn't recognize him. But when I
          did, I suddenly felt very, very scared.
          She freezes -- obscured by one of the trees as Wyatt checks
          his watch, scans-the lobby with a cool, piercing look.

          BACK TO BLACK BUSINESS SUIT AND JONATHAN IN THE MICHELANGELO

          BLACK BUSINESS SUIT
          I left before he saw me.
          She drags on her cigarette, looks off into space.

          BLACK BUSINESS SUIT
          He must have used my cell phone to get
          into the group.
          (crushes out her cigarette)
          Anyway, that's it. That's all I know.
          She looks around. At the room, the bed. She shudders, rises.

          JONATHAN
          Wait - thank you.
          (off her look)
          Have you ever run into him again?

          BLACK BUSINESS SUIT
          Getz? No. And I don't ever want to.

          JONATHAN
          Getz?

          That was his name. Jamie Getz.

          Bundled in her ski jacket, Solange is closing up her shop for
          the night, stacks of flowers in her arms, when she notices
          Jonathan coming down the front steps.

          SOLANGE
          Jonathan, you're home early -
          Only when he looks up, she finds the young man in the
          overcoat isn't Jonathan. It's Wyatt.

          SOLANGE
          Oh - je suis desole. My mistake.
          Wyatt flashes her an icy smile, continues down the steps.
          Solange watches him walk away, a puzzled look on her face.

          INT. MICHELANGELO - HOTEL BUSINESS CENTER - NIGHT

          Huddled over a computer, Jonathan typing, eyes red from
          exhaustion and stress as we hear his recall:

          JONATHAN (V.0.)
          who's James Getz?

          WYATT (V.0.)
          A guy I roomed with freshman year at
          Princeton.
          on Jonathan's monitor we see he's on a web site for Princeton
          University alumni. He types in: Getz, James.
          A beat - then: "No match." A long list of G names follows.
          Jonathan scrolls down the list, but there's no Getz.

          JONATHAN
          Shit.
          Jonathan exhales, about to log off - when a name among the
          H's jumps out at him: Holloway. Reed.
          Jonathan stares at it tensely - then clicks on the name.
          "Sort no contact information available."
          Jonathan thinks a moment - then tries a search engine, types:
          "Holloway Reed" then decides to add the word "missing."
          An article appears. From the Chicago Tribune: "BODY OF
          MISSING BUSINESSMAN FINALLY DISCOVERED." A head-shot style
          photograph shows a man in his early 40s whom we recognize
          from Black Business Suit's story. Beneath his photo, his
          name: "Reed Holloway."

          JONATHAN
          Can I print this out?

          EXT. EIGHTH AVENUE                                              (HELL'S KITCHEN)   - LATE NIGHT

          Porn shops and prostitutes, the streets pulsing with a
          sinister energy. Jonathan is pacing toward the subway,
          reading over the printed article.

          EXT. BROOKLYN - ELEVATED SUBWAY PLATFORM - LATE NIGHT

          Jonathan descends the steps to his presently deserted
          neighborhood. O.S. the departure of the subway train is
          joined by the distant.wail of SIRENS.
          Jonathan continues down the block, then pauses. He wrinkles
          his nose, smelling something. He looks up: two blocks away, a
          thick plume of smoke is billowing up into the sky --

          EXT. JONATHAN'S DUPLEX

          Jonathan bolts around the corner to find an ambulance and
          fire engine curbside -- a fire raging in the lower story of
          his building!
          Running toward the blaze, he speeds past a BLACK BMW parked
          across the street, engine running. It suddenly shifts into
          gear and peels out in a fast turn. Jonathan spins               - something
          about it troubling him - but the BMW is already gone. He
          continues racing toward his building...
          The neon "FLEURS DE SOLANGE" sign crackles and sparks in the
          flame. Through blown out windows, piles of burning flowers
          emit what must be an awful stench.
          Two EMS WORKERS are loading a gurney on which Solange lays,
          burned and half-aware, but alive, when Jonathan rushes over.
          She manages to open her eyes, her voice barely audible:

          SOLANGE
          Jonathan...
          He squeezes her hand as she's lifted into the ambulance.

          JONATHAN'
          (to EMS worker)
          Is she going to be okay?

          EMS WORKER
          Yeah, she'll make it.

          94.

          CONTINUED:
          The ambulance doors SLAM shut. A hand grabs Jonathan's arm.
          He spins                                                        - it's a FIRE WORKER.

          JONATHAN
          I live here.

          INT. JONATHAN'S APARTMENT - LATER

          Thick smoke clouds the stairs and corridor. Suit jacket over
          his head, Jonathan is hurriedly escorted by the Fire Worker.
          His own door has already been kicked open, splintered at its
          hinges. The place looks like it's been turned upside down,
          furniture soaking wet, charred areas on walls.

          FIRE WORKER
          Lucky we were able to contain it somewhat.
          Better get your valuables together.

          INT. JONATHAN'S BEDROOM

          still in shock, he tosses random clothes in a gym bag - "Duck
          on Bike" too.

          JONATHAN
          (calls out)
          How did it start?

          FIRE WORKER (O.S.)
          We're not sure. Maybe a bad fuse.

          INT. JONATHAN'S BATHROOM

          Jonathan opens his medicine cabinet, takes out his small film
          cannister, uncaps it to see how much money he has left. Not
          very much. He stuffs the cannister into his pants pocket.

          INT. SPARE BEDROOM

          Jonathan opens his old gunmetal-gray filing cabinet, then
          pops open his briefcase, trying to decide what to take.
          He finds a file marked "Bank Statements," pulls it, about to
          toss it in his briefcase - when he stops, something about its
          contents ---
          CLOSE ON THE FILE. Stuffed with paper. But not bank
          statements... Copies and copies of photographs of Jonathan
          with Simone Forester. Some we've seen, some new.
          Jonathan hunts through more files, his breathless nausea
          telling us the contents of each and every file have been
          swapped out with photos.

          (CONTINUED)

          

          

          

          

          95.

          CONTINUED:
          He opens another at random - and freezes: it's a photo of
          Jonathan and "S" walking in Chinatown. He scans through
          others, shots of them in the restaurant, entering the Hotel
          Lotus...
          TIGHT ON JONATHAN, terrified by the horrific implication -

          FIRE WORKER                                                     (O.S.)
          Mr. Messer?
          Jonathan gasps as he looks up to find the Fire Worker in the
          doorway. He quickly shuts the file.

          JONATHAN
          Just                                                            - give me a minute.

          INT. JONATHAN'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM

          A paranoid-looking Jonathan returns with a briefcase stuffed
          near to bursting. The tired Fire Worker looks up impatiently.

          FIRE WORKER
          That everything?
          Jonathan regards his minimal possessions, realizes how little
          evidence there is of a life. A wrenching sense of isolation.

          JONATHAN
          I guess it is.

          FIRE WORKER
          You got someone you can stay with?

          INT. A SEEDY HOTEL LOBBY - DOWNTOWN - PRE-DAWN

          The sort of decrepit no-tell motel frequented by hookers and
          junkies. Jonathan clutches his briefcase as he stares through
          steel mesh at. the NIGHT CLERK.

          NIGHT CLERK
          It's fifty for the night.
          Jonathan fishes out his film cannister, and parts with what
          he discovers are his last three                                 $20s.

          INT. SEEDY HOTEL - ROOM - PRE-DAWN

          Even more depressing than the lobby: bars on the windows,
          stains on the thin walls through which the faint sounds of
          paid sex bleed in. Somewhere a bottle smashes.

          96.

          CONTINUED:
          Unable to sleep, Jonathan has emptied his briefcase contents
          onto the bed. He stares at one of Wyatt's photos of him and
          "S." She's smiling up at him.
          EXTREME CLOSE ON THE IMAGE OF HER FACE. The smile, frozen in
          time, at once haunting and heartbreaking.
          He gently sets the photo down beside the Chicago Tribune
          article he'd printed on the unsolved murder of Reed Holloway
          ("BODY OF MISSING BUSINESSMAN FINALLY DISCOVERED"). His eyes
          drift to the article, and something suddenly occurs to him -
          FLASH ON: THE PHOTOGRAPH IN "WYATT'S.BROWNSTONE" of Wyatt
          with bleached hair styled in a loose spike --
          IN THE ARTICLE'S PHOTO, Holloway sports an almost identical
          look.-His eyes move to the date of the article: "May 17."

          CUT TO:
          Jonathan on the phone, a business card in hand.

          OFFICE ON PHONE
          Boston Police, how can I direct your call?
          Jonathan reads off the card Detective Russo had given him:

          JONATHAN
                                                                                                      This is Detective Russo, NYPD, badge
          number 274655.                                                                                                                     1   just need some

          Jonathan sits in suspense, awaiting a response. Finally -

          OFFICER ON PHONE
          Well?

          JONATHAN
          You've got a case, a missing person named
          William Bansky. I'm wondering if you can
          tell me the date he was last seen?

          OFFICER ON PHONE
          Hold a sec.

          (PAUSE)
          Bansky, William, last seen... May                              17.
          Jonathan's eyes return to the Holloway article                 ("BODY OF
          MISSING BUSINESSMAN FINALLY DISCOVERED:), dated "May 17."

          OFFICER ON PHONE

          CONTINUED:

          JONATHAN
          That's it, thanks.
          Jonathan quickly hangs up, equally encouraged and chilled by
          the connection he's made.
          TILT DOWN to a post-it, on which he's scribbled: "BOSE =
          BANSKY = HOLLOWAY." To this he adds: "= JAMES GETZ"

          INT. CHASE MANHATTAN BANK - MORNING

          A line of customers stare mutely up at plasma tv screens
          above - except for Jonathan, unshaven, suit wrinkled, face
          all anxious tension.

          SAME - TELLER'S WINDOW - MOMENTS LATER
          Jonathan slides his passport through the window's metal tray,
          to the TELLER                                                   (40s) working behind three inches of glass. The
          Teller examines the passport, then slides it back.

          TELLER
          M'kay, if you'll just swipe your ATM card.
          She gestures to a small punch pad to Jonathan's right.

          JONATHAN
          Actually, my card was stolen.

          TELLER
          Mmm'kay... do you see those two taupe
          colored telephones over there? Just pick
          up either one and you'll be connected with
          our automated system.

          JONATHAN
          The thing is, I already used your
          automated system and...look, this
          passport's all I have left, it's the only
          thing proves who I am and now I'm down to
          like my last ten dollars here, so...
          Jonathan's cool is cracking. The Teller wrinkles her brow.

          TELLER
          Mm'kay, if you press "0" on either phone?
          A customer service representative will -

          JONATHAN
          Give me a goddamn break.

          CONTINUED:

          TELLER
          Sir, there's no need for profanity.

          JONATHAN
          (loses it)
          Oh no? In the last few days I've seen a
          woman I thought might be dead turn up
          alive and a woman I assumed was alive turn
          up dead, both at the hands of a guy about
          whom everything I know is apparently a
          lie. I've had my building set on fire, my
          neighbor nearly killed, and my apartment
          ransacked. So please forgive my language,
          but it's been one fuck of a week.
          The stunned Teller stares back at him slack-jawed.

          JONATHAN
          Look, I know I'm just another face on this
          side of the glass, I get that. But I'm
          begging you, as one human being to
          another, please let me into your life just
          long enough to help me out here. Please.
          The Teller stares back at him a beat - and nods.
          She starts quickly typing into her monitor, finally looks up.

          TELLER
          I'm showing that card as having been sent
          out four days ago. It definitely went out.
          We even heeded the change of address
          request.

          JONATHAN
          Well, like I                                                    -- wait, what request?

          TELLER
          Apparently you informed the bank of an
          address change?
          She swivels her monitor so he can see.

          TELLER
          Mr. Jonathan Messer,                                            140                      E.   91st Street -

          We recognize the DOORMAN in the midst of fielding a complaint
          by an ELDERLY TENANT with a yappy dog. Jonathan hurries to
          the elevators, unnoticed.

          INT.                                                            140   E.            91ST -- HALLWAY

          Jonathan emerges from an elevator. The last door on the left.
          Jonathan tries the doorknob. It's locked. Jonathan checks
          under the mat. Sure enough, there's a key.

          INT. THE APARTMENT

          Utterly bare. Empty walls, expensive views, polished wood
          floors. Jonathan takes a wary step inside, leaning to peer
          around the corners.
          He paces cautiously through the living room. The dining area.
          The glistening chrome and granite kitchen.

          THE BEDROOM
          A room as empty as the others - with the exception of a small
          pile of envelopes beneath a window in a far corner. Jonathan
          slowly nears...to find it's a stack of mail. He picks up an
          envelope -- O.S. the CREAK of a door hinge.
          Jonathan whips around -- no one behind him. He steps out of
          the room to investigate.
          We remain alone in the empty room an excruciating beat...
          .until Jonathan finally steps back in, only slightly at
          ease. He returns to the stack of mail, picks up an envelope.
          He reads: "Mr. Jonathan Messer 140 E.                           91    St..."
          Eyes wide, he hurriedly flips through the rest of the mail -
          all addressed to him at this address.
          Jonathan still staring at this mail in disbelief, when he
          finds at the bottom of the stack: another PHOTOGRAPH. It's of
          "S" standing fearfully on the subwa latform across the
          track from Jonathan. And suddenly Jonathan is gripped with
          fear, unaware of a blurred, nearing intruder...

          Long time no see.

          Jonathan spins round, Wyatt's standing there with a gun. It's
          pointing directly at Jonathan.

          WYATT
          I have some instructions. Follow them and
          I might let her live.

          JONATHAN
          Where is she?

          WYATT
          This should've been simpler. I frame you,
          you panic...

          JONATHAN
          Where is she?!
          A terrifying silence - Jonathan erupts:

          JONATHAN
          Goddamn it tell me what you did to--

          WYATT
          Press pause on the questions and listen.
          The brokerage firm you're auditing is
          Clute Nichols. As a standard part of that

          transfer that money to an account I've
          established overseas.

          I know you don't. But I do. Your passport.
          (brandishes the gun)
          Now, please.
          Jonathan takes it out and tosses it to him. Wyatt catches it.
          And hands Jonathan an ENVELOPE.

          WYATT
          It's all in there.                                              11                              pm tonight. Their

          This account overseas                                   - it's in my name,
          isn't it?
          A moment of tense silence.
          Jonathan just stares back hard a quiet beat; then:

          JONATHAN
          Why'd you pick me?
          Wyatt raises a brow, vaguely amused the question.

          WYATT
          You answered the ad, Jonathan.
          (off Jonathan's confusion)
          "Feeling all alone out there? Have a great
          job, fine personality and good looks to
          match, but no time to.meet that special
          someone? Help is just a phone call away -"

          JONATHAN
          The ad - in Money magazine...

          WYATT

          (GRINS)
          Told you to block that Caller ID. Of
          course I had to scope out a whole lot of
          losers before I hit the jackpot. After
          all, there only so many Jonathan Messers
          out there.

          (BEAT)
          If you screw with me, well - you saw what
          I did to that Blonde? That's kindness
          compared to what I'll do to your little
          .girlfriend. You won't even recognize her
          when I'm through.

          JONATHAN
          Why should I believe you? Everything you
          told me was lies.

          WYATT
          Not lies, Jonathan. Foreplay. And now...
          now you're fucked.
          He grins his 'charming' grin and starts for the door.

          WYATT
          Remember: be smart. I'll be watching you.
          And... feel free to take a shower, looks
          like you could do with one.
          The front door slams. Jonathan just stands there, staring
          shell-shocked at the envelope.

          EXT. STREET - MINUTES LATER

          Jonathan comes out the building putting the envelope in his
          suit pocket.
          As he crosses the street a CAR HORN BLARES - WHIP AROUND to
          find a car barrelling at us. Jonathan dives out of the way an
          instant before the car would have hit him.
          Face first in the gutter, scraped and gasping, Jonathan peers
          up to see Wyatt's BLACK BMW speeding away.

          INT. WORTH & BERMAN - AN OFFICE - LATE DAY

          A stiff guy in his late-30s is working in his office when an
          ASSISTANT enters.

          ASSISTANT
          Mr. Peterson, one of the audit managers is
          here to see you. Jonathan Messer?

          PETERSON

          (PUZZLED)
          Really? Well - okay, bring him back.
          We follow the assistant out the door, read the name
          stencilled on the glass "CHET PETERSON, SENIOR MANAGER."

          INT. WORTH & BERMAN - LOBBY

          Through a set of frosted glass doors we see Peterson's
          Assistant approach a RECEPTIONIST, who gestures across the
          lobby. The Assistant approaches the sofas, where Jonathan is
          seated. She addresses him. He rises.

          INT. WORTH & BERMAN - PETERSON'S OFFICE

          Chet Peterson looks up as his door is opened -

          PETERSON
          Jonathan, good to see you again!

          YOUNG MAN
          Actually, I was just looking for Fred
          Whipple's office?

          PETERSON

          (AWKWARDLY)
          Next door down.
          The Young Man ducks out, and now Peterson sees his Assistant
          approaching, Jonathan a few paces behind her, adjusting his
          glasses. Peterson reloads his greeting:

          PETERSON
          Jonathan, good to see you again!

          INT. PETERSON'S OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER

          Close on Chet Peterson, gravely peering across his desk.

          PETERSON
          Well, I have to say, your resignation
          comes as something of a surprise. Most of
          our auditors seem to like the freedom the
          position affords.

          (CONCERNED)
          You'll stay on to finish up at Clute
          Nichols, of course?
          Track around Peterson to see Jonathan seated across from him,
          lifting his head to reply - and doing so revealing it's

          "
          Wyatt," wearing one of Jonathan's suits, hair colored and
          styled like Jonathan's, even sporting identical eyeglasses.
          He offers an awkward half-smile, just as Jonathan would.

          WYATT
          Absolutely.

          PETERSON
          So do you have any plans?

          WYATT
          Yes. I'm going to travel. I want to see
          the world.
          Peterson nods benignly.

          Jonathan sitting in the conference room of Clute Nichols,
          lettered-boxed by the glass wall through which he watches
          employees pass in fewer and fewer numbers. Throughout this,
          Jonathan's blank stare of harrowed tension never changes.

          Abeautiful shot of the cityscape - accompanied by the sound

          INT. CLUTE NICHOLS - CONFERENCE ROOM

          Jonathan seated at the far end of the empty table, typing on
          his laptop. Beside him is the envelope Wyatt gave him, and
          its sheet of paper on which instructions are typed.
          Jonathan peers at the laptop clock. It reads                            10:58   PM.
          His eyes travel in a tense triangle from instructions, to
          laptop screen, to glass wall - fingers typing all the while.
          He finally reaches a prompt: BIENVENUE. POUR ANGLAIS, CBOISEZ P2.
          We glimpse a small. logo with a SWISS FLAG.
          Jonathan presses F2. Reads some more, types some more.
          Finally we read: ENTER SUB-ACCOUNT NUMBER.
          Jonathan enters more per Wyatt's typed instructions. Reads.

          ENTER DESIGNATED ACCOUNT NUMBER:
          Jonathan copies the numbers in from the instructions. Waits.

          ENTER SENDER'S 8 DIGIT ACCESS CODE. REQUIRED TO COMPLETE TRANSACTION.
          His eyes travel to a page atop a Clute Nichols file. We can
          glimpse an 8 digit code circled in pencil. Jonathan stares at
          the cursor.on the laptop screen, the icon blinking
          petulantly. He's about to type...
          And then he halts. His eyes drifting to HIS CELL PHONE,
          resting in its charger.
          TIGHTER ON JONATHAN. His eyes fixed on the cell phone, an
          idea forming in his mind --
          RING!! of the cell phone suddenly jars us. RING... Jonathan
          hesitates, then picks up.

          Jonathan says nothing. We can hear Wyatt getting tenser:

          WYATT (O.S.)
          I said what's taking you?

          JONATHAN
          I wondered if you were monitoring this.

          WYATT (O.S.)
          Don't worry about what I'm doing. Just
          finish the transaction. Now.

          JONATHAN
          Not until I see her.
          (off Wyatt's silence)
          The transfer's impossible without an
          access code. And there's no way I'm
          entering it until I'm sure that she's
          safe. So you tell me. How do we do that?
          Wyatt still remains unnervingly silent. We tighten on
          Jonathan, holding his breath, any plan he's concocting
          clearly hinging on this...

          WYATT (0..S.)
          (low, frustrated)
          You have a wireless connection?
          Jonathan lets out a brief exhalation.

          SAME - MOMENTS LATER
          Jonathan snaps his laptop lid shut, packs it in his gym bag,
          in which we glimpse the photo he's kept with him of "S"
          smiling up at him.
          He then turns to his cell phone once more. He picks it up,
          scrolls the menu, punches a number.

          EXT. THE PLAZA HOTEL - ROOFTOP - LATE NIGHT

          An elaborate and intensely packed WEDDING PARTY is being held
          up here beneath the glow of heat lamps, the music and crowd
          noise unspeakably loud. We travel through the din, past
          hundreds of well-heeled partiers, mainly young and wealthy.

          EXT. PLAZA HOTEL - LATE NIGHT

          The party noise is even slightly audible                        30   stories below,
          where we find Jonathan carrying his bag as he enters...

          INT. THE PLAZA HOTEL - LOBBY

          Jonathan surveys the busy lobby. GUESTS mulling. STAFF
          bustling. And, of course, the "ELOISE" PORTRAIT.

          WYATT (O.S.)'
          May I ask you a personal question?
          Jonathan spins around, stares frostily into Wyatt's magnetic
          smile. With Wyatt's new look, they could be brothers.
          Except Wyatt looks clean and crisp, Jonathan dishevelled and
          tense. Wyatt eyes the bag in Jonathan's hand.

          JONATHAN
          Where is she?

          WYATT
          In one of the rooms. Safe.
          (a thin smile)
          I got us a table.

          INT. LOBBY BAR - MOMENTS LATER

          A WAITRESS delivers a pair of drinks to where Jonathan and
          Wyatt are seated.

          WAITRESS
          Two Macallan 25 year. Enjoy.
          The Waitress leaves. Wyatt raises his glass.

          WYATT
          To friendship.
          Jonathan just stares back at Wyatt.

          Bansky's dead, isn't he?

          WYATT
          He was dead when I met him. Just like you.
          The rest was a mere formality.
          (re: the laptop)
          Of course he didn't have your bargaining
          chip. Speaking of which...

          JONATHAN
          Not until I see her. She's the only reason
          I'm here and not at the police.

          WYATT
          I told you, she's in a room. Alive.

          JONATHAN
          Give me the key then.
          Wyatt considers this, then takes out an electronic key card
          and slides it across the table. Of course there's nothing on
          the key card to indicate a room number.

          WYATT
          As soon as you're done, I'll tell you the
          room number.

          JONATHAN
          Not good enough.
          Wyatt reaches for the key card; as he does we glimpse a
          handgun concealed by his suit.

          JONATHAN
          You won't let her live. You killed all the
          others, you'll have to kill us too.

          WYATT
          Hey, I like you, okay? You'll be fine.

          JONATHAN
          (scoffs, repulsed)
          You like me.

          WYATT
          I do, Jonathan. In my way. After all,
          you're my creation. I'm the one who gave
          you life.

          JONATHAN
          Don't you get it? It was her, not you!
          She's the one. She gave me life! You can
          steal my identity, but not what's here.

          He puts his hand on his heart. Wyatt is startled by
          Jonathan's passionate outburst.

          WYATT
          Yeah, well, I'm weeping big wet ones for
          you both. Now, let's get on with it.

          (BEAT)
          I don't have all night, Jonathan.
          Jonathan reluctantly nods his assent. Wyatt lets go of the
          key card. Jonathan opens his bag...

          SAME - MOMENTS LATER
          CLOSE ON JONATHAN'S LAPTOP SCREEN as it defuzzes from sleep.
          The screen as it was, cursor blinking by the request for an
          access code.
          Wyatt watches intensely as Jonathan starts to type -- then
          pauses, looking confused.
          Jonathan quickly reaches around. to the back of his laptop,
          feels an empty jack - and suddenly turns pale.

          WYATT
          What is it?

          JONATHAN
          My wireless modem - I must have left it in
          the conference room. I can't get back
          online.
          Wyatt glares at Jonathan, seething.

          I can go back there and-

          Wyatt and Jonathan crossing the lobby; they arrive at

          Empty at this hour, with the exception of a sleepy-looking
          EMPLOYEE. As Jonathan steps toward the desk, he takes out
          the hotel key card, his eyes travelling up to a clock
          overhead:                                                       11:29.

          Satisfied, Wyatt finds a comfortable chair with a direct view

          Across the lobby, an attractive AUBURN-HAIRED WOMAN in
          business attire glances over at him.

          Jonathan is subtly slipping the                                 $100                            bill to the Employee.

          EMPLOYEE
          You forgot your. own room number?

          JONATHAN
          I just checked in and it's been a hectic
          day. Look at me!
          The Employee looks uneasy - something about the ill-concealed
          tension in Jonathan's eyes.

          EMPLOYEE
          You could just ask at the front desk. I'm
          sure they can-

          JONATHAN
          I really don't have time, okay?
          Jonathan presses the bill into the Employee's palm, peers up
          at the clock again: the big hand clicks over to 11:30.

          accept the money.
          Wyatt looks relieved -- when his view is abruptly blocked by
          the Auburn-Haired Woman.

          AUBURN HAIR
          Pardon me, but may I ask you something -
          personal?
          Wyatt quickly looks up at her, momentarily confused.

          AUBURN HAIR
          Are you waiting for me?

          BACK TO JONATHAN IN BUSINESS CENTER
          The Employee finishes swiping his card through a scanner.

          His view of Jonathan still obscured by Auburn Hair.

          WYATT
          What the hell are you --
          And then he sees Auburn Hair glance unsurely at the Eloise
          portrait, then at her cell phone's clock -- and now realizes:

          WYATT
          Motherfucker!
          He jumps up, shoves Auburn Hair aside - eyes darting to the
          Business Center to find Jonathan no longer behind the glass,
          just his laptop resting on the counter where he'd been
          standing.

          Jonathan rushes into an elevator car just as it's about to

          Ding as the elevator doors open and the family step out.
          Jonathan is left alone, impatiently waiting for the doors to
          close -
          - when his eyes land on something in the hallway: the fire
          alarm. He suddenly reaches out to stop the elevator door just
          as it's about to close.

          INT.                                                            6TH FLOOR HALLWAY

          alarm blares to life. Pan                                                                                                                                     180   to find Jonathan dipping into
          an emergency exit stairwell.

          INT. PLAZA HOTEL - LOBBY

          Wyatt is just about to step onto an elevator, when a crowd of
          wedding guests also start to pile in. Furious, he abandons
          the elevators for the nearest stairs.

          GUESTS spilling out of rooms met by the blaring alarm...

          Surveillance monitors show guests in the various hallways and
          stairwells rushing in confusion at all angles...

          Only the party 30 stories above remains oblivious: music
          still blasting, the upscale throngs still partying.

          INT. STAIRWELL

          Wyatt is bounding up the stairs, rounding the Fifth Floor -
          - when he hears the door overhead bang open, and like a tidal
          wave a flood of guests fill the stairwell.
          Wyatt presses against the crush of bodies, pushing his way up
          the stairwell.

          INT.                                                            9TH FLOOR - HALLWAY

          banged open by Jonathan's shoulder.
          The sound of the fire alarm is fainter up here as Jonathan
          races down the carpeted corridor, room numbers blurring past
          in sporadic fits                                                -                                      925...921...           918...   913...   910...
          Jonathan finally lurches to a halt before room 907.
          He takes out his key card, about to slide it in the slot --
          when a hand grabs his forearm! He spins in panic to --
          - a CLEANING WOMAN. She says something.in Vietnamese,
          indicating the ringing alarms.

          JONATHAN
          Fire, I know - I'll be out in a minute.
          The scared Cleaning Woman nods and hurries off as Jonathan
          quickly slides the key in the slot. The light blinks green.
          He jerks the door handle and throws open the door to find -

          INT. ROOM 907

          - nothing. The room is freshly made up, no sign of life other
          than A PORNO FILM BLARING from the TV set on Pay-Per-View.
          Jonathan's heart is pounding - where is she? He searches
          every corner, the bathroom, the closets. Everywhere.
          The sterile room taunts him - the uncreased bedspread, the
          neat arrangement of the complimentary stationary, the
          incessant moaning coming from the porn on the TV set --
          Jonathan suddenly erupts, grips the TV and shoves it off its
          ledge. It hits the floor with a crash, and sudden silence.
          Jonathan rubs his brow, heaving in desperation -- when his
          eyes land on the sleek, dark piece on which the TV was

          CONTINUED:
          resting; it's a dense, rectangular block - only when Jonathan
          taps it, he realizes: it's hollow.
          He immediately seizes it, yanks it from the wall...
          And there she is, lying face down in a lifeless heap: "S".
          Panicked, Jonathan rushes to her, turns her over. She looks
          semi-conscious, hands and mouth duct-taped. Jonathan
          hurriedly removes the tape, gently shakes her, terrified by
          how lifeless she appears -
          - when her eyes widen, focus on his face. Before he can say
          anything, she throws her arms around his neck, presses her
          face to his chest.

          âS.,
          (whispers gratefully)
          You're alive.
          He's struck by these words, and nods, holding her face in his
          hands as he kisses her urgently and gratefully.

          JONATHAN
          What do you say we stick together from now
          on?

          JA S"
          I'd like that.

          INT. EMERGENCY STAIRWELL

          A rush of guests hurriedly descending the staircase, a
          seemingly endless stream of densely packed faces.
          Close on Wyatt jostled within the flow of the wealthy guests -
          as he's the only one heading up. He passes the 6th floor...

          INT.                                                             9TH FLOOR

          Jonathan and "S" hurrying down the hall - Jonathan torn
          between a choice of two stairwells. His eyes dart from one to
          another                                                          - he finally gambles on the one to the right.

          INT. EMERGENCY STAIRWELL

          Wyatt forcing his way upstream with menacing determination;
          his gaze is wilder, more and more irritated by the descending
          mob of successful, well-dressed guests he's pushing against --
          - when he halts, peering up through the railings' lozenge-
          shaped opening, past a collection of hands and profiles...
          .to Jonathan and "S" some three stories above.

          TIGHT ON WYATT. As yet unnoticed by Jonathan, he remains
          halted on a stair, bodies squeezing past him.
          TIGHTER ON HIS EYES. That predatory gleam.
          EVEN TIGHTER ON HIS GUN, tucked carefully at his side.
          CLOSE ON JONATHAN AND "S" three stories above, starting to
          descend -- when Jonathan notices the hint of disruption in the
          flow of bodies below.
          Immediately wary, he leans over the railing, but can't get a
          good look. He grips the railing, leans further over... and
          his eyes find Wyatt's staring right back up at him --

          JONATHAN
          He's down there! I saw him -

          11 SIP
          Oh God -

          JONATHAN
          Up - we've got to go up!
          Clutching her arm, Jonathan and "S" turn back up, against the
          flow of traffic. Stories above, less and less people are
          evacuating.
          ANGLE ON WYATT as he presses upward, his steely gaze even
          more rapacious.
          The crowd is thinning as Jonathan and "S" race upward as
          well.
          INSERT JONATHAN'S POV: a shaky, dizzying blur as they race
          higher and higher...
          INSERT WYATT'S POV: from below but gaining on them, Jonathan
          and "S". appearing and disappearing with each twist and turn
          of the staircase...
          CLOSE ON JONATHAN AND "S", desperately racing upwards...
          CLOSE ON WYATT bounding the stairs, footsteps echoing, the
          staircase now empty and quiet, save for the footfall of
          Jonathan and "S"                                                 - no more than three floors above Wyatt
          now...
          Wyatt slows his pace, leans into the railing, takes aim...
          CLOSE ON JONATHAN AND "S" still hurrying up - when a shot
          rings out, a jolting echo clanging through the stairwell, the

          - when a second shot rings out, the bullet punching a dent
          into the underside of the stairs just overhead.
          ON WYATT, realizing he needs a cleaner shot, taking the
          stairs even harder in pursuit, all merciless intensity.

          EXT. HOTEL ROOFTOP - MOMENTS LATER

          The party is still at full throttle. Apparently no one has
          yet told them of the alarms.
          CLOSE ON A STAIRWELL DOOR MARKED "EMERGENCY EXIT" as it
          suddenly bangs open and Jonathan and "S" spill out.
          They pause a moment - thrown by the sight of all the wealthy,
          beautiful faces, laughing, dancing.

          JONATHAN
          Come on!
          She grabs his hand, and they waste no time disappearing into
          the mass of bodies.
          They keep moving. Shoulder to shoulder within the swell of
          partiers, they fit right in - instantly anonymous                - though
          not as smartly attired.
          BACK TO THE STAIRWELL DOOR as Wyatt enters the party,
          scanning the dense crowd, all senses alert.
          INSERT WYATT'S POV: just a mass of successful, attractive,
          partying young men and women. There's no way to pick Jonathan
          and "S" out.
          Wyatt's smirk fades to an icy glare as he stalks the
          periphery.
          WITHIN THE CROWD "S" clutches Jonathan's hand, their heads
          ducked low as they press forward...
          CLOSE ON WYATT, frustration gnashing at him as he quickens
          his pace, the idiotic enthusiasm of the crowd enraging him,
          sweat beading on his face                                        --
          -- when suddenly the music stops. Wyatt frowns., eyes darting.

          The crowd noise resumes, as the throngs begrudgingly start
          for the exits.
          ON JONATHAN AND "S," doing their best to stay concealed
          within the exiting crowd.
          Angle on Wyatt pushing his way through the crush, shoving
          people aside, trying to find them -
          - when he suddenly stops. He has an idea. He takes out his
          cell phone.
          BACK TO JONATHAN AND "5" within the crowd -
          - when Jonathan's cell phone RINGS.
          CLOSE ON JONATHAN as his eyes widen in panic.
          RING... He quickly fumbles for it, tries to turn it off        -
          - but it's too late... WHIP ACROSS THE CROWD to Wyatt,
          grinning wider. He's spotted them. In an instant he is bee-
          lining through the packed suits.
          WIDE SHOT OF THE ROOFTOP as the throngs are clearing out.
          Jonathan grabs "S" as they duck, racing across the dark,
          rooftop, looking for a place to hide.
          They take cover behind a large venting duct near the ledge -
          gasping to catch their breath... Stepping back, "S's" foot
          clinks against something: a stray iron railing post.
          She reaches. down for it, starts to lift it -
          - when Wyatt's hand darts in and grasps the other end.
          She looks up in terror - when Wyatt punches her violently,
          knocking her to the ground.
          Jonathan rushes to her - only to be blocked by Wyatt,
          gripping the iron rod tight.

          WYATT
          Nice try back there, Jonathan. Looks like
          you picked up a thing or two from me.
          Jonathan tries to strike him - when with a lightning quick
          movement Wyatt whips the iron rod through the air, cracking
          Jonathan across the face.

          racquet, steps into position                                   -
          - and brings the rod down on Jonathan with ruthless tennis
          strokes: Backhand! Bam! Forehand! Bam! Slice! Bam!
          Jonathan can barely peer up, bloody and beaten. He hears
          Wyatt drop the iron rod...

          swoops in on us

          yanks him back to the roof's concrete ledge. Jonathan fights
          to struggle free - when Wyatt jams the gun under his chin.
          Jonathan freezes.

          They'll... catch... you...

          WYATT
          Me? No - no, I'm just a face in the crowd.
          I'm a tourist, just passing through.
          JONATHAN'S POV: Wyatt's face presses closer, now almost in
          focus as he presses Jonathan's torso back over the ledge -

          WYATT
          As for you, you had your fun...
          Wyatt presses closer, crushing Jonathan's back to the edge.

          WYATT
          Now we're going to go back down...

          fingers fumbling for the cell phone                            (Jonathan's old phone).

          WYATT
          We're going to get that laptop...

          - to find she's right beside him, grateful tears in her eye.

          We travel through the confusion until we find JONATHAN AND
          "S" sitting side by side on the sidewalk curb, each propped
          against the other.
          The 'shock of it all is beginning to fade. He reaches into his
          pocket and hands her 'Duck on Bike'.

          and whispers the answer in his ear. Jonathan gazes at her a
          moment - whatever her name is, it must be perfect.

          So what now?
          She smiles up at him.

          Yes. I'm free.

          the window itself now a frame, letter-boxing the scene,
          people passing like fish in their tank... except for Jonathan
          and S, seated center-frame, two small figures side by side,
          face to face, talking intimately as we.

          FADE OUT.

                                      SHOOTING DRAFT

                

               EXT. CLEVELAND STREET - NIGHT (1970)

               Rain. Christmas lights. A rusted out '56 Lincoln rattles 
               down the bleak boulevard. In it: JOE STEVENS, an angry, black 
               man in his late 20's, beside him his 10-year-old son, JOE 
               JR.

               Joe Jr. stares out the window at passing: boarded buildings, 
               whores with raincoats over their heads trying to flag down a 
               john, a black Santa, a knot of drinkers. Breaking the silence:

                                     JOE STEVENS
                         Your mother okay?

                                     JOE JR.
                         Yes, sir.

               They stop at a light. Joe Stevens tries to furtively snort a 
               little something. He spots Joe Jr. watching.

                                     JOE STEVENS
                              (firm, without irony)
                         Don't you do this shit, boy. Don't 
                         you ever fuckin' touch it, you hear 
                         me?

               Joe Jr. stares, silent; Joe Jr.'s about to hit him.

                                     JOE STEVENS
                              (continuing)
                         You hear me, goddam it?

               The boy nods. Satisfied, Joe Sr. draws in the stuff. It makes 
               him feel good, strong, worried and determined all at once.

                                     JOE STEVENS
                              (continuing; charged 
                              up)
                         What do you want for Christmas?

                                     JOE JR.
                         I don't know.

                                     JOE STEVENS
                              (light changes; he 
                              accelerates)
                         You don't know?? You gotta know what 
                         you want, boy, if you ever expect to 
                         get it.

               A sudden charm to his bravado. Joe Jr. smiles uncertainly. 
               Joe Sr. grins back, pulls up in front of a liquor store.

                                     JOE STEVENS
                              (continuing)
                         Wait here. This won't take a minute.

               Joe Jr. doesn't notice or doesn't remark that his father, 
               just before entering the store, draws a handgun from beneath 
               his coat.

               The boy gazes dreamily at the street. The lunatic Black Santa 
               marches by, ranting to himself ("Then the white man say..."). 
               The RAIN HAMMERS on the roof and windshield. Joe Jr. breathes 
               on the glass, fogging the scene.

               From the store: MUFFLED GUNFIRE.

               Joe Jr. looks that way. Another GUNSHOT, then:

               His father comes out the door clutching money in one hand. 
               He strides toward the car with a reckless pride. He doesn't 
               notice:

               The liquor store door opens behind him.

               A SHOTGUN BLAST. Joe Stevens' guts splatter onto the car 
               windshield. A look of terrible amazement; he sinks to his 
               knees.

                                     JOE JR.
                         Daddy!!

               He jumps from the car, kneels by his father.

               The STORE OWNER (47, Slavic) drags the gun toward them, 
               bleeding profusely.

                                     STORE OWNER
                              (enraged, almost to 
                              tears)
                         Fuckin' niggers... fuckin' niggers...

               JOE STEVENS

               looks at the money in his hand: two 20's, two 5's.

                                     JOE STEVENS
                         Fifty bucks... fifty goddam bucks.
                              (looks up at his son)
                         I'm sorry...

               He stuffs the blood-soaked bills in the boy's shirt pocket 
               and dies. Joe Jr. looks up at...

               THE STORE OWNER

               Bloody, nearly unconscious, he aims the shotgun at the boy 
               who is too frightened to move.

                                     JOE JR.
                         Please, Mister...

               The man dies on his feet. As he falls backward, he pulls the 
               trigger, the BLAST shattering the car windows.

               Cop cars SQUEAL up. Uniformed cops leap out, guns drawn, 
               survey the scene. Then one notices Joe Jr., staring motionless 
               at his father and the store owner, dead together. ON HIS 
               EYES:

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               THOSE SAME EYES

               -- but older, harder, colder. They're concentrating on a 
               paper before him.

               TITLE: 17 YEARS LATER

               CLOSEUP - THE MINNESOTA MULTIPHASIC PERSONALITY INVENTORY

               Hundreds of TRUE/FALSE questions...

               1.) I have never indulged in any unusual sexual practices. 
               (T/F)

               2.) I have often felt that strangers were looking at me 
               critically. (T/F)

               3.) When I was young I occasionally stole things. (T/F)

               Joe Stevens marks these TRUE, FALSE, FALSE then comes to:

               4.) A person's station in life is at least partially 
               determined by his race. (T/F) We are:

               INT. A ROOM - DAY

               Thirty-seven Black Cleveland police officers (many in uniform, 
               including Joe) are taking the MMPI. Some roll their eyes at 
               the questions. Some try to copy answers. Others, like Joe, 
               work with rapid concentration.

               But he gets stuck on #4. Marks it false. Erases it. Marks it 
               true. Erases that. Ponders. Goes on to: #5. At times I hear 
               so well it bothers me. (T/F) He marks that true.

               INT. INTERVIEW ROOM - DAY

               GERALD CARVER, 36, an ambitious government lawyer with a 
               relaxed, vaguely hip manner, looks over the file of the 
               ingratiating BLACK OFFICER sitting across the desk from him.

                                     CARVER
                         Officer Leland? You know the 
                         difference between a black man and 
                         nigger?

               Leland is startled, insulted, but doesn't want to blow the 
               interview. He smiles weakly, shakes his head no.

                                     CARVER
                              (continuing; pleasant 
                              smile)
                         Yeah, most niggers don't.

               Stung, Leland tries to laugh. Carver puts his file aside, 
               picks up another.

                                     CARVER
                              (continuing)
                         Nice to meet you.

               INT. SAME - ANOTHER INTERVIEW

               A SECOND BLACK OFFICER is powerfully built, politically 
               conscious, takes no shit. Carver's leafing through his file.

                                     CARVER
                         So, Winston, what's the difference 
                         between a black man and a nigger?

               Winston is out of his chair before the question is finished, 
               drags Carver by the shirt front halfway across the desk and 
               hisses into his face:

                                     WINSTON
                         Who the fuck do you think you're 
                         talking to?

               Carver smiles cheerfully past Winston's cocked fist.

                                     CARVER
                         Thanks for coming in.

               Nonplussed by this cool dismissal, Winston stalks out. Carver 
               picks up the next file, unfazed.

               INT. SAME - ANOTHER INTERVIEW

               Joe Stevens watches Carver reading his file and waiting for 
               an answer. When none is forthcoming, Carver glances up, finds 
               Stevens looking right back at him.

                                     STEVENS
                         The nigger's the one who falls for 
                         your bullshit.

               He says it pleasantly, without belligerence. Carver smiles: 
               he's found his man. He offers his hand.

                                     CARVER
                         Gerald Carver, United States District 
                         Attorney. Call me Gerry.

               INT. A DARKENED ROOM - DAY/NIGHT

               ON A TV SCREEN: a grainy black-and-white tape, date and time 
               stamped at the bottom. A grungy street, palm trees. The light 
               from the monitor dimly illuminates Carver and Stevens.

               On SCREEN the CAMERA finds: A MAN in jeans, sneakers and 
               sweatshirt on a street corner.

                                     STEVENS
                         He ought to be wearing a sign.

                                     CARVER
                         You can tell he's a cop?

               Stevens laughs: it's obvious.

               A real DRUG DEALER joins the cop. UNDERCOVER COP: "You got 
               it?" DEALER: "In the motel, right over here..." The Cop's 
               uneasy, keeps glancing back toward the CAMERA as they go.

                                     STEVENS
                         He keeps looking for his back-up. 
                         Now, the other guy knows it, too.

                                     CARVER
                         Then why's he taking him to the room?

                                     STEVENS
                              (why else?)
                         To rip him off.

               Carver studies Stevens in the darkness, impressed.

               ON SCREEN: The figures disappear into the motel. We hear 
               their voices. DEALER: "Here, try some of it." UNDERCOVER 
               COP: "Uhh... No, I don't..." DEALER: "Why not, you 
               sonofabitch?" Two bursts of SOUND DISTORTION.

               A plainclothes cop, TAFT, (black, stocky, powerful) bolts 
               from behind the CAMERA, sprints toward the motel. The CAMERA 
               wobbles after him.

                                     STEVENS
                              (continuing)
                         Too late.

               ON SCREEN: The CAMERA (jerky, hand-held) nears the open motel 
               door. Taft is bent over the Undercover Cop's body.

                                     TAFT
                         Oh, Bobby... Jesus, Jesus...
                              (to the CAMERA)
                         Get an ambulance -- and back up. 
                         Now!

               He slams the wall, starts past the CAMERA. Carver pushes the 
               pause button; the tape freezes on a jerky image of Taft's 
               face.

                                     STEVENS
                              (focussed on Taft)
                         Who is he?

                                     CARVER
                         Charles Taft. LAPD Narcotics.

                                     STEVENS
                         He's a good cop.

                                     CARVER
                         He's a great cop. Two [names citation] 
                         and a [another citation]. As tough 
                         as they come and twice as honest.

               Carver watches Stevens watch Taft, smiles at something.

                                     STEVENS
                         But the cops aren't getting it done 
                         here, are they? Gotta try something 
                         new...

               He opens a manila envelope, dumps the contents on the desk: 
               driver's license, social security card, high school 
               transcript, prison records... all in the name of William G. 
               Hull. No photos.

                                     STEVENS
                              (continuing)
                         Who's John Hull?

                                     CARVER
                         You are. If you want to be.
                              (off Stevens)
                         Most undercover guys don't know what 
                         they're doing because it's a day 
                         gig.
                              (indicates dead cop 
                              on TV)
                         I need somebody who goes under and 
                         stays there; six months, a year, 
                         five years...

                                     STEVENS
                         What does he have to do?

                                     CARVER
                         Buy drugs. Sell drugs. Feed me 
                         information.

                                     STEVENS
                         He's a snitch.

                                     CARVER
                         He's a drug dealer. A criminal. A 
                         scumbag. But for the right side.
                              (beat)
                         I want you to come to Los Angeles on 
                         loan to the Justice Department as a 
                         federal agent. Your experience there 
                         will be credited toward your seniority 
                         here. And you'll come back to 
                         Cleveland a P3 or higher.

                                     STEVENS
                              (uncomfortable)
                         I can't do that. I've got a wife and 
                         kids.

                                     CARVER
                         You're separated from your wife, 
                         she's filled for divorce. You see 
                         your kids every other weekend.

               Stevens takes a breath: this is awkward to explain.

                                     STEVENS
                              (almost a confession)
                         All my life I've stayed away from 
                         that stuff. I've never touched drugs.

                                     CARVER
                              (tolerant)
                         Come on, a little grass...?

                                     STEVENS
                         Not grass. Not nothing. I never even 
                         had a drink.
                              (his motto)
                         Never have, never will. You don't 
                         understand. I made a choice in my 
                         life.

                                     CARVER
                         What's to understand? You saw your 
                         father killed when you were ten, and 
                         you decided you wouldn't be like 
                         that.
                              (off Stevens' surprise, 
                              Carver grins)
                         I'm God, I know everything. You wanted 
                         to be a good boy, so you became a 
                         cop. Hiding out in uniform... That's 
                         why you got the hard-on for Taft.

                                     STEVENS
                         It's not that simple.

                                     CARVER
                              (opening Joe's file; 
                              as if reluctantly)
                         I'll tell the truth, Joe. You're 
                         never going to be a Taft.

                                     STEVENS
                         I don't believe that.

               But he does.

                                     CARVER
                              (looks at MMPI results)
                         You ever take a look at your 
                         psychological profile? You score 
                         almost like a criminal.
                              (reading)
                         "Resents authority..."

                                     STEVENS
                         I do not.

                                     CARVER
                         "...Exaggerated moral standards, but 
                         with no underlying value system." 
                         Look at the anger, the repressed 
                         violence, it's almost off the scale...

                                     STEVENS
                         Let me see that...

               Carver hands him the scores which are, of course, just 
               clusters of numbers. Stevens is upset, though oddly 
               unsurprised, as if this only confirmed his secret fears.

                                     CARVER
                         Why'd you join the force?

                                     STEVENS
                              (awkward, but felt)
                         I wanted to be of use.

                                     CARVER
                         Well, now you can be. You won't be 
                         Taft, but maybe you'll be something 
                         more... interesting.
                              (sits back)
                         There's a man named Ramon Gallegos 
                         who supplies 60% of the cocaine to 
                         the West Coast. He's smart, smooth, 
                         and sufficiently elusive that we 
                         don't even have an adult photograph 
                         of him. However, his uncle is Hector 
                         Guzman, an important Latin American 
                         political figure. Gallegos uses 
                         Uncle's connections to get product 
                         into the country, and everyone we've 
                         sent after him has ended up like 
                         that...

                                     STEVENS
                         Why would I be different?

                                     CARVER
                         You already are, that's the point...
                              (indicates file, test

                         You've got the ability and the 
                         personality to go underground and 
                         blend in completely. That's what the 
                         others couldn't. Some part of them 
                         showed. That's why they're dead. 
                         See, there's only one rule in this 
                         game.

               Stevens raises his eyebrows: what?

                                     CARVER
                              (continuing)
                         Don't blow your cover.

               EXT. WORKING CLASS CLEVELAND NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY

               Stevens parks outside a small, well-maintained house. As he 
               gets out, he spots a GROUP OF KIDS (black and Hispanic) 
               playing down the street. He's not pleased about that.

                                     STEVENS
                              (calls to them)
                         Joe-J, Carmen...

               A BOY, 7, and a GIRL, 5, (both light-skinned) run to him 
               shouting, "Daddy," jump into his arms, competing for 
               attention, as if they haven't seen him in ages.

                                     STEVENS
                         What were you doing with those kids?

                                     JOE-J & CARMEN
                         Playing...

                                     STEVENS
                              (displeased)
                         Your mom lets you play with them?

                                     JOE-J & CARMEN
                         Yes, sir... Yes, sir.

               His strictness has already sobered their enthusiasm. Sensing 
               this, he attempts to embrace them which he can do only 
               awkwardly.

               Meanwhile, his wife, TERRY (Southern white) has come out the 
               screen door. She and Stevens bristle at each other.

                                     STEVENS
                         I thought we talked about this. The 
                         older brother up there's got a sheet 
                         with --

                                     TERRY
                         Lay off it. They're just kids...

               Both are ready to fight, but restrain themselves. A big 
               Polynesian, TITO comes out the door.

                                     TITO
                         Hey, Joe.

                                     STEVENS
                         Tito...

               A moment of surprise, then he gets it. He looks to Terry. 
               She gives a little shrug, refusing to be embarrassed.

               INT. KITCHEN - FIVE MINUTES LATER

               Stevens is trying to seem interested in Carmen's little 
               drawings.

                                     STEVENS
                         They're real nice, honey. Is that a 
                         horse?

                                     CARMEN
                              (exasperated)
                         Daddy! It's a bunny...

               She puts her arms around him.

                                     CARMEN
                              (continuing)
                         I don't want you to go away, Daddy.

                                     STEVENS
                         It's my work. I've got to.

               Over her shoulder he sees Terry sitting with a subdued Joe-
               J. Her face seems to say, "See, I told you..." Avoiding this 
               accusation, Stevens notices a bruise on Carmen's arm.

                                     STEVENS
                              (continuing)
                         What happened to you there, baby?

                                     CARMEN
                         Tito did it.

                                     STEVENS
                              (instantly outraged)
                         He hit you?!
                              (up in a fury)
                         God damn it, what's he doing touching 
                         her? I'm gonna...

               Terry intercepts him on his way out of the room.

                                     TERRY
                         She was running behind his chair 
                         when he got up. It was an accident.
                              (he's uncertain)
                         A complete... total... accident.

               Stevens looks at Carmen who giggles. He's humiliated by his 
               own temper, attempts to calm himself. Terry puts a sympathetic 
               hand on his shoulder.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               EXT. LOS ANGELES - AERIAL SHOT - DAY

               The immense sprawl, the arterial flow of the freeways, the 
               blinding light. We DESCEND...

               INT. TRAIN STATION - UNDERGROUND - DAY OR NIGHT

               People getting off, among them the former Joe Stevens, now 
               known as JOHN HULL. He's carrying a suitcase.

               INT. TRAIN STATION/EXT. STREET - DAY

               Hull goes up the stairs onto a downtown street.

               EXT. ANOTHER STREET - DAY

               South L.A. neighborhood. A 13-year-old BLACK YOUTH selling 
               drugs through a car window. Hull walks by. He's at ease, 
               looking around, his manner subtly announcing that he belongs 
               here, just as in the train station he seemed to belong among 
               the commuters.

               EXT. TRANSIENT MOTEL - COURTYARD - DAY

               A fat BLONDE WOMAN (61, large white glasses, tiny shoes) 
               leads Hull down a corridor.

                                     BLONDE WOMAN
                         Television mostly. I was on "Sky 
                         King" twice, "Ramar of the Jungle." 
                         That was a silly show. The jungle 
                         was mostly flats...

               They pass an open door where a 6-year-old boy, JAMES, a 
               latchkey, sits on the stoop playing Gameboy; inside, his 
               mother, BELINDA, a broken down whore, is doing her nails and 
               drinking Pepsi. She looks up, bats her lashes at Hull.

                                     BLONDE WOMAN
                              (continuing)
                         You want my advice, I'd stay away 
                         from that bitch.

               She opens the door to the room across the hall. A dump. Hull 
               walks in, drops his duffle: he'll take it. The Blonde lounges 
               in the doorway. He closes the door.

               INT. ROOM - DAY

               Hull empties his pockets on the dresser. Looks at his money, 
               room key, identification. Looks at himself in the mirror. He 
               touches his clothes, his face, tries on different expressions.

               (NOTE: Throughout the film, Hull continually checks himself 
               out in mirrors, both to adjust his appearance to the 
               circumstances and as if in an attempt to recall who he 
               "really" is.)

               EXT. 79TH AND FIGUEROA - TWILIGHT

               On the seam between South-Central and USC. Lots of people 
               out: children, students, dealers, whores. Hull with a new 
               haircut.

               EXT. ANOTHER, SIMILAR CORNER - DAY

               Dealers (most in mid-teens) meeting cars, making transactions. 
               All this casually observed. EDDIE comes up the street, 
               reciting his version of an old street toast.

                                     EDDIE
                         On the day of the King's castration, 
                         all the counts and no accounts were 
                         down on the deck with Georgia Tech 
                         taking turns in the back seat...

               Those dealers not at car windows, gather around. He never 
               speaks to them, goes on declaiming as he exchanges drugs for 
               money.

               Hull watches, talking to another street person. His appearance 
               continues to change: clothes, posture, walk, gestures subtly 
               conform to the environment, a bit like Zelig. Throughout the 
               film his appearance shifts, depending on who he's with. We 
               always recognize him, but each time he's different.

               He walks up to a dealer, makes a quick buy and keeps going. 
               But he sees them and is seen.

               INT. AN OFFICE - NIGHT

               Hull drops eleven foil balls on a green blotter. Carver counts 
               out money for him.

               INT. HULL'S MOTEL ROOM - DAY

               He sits at the window, eating a burrito, watching little 
               James play in the courtyard.

               EXT. STREET - EVENING

               Hull approaches another Dealer, the 13-year-old seen earlier 
               (angelic face). Like Hull, he's trying to act tough.

                                     HULL
                         Whatta you got?

                                     13-YEAR-OLD DEALER
                              (voice just changing)
                         Nickel rock, dime rock. Excellent 
                         shit.

               Hull exchanges a folded twenty for two foil balls. He walks 
               off. He has gone twenty feet when...

               RED RANGE ROVER

               SQUEALS to a stop opposite the Dealer.

               A huge young black man, IVY (23, all in red with a red 
               headband), leans out the passenger window, shouting at the 
               13-year-old.

                                     IVY
                         What the fuck I tell you about being 
                         here?

               Everyone turns to look, but Hull's view is blocked.

                                     13-YEAR-OLD DEALER (O.S.)
                         No, wait...

                                     IVY (O.S.)
                         Too fuckin' late.

               POPPING noises. Ivy is waving an automatic weapon. Everyone 
               on the street but Hull has hit the ground.

                                     IVY
                              (enjoying it, shouting)
                         Get down, motherfuckers!

               Ivy laughs and fondles a girlfriend as the car ROARS off. He 
               sees Hull, pretends to fire, laughs as Hull, too, ducks. 
               When Ivy's gone, he runs to where a CROWD has gathered 
               around...

               THE 13-YEAR-OLD

               lying in the street, a bullet hole in his head, eyes open. 
               He twitches and kicks, blood pulsing from the neat wound. 
               Then he's dead. The faces around him (young, old, many races) 
               watch with a variety of emotions.

                                     CROWD
                         Who is he?... Why'd they shoot him?... 
                         Ivy did him, man... He's in the wrong 
                         fuckin' place... That poor boy... 
                         Get his beeper...

               Cops push through to the body. As the crowd disperses, Hull 
               can't take his eyes off the boy. When he finally does, he 
               sees Eddie, drink in hand. Their eyes meet, and Eddie, a 
               rapper, raises his eyebrows in brief acknowledgment of sorrow.

                                     EDDIE
                              (sadly)
                         He done done, ain't he?

               EXT. LEWAZZ - NIGHT

               TITLE: TWO WEEKS LATER

               A bar with a neon bird for a sign. Hull enters.

               INT. LEWAZZ - NIGHT

               A racial mix. Hull takes a seat at the bar. Stuffed birds 
               line the lintel above the bottles. A female BARTENDER (long 
               red nails) greets him familiarly.

                                     BARTENDER
                         How's it going, John?

                                     HULL
                         I'm in there.

               Without being asked, she sets him up a Dry Sack with a long 
               red straw. (NOTE: He never touches the drink.) Hull's 
               appearance has continued to change. His clothes have become 
               flashier, he has an earring, the start of a goatee.

               Eddie approaches the bar compulsively reciting one of his 
               toasts.

                                     EDDIE
                              (to himself)
                         "Where's the Queen," said the King. 
                         "She's in bed with laryngitis." "Is 
                         that bastard still in town?... Fuck 
                         the Queen," said the King, and ten 
                         thousand knights straaaained at their 
                         utmost...
                              (to the bartender)
                         Pina colada times two and a white 
                         wine.

               He goes on muttering under his breath, tapping his foot like 
               any crankhead. He notices Hull, greets him as someone he 
               can't place but knows he's seen around.

                                     EDDIE
                              (continuing)
                         How you doin', Dudley...

               Tries to remember name.

                                     HULL
                         John.

                                     EDDIE
                         John, man, right...

               Clasp hands. Eddie takes his drinks, carries them to...

               A TABLE

               where he rejoins a white man, DAVID ELIAS (30s, slick, 
               powerful) and a well-dressed BLACK WOMAN (mid-20s, good-
               looking). She gets the wine.

               Elias rises to let her out. As the woman passes Hull on her 
               way to the restrooms, their eyes meet: an instant of perfect 
               chemistry. He's struck. Her features open, grow sensual for 
               a moment, but then, as if seeing something she doesn't like, 
               her eyes flick away, and she walks by as if he weren't there.

               INT. CARVER'S OFFICE - NIGHT

               (NOTE: Hull invariably meets Carver in this anonymous room, 
               distinguished only by the green blotter and a view of the 
               city. This simple regularity suggest visits to a psychiatrist, 
               Carver probing, testing, teasing, trying to draw Hull out. 
               And they feel like therapy, at once a respite and a torment.)

               More foil balls on the blotter beside boxes of 3x5 
               photographs. Photos of Eddie and David Elias are up on a 
               corkboard, the beginning of a pyramid.

                                     HULL
                         Eddie something... a motormouth... 
                         he supplies the street dealers... 
                         buys from him...
                              (reads name on back 
                              of photo)
                         David Elias... who apparently buys 
                         from a guy named Barbolla or 
                         something. But I haven't seen him.

               Carver produces a photo of a handsome Latin in his 50s, pins 
               it on the board above Elias.

                                     CARVER
                         Barbosa, Felix.

                                     HULL
                         There was also a woman, but she's 
                         not here.
                              (as Carver reaches in 
                              a drawer)
                         I saw a kid killed. Twelve, thirteen 
                         at the most. Turf war.

               Carver shrugs: these things happen. He hands Hull a lot of 
               cash, much more than expected. Hull does understand.

                                     CARVER
                         Get to Elias. Then to Barbosa.

                                     HULL
                         You can't rush this stuff.

                                     CARVER
                         Rush it, please. I want art, John, 
                         not reality. Budget hearings start 
                         in April, and I need Gallegos by 
                         then. They won't give us funding for 
                         three ounce buys.

                                     HULL
                         We're not just doing this for the 
                         funding, are we?

                                     CARVER
                         Without funding, we aren't doing it 
                         at all.

               TITLE: TWO WEEKS LATER

               INT. CRACK HOUSE - DAY

               Virtual darkness save splinters of light between the curtains. 
               Pipes burn here and there in the gloom. Ten or fifteen 
               crackheads huddle around a battery-operated TV on which Tom 
               Brokaw is narrating an NBC documentary on drugs. A 12-year-
               old sits against a wall too stoned even for television.

               Hull approaches Eddie, regally installed on an automobile 
               bench seat-cum-sofa, a lit pipe in one hand. We barely notice 
               the redhead kneeling between his legs, face buried in his 
               crotch. He greets Hull from wrecked bliss. They know each 
               other now.

                                     EDDIE
                         My man, Dudley, he's so fud-ley...

               Hull greets Eddie, some of the others, drops familiarly onto 
               an adjacent auto seat. The patrons are making fun of Brokaw, 
               laughing, exchanging fives.

                                     HULL
                         Eddie, man, I need...

               Eddie holds up a hand telling Hull to wait. His mind is 
               elsewhere. His features contract in brief concentration.

                                     CHORUS OF COMMENTS
                         Whatever happened to that Drug Czar 
                         motherfucker?... He gave up 'cause 
                         he finally realized he didn't know 
                         nothing about any of that shit...

               More laughter, etc. Eddie's concentration peaks, breaks off 
               into a sigh and a smile.

               Eddie sings a satisfied little song...

               The redhead rises from Eddie's crotch, and we see it's a 
               boy, seventeen going on death; he might have been pretty a 
               year ago.

               Eddie passes him the crack pipe, lets him suck greedily for 
               a few seconds before ripping it out of his scabrous mouth 
               and offering it to Hull, who, with a grimace that gets laughs, 
               declines. The others continue to watch and comment on the 
               speech.

                                     EDDIE
                         So what is it you need so bad, blood? 
                         Need, need, need??

                                     HULL
                         A whole K, quick as you can get it.

                                     EDDIE
                              (impressed, a trace 
                              of envy)
                         Comin' in the world, Dudley.

                                     HULL
                              (winning grin)
                         All because of my man...

               Eddie likes that, holds out a hand. Hull hits it.

                                     EDDIE
                         Give me a day.

               Hull nods, rises.

                                     EDDIE
                              (continuing)
                         Stick around, let the bitch Hoover 
                         you, too.

               Indicating redhead.

               In all these scenes, Hull acts indifferent to the horror, 
               but here the effort costs him. He masters his disgust with a 
               joke.

                                     HULL
                         Only if you Clorox him first.

               Everyone laughs, even the boy.

               EXT. STREET - NIGHT

               Eddie comes out the back door of a building, is immediately 
               collared by Taft (the cop on the videotape). He's in his mid-
               40s, stocky, balding.

                                     TAFT
                              (cheerful, gregarious)
                         Eddie Shitface! Where you been, boy?

               Eddie breaks free, runs three feet before HERNANDEZ (a 
               muscular Mexican) knees him in the groin. Eddie crumples.

                                     TAFT
                              (continuing)
                         Eddie, I don't think I introduced 
                         you to my new partner, Michael 
                         Hernandez...

                                     HERNANDEZ
                         Pleased to meet you, Mr. Shitface...

               EXT. STREET - NIGHT

               Eddie folded over his wounded nuts. Hernandez and Taft sit 
               on crates to either side. The drugs they've taken from him 
               are neatly arranged on a garbage can lid.

                                     HERNANDEZ
                         You have the right to remain silent... 
                         You have the right to an attorney... 
                         You have the right to go back to 
                         Ontario for eight-to-ten on a second 
                         offense...

                                     EDDIE
                              (in several kinds of 
                              pain)
                         Oh, man, I can't go back in there, I 
                         just can't.

                                     TAFT
                              (soothing)
                         'Course you can't, child, 'course 
                         you can't. That's why you're gonna 
                         start giving us some help.

               EXT. DAVID ELIAS'S HOUSE - NIGHT

               A pleasant, Santa Monica neighborhood. Spanish style house.

               INT. ELIAS'S HOUSE - NIGHT

               Pleasant, tasteful. Elias's wife, NANCY, (dressed like the 
               attorney she is) sits in an alcove-study reading a real estate 
               contract through half-glasses. Elias himself is helping his 
               daughter, MIRANDA, 7, with her homework. He is 38, with the 
               body and bearing of a powerful man.

                                     ELIAS
                         Again. Three times four.

                                     MIRANDA
                         Seven.

               Elias is not a sweet Daddy. It should make us uncomfortable 
               to watch him push his daughter.

                                     ELIAS
                         No. You're adding again, you have to 
                         multiply. Three and four is seven. 
                         Three times four is...

                                     MIRANDA
                         Twelve.

                                     ELIAS
                         Three times five.

               The DOORBELL.

                                     NANCY
                         Can you get that?

                                     MIRANDA
                         Eight.

                                     ELIAS
                              (getting up; more 
                              about the answer 
                              than the door)
                         Damn it.

                                     MIRANDA
                         Why can't I just use a calculator?

               INT./EXT. FRONT DOOR - NIGHT

               Three men: FELIX BARBOSA (whose photo we saw in Carver's 
               office). Barbosa is a veteran of the coke business, but he's 
               doing too much of the drug now; he's sweating, paranoid, 
               unstable. With him is GOPHER, early 60s, a wizened high-voiced 
               old con who Barbosa keeps the way Spanish kings kept dwarfs, 
               for amusement and luck; like the court jester, Gopher can 
               say anything he wants without fear. Behind them is an Hispanic 
               kid, CHINO, 17, a thug.

               Elias knows them all, but is not happy to see them at his 
               door.

                                     ELIAS
                         What are you doing here?

                                     BARBOSA
                         We've got a problem, David.

                                     ELIAS
                         Call me on the phone.

                                     BARBOSA
                         Your friend Eddie just started bending 
                         over for the cops.

               This is very bad news. Elias murmurs a shaken, "Shit..." and 
               steps outside, half-closing the door behind him.

                                     BARBOSA
                              (continuing)
                         They busted him, and he's dealing to 
                         save his ass.

                                     GOPHER
                         Which is how he'll lose the skinny 
                         little thing.

                                     ELIAS
                         Did he give us up?

                                     BARBOSA
                         Not yet, but he will if he has to, 
                         and eventually he'll have to.

                                     MIRANDA (O.S.)
                         Daddy! I thought we were doing my 
                         homework.

                                     ELIAS
                         I don't think he'd talk about us. 
                         He'd try not to.

                                     BARBOSA
                         If we whack him, he definitely won't.

                                     MIRANDA (O.S.)
                         Daddy!!

                                     ELIAS
                              (to Miranda)
                         Just a second.
                              (to Barbosa)
                         Not yet. Let me check on this, first.

                                     BARBOSA
                              (taunting)
                         Nobody said you had to do the dirty 
                         work, David. I'll take care of --

                                     ELIAS
                         Felix, if he's a problem, we'll kill 
                         him. I'll kill him myself.

               He doesn't realize until it's too late that Nancy has just 
               then opened the front door to see where he went. They look 
               at each other, a terrible moment: she knows what he does, 
               hates it, can't bring herself to leave him, hates herself 
               for that.

                                     ELIAS
                              (continuing)
                         Nancy, get out of here.

                                     NANCY
                         For you; it's Eddie.

               She hands him a cordless phone, goes inside closing the door.

                                     BARBOSA
                         You got a tasty wife, David. No wonder 
                         you don't want us coming here.

                                     ELIAS
                              (warning him)
                         Don't talk about her that way.

               Barbosa laughs.

                                     GOPHER
                         He can't help it, David, it's his 
                         nature.

                                     ELIAS
                              (into phone, chipper)
                         Eddie... Sure, man, what do you need?

               INT. A BOXING GYM - NIGHT

               Elias joins Eddie and Hull to one side. In the b.g. two guys 
               sparring.

                                     EDDIE
                         David, this is John, John, David. 
                         Eddie, this is Eddie. Everybody ready?

                                     HULL
                              (to Elias)
                         So what's this, you want to meet me?

                                     ELIAS
                              (charming, touch of 
                              mockery)
                         I like to know the important 
                         customers.

               Hull makes a show of weary patience, gestures: here I am.

                                     ELIAS
                              (continuing)
                         You're taking a lot of weight for a 
                         guy we hardly know. Where're you 
                         moving this stuff, John? We haven't 
                         seen you around. We like to have a 
                         sense who your customers are.

                                     HULL
                         Ah, come on, man, do Macy's tell the 
                         Gimbel motherfuckers?

                                     ELIAS
                              (beat; watches him)
                         Eddie, forget this guy, he's a cop.

               He gets up, walks away.

               ON HULL

               He's blown it. He's been made. The crushing failure. He 
               rallies himself to indignation.

                                     HULL
                         What is this shit, Eddie? I thought 
                         you were the man.

               Eddie's sickened, wants to get paid, owes Taft a bust.

                                     EDDIE
                         Nobody's the fuckin' man. Go to your 
                         place. I'll call you.

               EXT. GYM/INT. A VAN - CONTINUOUS TIME

               Taft and Hernandez, watching the gym. Hull comes out, looks 
               up and down the street carefully. Taft sits up, pays 
               attention.

                                     TAFT
                         This is our collar?

               Hernandez grunts.

                                     TAFT
                              (continuing)
                         Who is he?

                                     HERNANDEZ
                         Some scumbag...

               But Taft clearly thinks there's something different about 
               Hull. He's not sure what, but it troubles him. (NOTE: Hull 
               makes a little move that Taft will later realize was a cop's 
               move. For now he can't quite place it.)

               EXT. PARKING LOT - CONTINUOUS TIME

               Eddie pleading his case to Elias.

                                     EDDIE
                         He's no cop, David. He's an animal. 
                         You see his eyes? You never see a 
                         cop with those eyes. I know this 
                         shit, man, you don't.

                                     ELIAS
                              (giving him an opening)
                         What's going on, Eddie?

                                     EDDIE
                         Twenty-six thousand cash is what. We 
                         need it, David. We're behind.

               Elias studies Eddie: is he a rat? Elias hopes not, but he's 
               going to find out. He hands a fat Federal Express envelope 
               through the window.

                                     ELIAS
                              (a warning)
                         I want him to get it all, Eddie.

               Eddie bows in gratitude, hurries off.

               EXT./INT. HULL'S MOTEL - NIGHT

               Hull's unlocking his door when Belinda, the hooker across 
               the hall, comes out to talk. Her 6-year-old, James, watches, 
               silent.

                                     BELINDA
                              (a crackhead)
                         Mr. Hull... Mr. Hull...

                                     HULL
                              (wearily)
                         What's happening, Belinda?

                                     BELINDA
                         Now you know, Mr. Hull, I was to the 
                         welfare this afternoon, but the bus, 
                         you know what I'm saying?... the one 
                         bus, and then the other, and when I 
                         got there they'd gone and changed 
                         the time on me, without notification. 
                         They's supposed to give notification, 
                         ain't they? They said I got a thing 
                         in the mail, but I don't remember, I 
                         don't think they sent it, so now I'm 
                         off the welfare, plus I forgot to 
                         take James for his shot... for the 
                         school? Which otherwise they let him 
                         go. And he's gotta learn, he's gotta 
                         learn, don't he, Mr. Hull, you tell 
                         him, so's he can better hisself.

               Hull slouches in the doorway, fingers to his eyes.

                                     HULL
                              (to James)
                         You had any food today, James?

                                     JAMES
                              (disclaiming any need)
                         I had Ding-Dongs.

                                     HULL
                              (sighs, gives him 
                              money)
                         You go to the Mexican place over 
                         there, and get the chicken tostada 
                         or the beef and bean burrito or both. 
                         And a milk.

                                     JAMES
                         I don't like milk. I want a --

                                     HULL
                              (an order)
                         You get the milk! And get something 
                         for your mother, too.
                              (to Belinda)
                         What do you want?

                                     BELINDA
                         Now, Mr. Hull, if you just --

                                     HULL
                              (to James)
                         Two tostadas, two burritos, two milks.

               Gives him another bill. The boy runs off.

                                     BELINDA
                         You now, I look out for my James 
                         best I can, Mr. Hull, but it's hard. 
                         Now you like the boy, don't you?

               Hull grunts.

                                     BELINDA
                              (continuing)
                         I know you do. And I was thinkin' if 
                         you wanted to take care of him, that 
                         might be good for him. Give him a 
                         male figure to look up to.

                                     HULL
                         Look, Belinda, I can't...

                                     BELINDA
                         If you could just give me something 
                         for him. Say five thousand dollars...
                              (off Hull's shock)
                         Or maybe four thousand. I couldn't 
                         give up my boy for less than four 
                         thousand...

               Hull is rescued from this horror by the ringing PAY PHONE. 
               He runs down the hall, grabs it.

                                     HULL
                         It's me. I'm here... Where?... five 
                         minutes.

               He dashes past Belinda into his room.

                                     BELINDA
                         Or you could just give me a part 
                         now...

               He closes the door, takes the money Carver gave him out from 
               behind the mirror, dashes back outside. As he rushes by:

                                     BELINDA
                              (continuing)
                         Let me do somethin' for you, Mr. 
                         Hull. Let me do a little somethin' 
                         for you.

               He keeps going. The Blonde Woman addresses Belinda.

                                     BLONDE WOMAN
                         No solicitin' in the halls. I told 
                         you that before.

                                     BELINDA
                              (spunkier than we've 
                              seen)
                         I ain't doin' shit. Bitch...

               EXT. TACO STAND - VENICE AND LA BREA - NIGHT

               A handful of customers under a mud sky. The THROB of a distant 
               helicopter. Hull pulls into the lot beside Eddie's BMW.

               He climbs into the BMW, tosses Eddie a brown envelope; money 
               spills onto his lap. Eddie does a quick count, produces the 
               Fed Ex envelope. The usual white stuff.

               Hull's about to taste when the chopper swoops in with a sudden 
               blinding overhead light. A BULLHORN booms down like the voice 
               of God.

                                     AMPLIFIED VOICE
                         This is the police. Remain inside 
                         the vehicle. Place your open hands 
                         against the windshield so that they 
                         are clearly visible...

                                     HULL
                         Christ...

                                     EDDIE
                              (a strategy)
                         Spread the floor, Dudley.
                              (rap sound effects 
                              with rhythmic head 
                              spasms)
                         A-ga, a-ga, a-ga, a-ga...

               Eddie starts the car, and Hull rolls out the passenger door 
               as the BMW races across the lot.

               Two black-and-whites and an unmarked converge on the stand.

               Hull can't reach his car. He vaults a metal rail and runs 
               off between two buildings.

               Hernandez jumps out of an unmarked and races after him. Taft 
               speeds the car out onto the street.

               HULL

               running. Police and SIRENS pursuing. He hurls the Fed Ex 
               envelope into a dumpster. HELICOPTER light sweeps over him.

               As he cuts around a building, Taft opens a car door right 
               into his face. Hull goes down hard.

                                     TAFT
                              (into car radio)
                         Thank you kindly...

               He waves at the helicopter which goes away, kneels over Hull 
               who is twitching spastically on the ground, gasping for air. 
               Hernandez arrives carrying the Fed Ex envelope.

                                     TAFT
                              (continuing)
                         How you doin', child?...

               Hull is astonished to look up and see Taft looming over him, 
               the man he remembers from the videotape. He tries to speak:

                                     HULL
                              (barely audible)
                         You...

                                     TAFT
                              (briefly puzzled)
                         Me? Of course, it's me. You know me?

               Hull shakes head, winces.

                                     TAFT
                              (continuing)
                         Hurts, huh?

               Hull tries to curse.

                                     TAFT
                              (continuing)
                         Here, I want to show you something. 
                         You have kids?

               He takes out his wallet, opens it to pictures of his two 
               children, a boy and a girl, seven and eight.

                                     TAFT
                              (continuing)
                         These are mine. Aren't they the most 
                         beautiful children you ever saw?

               Hull groans, twists in pain. Taft sticks the pictures in his 
               face. Hull is affected by the children despite everything.

                                     TAFT
                              (continuing)
                         Yeah, I know, they kind of leave you 
                         speechless. So let me ask, if someone 
                         put a gun to your baby's head, 
                         wouldn't you kill him if you could?

               Hull just looks up.

                                     TAFT
                              (continuing)
                         Me, too. And you're the bastard with 
                         the gun.

               He takes the Fed Ex envelope from him.

                                     HULL
                              (hoarse; his first 
                              words)
                         You know the difference between a 
                         nigger and a black man?

                                     TAFT
                         Don't jive me, boy.

                                     HULL
                         The nigger's the one covers Whitey's 
                         ass by puttin' the brothers in jail.

               Taft yanks him hard to his feet; Hull cries out in pain.

                                     TAFT
                         You ain't my brother.

               INT. COURTROOM - NIGHT

               Hull is led in with other handcuffed PRISONERS. Carver is 
               here, catches Hull's eye. Hull shakes his head; doesn't want 
               Carver to intercede. A woman PUBLIC DEFENDER (26, attractive, 
               harried) addresses the prisoners.

                                     PUBLIC DEFENDER
                         Hi, I'm Shelley Weissbrod. This is 
                         only an arraignment, a preliminary 
                         hearing, but if you don't have money 
                         for an attorney, the Public Defender's 
                         office can...

               Hull is listening to this when a BAILIFF taps his shoulder.

                                     BAILIFF
                         You've got counsel. Over there.

               Puzzled, Hull sees the back of a suit conferring with a 
               PROSECUTOR. The suit turns. It's DAVID ELIAS who smiles, 
               offers his hand. Hull is stunned. Elias enjoys that.

                                     HULL
                         You're a lawyer??

                                     ELIAS
                         I'm your lawyer.

                                     HULL
                         Who hired you?

                                     ELIAS
                              (smiles)
                         It's pro bono. If you don't want me, 
                         there's Shelley. She's good. She 
                         just can't provide special services...

                                     HULL
                         Like what?

                                     VOICE (O.S.)
                              (calling the next 
                              case)
                         John Hull...

                                     ELIAS
                         Getting your case called first.

               Elias addressing the court.

                                     ELIAS
                              (continuing)
                         Your Honor, I believe the preliminary 
                         police toxicology report will show 
                         that the substance seized from my 
                         client was Mannitol, a baby laxative. 
                         We move for immediate dismissal.

               Hull is surprised at this news. The Judge looks to the 
               Prosecutor who waives objection. Gavel.

                                     ELIAS
                              (continuing; to Hull)
                         We're out of here, Dude.

               As they walk toward the back, Taft approaches Hull. There's 
               already a deep pull between these two, and in Taft's presence, 
               Hull can't sustain the tough street act. We almost see the 
               little boy inside him.

                                     TAFT
                              (to Hull, amused)
                         Baby laxative, they sold you some 
                         bad shit.

                                     DRUNKEN PRISONER
                              (to Hull)
                         You have a constipated baby, and 
                         you're in jail? What kind of a father 
                         are you?

                                     TAFT
                         A father who don't know his own 
                         children, ain't that right?

               A long look between them, broken when Elias takes Hull's 
               arm, leads him away. Elias cheerfully greets a couple of 
               hookers waiting arraignment. Hull furtively grabs his sleeve.

                                     HULL
                              (under his breath)
                         You sold me Mannitol, motherfucker.

                                     ELIAS
                              (under his)
                         If it hadn't been, asshole, you'd be 
                         in jail right now... Come on, I want 
                         you to meet some people.

               EXT. LEWAZZ - NIGHT

               After hours. The place is closed. A couple of cars in the 
               lot. Elias's BMW pulls in.

               INT. LEWAZZ - NIGHT

               Deserted except for one table where Eddie, Barbosa, Gopher 
               and Chino are eating shrimp. They look up as Hull and Elias 
               approach. Eddie's astonished to see Hull.

                                     EDDIE
                         Dudley, Dudley, Fo-Fudley...

                                     ELIAS
                         Surprised to see him, Eddie?

               Eddie looks around, uneasy.

                         John got busted and kept his mouth 
                         shut. Can't say that for everybody, 
                         can we?

                                     EDDIE
                         What are you saying? Are you saying 
                         me? Are you saying something about 
                         me?

                         Tell the truth, Eddie. Be honorable. 
                         It's all you got left.

                                     EDDIE
                         Shut up, you little faggot.

                                     ELIAS
                         The cops made you give them somebody. 
                         We know it.

               Eddie looks around. Everybody's looking at him. He considers 
               lying, but realizes it's pointless.

                                     EDDIE
                         All right, so what? I mean, so what, 
                         man? You got the money. Twenty-six 
                         G. Twenty-six, David. Count it.

                                     ELIAS
                         Next time you might trade us.

                                     EDDIE
                         Never.
                              (turns to Barbosa)
                         Never, Felix, never. Come on, man, 
                         you know I'd never...

               Hull observes Barbosa become the power center.

                                     BARBOSA
                              (softly)
                         I know you never will.

                                     EDDIE
                         Felix, no. Don't be... I'm worth 
                         money to you. Let me give you money.

                                     BARBOSA
                         Why? You don't owe me anything.

                                     EDDIE
                         Another twenty-six grand... Just to 
                         show you... Fifty.

                                     BARBOSA
                         Why not a hundred?

                                     EDDIE
                              (that's so much)
                         A hundred??? Felix...

               Barbosa's impassive.

                                     EDDIE
                              (continuing)
                         Okay, a hundred.

                                     BARBOSA
                         Give it.

                                     EDDIE
                         Tomorrow. Twenty-four hours.

                                     BARBOSA
                         Now. Ten seconds.

                                     EDDIE
                         Felix, I need time. I --

                                     BARBOSA
                         One... two...

                                     EDDIE
                         I don't have it right now. But I can --

                                     GOPHER
                              (sadly)
                         Then goodbye, Eddie. I forgive you 
                         for what you said to me.

                                     EDDIE
                              (pleading)
                         Twelve hours. Tomorrow morning.

                                     BARBOSA
                         Six... seven...
                              (to Elias)
                         You want to do it, David?

               Elias looks stricken. Barbosa laughs. Eddie jumps up. Hull 
               turns away, can't bear to watch this.

                                     BARBOSA
                              (continuing)
                         Nine...

               EDDIE

               grabs the first thing he lays eyes on, a tiny snail fork and 
               plunges it into Barbosa's neck.

               As if it were a fly bite, Barbosa flings the table aside 
               and, with a long knife already in his hand, guts Eddie from 
               groin to breast bone. Eddie falls like a suddenly emptied 
               sack.

               Elias can't help gasping.

               Hull looks away, hiding his horror.

               Barbosa rips the fork out of his neck and hurls it at the 
               body.

                                     BARBOSA
                         Piece of shit!

               Elias stares at Eddie's body, transfixed. Horrified, 
               fascinated, afraid, in awe. Barbosa turns to Hull.

                                     BARBOSA
                              (continuing)
                         What'd you think?

                                     HULL
                         At least it was clean.

                                     BARBOSA
                              (pleased, to Elias)
                         What about you, bar mitzvah body? 
                         First time you saw somebody die?

                                     ELIAS
                              (eyes fixed on the 
                              body)
                         No.
                              (catching breath)
                         At camp... when I was fourteen... a 
                         friend of mine was water skiing... 
                         The motorboat ran him over... A junior 
                         counsellor was driving.

                                     BARBOSA
                         You should kill a man some day, David, 
                         it's liberating...
                              (walking out)
                         Summer camp. I'm in business with 
                         somebody who went to summer camp.

               Everyone else is silent, grave.

               INT. ELIAS'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - EARLY MORNING

               Through sliders we see a small pool. Elias and Hull sit over 
               uneaten omelets. Both still shaken by the previous scene.

                                     ELIAS
                         Eddie, man... He was always nice to 
                         my daughter.

                                     HULL
                         How'd a guy like you get into this?

                                     ELIAS
                         The way most drug lawyers do: clients 
                         paid me in product, and I had to 
                         move it. Soon I was doing more dealing 
                         than law. But this was '83, '84, 
                         there was so much money we thought 
                         it would never end.

                                     HULL
                         Yeah. And now...?

                                     ELIAS
                         The road gets rougher. Cocaine's a 
                         dying business.

                                     HULL
                         Then what are we doing here?

                                     ELIAS
                         People are always going to want to 
                         get high. Every society has ways to 
                         alter consciousness.

                                     HULL
                         Because they can't bear reality.

                                     ELIAS
                              (smiles)
                         We all need our delusions, only the 
                         means change: psychedelics, opiates, 
                         prayer, orgies, human sacrifice...

                                     HULL
                         What's next?

               Elias puts a finger to his lips.

                                     HULL
                              (continuing)
                         Why aren't you selling it?

                                     ELIAS
                         I know how to make it and market it. 
                         But I need capital. That's the only 
                         reason I'm hanging out with an asshole 
                         like Barbosa.
                              (feels his hatred of 
                              Barbosa)
                         And because I can't get to the big 
                         guys.

                                     HULL
                         Who are the big guys?

                                     ELIAS
                         Gallegos, et cetera.

                              (reacts to the name)
                         Why can't you get to them?

                                     ELIAS
                         What do you care?

               Hull shrugs: he doesn't.

                                     ELIAS
                              (continuing)
                         Anyway, designer drugs have a bad 
                         name: ice, ecstasy, tar -- there's a

               They hear someone coming.

                              (closing the subject)
                         In dreams begin responsibilities.

                                     HULL
                         Tell me about this new shit.

                                     ELIAS
                         Some other time, John, when we know 
                         each other better.
                              (as Miranda enters 
                              kitchen)
                         Hey, bunnela.
                              (she snuggles against 
                              him; Elias enjoys it)
                         Five times two.

                                     MIRANDA
                         It's too early. Don't bother me.

               He hugs her, kisses her, much more openly affectionate than 
               Hull was with his own children. Hull notices that.

                                     MIRANDA
                              (continuing; head in 
                              her father's chest)
                         Seven.

               Elias whispers in her ear.

                                     MIRANDA
                              (continuing)
                         Oh, yeah... Ten... Who's he?

                                     ELIAS
                         That's my friend, John. This is 
                         Miranda.

                                     HULL
                         Hi, Miranda.

               Miranda gives Hull a shy greeting. Nancy hurries into the 
               kitchen, handsome, busy, ready for work.

                                     NANCY
                         Come on, honey...

                                     ELIAS
                         Nancy, this is John.

               Nancy nods briefly in Hull's direction. Elias kisses Miranda 
               who grabs the back-pack her mother proffers, and they go 
               out. When they're gone:

                                     ELIAS
                              (continuing; on Nancy's 
                              chilliness)
                         That's not about you. It's, she's... 
                         judgmental about what I do.

               When they're gone, he opens louvered doors onto a 
               washer/dryer, takes a sports bag off a shelf, gives it to 
               Hull. Hull looks inside. White powder. He tastes. Real. He 
               hefts the bag.

                                     HULL
                         That's more than I bought.

                                     ELIAS
                         Half we owe you. The other half's on 
                         consignment. A token of our esteem.

                                     HULL
                         You're having trouble moving it.

               Elias doesn't deny it.

                                     HULL
                              (continuing)
                         Make me your partner. I'll help you 
                         get your capital.

                                     ELIAS
                         I don't need a partner. I need a 
                         salesman.

               INT. CARVER'S OFFICE - DAY

               Now in daylight. Two separately wrapped kilograms of crack 
               cocaine on the green blotter.

                                     CARVER
                         I can't buy this much shit. I haven't 
                         got it in the budget.

                                     HULL
                         What am I supposed to do with it?

                                     CARVER
                         You're a drug dealer, John. Deal 
                         drugs.

               Hull just looks at him. Carver doesn't blink.

                                     HULL
                         You know how this goes, Gerry. It 
                         won't stop here. You know what they're 
                         going to ask me to do pretty soon, 
                         to prove I'm down. What am I supposed 
                         to do then?

                                     CARVER
                         Don't blow your Carver.

               Hull: a moment of horror as he realizes what Carver is saying.

               MUSIC -- A DRUG DEALING SEQUENCE

               INT. HULL'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

               He's filling glass vials with crack. Hundreds of them. It's 
               tedious work. He spills some, curses. He stops. He can't 
               believe he's doing this. He goes on doing it.

                                     CARVER (V.O.)
                         You're still thinking like a cop, 
                         John. Forget that. Cross the line. 
                         Be what you are. You're a criminal. 
                         You don't give a shit about other 
                         people. You're just trying to survive.

               INT. CRACK HOUSE - DAY

               Hull doling out vials to DEALERS seen earlier with Eddie.

                                     HULL (V.O.)
                         I can't do this shit. I just can't.

               EXT. A STREET - DAY

               DEALERS going up to cars as before, only now they're Hull's 
               dealers. A well-dressed Black businessman buys from his BMW.

                                     CARVER (V.O.)
                         But you want to be of use. You want 
                         to get drugs off the street, don't 
                         you?

                                     HULL (V.O.)
                         That's why I'm here.

               EXT. SAME - ANOTHER TIME

               Another sale: Teenagers on foot.

                                     CARVER (V.O.)
                         Well, this is the cost. Pay it or go 
                         grow flowers someplace.

               EXT. HULL'S MOTEL - ANOTHER TIME

               He comes out of the motel talking to a Dealer we've seen 
               above.

                                     HULL
                         You can't back down with them. You've 
                         got to project strength, from inside, 
                         you know?

               The Dealer nods. Across the street Hull sees:

               A blue sedan. Taft and Hernandez. Taft gives Hull a little 
               nod and grin.

               EXT. STREET - ANOTHER TIME

               Hull sitting in an aging Trans Am, making entries in a 
               notebook. Across the street he watches:

               A PREGNANT WOMAN (19), a squawling baby in arms, buying from 
               one of his Dealers.

               He kicks the dash in frustrated anger. Under the MUSIC:

                                     HULL
                         Cocksucker...

               As soon as the woman's gone. He goes over to the Dealer, 
               slaps his head, slaps it again. Under the MUSIC:

                                     DEALER
                              (hurt, confused)
                         What'd you do that for?

                                     HULL
                              (walking off)
                         'Cause I can, motherfucker, 'cause I 
                         can.

               EXT. SAME - ANOTHER TIME

               A white housewife making a buy from a new mini-van, a baby 
               in the car seat.

               EXT. STREET - TWILIGHT

               Two USC football players (letter jackets, huge) hassling 
               BIJOUX, a woman dealer, pushing her, she pushes back, curses.

               Suddenly Hull comes running up, shoves them apart. He's 
               yelling, pointing a finger in their faces. Elias comes up 
               behind, calmer.

               Hull is smaller than either USC kid, but they back down as 
               he curses them. Under MUSIC:

                                     HULL
                         ...Touch her again, motherfuckers, 
                         I'm gonna mess you up.

               A brief scuffle. Hull decks one USC, and Elias pulls him 
               off. The kids leave. Elias doubles over with laughter. Hull 
               yells at Bijoux and walks off.

               EXT. APARTMENT HOUSE - DAY

               Hull (looking at written address) knocks on a door. It's 
               opened by a beautiful, dark-skinned black woman in a skimpy 
               robe. She looks at him with disarming frankness. He thinks 
               he must be in the wrong place.

                                     HULL
                         Is David Elias here?

                                     ELIAS (O.S.)
                         Momentito...

               Through the door we see him emerge from a bedroom stepping 
               into his loafers, buttoning his shirt. He gives the woman 
               along, dark kiss, caressing her body.

                                     ELIAS
                         Jacqueline, ho-ney...

               She laughs, closes the door. As he and Hull walk to the 
               street, Elias sings happily to himself:

                                     ELIAS
                              (continuing)
                         "Who's making love to your old lady... 
                         while you're out make love...?"
                              (cheerful)
                         How come I like balling black chicks 
                         so much?

                                     HULL
                         'Cause you're a racist asshole. You 
                         feel like you're fucking a slave, 
                         and it gets you off.

                                     ELIAS
                         Oh, don't mau mau me with the Malcolm 
                         X shit. Tell me you're not chasin' 
                         white pussy every chance you get.

                                     HULL
                         I don't dig white women.
                              (knowing that's a lie)
                         Even if I did, it wouldn't mean the 
                         same thing.

                                     ELIAS
                         Sure, it'd be the slave fucking the 
                         master. Hegel talks about it. Just 
                         like me, but the other way around.

                                     HULL
                         Fuck Hegel. Who the fuck is Hegel? 
                         Some smart-ass kike that talks 
                         backwards?

               Elias laughs, gets into Hull's car. Hull's angry, takes a 
               beat before he gets in.

                                     ELIAS
                         Everybody digs the other, John. They 
                         dig their own, and they dig the other.

                                     HULL
                         Does your wife dig black guys, David? 
                         Did she fuck Eddie? Does she want to 
                         fuck me?

                                     ELIAS
                              (mock-terrified)
                         Ooo... you mean with that great big 
                         purple dick of yours? I hope not. 
                         She'd never be impressed with my 
                         little thing again.

                                     HULL
                         You think what impresses her now is 
                         your dick?

                                     ELIAS
                              (musing)
                         What does impress her?

               Hull can't help laughing. He starts the car.

               EXT. BETTY'S STORE - DAY

               Elias and Hull approach. Hull's carrying a satchel and wearing 
               a new leather jacket.

               INT. JEWELRY STORE - DAY

               As they go in, Elias switches the OPEN sign to CLOSED and 
               turns the latch. The store is filled with Latin American 
               folk art, particularly masks which line the walls.

               BETTY STONE, the woman Hull saw with Elias at the bar, comes 
               out from the back. She is 27, a bad girl trying to dress the 
               way she thinks a banker who went to Vassar dresses for 
               success. She's also a little strung out.

               She and Hull recognize each other at once, (a brief reprise 
               of that moment of perfect chemistry) but she avoids his gaze.

                                     ELIAS
                         Betty, this is John, my new associate.

                                     MCCUTCHEON
                         Your new Eddie. I hear the old one 
                         wore out.

                                     ELIAS
                         Factory recall. John's going to be a 
                         good customer. He does a lot of wash.

               Hull puts the satchel on a display case. Betty still won't 
               look at him, opens the satchel, begins a quick count. She 
               does this with a speed and sureness that suggests high test 
               scores.

                                     HULL
                         So how's this place work?

               Betty doesn't answer, so Elias covers the awkwardness.

                                     ELIAS
                         Betty wires the money to a store in 
                         Aruba in payment for things they 
                         never sent her. They deposit the 
                         money in a bank there that turns 
                         around and loans her money she never 
                         has to repay. That way it doesn't 
                         turn up as income for the IRS. Welcome 
                         to the laundromat.

                                     MCCUTCHEON
                         David, you talk too much.

                                     ELIAS
                         She doesn't trust you.

               Hull has taken down a mask, puts it over his face, looks in 
               a mirror.

                                     HULL
                         How much is this?

                                     MCCUTCHEON
                         More than you can afford.

                                     HULL
                         I'll take it.

               She produces a vial of coke, looks questioningly at Elias.

                                     ELIAS
                         By all means.

               She draws out six lines. Elias does two.

                                     MCCUTCHEON
                              (offering him the 
                              straw)
                         Come on, Eddie 2... you're up.

                                     HULL
                         No, thanks.

               NOTE: Betty is acutely attuned to Hull, and in his refusal 
               she senses -- albeit unconsciously -- two things: first, 
               that he doesn't trust himself on drugs, therefore, he's a 
               dangerous guy and, therefore, exciting; and, second, more 
               important, the refusal bespeaks a repudiation of the violence 
               and danger and, thus, a longing for goodness. Despite the 
               seeming contradiction, she finds this even more attractive. 
               But because she feels herself to be bad, his goodness seems 
               only a judgment against her, and so she thinks she hates 
               him.

                                     MCCUTCHEON
                         Who is he, my mother?

                                     HULL
                              (smiles)
                         Never have, never will.

               Betty ignores him, does her lines.

                                     MCCUTCHEON
                              (taunting Hull)
                         Oooh... Cocaine, I love it and I 
                         hate it and I love it. The disease 
                         is the cure.

               She can't help looking at Hull who's looking at her. She and 
               Elias are stoned; he's not.

                                     MCCUTCHEON
                              (continuing)
                         Don't look at me. Elias, tell him 
                         not to look at me. I don't like the 
                         fucker.

               But Elias is too busy vacuuming up Hull's leftovers.

                                     ELIAS
                              (sniffling)
                         John's an ascetic Negro; he wants to 
                         make sure you know he's not a jungle 
                         bunny.

                                     HULL
                         Watch your mouth, David.

                                     ELIAS
                         But he's got another side. You should 
                         seen him on the street the other day 
                         with these two USC kids. Do the spade 
                         bit for her, John.
                              (black accent)
                         I'm gonna mess you up, muthafugga...

               He sticks his finger in Hull's face just like Hull with the 
               boys.

                                     HULL
                         Don't call me a spade. And don't 
                         tell me to play black.

               He says it gently, but Betty hears the edge.

                                     ELIAS
                              (hurt, disappointed)
                         Come on, John, you do it so well.
                              (falling into it)
                         Ah ain't playin', muthafucka. Ah 
                         ain't playin'.

               Hull glares; Elias refuses to be intimidated.

                                     ELIAS
                              (continuing)
                         Don't fuckin' dis me, muthafucka. 
                         Fucka... fucka... fucka a... fucka 
                         b... fuck b-hive... fucka, fucka, 
                         fucka...

               Elias dances around repeating "fucka" until it's almost 
               musical.

               Hull picks him up and slams into a wall.

                                     HULL
                         Say it again, and I'll kill you.

               Elias throws Hull back against a display case. He's strong 
               and unafraid. They're ready to fight.

                                     MCCUTCHEON
                         Grow up, assholes!

               This half snaps them out of it. Still glowering, they slowly 
               relax, release each other.

               EXT. STREET - NIGHT

               Hull sits in the Trans Am eating a sandwich and watching the 
               street as a DEALER leans in the window telling his sob story. 
               There's an authority to Hull's manner that tells us he may 
               not like this job, but he knows how to do it.

                                     DEALER
                         ...The guy ripped me off, man, so I 
                         don't got the money, I don't got the 
                         stuff and --

                                     HULL
                              (eyes on street)
                         You gotta pay anyway.

                                     DEALER
                         Oh, but, man...

               As he raps on, comical pathos, Hull spots in his side 
               mirror...

               THE RED RANGE ROVER

               coming slowly this way. Ivy in the passenger window, the 
               barrel of an automatic weapon glinting in the streetlight.

                                     HULL
                         Shit...

               Hull glances up: Bijoux is selling on the next corner.

               The Range Rover passes the Trans Am. Ivy leans out.

               Hull flings open the Trans Am door, throwing the Dealer to 
               the ground. He jumps from the car:

                                     HULL
                              (continuing)
                         Bijoux!!

               She turns. Sees Ivy. She puts out her hands to block the 
               shots. The SOUND of the gun is inaudible. The barrel bounces 
               slightly. Bijoux sprawls backward.

               Bijoux: dead on the sidewalk, limbs askew, bleeding from 
               many wounds.

               Hull, standing over her, covers her face.

               EXT. SAME - MUCH LATER THAT NIGHT

               The body has been taken away, the crowd has cleared. Elias 
               sits on the hood of the Trans Am. Hull stands, staring down.

                                     ELIAS
                         It wasn't your fault.
                              (no response)
                         What could you have done?

                                     HULL
                         She worked for me. I'm supposed to 
                         protect her.

               Elias knows that's true, and it leads to another truth.

                                     ELIAS
                         We have to kill him.

               Hull looks up.

                                     ELIAS
                              (continuing)
                         Or we lose all authority with the 
                         other dealers. And one of them'll 
                         kill you.

               Hull looks up, startled.

                                     ELIAS
                              (continuing)
                         You've got to assert now, or you're 
                         dead.

               Hull sees the truth of that and slowly nods.

                                     ELIAS
                              (continuing)
                         And if we kill Ivy, we control this 
                         whole territory.

                                     HULL
                         That guy who works for Barbosa can 
                         do it, Chino.

                                     ELIAS
                         No. If we use Chino, it's Barbosa 
                         who's asserting. It'll be Barbosa's 
                         territory.
                              (again: his hatred of 
                              Barbosa)
                         It's gotta be us.

                                     HULL
                         Right.

                                     ELIAS
                         And if it's us, it's gotta be you.

               Meaning he can't do it. Hull knows that. A long beat on Hull's 
               face as he reaches the inevitable decision.

                                     HULL
                              (to himself)
                         Don't blow your cover.

                                     ELIAS
                         What?

                                     HULL
                         If I do this, we're partners. Equal 
                         partners on everything.

               Elias offers his hand. Hull stands up, a sudden resolve.

                                     HULL
                              (continuing)
                         Let's go.

                                     ELIAS
                              (afraid)
                         Now...?

               But Hull is already moving.

               EXT. STREET/INT. ELIAS'S CAR - NIGHT

               Hull and Elias driving, looking for Ivy. Elias double parks 
               by two prostitutes.

               We STAY in the car with Hull who's silent, frightened, keeps 
               trying to warm his hands.

               Outside, Elias is talking and laughing with the prostitutes. 
               We see them point. He gives them money, kisses. They laugh. 
               He gets back in the car.

               EXT. A DANCE CLUB - NIGHT

               The Range Rover parked in front. Elias's car stops. MUSIC 
               pounds from inside. Then one CONTINUOUS SHOT:

               They pass the club, other store fronts... Turn at the 
               corner... Turn into an alley... Down the alley past the same 
               buildings... The rear door of the club... To the next 
               street... Turn... Turn... onto the original street, back to 
               the front of the club. They stop again.

                                     HULL
                         Go wait around back.

               Elias nods. A beat. They look at each other.

                                     ELIAS
                         I want to see you in that alley.

               Hull's so terrified he seems calm. With an air of submitting 
               himself to fate, he gets out and walks into the club.

               INT. CLUB - NIGHT

               Crowded and BOOMING and strobe lit. Hull pays the cover and 
               climbs a staircase to a...

               CIRCULAR BALCONY

               that overlooks the dance floor. On stage: a RAP ACT with its 
               throbbing beat and below Hull a sea of dancers.

               Hull circles the balcony. It isn't hard to pick out Ivy -- 
               he's all in red, dancing with the woman we saw him with in 
               the Range Rover the first time.

               Hull reaches the steps again and starts down, keeping his 
               eye on Ivy. The number ends. In the pause before the next 
               one, Ivy can be seen excusing himself, heading toward the 
               rear of the club.

               The next number begins. People dance. Hull pushes his way 
               through the dancers to...

               INT. REAR OF CLUB - A SHORT HALLWAY - NIGHT

               leading toward the rear door they saw from the alley.

               MOVING DOWN THE HALL

               A woman's room. A men's room. Hull goes into...

               INT. MEN'S ROOM - NIGHT

               Ivy is pissing into a urinal. He's so huge he seems to take 
               up all the space in the tiny room. Hull stares at him, unable 
               to look away.

               He notices Hull. All dialogue is UNDER the POUNDING MUSIC.

                                     IVY
                         What're you looking at?

               Hull stares at Ivy's face. Ivy considers this rude.

                                     IVY
                              (continuing)
                         You want to suck it, bitch?
                              (offers his dick)
                         Or drink it?

               Laughing, he turns, urinates on Hull's pants. Hull doesn't 
               move.

                                     IVY
                              (continuing; 
                              recognizing him)
                         Oh, I know you. You're the bitch 
                         whose whore I wasted tonight, ain't 
                         you?

               Somebody pushes on the outside of the door. Hull holds it 
               closed with his back.

                                     IVY
                              (continuing)
                         I gotta take care of you, too, huh?

               He reaches into his pants for the butt of a gun.

               Hull is frozen.

               Ivy starts to draw it out.

               Hull steps forward, grabs Ivy's gun arm. With his other hand 
               he clumsily pulls a silenced .22 from inside his jacket, 
               puts it in the underside of Ivy's jaw and SHOOTS twice. Ivy's 
               brains spray upward onto the wall, and he slides straight to 
               the floor. Hull steps out into...

               INT. SHORT HALL - NIGHT

               An Hispanic busboy coming out of the kitchen sees him and 
               the gun in his hand, freezes.

               Hull walks past him and out the back door. From inside we 
               see Hull go down three steps, stumble in the drive and fall 
               to his knees, the gun CLATTERING away from him.

               A couple that had been making out, stops, looks.

               It takes Hull a moment to gather himself. He picks up the 
               gun, gets into Elias's car. It drives away.

               INT. HULL'S MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

               Alone, he looks at his face in the mirror. As if he doesn't 
               know the person there.

               With a knife, he draws out something hidden inside the wooden 
               backing of the mirror. A manila envelope. He empties it onto 
               the dresser:

               Mementos among which we see, carefully preserved, the blood-
               soaked bills his father gave him. Hull ignores them and picks 
               up...

               PHOTO OF HIS CHILDREN

               He smooths out the folds, stares at it as if trying to fix 
               this in his thoughts.

               Hull on the phone. He's unusually excited, even moved.

               Hull pressing the phone to his face, trying to master his 
               emotions.

               GRAINY 16MM FILM - A LABORATORY MAZE

               A lab rat with a metal electrode protruding from its head, 
               is running a maze at high speed. A VOICE explaining things.

                                     VOICE
                              (young, nasal, too 
                              smart)
                         The maze leads in two directions. At 
                         one end the rat can obtain a food 
                         pellet. At the other...
                              (pointer indicates 
                              each end)
                         ...it receives electrical stimulus 
                         to a very specific area of the 
                         cerebellum...

               The rat reaches this second destination, pushes a bar, is 
               stimulated. A lab worker (white coat, gloves) picks up the 
               animal, replaces it at the start. It runs the same route.

                                     VOICE
                              (continuing)
                         This rat, like 86% of the others in 
                         the experiment, chose the electrical 
                         stimulus repeatedly and exclusively. 
                         It continued to do so until it died 
                         of malnutrition.

               ANOTHER SHOT -- the rat dead.

               INT. A LABORATORY - DAY OR NIGHT

               A 21-year-old RENEGADE from the Cal Tech chemistry department 
               (red hair, freckles, glasses held together with electrical 
               tape), a brilliant nerd. He picks up...

               A MOLECULAR MODEL

               Colored balls stuck together with wooden dowels.

                         This is an addictive amphetamine 
                         with time-space distortion, delusions 
                         of grandeur -- or maybe they're real -- 
                         tending to be impulsive, sometimes 
                         violent behavior. Psychotropic 
                         adaptation for late monopoly 
                         capitalism. It's illegal, and you 
                         can buy it on any street corner.

               He tears off some of the balls, sticks on new ones.

                         What would it take to manufacture 
                         this stuff in quantity?

                         With a million dollars, I could

                         at about two bucks a pop.
                              (makes a face: fair)
                         But then with five million, or better 
                         yet ten, the cost would drop to thirty 
                         cents, and we'd have enough for the 
                         whole world.

                                     ELIAS
                         I'm going to put two hundred fifty 
                         thousand into your corporate account. 
                         You cheat me, Randy, I'll use your 
                         bladder for a bagpipe.

                              vengeance)
                         We're going to put Barbosa out of 
                         business.

               Elias is very happy. He leads Hull out.

               INT. CARVER'S OFFICE - DAY

               On the pyramid chart there's a black border around Ivy's 
               photo, as around Eddie's. A photo of Hull is now on the board 
               beside the one of Elias. Hull stares out the window, lost in 
               thought.

                                     CARVER
                              (dismissive)
                         Synthetic shit?? Sounds like a 20/20 
                         segment...

               Hull shrugs: it's not that important. Carver turns to his 
               real interest.

                                     CARVER
                              (continuing)
                         So, what was it like?

                         Then you should know how it was.

               Carver smiles, but he's non-plussed by Hull's new detachment.

                                     CARVER
                         You didn't clear it with me. You're 
                         getting independent. That's good.

               Hull smiles.

                                     CARVER
                              (continuing)
                         How're we coming on Gallegos?

                         He supplies Barbosa. To get to him 
                         we'll have to take quantity.

                                     CARVER
                         Then you've got to --

                         That's what killing Ivy did. I'll 
                         get to him soon.

               Carver's impressed.

                                     HULL
                              (continuing)

                         Act it. And get some clothes. Spend

               Hull in a new, expensive suit, gives the big Blonde Woman 
               cash.

                         needs. And something for you.

               He adds another bill. She smiles.

               INT. A RENTED CONDOMINIUM - DAY

               Views, open space, expensive furnishings. Hull (in another 
               fancy suit) is hanging a couple of Betty's masks. He's 
               meticulous about their placement.

               Elias wanders out from the other rooms, looking around.

                         Nice place. Nice suit.

               Hull has a moment of self-consciousness about the suit, checks 
               himself out in a mirror -- a private moment.

               Elias flops on a couch, puts his feet on an antique coffee 
               table.

                         Hey...!

               He hurries over, lifts Elias feet to the floor. Hull brushes 
               the wood, inspects it carefully, fusses, worries... Elias is 
               amused.

                                     ELIAS

                         impressed.

               Hull starts to place stacks of cash in a briefcase. He's 
               momentarily mesmerized by all the money.

                                     HULL

                         I do. We've got a bigger territory, 
                         we need more product. I want to deal 
                         directly with Gallegos. It would 
                         save us money.

                                     ELIAS
                         Barbosa'll never let us near him.

               Hull closes the briefcase, ushers Elias toward the door. 
               He's going out, too.

                                     HULL
                         If we buy twenty, Gallegos'll come 
                         to us himself.

                                     ELIAS
                         How do you know?

                                     HULL
                         When I bought a key from Eddie, you 
                         came to me.

               Elias laughs, surprised, afraid.

                                     HULL
                              (continuing)
                         Who's above Gallegos?

                                     ELIAS
                         Guzman, but he's... Don't ask so 
                         many questions.

                                     HULL
                         How else will I learn?
                              (hint of a threat)
                         Call Barbosa, David, put in our 
                         order... Because we have to split 
                         this, and there isn't enough here 
                         for both of us.

               Elias feels the threat.

               EXT. BETTY'S JEWELRY STORE - NIGHT

               Despite the CLOSED sign, a light's on inside. Hull knocks. 
               No response. He keeps knocking without let-up until:

                                     BETTY'S VOICE
                              (annoyed)
                         Nobody's home, go away.

               He knocks harder. Finally she appears in the doorway, stopping 
               short when she sees it's him. She's immediately aware of 
               white streaks on her grey suit. she tries to brush them off.

                                     MCCUTCHEON
                              (doesn't want to let 
                              him in)
                         Look, I'm tired, why don't you...

               Hull holds up the briefcase. She sighs, unlocks the door.

               INT. BETTY'S OFFICE - NIGHT

               A bill counter toting up the cash. She watches it fixedly to 
               avoid looking at him, but she feels the chemistry.

                                     MCCUTCHEON
                         Why do you look at me like that?

                                     HULL
                         How do I look at you?

                                     MCCUTCHEON
                         Like you know something I don't. 
                         Like you're better than me.

               That catches Hull off-guard, and he responds with a candor 
               she didn't expect.

                                     HULL
                         I don't think I'm better than you. I 
                         don't think I'm better than anybody.

               She's startled by this remark and instinctively drawn to 
               him.

                                     HULL
                              (continuing)
                         But I do know something... You can't 
                         stop thinking about me.

               Embarrassed, she looks away. He takes her hand, and at his 
               touch something yields to her. She lets him draw her to him. 
               His kiss is strangely tender, searching. It turns Betty on 
               incredibly. She melts into him.

                                     MCCUTCHEON
                         Let's go back here...

               She leads him into...

               THE SMALL OFFICE

               She's sweet and loving, but her sweetness scares her. He's 
               all over her, but she pulls back for a moment. There is a 
               couch and before it a coffee table with coke scattered on a 
               plate.

                                     MCCUTCHEON
                              (indicates coke)
                         Do this... do it with me.

               She offers him a straw. He doesn't take it.

                                     MCCUTCHEON
                              (continuing)
                         This is where I'm at. You want to be 
                         with me, it's gotta be there.

                                     HULL
                         I don't do that.

                                     MCCUTCHEON
                         Never have, never will.

                                     HULL
                         It's for fuck-ups.

                                     MCCUTCHEON
                         What do you think, you're not a 
                         nigger? You're a nigger as much as 
                         me.

                                     HULL
                         More.

               She's angry, hurt, confused, wants to love him, but feels he 
               won't let her, or she won't let herself. It's torment. Finally 
               she's released by a KNOCK on the door. She goes out to...

               THE FRONT OF THE STORE

               Lets in Elias. He smells the tension.

                                     ELIAS
                              (amused, jealous)
                         Having fun?
                              (neither answers; to 
                              Hull)
                         I talked to Barbosa. He'll see us 
                         now.

               Hull turns to Betty. Both want to go that way instead of 
               this, but events are leading somewhere else. He follows Elias 
               out.

               EXT. A SALSA CLUB - NIGHT

               MUSIC pouring into the darkness.

               INT. CLUB - NIGHT

               Kids dancing to a live STAGE ACT. High in a wall: a lit 
               window.

               INT. THAT ROOM - NIGHT

               Very different from the club. A comfortable room with a bar, 
               tables, filled with men much older than the dancers below. 
               Barbosa and Gopher at the bar with Elias and Hull. Chino and 
               other SHADOWY FIGURES lurk in the room's depths.

                                     BARBOSA
                         Ten kilos? You're always late on 
                         two.

                                     HULL
                         Not ten... twenty.

               Barbosa's impressed.

                                     HULL
                              (continuing)
                         The more we have, the more we can 
                         move. There're markets we can't open 
                         because we don't have the inventory.

               Barbosa's coked to the eyeballs, mean and dangerous.

                                     BARBOSA
                         Finally some balls on this team...
                              (taunting Elias)
                         Come work for me, John. I'll give 
                         you your own franchise. You can supply 
                         Elias, lean on him when he's late.

                                     ELIAS
                         Go fuck yourself.

               Barbosa laughs.

                                     HULL
                         I'm with David.

                                     BARBOSA
                         Why? He give you his "designer drugs" 
                         pitch. He's never going to do it. 
                         He's a shmuck.

                                     ELIAS
                         Don't talk to me that way.

                                     BARBOSA
                         I'm not talking to you at all. I'm 
                         talking to John.

                                     GOPHER
                         It's the cocaine. Don't listen to 
                         him. Felix, you've had enough...

                                     BARBOSA
                         Shmuck.

               Elias goes for him. He's fast and strong, and it takes Chino 
               and Hull to pull him off.

                                     GOPHER
                         Praise God they don't let guns in 
                         here.

                                     CALMING VOICES
                         "None of that in here..." "Take it 
                         outside..."

               Barbosa's laughing, but his cheek is flecked with his own 
               blood, and his eyes are dead.

                                     BARBOSA
                         David, you've been working out, you're 
                         getting strong. Are you quick, too?
                              (shadow boxes)
                         Come on, I'll give you a shot at me.

                                     ELIAS
                         Any time, any place.

                                     BARBOSA
                         Right here, right now. Do this.

               He puts his hands out, palms up.

                                     ELIAS
                         This? What is this?

                                     BARBOSA
                         You know, you slap me, I slap you.
                              (mimes that game)
                         Come on, it's fun. Like summer camp.

               It doesn't look fun. Elias glances at Hull for guidance.

                                     HULL
                         Don't waste your time.

                                     BARBOSA
                         Stay out of this.
                              (to Elias)
                         Come on, you can do it, David, you're 
                         not a shmuck.

               Elias puts his hands out, palms up. Barbosa covers them with 
               his own. ON THE HANDS: Barbosa's broad, muscular with thick 
               gold rings and a Rolex; Elias's paler, slighter, a wedding 
               band and a slim watch.

                                     BARBOSA
                              (continuing)
                         Slap my hands. Just slap them.

               Elias looks Barbosa in the eye. He's trying to be a snake, 
               but he's more the mouse. He looks away and as he does tries 
               to...

               Slap him with both hands but hits only...

               Air. The room breathes. Barbosa turns his rings so the big 
               surfaces point down.

                                     BARBOSA
                              (continuing)
                         Now it's my turn.

                                     GOPHER
                         It's Barbosa's turn. He's gonna kill 
                         the white boy.

                                     ELIAS
                         One more.

                                     BARBOSA
                         No, you went, Davey, now it's my 
                         turn. First to four wins, like the 
                         World Series.

               Elias covers Barbosa's palms with his own.

                                     GOPHER
                         Oh, God, I can't look.

               ON THE HANDS: Barbosa tenses his hands. Elias yanks back. 
               Barbosa's hands haven't moved.

                                     BARBOSA
                         You remember the rules? If you flinch, 
                         I get to hit you.

               He slaps Elias across the face. Hull starts forward. A knife 
               appears. He stops.

                                     BARBOSA
                              (continuing)
                         Again, shmuck.

               Elias covers Barbosa's hands. Barbosa tenses. Elias holds 
               firm, and Barbosa quickly slaps both hands, hard. Elias 
               doubles over, holding his hands in pain.

                                     GOPHER
                         One.

                                     ELIAS
                         That was two.

                                     BARBOSA
                         No, this is two.

               He slaps him again, a stinging crack. Elias looks to Hull, 
               but they're across a canyon. Hull lowers his eyes.

                                     GOPHER
                         Oh, and it hurts. Mercy, it hurts.

               ON THE HANDS. Barbosa moves his hands a millimeter, and Elias 
               flinches again. Barbosa smacks him across the face. The sound 
               reverberates through the room. Now even Gopher is silent. 
               Tears run from Elias's eyes, blood from his mouth, but he 
               doesn't move.

                              (continuing)
                         Three.

                                     A VOICE
                         Felix! No mas. Finito.

               A MAN

               steps forward out of the shadows. He is young, mid-30's, 
               handsome, European features, beautifully dressed, accompanied 
               by a guard we'll know as MOLTO. Someone murmurs to someone 
               else:

                                     SOMEONE
                         Gallegos...

               Hull reacts. Their eyes meet.

                                     GOPHER
                         The fight is over! The Ambassador 
                         from the South has spoken!

                                     ELIAS
                              (refusing any mercy)
                         One more.

               Barbosa shakes his head, ashamed now in front of Gallegos.

                                     ELIAS
                              (continuing)
                         One more! We're not finished!
                              (people are silent)
                         Four was the match.

               He holds out his hands. Barbosa resumes the stance, then 
               waits, waits, waits, and finally brings both hands down, 
               terribly hard, the sound of the slap is awful.

                                     BARBOSA
                         Four.

                                     HULL
                         Okay, that's it. Get away.

               Hull leads Elias to the door right past Gallegos. Their gazes 
               meet again. As they go out they hear Gallegos BERATING Barbosa 
               in furious Spanish.

               INT. STAIRCASE - NIGHT

               Trembling, Elias holds his bloody hands against his chest, 
               as Hull leads him in silence down the steps.

                                     ELIAS
                         Look at me. Look at me, damn it!

               He barely whispers, but it's like a shout. Hull, who'd been 
               avoiding his gaze, forces himself to look. Elias's humiliation 
               is so profound it almost ennobles him. Finally:

                                     HULL
                         Why did you do it?

                                     ELIAS
                         I needed it. They taught me what I 
                         needed to know. That I'm not part of 
                         them, and I never will be. That they 
                         don't respect me. That I don't deserve 
                         respect. Because I'm a shmuck, John. 
                         I'm a shmuck...

               He laughs a terrible laugh. The door behind them opens, and 
               Barbosa appears with Gopher. Everyone is ready for death, 
               but:

                                     BARBOSA
                         David, I'm sorry. It's a crazy time, 
                         and... you know... I'm doing a little 
                         too much coca... I'll buy your kid a 
                         pony... anything you want... Let's 
                         forget about it.

               He comes down the stairs, offers his hand. Elias will never 
               forget about it, but he silently takes the hand, holds them 
               in his own bloody paws, looking directly into Barbosa's face.

               Barbosa becomes uneasy, manages to extract his hand. Elias 
               and Hull continue down and out the door. Gopher gushes to 
               Barbosa.

                                     GOPHER
                         I am so proud of you. You can be 
                         cruel, and you can be kind. And just 
                         now you were kind. Proud, proud, and 
                         more proud. That's me.

                                     BARBOSA
                         Shut up.

               INT. BOXING GYM - NIGHT

               Barbosa, Gopher with Hernandez, Taft's partner. Now we know 
               Hernandez is corrupt: that's how they knew Eddie was talking.

                                     BARBOSA
                         I got nothing to give you, my man. 
                         I'm an il-liquid son of a bitch.

                                     HERNANDEZ
                         Felix, I keep telling them, "I have 
                         informants down there, I'm working 
                         guys, I can't say who..." If you 
                         don't have money, give me busts, or 
                         they're gonna start wondering about 
                         me.

                                     GOPHER
                         They're already wondering.

                                     BARBOSA
                              (deadpan)
                         You can have Gopher.

                                     GOPHER
                         Oh Gawd...

                                     BARBOSA
                         How about a lawyer?

                                     GOPHER
                              (knows who he means)
                         Felix, don't do this.

                                     HERNANDEZ
                              (he knows, too)
                         Great, lawyers are great, Jewish is 
                         best. But I need spades, too. The 
                         politicians want dark facts to scare 
                         the suburbs so they'll vote 
                         Republican.

                                     BARBOSA
                         Lawyers and spades; I got the 
                         trifecta: two dealers and a girl who 
                         does their wash. Two niggers and a 
                         kike; all Democrats.

                                     HERNANDEZ
                         You're my man. And afterwards...

               Hernandez rubs thumb against fingers.

                                     BARBOSA
                         When this is over, I'll send you to 
                         Hawaii, Maui. It's very beautiful in 
                         Maui, it's a very spiritual place.

                                     HERNANDEZ
                         I just want money.

               And he's gone.

                                     GOPHER
                         I wouldn't trust that man when he's 
                         out of rifle range.

               Barbosa looks tired.

                                     GOPHER
                              (continuing; 
                              premonition of 
                              disaster)
                         Don't do this, Felix. It'll go wrong. 
                         Kill Elias if you have to, honey, 
                         but don't set him up for this. It 
                         damages your prestige.

               Barbosa faces his cocaine. He tries to resist the pull, then 
               yields. He does another line. It's his friend. He loves it. 
               He picks up a cellular phone, dials.

                                     BARBOSA
                         David, you're awake, I'm impressed... 
                         I'm sorry about what happened... 
                         Listen, I'll get you twenty boxes, 
                         like you wanted. You were right, you 
                         should have what you need... Tomorrow 
                         night... Bring your partner and that 
                         girl with the store, Betty... I need 
                         her advice on something. I want us 
                         to have fun, like we used to. We'll 
                         go to that shrimp place, okay?... 
                         Good... Me, too, David.
                              (hangs up; does another 
                              line; drawing it 
                              deep into him)
                         Yes!

               INT. CARVER'S OFFICE - BEFORE DAWN

               Hull jacked up, excited, pleased with himself. As he paces, 
               Carver observes his beautiful suit, shoes, expensive watch. 
               He looks much better than Carver.

                                     HULL
                         We're getting twenty kilograms

                              sky)
                         Tonight. I made it happen. I pushed 
                         Elias, now he doesn't make a move 
                         without me.

                                     CARVER
                         You run Elias.

                                     HULL
                         I control him. Barbosa's selling it 
                         to us because he thinks I can move 
                         it...
                              (now the big news)
                         And last night I met Ramon Gallegos.

               Carver sits up fast. Hull likes that.

                                     HULL
                              (continuing)
                         We're getting the dope from him; 
                         it's still coming through Barbosa, 
                         but Gallegos will approach me soon 
                         on his own. We're going to get him, 
                         Gerry. We're going to bring him and 
                         the whole thing down.

               Carver sits back, grimaces.

                         My problem? My problem is that you 
                         don't really know what's happening.

                         He's dealing you to Taft and 
                         Hernandez. You're going to be taken 
                         down as you receive the drugs. They're 
                         putting together the arrest team

               That rocks Hull. He is up, pacing.

                         What do we do?

                         You stay away. We're going to take 
                         them down.

                         My boss wants a bust right now. He 
                         goes before the oversight committee 
                         next week. He needs something to 
                         justify the budget.

                                     HULL
                              (imploring)
                         I'll get him something. Give me ten 
                         days, and I'll get him Gallegos on a 
                         plate.

                                     CARVER
                         Too late. The whole thing's set up.

                                     HULL
                         Gerry, what are you telling me? I 
                         need Elias... and Betty. You arrest 
                         them, and you're throwing away 
                         everything I've set up.

                                     CARVER
                         It's out of my hands.

               Hull walks out.

                         We shouldn't go to them. Maybe them 
                         come to us.

                                     ELIAS
                         He wouldn't.

               They pull into the lot of a boarded up restaurant where 
               Barbosa and Chino stand outside of a limousine.

               EXT. BEHIND AN AIRPORT MOTEL - NIGHT

               Taft and Hernandez in the same van that was outside the gym 
               earlier. They're watching THROUGH BINOCULARS, night scopes. 
               They spot Elias's car.

                                     HERNANDEZ
                              (whispering into radio)
                         Here they are. Nobody move until we 
                         see the green suitcase.

               EXT. PARKING LOT - NIGHT

               The two groups meeting. Barbosa gives Betty a courtly kiss.

                                     BARBOSA
                              (flirtatious)
                         I'm sorry for dragging you out so 
                         late, but I have to be careful.

                                     MCCUTCHEON
                         It gives me confidence.

               HULL

               watching planes descend into the airport, nervous. He knows 
               what's coming, but how does he handle it?

                                     HULL
                         Let's see what we've got.

               Elias takes a satchel out of the rent-a-car trunk. Chino 
               opens the limousine's trunk. Inside is an over-sized day-glo 
               green plastic suitcase. He is about to pick it up.

                                     HULL
                              (continuing; spotting 
                              the police van in 
                              the adjacent lot)
                         Don't touch it.

               Everyone looks at him, then the direction he's looking.

                                     BARBOSA
                         What is this?

                                     HULL
                         Something's wrong. What's that van 
                         doing there?

               Everyone looks. They can barely see the van. Hull pulls a 
               gun.

                                     HULL
                              (continuing)
                         This is a bust. The minute we take 
                         the stuff, they'll be over us.

                                     BARBOSA
                         He's crazy, David. I thought you 
                         were the crazy one, but it's him.

               Hull puts the gun to Barbosa's head, addresses Chino:

                                     HULL
                         Chino, pick up the suitcase and give 
                         it to Elias. I'll only kill him if 
                         something goes wrong.

               Chino moves to pick up the suitcase.

                                     BARBOSA
                         No!!

               Everyone looks at Hull amazed, even Chino.

                                     ELIAS
                              (softly)
                         Fucking A, John...

                                     HULL
                         Okay, everybody in the car.

               He throws the money in the limo truck, slams the lid. He's 
               running the show now, and everyone knows it. He's winging 
               it, but confident and strangely calm.

               Elias, energized by Hull's command, grabs Barbosa and throws 
               him toward the limo.

               HERNANDEZ'S POV THROUGH NIGHT SCOPE

                                     TAFT
                         We have a problem.

                                     HERNANDEZ
                         Shit! Shit! Shit!
                              (aiming rifle; Hull 
                              in sights)
                         Enough of this...

                                     TAFT
                         No!

               EXT. TWO CARS - NIGHT

               Hull shepherding everyone into the limo. He glances toward 
               the van. On instinct. He pulls Chino to him.

               A RIFLE SHOT

               Chino's head explodes. Betty screams.

                                     BARBOSA
                              (screaming at van)
                         Don't shoot... Don't shoot...

               INT. VAN - NIGHT

               Taft hurling Hernandez against the wall.

                                     TAFT
                         Goddam it, what the hell are you 
                         doing?

               EXT. TWO CARS - NIGHT

               SIRENS. GUNFIRE. Elias drags Barbosa into the limo. Hull 
               throws Betty into the front seat. The limo takes off.

               EXT. STREET/INT. LIMO - DRIVING - NIGHT

               Hull driving, Betty up front. Elias with a gun on Barbosa in 
               back. Hull slaloms the limo through police GUNFIRE. Windows 
               are blown out. Glass everywhere.

                                     MCCUTCHEON
                              (weeping)
                         I asked for this... I asked for it... 
                         It's my fault...

                                     HULL
                              (calm, eyes on road)
                         Relax. We'll make it.

               She looks at him, stunned yet soothed by his certainty.

                                     BARBOSA
                         He's a cop. He has to be. How else 
                         would he have known?

                                     HULL
                         If I was cop, you'd be face down 
                         back there.

                                     MCCUTCHEON
                         How did you know?

                                     HULL
                         The whole thing smelled. Changing 
                         his mind about the stuff. Meeting us 
                         way out here. And I'd seen cops in 
                         that van before. Hernandez is dirty, 
                         that's who he's using.

                                     ELIAS
                              (to Barbosa)
                         Get out of the car.

               He starts to open the door.

                                     HULL
                         David, not now.

                                     ELIAS
                         Yes, now!

               INT. TAFT AND HERNANDEZ'S CAR - NIGHT

               Racing. Taft at wheel, raging at Hernandez.

                                     TAFT
                         Who are you, man? Who the fuck are 
                         you?

                                     HERNANDEZ
                              (stonewalling)
                         I'm me.

               INT. LIMO - DRIVING - NIGHT

                                     ELIAS
                         He traded us to the cops. Just like 
                         Eddie. Eddie, who was nice to my 
                         daughter, had to die because that's 
                         the rule. And you were vulgar about 
                         my wife, Felix, so at the very least 
                         the same rule applies to you.

                                     BARBOSA
                         I'll give you money. I'll give you a 
                         million. Anything you want.

                                     ELIAS
                         I want you to get out of the car. 
                         Get out of the fucking car. Out of 
                         the fucking --

                                     MCCUTCHEON
                              (near tears)
                         No, no... we can't do this.

                                     HULL
                              (turning around from 
                              front seat)
                         Stop it, David, or we're...

               Elias wheels on him, sticks the gun in his face:

                                     ELIAS
                              (in a fury)
                         Look at my hands!

               He holds them up: swollen, black and blue, cut up.

                                     ELIAS
                              (continuing; to 
                              Barbosa, softly)
                         Get out of the car.

               Barbosa's frozen. Elias grabs his hand, SHOOTS a bullet 
               through. Barbosa screams...

                                     MCCUTCHEON
                         No!

                                     HULL
                         Goddammit!

               Elias wheels on them, swinging the gun from one to the other.

                                     ELIAS
                         Stay out of this, or you'll die. 
                         You'll both die. Everyone'll die.

               His fury makes anything seem possible. He pushes open the 
               door. Trembling, Barbosa starts to climb out.

               The limo enters a tunnel, police still in pursuit.

               Halfway out, Barbosa stops.

                                     BARBOSA
                         I can't...

               Elias SHOOTS him in the butt. He shrieks, jerks forward. The 
               cops are getting close behind.

               Other cops waiting at the far end of the tunnel.

               Hull hits the brakes, spins a 180 into the opposite lane.

               Barbosa is flung out of the car and plastered by a succession 
               of fishtailing vehicles.

               Hull speeds back the other way. They're going straight at:

               INT. VAN - COMING STRAIGHT AT THEM - NIGHT

               Taft and Hull, the two drivers, lock eyes. It's chicken, but 
               more than that. Two men set against each other who, for some 
               reason, want to be friends.

               At the last instant, the van swerves away, but:

               ELIAS AIMING AT TAFT

               Taft sees the gun too late. He can do nothing.

               Hull's gaze follows Taft's. He sees Elias, deliberately 
               swerves, sending the SHOT wild.

               INT. LIMO - RACING - NIGHT

                                     ELIAS
                         I had him!

                                     HULL
                         You want to kill a cop?? Don't be 
                         stupid.

               The limo speeds away.

               EXT. STREET/INT. LIMO - DRIVING - NIGHT

               The windows shot out. Hull and Betty silent, shaken. Elias 
               charged up, happy.

                                     ELIAS
                         Everything is different. We're the 
                         Colombians now.

                         This is the greatest night of my

                         right...

                         He said I should kill a man. He was 
                         right.

                                     MCCUTCHEON
                         My God.

                         Barbosa was a roach. Do you miss 
                         him? Will anybody in the world miss 
                         him?

                                     MCCUTCHEON
                         Are you a roach, too?

                              (happily)
                         Yes. Thank God.

                              (to Hull)
                         What about you?

               He's silent, keeps driving. She's had enough.

                                     MCCUTCHEON
                              (continuing)
                         Stop the car.

               Hull looks at her.

                              (continuing)
                         Stop it!

               He brakes to a stop. She jumps out, leans back in.

                                     MCCUTCHEON
                              (continuing)
                         No more laundering, no more anything. 
                         I'm finished with this.

               And she disappears into the night. Elias watches her go. 
               Hull resumes driving.

                                     ELIAS
                         She knows too much. We have to kill 
                         her.

                                     HULL
                         No! She's with me. She's not going 
                         to talk.
                              (looks at Elias)
                         You touch her, I'll kill you.

                                     ELIAS
                         She's your responsibility then.

               Hull accepts it.

                                     ELIAS
                              (continuing)
                         We're going to get the money now, 
                         John. Enough for the new drug. We're 
                         going to be rich. We're going to be 
                         so rich that we're going to leave 
                         the world of ordinary people and 
                         going to a higher realm. I mean that.

                                     HULL
                         They're going to come after us.

                                     ELIAS
                              (matter-of-fact)
                         It's a hardball game. We're hardball 
                         players.

               EXT. COMMERCIAL STREET - EAST L.A. - NIGHT

               Hernandez comes out of a bodega with groceries, wine and a 
               woman. He nuzzles her as he lets her into his car. As he's 
               getting behind the wheel, Molto (Gallegos' guard) stops the 
               door from closing. The conversation is entirely in SPANISH.

                                     HERNANDEZ
                         It wasn't my fault.

                                     MOLTO
                         It never is.

               He SHOOTS him in the head. Hernandez slumps against the wheel. 
               The woman screams. Molto walks away.

               EXT. AN APARTMENT COMPLEX/INT. BETTY'S APARTMENT - DAWN

               Hull finds a door, pushes the buzzer. Betty looks through 
               the glass. She's afraid of him.

                                     MCCUTCHEON
                         Don't kill me. I'm not going to talk. 
                         I swear. Please.

               Then she looks closer and sees not murder in his face, but 
               need. She opens the door. Without a word, he gathers her to 
               him. She can't resist him now. Her mouth is everywhere on 
               him.

               INT. HER BEDROOM - DAWN

               Betty gasping in the wake of pleasure, turning her face away 
               from him, she feels so exposed.

                                     MCCUTCHEON
                         Don't look...

               She hides her face in his neck.

               INT. SAME - LATER

               They lie in each other's arms, relaxed together for the first 
               time. A wonderful, unprotected openness.

                                     HULL
                              (softly)
                         Tell me about you.

                                     MCCUTCHEON
                              (half-kidding)
                         Everything worth knowing you just 
                         found you.

               He laughs. They begin to make love again. Suddenly: AN EXTRA 
               HAND stroking Betty's hair. She gasps. A gun in Hull's ear. 
               Another in her face. Guns all around.

                                     HULL
                         Don't hurt her.

               Hands pull him out of bed, leave her there alone. We see 
               Molto, two or three others.

               EXT. A CEMETERY - MORNING

               RAMON GALLEGOS lays a bouquet of white lillies on a grave. 
               He kneels, whispers a prayer, crosses himself.

               He rises and walks to where Molto and the other guards hold 
               Hull and Elias. Gallegos is in his thirties, more European 
               than Barbosa. He has a distinctly mild manner.

                                     ELIAS
                         Who's grave?

               An impudent question, but Elias seems strangely bright-eyed 
               despite the guns held on him.

                                     GALLEGOS
                         My wife's. She died of leukemia three 
                         years ago.
                              (looks around)
                         I like to be among the dead. They 
                         never interrupt you.
                              (turning to them)
                         Felix Barbosa started out as a skinny 
                         fourteen-year-old fucking Yankee 
                         businessman in Bogata hotels. He 
                         grew up. He made himself strong and 
                         rich, but getting there made him 
                         sick, and that killed him. So he 
                         lost everything for the same reason 
                         he'd gotten it in the first place. 
                         Now we'll see if you can do as well.

               A PRIEST going by greets Gallegos who responds warmly. They 
               chat a minute in SPANISH. The Priest leaves.

                                     GALLEGOS
                              (continuing)
                         Felix owed me one million eight 
                         hundred thousand dollars.

               He addresses this to Hull; Elias feels left out.

                                     GALLEGOS
                              (continuing)
                         When you killed him, you bought the 
                         debt; now you owe it to me; you get 
                         to keep thirty percent, like he did. 
                         You have three days.

               Gallegos turns to leave.

                                     HULL
                         Who did Barbosa collect from?

                                     GALLEGOS
                         If you don't know, you shouldn't 
                         have killed him.

               He notices Hull's earring: two tiny dice, the spots made of 
               minuscule jewels. Unembarrassed, he fingers it.

                                     GALLEGOS
                              (continuing)
                         Cute... Can I have that?

               Without waiting for an answer, he yanks it out of Hull's ear 
               and walks away, leaving Hull bleeding through his fingers 
               before a stone cross.

               EXT. A GHETTO STREET - NIGHT

               A club on the corner. THROUGH A WINDOW we see a RAP ACT on 
               the stage, their MUSIC pumping out onto the street. Hull 
               pulls up in a Jaguar. He and Elias go through a door adjacent 
               to the club.

               INT. BUILDING HALL/INT. GOPHER'S ROOM - NIGHT

               The MUSIC is still audible here, though muffled. Elias and 
               Hull are pushing at door Gopher is trying to hold closed.

                                     GOPHER
                         I don't want you in here. You killed 
                         the man, and I loved him. I don't 
                         want to have anything to do with 
                         you.

               Elias kicks it open, and they enter Gopher's tiny, miserable 
               domain. He's wearing some sort of negligee and an immense 
               naked woman fills his bed. We still hear the MUFFLED MUSIC.

                                     GOPHER
                              (continuing; apoplectic)
                         I'm a sixty-three-year-old man! I'm 
                         a grandfather! Would you hit a sixty-
                         three-year-old white man? Would you 
                         hit your own grandfather?

                                     ELIAS
                              (slaps him against 
                              wall)
                         Listen, you fucking monkey, you know 
                         who owed him money, and we know you 
                         know. Tell us or --

               Hull pulls him off. Elias is angry. They struggle.

                                     HULL
                         He'll tell us. Gopher, just...

               Meaning: deal with me or deal with Elias.

                                     GOPHER
                         You can't tell anyone it was me.

               The MUSIC continues OVER the following sequence:

               INT. CRACK HOUSE - DAY

               Elias arguing with a dealer. He slaps him around.

               TIGHT ON HANDS

               Money is exchanged. The money is stuffed in a satchel.

               INT. A LAW OFFICE - DAY

               A well-dressed lawyer (30's) talking with clients, a 
               distinguished couple in their 60's.

               The door BANGS open and a secretary is unable to restrain 
               Hull and Elias as they charge into the room. The lawyer is 
               up on his feet, but Hull shoves him around as Elias politely 
               explains to the clients that this will only take a moment.

               TIGHT ON SATCHEL

               Hull's hands thrust more money in. It's getting full.

               INT. A MOTORCYCLE REPAIR SHOP - NIGHT

               A biker in leathers on hands-and-knees spitting blood onto 
               the cement floor. Hull stands over him, fists clenched.

               INT. A CAR TRUNK

               A satchel stuffed with money is latched, set next to another 
               latched one. A third is opened, money and jewelry dumped in.

               EXT. STREET - NIGHT

               Hull looking into the trunk. Elias is beat.

                                     HULL
                         Where the hell is all the money? 
                         We're still a million short.

                                     ELIAS
                         I gotta get laid.

                                     HULL
                         David, we've got thirty-six hours.

                                     ELIAS
                              (slams trunk, moves 
                              toward door)
                         Pick me up at Jacqueline's in the 
                         morning.

                                     HULL
                         Sooner than that.

               Elias gets in the car and drives off. Hull turns and a dark 
               American sedan pulls up alongside. Carver behind the wheel.

                                     CARVER
                              (an order)
                         Get in.

               INT. CAR - NIGHT

                                     HULL
                              (as he gets in)
                         What are you doing here? You're going 
                         to get me killed.

               Carver peels away fast. He's very angry, frightened, too, 
               but that's hidden.

                                     CARVER
                         Where the hell have you been?

                                     HULL
                         Doing my job.

               There's an indifference to Carver's authority we haven't 
               heard before. Hull isn't even aware of it, but Carver is.

                                     CARVER
                         You violated a direct order to stay 
                         away from that bust. As a result, a 
                         police informant is dead, a state 
                         senator was critically injured in 
                         the tunnel pile up and a city 
                         policeman was subsequently murdered.

                                     HULL
                         I didn't blow my cover.

                                     CARVER
                         Don't get smart with me, motherfucker.

                                     HULL
                         Don't be a shmuck, Gerry. I'm talking 
                         to Gallegos. I'm collecting his money. 
                         We can set him up right now.
                              (NOTE: Carver arrives 
                              somewhere and parks. 
                              To be discussed, but 
                              let's say, for now, 
                              that we are:)

               EXT. SANTA MONICA PARKING STRUCTURE - OVERLOOKING OCEAN - 
               NIGHT

               They get out of the car. Carver takes out a flask, has a 
               drink, offers it to Hull who declines.

                                     CARVER
                         Never have, never will.
                              (puts the flask away)
                         I want you to give me your gun. You're 
                         coming in right now.

                                     HULL
                              (doesn't understand)
                         Coming in where?

                                     CARVER
                         Your assignment has been terminated. 
                         You're not going out there again. If 
                         I have to, I'll put you in custody.

                                     HULL
                              (uncomprehending)
                         I'm going to have Gallegos in two 
                         days.

               Carver says nothing. Suddenly Hull understands.

                                     HULL
                              (continuing)
                         You're protecting him. You're 
                         protecting Gallegos.

               Carver snorts: ridiculous.

                                     HULL
                              (continuing)
                         No, of course. That's why you wanted 
                         to bust Elias and Betty. I was getting 
                         close, and you wanted to cut this 
                         off then... What is he, the new 
                         Noriega? Helps you fight commies, so 
                         you let him sell drugs to the niggers. 
                         Two birds with one stone.

                                     CARVER
                         You violated orders, so you're 
                         through. Don't make a conspiracy 
                         theory out of it.

                                     HULL
                              (laughs)
                         I'm through...? Then, I might as 
                         well have a drink after all.

               Surprised, Carver reaches for the flask. As he does, Hull 
               grabs him, pushes him out over the edge of the building, 
               holds him there.

                                     HULL
                              (continuing)
                         Now tell me the truth or they're 
                         going to decide your troubles got 
                         the best of you.

               Carver struggles. Hull pushes him out farther. Carver dangles.

                                     CARVER
                         You're insane.

                                     HULL
                         All the more reason to do what I 
                         say. Jesus, Ger, I'm having trouble 
                         holding on...

                                     CARVER
                         All right!

                                     HULL
                         Say it!

                                     CARVER
                         It's the State Department.

               Hull pulls him back in. Carver slumps against the wall, drinks 
               greedily. Hull lets him for a moment, then takes the flask 
               away.

                                     CARVER
                              (continuing)
                         I told you, Gallegos's uncle is a 
                         big deal down there.

                                     HULL
                         Guzman.

                                     CARVER
                         Guzman, right. Our government supports 
                         Guzman because he's a moderate. That's 
                         a right-winger who's pro-U.S.
                              (he doesn't like it 
                              either)
                         If Gallegos got busted here, it would 
                         hurt Guzman's political career there. 
                         It's politics, John, not drugs.

                                     HULL
                         Drugs is politics. Politics is 
                         drugs...
                              (sickened)
                         Christ, Gerry, I dealt drugs. I killed 
                         a man. Others died. What did I do 
                         all this for? For nothing.

                                     CARVER
                         I'm going to Washington, John. I'll 
                         bring you with me. We'll have clout, 
                         money...

                                     HULL
                              (outraged)
                         I didn't do this for clout or money. 
                         You said we were gonna do some good.

                                     CARVER
                         We tried.

                                     HULL
                         Trying's for college boys.
                              (his head on fire)
                         If all there is is power and money... 
                         If all there is... then what am I 
                         doing here? 'Cause I can get more 
                         power and money out on the street, I 
                         got more there already, than I'd 
                         ever get kissing your ass in 
                         Washington...

                                     CARVER
                         But you can't do that, John. It's 
                         not you.

                                     HULL
                         Me? There is no me. We took care of 
                         that. First I was a cop pretending 
                         to be a dealer. Now I'm just a dealer 
                         pretending to be a cop. Why not stop 
                         pretending...? Quit the force. Be a 
                         dealer.

                                     CARVER
                         It's not that simple.

                                     HULL
                         My assignment's already terminated. 
                         All I have to do is quit. I hereby 
                         quit.
                              (lifts the flask)
                         My first one.
                              (drinks)
                         Not so bad.

               He slips the flask in his pocket, gets in the car, starts 
               engine.

                                     CARVER
                         Don't blow your cover.

               Hull drives off, leaving Carver alone on the roof.

               INT. BETTY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

               She lets him in, sees the distress in his face.

                                     MCCUTCHEON
                         What's the matter?

               He shakes his head, drops onto the couch. He takes out the 
               flask, offers it to her. She shakes her head.

                                     HULL
                         Who are you, my mother?

               He laughs, takes a drink. She's surprised, says nothing.

                                     MCCUTCHEON
                         Tell me.

                                     HULL
                         Tell you what?

                                     MCCUTCHEON
                         What you came to say.

                                     HULL
                         What did I come to say?

                                     MCCUTCHEON
                         Then tell me anything. Something 
                         about you. Something real.

                                     HULL
                              (long beat; another 
                              drink)
                         When I was young, I occasionally 
                         stole things.
                              (laughs to himself)
                         My father died when I was ten. Right 
                         in front of me.

               The revelation is so sudden it surprises Hull as much as 
               Betty.

                                     HULL
                              (continuing)
                         Heart attack. He just fell down. He 
                         said, "I love you," then died in my 
                         arms.

                                     MCCUTCHEON
                         Oh, baby...

               She holds him, and he lets himself be held.

                                     MCCUTCHEON
                              (continuing)
                         Tell me what's going on, John?

                                     HULL
                              (doesn't want to talk 
                              about that)
                         You're not doing the stuff anymore, 
                         are you?

               Pulls playfully at her nose.

                                     MCCUTCHEON
                         No. Don't change the subject.

                                     HULL
                         How is that?

                                     MCCUTCHEON
                         It's hard. John...!

                         Things are getting, they're getting 
                         a little... confusing. I had certain 
                         plans, and people haven't come through 
                         exactly as they promised.

                                     MCCUTCHEON
                         What do you expect with those people?

                                     HULL
                              (laughs)
                         It's not just those people. It's... 
                         it's bigger than that. It's of 
                         everybody. Present company excluded.

                                     MCCUTCHEON
                         You've got to stop this, John, you 
                         know that. You gotta get out.

                                     HULL
                         I can't.

                                     MCCUTCHEON
                         Of course, you can.

                                     HULL
                              (almost angry)
                         No! This is what I'm supposed to do.

                                     MCCUTCHEON
                         Supposed to? Who said you're supposed 
                         to?

                         The whole fuckin' world. You think I 
                         didn't try something else? But 
                         everything funnels you right back 
                         here. Like it's where you had to go 
                         all along.

                                     MCCUTCHEON
                         But you know what you're doing, don't 
                         you, selling this stuff? Doing to 
                         our own.

                         If I tried to get out now, they'd

                         involved in drugs.

               He nods. He knows. He's even happy about it. But she won't 
               yield. Finally he gets up and walks back out the door.

               EXT. GOPHER'S BUILDING - 4 A.M.

               The neighborhood is reminiscent of the one where Joe Stevens 
               Sr. was killed. The rap club still pumps MUSIC onto the 4 
               A.M. streets where whores, junkies, children, teenagers with 
               beepers and Nikes, welfare mothers roam as if it were daytime 
               anywhere else. Their eyes, yearning, sullen, vital, hopeless 
               and hoping stare at...

               HULL

               Everyone knows what he is: the Black Man with the Big Car. 
               They don't remember when he was just another hustler making 
               street buys. Now they hate him, revere him, want to be him, 
               not caring what it entails. Every eye follows as...

               He and Elias cross the street toward Gopher's door. Hull's 
               eyes don't go right or left. He's a driven man now.

               INT. GOPHER'S ROOM - NIGHT

               Gopher has just been roused from sleep. A light in his face, 
               Hull and Elias looming over him.

                                     HULL
                         There've got to be more. We have a 
                         million two, we owe Gallegos one 
                         eight.

                                     GOPHER
                         I told you everyone. Everyone who 
                         owed him, everyone he... One eight? 
                         He's lying. Barbosa barely owed him 
                         a million.

               Hull and Elias look at each other.

               INT. BETTY'S STORE - MORNING

               Taft is showing her photocopies of phone bills, bank 
               transactions, invoices. She's obviously upset.

                                     TAFT
                         I got every money transfer, every 
                         phone call, all your laundry tickets.

                                     MCCUTCHEON
                              (miserable)
                         What do you want?

                                     TAFT
                         John Hull.

                                     MCCUTCHEON
                         I can't!

                                     TAFT
                         Or you'll go away 'til you're a dried 
                         up old woman, and when you come out, 
                         ain't nobody gonna want you.

               She covers her face.

               EXT. EAST L.A. STREET/INT. CAR - DAY

               Elias driving a car we haven't seen before and snickering to 
               himself at some private joke.

                                     HULL
                         What are you laughing at?

               Elias shakes his head: nothing. He laughs. They pull into 
               the lot beside a movie theater.

               INT. THEATER - DAY

               A Technicolor Spanish melodrama is winding to its lurid end. 
               A door in back opens, and a burst of daylight reveals Hull 
               and Elias being brought in by a guard and met by Molto.

               Molto and the guard frisk them, take their guns and money 
               satchels, make them wait a moment until...

               The movie ends.

               The house lights come on revealing Ramon Gallegos as the 
               only spectator in the theater. He beckons. Molto and the 
               guard bring Hull and Elias down the aisle to him.

               Gallegos looking in the satchels. A tense moment.

                                     HULL
                         It isn't one eight.
                              (off Gallegos)
                         It's a million one. That's all Barbosa 
                         owed, it's all we're paying.

               Gallegos is stern for a moment, then laughs.

                                     GALLEGOS
                         Big brass balls. Collecting money 
                         makes you strong.

               Everybody relaxes. Gallegos scribbles something on a piece 
               of paper, hands it to the guard who feeds it into a fax 
               machine.

                                     ELIAS
                         What's that?

                                     GALLEGOS
                         I'm telling our suppliers they got 
                         paid. They'll be very happy. I'm 
                         happy.

                                     ELIAS
                         And we're happy. Everybody's happy. 
                         It's a happy world.

               Elias seems a bit mad, but no one minds. He and Hull are 
               ready to go. He gestures to Molto, wants his gun back.

                                     GALLEGOS
                         So, how can I express my gratitude 
                         for a job well done?

                                     ELIAS
                         We want Barbosa's business.

               Gallegos gestures to Molto to give them the guns.

                                     GALLEGOS
                         Done. Of course.

                                     ELIAS
                         And, also, your business. All this. 
                         Your money, your dope, everything.

               Hull looks at Elias; what's going on?

                                     GALLEGOS
                              (smiles)
                         You're tougher than I thought, but 
                         not that tough.

                                     ELIAS
                         How tough is enough?

               He brings up the gun and SHOOTS Gallegos in the head.

               Hull and the guards are frozen. Then everyone goes for a 
               gun. Elias SHOOTS the guard. Hull has his gun to Molto's 
               head and screams at Elias:

                                     HULL
                         No!

               Meaning don't shoot him. But Elias has no intention of doing 
               so.

                                     ELIAS
                              (breathless)
                         Thank you, John. I couldn't have 
                         done that without you.

                                     HULL
                              (barely able to speak)
                         Jesus Christ...

               He can't believe it: the guy he's been after the whole time 
               is dead on the floor.

                                     ELIAS
                         You taught me to take my work 
                         seriously.

                                     HULL
                         What's going on here, David?

                                     ELIAS
                         We're taking over.

                                     HULL
                         You're doing too much stuff.

                                     ELIAS
                         No, I'm very clear. I'm very, very 
                         clear.
                              (to Molto)
                         Ahora, usted nos assistamos. Enteindo?

               Molto nods.

               EXT. THEATER PARKING LOT/INT. CAR - DAY

               Hull, Elias and Molto getting into their car. Molto is 
               recalcitrant. Elias pistol whips him. Hull stops him.

               EXT. SAN FERNANDO VALLEY/INT. CAR - DAY

               The car passes through a development of suburban homes. They 
               enter a driveway. Two boys play in the yard.

                                     ELIAS
                              (to Molto)
                         Donde esta?

               Molto is silent. Elias FIRES a bullet right between his feet. 
               Molto jumps. The boys turn. Hull grabs the gun away. We feel 
               the toll Elias's madness is taking on him.

                                     HULL
                         What the fuck's the matter with you?

                                     ELIAS
                         It works, John. It works.

               And, indeed, Molto is pointing to a Winnebago parked at the 
               rear of the property.

               EXT. REAR OF PROPERTY - DAY

               Winnebago. With a tire iron, Hull snaps off the padlock that 
               holds the rear door closed. He opens the door. Money gushes 
               out. He slams it closed.

                                     HULL
                         Jesus...

               He, Elias and Molto are on hands and knees scooping it up.

               SAME - LATER

               Molto tied to a tree. Elias is giving him instructions while, 
               strangely, removing Molto's shoes and socks.

                                     ELIAS
                              (to Molto)
                         Disce a Senor Guzman que...
                              (his Spanish isn't 
                              good enough)
                         ...that we have his money, and we're 
                         willing to talk as soon as he comes 
                         to town. We'll know how to reach 
                         him. Okay?

               Molto just glares at him. Elias smiles, takes the shoes and 
               socks and all the contents of Molto's into the Winnebago, 
               and he and Hull drive away, leaving the car behind.

               EXT./INT. A PARKING GARAGE/INT. WINNEBAGO - EVENING

               The Winnebago enters the garage, Elias greeting the attendant, 
               "Hey, Frank." Frank waves him in.

               The garage is filled with various RVs. Hull pulls the 
               Winnebago into an empty spot beside Elias's car and gets 
               out. Elias remains in the cabin making calculations.

                                     ELIAS
                         Approximating the cubic capacity and 
                         depending on the denominations of 
                         the bills, it's somewhere between 
                         fifty million and two hundred million 
                         dollars. Right back there.

               As he does, Hull checks his gun, walks around behind the 
               vehicle and prepares to shoot Elias in the back of the head 
               through the open window. Elias finishes his money report, 
               and sits there as if unaware of Hull, but:

                                     ELIAS
                              (continuing; not 
                              turning around)
                         Think I'm crazy?

                                     HULL
                         Yes.
                              (blowing up, gun still 
                              on him)
                         I can't believe you got us into this. 
                         All of fucking Latin America is going 
                         to be after our asses, including 
                         Renaldo Guzman who's friends with 
                         fucking George Bush.

                                     ELIAS
                         I know they're coming after us. I 
                         want them to. We'll give them the 
                         money, but we'll make a deal for 
                         ourselves. We'll get what we need 
                         for the synthetic drugs. I've thought 
                         it all out. I've been thinking it 
                         out for years.

               Hull uncocks the gun, rubs it against his burning face. Elias 
               turns around, embraces him.

                                     ELIAS
                              (continuing)
                         We're going to have everything. Don't 
                         you want everything, John?

                                     HULL
                         They're going to get your family, 
                         David. They'll kill your wife and 
                         daughter.

                                     ELIAS
                              (serene)
                         Nancy and Miranda left the country 
                         two days ago.

                                     HULL
                         You knew about this then?

               Elias smiles.

                                     HULL
                              (continuing)
                         What about Betty?

               EXT. BETTY'S JEWELRY SHOP - EVENING

               A car SQUEALS to a stop. Molto and three thugs smash through 
               the glass door. They disappear into the store where things 
               can be heard BREAKING. They emerge a moment later, jump into 
               the car.

               EXT. SYNAGOGUE - EVENING

               Hull's car races up. He jumps out, dashes toward the building.

               INT. SYNAGOGUE SOCIAL HALL - EVENING

               Forty PEOPLE on folding chairs. Hull enters on a dead run. 
               He stops short when he sees:

               BETTY

               at the front. He signals to her, but she's already saying:

                                     MCCUTCHEON
                         Hi, my name is Betty.

                                     EVERYONE IN THE ROOM
                         Hi, Betty!

                                     MCCUTCHEON
                         My name is Betty, I'm a drug addict. 
                         And I've been clean for nineteen 
                         days.

               The room bursts into APPLAUSE. She sees Hull at the back; he 
               signals to her, but she goes on.

                                     MCCUTCHEON
                              (continuing)
                         I've been using drugs and selling 
                         them, and I've wanted to stop for a 
                         long time, and the only way I did 
                         was because I met a man I loved and 
                         who loved me. I know that's not what 
                         I'm supposed to say. I'm supposed to 
                         say there was a higher power, and 
                         maybe there was, behind it all, but 
                         this man is strong and his love made 
                         me strong enough that I could start, 
                         or at least think about a life that 
                         didn't have drugs in it...

               She's looking right at Hull as she speaks. He's torn between 
               the danger he knows she's in and his emotion at what she's 
               saying.

               EXT. SYNAGOGUE - EVENING

               Hull hurrying Betty toward his car. She's protesting.

                                     MCCUTCHEON
                         I've got to get clothes.

                                     HULL
                         You can't go back.

               INT. HULL'S CONDO - EVENING

               Molto and men pouring through it. In frustration, Molto 
               smashes the table Hull had fussed over when Elias put his 
               feet up.

               EXT. MOTEL COURTYARD - NIGHT

               Hull and Betty hurry toward his room carrying shopping bags, 
               a newly bought suitcase. They see...

               COPS

               They freeze, turn, ready to bolt. But more cops behind them. 
               A panic, yet no one's coming after them. They walk on. The 
               cops are going into and coming out of Belinda's room.

               INT. BELINDA'S ROOM - NIGHT

               The fat Blonde Woman is talking to a policewoman. James sits 
               on the bed staring at...

               BELINDA

               who lies dead on a floor littered with crack vials. Hull 
               picks up a vial, holds it up to the Blonde Woman with a 
               question.

                                     BLONDE WOMAN
                              (nodding)
                         She got a fever and just burned up. 
                         She just burned up all of a sudden. 
                         It must have been bad stuff.

                                     MCCUTCHEON
                              (indicating James)
                         He shouldn't be here.

                                     BLONDE WOMAN
                              (takes his hand)
                         Come on, James, we'll go get a 
                         burrito.

               The boy allows himself to be led out. Betty looks at Hull 
               who's in a private hell.

               EXT. COURTYARD - NIGHT

               Hull and Betty are about to enter Hull's room. The door is 
               ajar.

               INT. HULL'S ROOM - NIGHT

               Taft stands at the dresser. He's found Hull's collection of 
               memorabilia and is looking at the photo of his children.

                                     TAFT
                         Cute kids...

                                     HULL
                              (angry at the invasion)
                         Give me that.

               He snatches away the photo, but not before Betty sees it. 
               She reaches out her hand. He reluctantly turns it over to 
               her.

                                     TAFT
                         Tell me something, who the fuck are 
                         you?

               Hull doesn't answer, collects the rest of his things, 
               including the bloody money, stuffs it back in the envelope.

                                     TAFT
                              (continuing)
                         'Cause I don't think you're quite 
                         the asshole you're trying to be.

                                     HULL
                         Look, Mr. Taft, that's your name, 
                         right? Leave me alone. I got things 
                         on my mind.

                                     TAFT
                         I'd think you would. You better have 
                         your goddamn life on your mind, or 
                         it's gonna get away from you. It's 
                         gonna burn up like that poor woman 
                         across the way. Like all of you's 
                         gonna burn...

                                     HULL
                         And what do you do, Mr. Taft, except 
                         chase bad guys up and down the street 
                         with your dirty partner, never 
                         catching anybody important?

                                     TAFT
                         I do what I can. Do you do what you 
                         can?
                              (Hull says nothing)
                         Maybe my partner was dirty. Maybe 
                         the chief's dirty. And the mayor. 
                         And the President. Maybe God Himself's 
                         taking something on the side. That's 
                         their problem. But I'll bust 'em if 
                         I can.

                                     HULL
                              (without force)
                         Get out of my room.

                                     TAFT
                         Don't deny who you are.

               He leaves. Hull turns to Betty who is still holding the photo 
               of his children. He gently takes it, looks at it, seems to 
               draw both succor and pain from it.

               He gets out Carver's flask and tries to drink, but it's empty.

                                     HULL
                         They're my children. They live in 
                         Cleveland with their mother. I'm 
                         divorced from her. I haven't seen 
                         them in... some time. I want to, but 
                         I haven't been able to arrange it.

                                     MCCUTCHEON
                         How much else don't I know about 
                         you?

                                     HULL
                              (trying to make a 
                              joke)
                         Everything else... Everything else 
                         is... I don't know.

                                     MCCUTCHEON
                         Taft has all the evidence about my 
                         laundering.

               Hull's upset.

                                     MCCUTCHEON
                         He's going to put me in jail for a 
                         long time unless I give you up.

                                     HULL
                         Do it.

                                     MCCUTCHEON
                         I can't. So, I've got to get away. 
                         Far away. But I need money.

                                     HULL
                              (laughs)
                         Money? I got money...

               He empties his pockets of all that gushed out of the 
               Winnebago, empties a satchel as well until it fills the room 
               like snow.

               EXT. MOTEL - NIGHT

               Hull putting Betty into an airport limousine.

                                     HULL
                              (to the driver)
                         International terminal.
                              (to Betty)
                         I'll meet you there in a week.

               She kisses him. He's about to close the door. She stops it.

                                     MCCUTCHEON
                         You know the first time, when I saw 
                         you in the bar...?

                                     HULL
                              (smiles at the memory)
                         You wouldn't even look at me.

                                     MCCUTCHEON
                         'Cause I knew what you were thinking. 
                         You were judging me.

                                     HULL
                         No, I wasn't, I was...

                                     MCCUTCHEON
                         You were. Your eyes were like an 
                         angel in my heart telling me I should 
                         be good, and I didn't want to hear 
                         it.

               This news startles Hull, yet, strangely, he senses its truth, 
               and the sweetness is more than he can bear.

                                     MCCUTCHEON
                              (continuing)
                         That's you, too. Maybe this is you, 
                         I don't know, but I know that's you.

               She closes the door. The car pulls away.

               In an unmarked car up the street, Taft picks up the radio.

               EXT. A LATIN AMERICAN CONSULATE - DAY

               A limousine pulls into the gate and disgorges RENALDO GUZMAN, 
               55, and his wife, 25. They're shown into the consulate.

               The limousine pulls out onto the street and parks. Gopher 
               appears, knocks on the driver's window. It comes down. They 
               chat briefly in Spanish. Gopher opens up a cellular phone.

               INT. A HOTEL ROOM - SANTA MONICA - DAY

               Overlooking the ocean. Hull pacing nervously, Elias relaxed, 
               reading the paper.

                                     HULL
                         What if we forget all this? Take ten 
                         million each and disappear. Leave 
                         the country. New identities, new 
                         lives...

                                     ELIAS
                         What's the matter, John? Having 
                         doubts?

                                     HULL
                         Yeah.

               A phone RINGS. Elias picks up his own cellular.

                                     ELIAS
                         Yes... Where?... No! No way... We 
                         pick the time and place... Otherwise 
                         no meet...
                              (looks to Hull who 
                              nods his agreement)
                         Got a pencil?

               EXT. CONSULATE - LIMO - DAY

               Gopher hands a piece of paper to the limo driver. He walks 
               away...

               AROUND THE CORNER

               As he's about to get into a car, Taft grabs him. Gopher is 
               surprised and not pleased.

               EXT. PARKING GARAGE - NIGHT

               Where Hull and Elias left the Winnebago. Guzman's limo 
               approaches. Frank, the attendant, waves it on.

               INT. GARAGE - NIGHT

               The limo climbs the ramps until it comes to Elias's car, 
               parked where the Winnebago was; the Winnie is nowhere in 
               sight. The limo pulls alongside.

               Hull and Elias get out. Molto gets out of the limo. Then 
               Renaldo Guzman.

                                     ELIAS
                         We have a proposal to make. We regret 
                         what happened to your nephew...

                                     GUZMAN
                         Say what you have to say.

                                     ELIAS
                         We all know that your cousin's 
                         business is coming to an end. Costs 
                         have climbed while profits and the 
                         market --

               Guzman waves: get to the point.

                                     ELIAS
                              (continuing)
                         We have developed a new product: 
                         simpler, cheaper to manufacture, 
                         superior quality and completely 
                         synthetic. Therefore, no growing, no 
                         refining, no peasants, no importing, 
                         no customs agents... Here's a detailed 
                         prospectus with anticipated cash 
                         flow and so forth.

               He hands a copy to Guzman and the lawyer.

                                     GUZMAN
                              (to Molto, teasing 
                              Elias)
                         The racist Americans just want to 
                         cut us poor Hispanics out of the 
                         market.

                                     ELIAS
                         There are no Americans anymore, Mr. 
                         Guzman, you know that. No Hispanics, 
                         no Japanese, no blacks, no whites, 
                         no anything. There are only rich 
                         people and poor people. We're rich, 
                         so we're on the same side.

               EXT. GARAGE - NIGHT

               Taft with Gopher in his car.

                                     TAFT
                         Do they have money in there?

                                     GOPHER
                         I don't know.

                                     TAFT
                         They wouldn't meet here otherwise.

               Gopher shrugs; a decision: Taft picks up his radio.

                                     TAFT
                              (continuing)
                         Okay, everybody, here's the play...

               INT. GARAGE - NIGHT

                                     ELIAS
                         We're prepared to give you 80% of 
                         the money. The remainder you invest 
                         in our business with proceeds paid 
                         out according to the figures there.

               He indicates the prospectus that Guzman has been looking 
               through.

                                     GUZMAN
                         This looks interesting. I'd have to 
                         confirm everything, of course. Do 
                         you have a sample of the product?

               Elias produces one. Guzman gestures to Molto. Molto samples 
               it. Molto's eyes widen.

                                     MOLTO
                         Buy it!

                                     GUZMAN
                         Where is our money?

               Elias hands him a key, points to a different Winnebago. Molto 
               takes the key, unlocks the back: money. He signals okay to 
               Guzman.

               Suddenly: SIRENS. Police cars wail into the garage. The THWACK-
               THWACK and sweeping light of a helicopter descend toward the 
               roof (though we never see the copter).

                                     GUZMAN
                              (continuing; anger)
                         You set this up.

                                     HULL
                         They're after us, not you.

               Everybody scatters. The garage is a labyrinth of cement 
               stairwells, ramps, hundreds of RVs to hide between, under 
               and so forth... Lots of NOISE, lights, but mostly we see 
               Hull and Elias dodging here, avoiding the action.

               INT. ANOTHER PART OF THE GARAGE - NIGHT

               Molto caught between the lights. He draws his gun. GUNFIRE. 
               He's cut down.

                                     TAFT
                              (screaming)
                         Where are the rest of them?

               EXT. PARKING GARAGE - NIGHT

               Cars with rotating dome lights, but not many cops.

               Hull and Elias emerge from a shadowy doorway and make their 
               way at a casual pace beyond the perimeter of police cars, 
               quickly mingling with other spectators. They continue down...

               EXT. A QUIET SIDE STREET - NIGHT

               Strolling now. Elias elated, uncontained joy.

                                     ELIAS
                         We did it. Twenty million. Twenty 
                         fucking million. We're going to have 
                         synthetics. We're gonna be rich. 
                         We're gonna...

               Hull stops walking and just stands there.

                                     ELIAS
                              (continuing)
                         What's the matter, John? Be happy. 
                         Your whole life has just been solved.

                                     VOICE
                              (behind them)
                         Stop! Police!

               In one motion, Elias draws his gun, turns and FIRES.

               The figure goes down. Elias can't believe he hit him.

               Hull starts toward the figure.

                                     ELIAS
                              (heading the other 
                              way)
                         John, where are you going?

               Taft -- on the ground.

                                     HULL
                         Oh, Jesus, no...

               He drops to his knees. Blood oozes from Taft's chest.

                                     ELIAS
                         John, what the hell are you doing? 
                         Let's get out of here.

               Hull tries to hold closed the wound. The posture duplicates 
               Hull with his dying father. He feels for a pulse. For breath.

                                     HULL
                              (distraught)
                         He's dying.

                                     ELIAS
                         Let him die. Let him die twice. Come 
                         one.

               He pulls at Hull who won't go. Hull does mouth-to-mouth. 
               Taft opens his eyes, looks up at him.

                                     HULL
                         [Says to Taft whatever a CPR-trained 
                         policeman would say in this 
                         situation.]
                              (to Elias)
                         Get help.

                                     ELIAS
                         Are you kidding me?

                                     TAFT
                              (to Hull, getting it)
                         Oh, man, you're a cop. You're a cop, 
                         aren't you?

                                     HULL
                              (with difficulty, as 
                              if against his will)
                         Yeah, I'm a cop. I'm a fucking cop...

                                     ELIAS
                              (laughs)
                         Oh, really? Where's you badge?

                                     HULL
                         I don't have one. I'm undercover. 
                         Get help, David.

                                     ELIAS
                         John, that's a cop. He tried to kill 
                         you.

                                     HULL
                         He didn't know.

                                     ELIAS
                         Oh, he didn't know. I don't know. 
                         Maybe you don't know. Maybe you think 
                         you're a cop because... because...

                                     HULL
                         Drop the gun, put your hands against 
                         the car. Spread your legs... Police!

               Taft grunts once, stiffens.

                                     HULL
                              (continuing)
                         My God! Please...

               The pulse is gone. Hull begins to perform CPR.

                                     ELIAS
                         Okay, let's say you're a cop. Be a 
                         cop.

               Hull keeps doing CPR.

                                     ELIAS
                              (continuing)
                         We've still got the money. We put it 
                         into Randy's chemistry set. In five 
                         years we're worth five hundred million 
                         each, minimum. You'll be one of the 
                         richest black men in America. Richer 
                         than Cosby. Who gives a shit how you 
                         got it? You think the white ones 
                         were honest?

               Hull keeps working on Taft.

                                     ELIAS
                              (continuing)
                         Is this asshole all that stands 
                         between you and greatness? Let me do 
                         you a favor.

               He puts a gun to Taft's head and FIRES. In a reflex, Hull 
               draws his own gun, SHOOTS Elias in the stomach. Stunned, he 
               wobbles backward a few steps. Sits on the street.

                                     ELIAS
                              (continuing)
                         Gee, John, that's kind of an extreme 
                         reaction.

               Hull is stunned he did it. And this finally attracts the 
               police who see a black man with a gun who just shot a white 
               man.

               Hull goes to Elias who's dead. A POLICEMAN pulls him off, 
               beating him with a gun.

                                     POLICEMAN
                         Fucking nigger...

               INT. LOS ANGELES COUNTY JAIL - DAY

               Hull, bandaged, wearing prison blues, walking with Carver.

                                     HULL
                         What about Guzman?

                                     CARVER
                         He vanished, thank God, or we'd both 
                         be in deep doo-doo. At least you got 
                         Gallegos.

                                     HULL
                         Elias did. And everything goes on as 
                         before.

                                     CARVER
                         That's the drug game. Plus a change... 
                         I want you to come back to work for 
                         me. You'll beat all charges on a 
                         technicality and go back to who you 
                         were.

                                     HULL
                         Who was I, Ger?

                                     CARVER
                         Does anyone really know?

                                     HULL
                         I have other things to do.

                                     CARVER
                         Like travel? Tangiers, maybe?

               Hull looks at him; how did he know?

                                     CARVER
                              (continuing)
                         I'm God, remember?

               He beckons him. He walks him over to a cell. Through a one-
               way window they see:

               BETTY

               alone in the cell, unaware she's being watched.

                                     CARVER
                         Go back to work, she walks out of 
                         here. Otherwise, she's up on multiple 
                         counts, and I'll see to it the judge 
                         runs them consecutively.

               Hull just looks at him. Carver shrugs apologetically.

               INT. ANOTHER ROOM

               Absolutely white. Not a window, not a stick of furniture. 
               The only deviation is Hull in prison blues.

               The door opens, Betty comes in wearing prison yellows. She 
               sits on a nearly invisible chair. They know they're being 
               watched.

                                     MCCUTCHEON
                         They want me to testify against you. 
                         I said I wouldn't.

                                     HULL
                         You have to. It's all set up. That's 
                         how you're getting off.

               She shakes her head in cynical understanding. How difficult 
               it is to get back to an honorable life.

               He takes her hand.

                                     HULL
                              (continuing; with 
                              difficulty)
                         My father didn't have a heart attack.

               She looks at him.

                                     HULL
                              (continuing)
                         He was shot robbing a liquor store. 
                         Trying to rob it. I lied about that.

                                     MCCUTCHEON
                         Baby, why are you telling me this?

                                     HULL
                         I had to start somewhere... There're 
                         other things you don't know...

               AN IRIS SHOT - HULL AND BETTY

               Silent. Kissing. Beginning to make love. Hull extracts 
               himself, gives the finger to the POV and stuffs a bit of 
               tissue in the iris, blocking our view.

               EXT. ROOM - DAY

               Carver takes his eye from the now obscured peephole.

               EXT. A CEMETERY - DAY

               A funeral. Taft's wife and children (from the wallet photo) 
               leave the graveside with the rest of the funeral party.

               When everyone is gone, Hull approaches the grave. From his 
               pocket, he removes the four blood-soaked bills his father 
               gave him, and wedges these among the stems of flowers that 
               already cover the plot.

               He's silent a moment, then he gets up. He joins Carver who's 
               standing with Hull's children. The kids each take his hand, 
               they walk together.

                                     CARVER
                         Betty walked out of court free this 
                         morning. That's my side of the deal.

                                     HULL
                              (to the children)
                         You two run on ahead.

               They do. Hull watches them go.

                                     CARVER
                         Her probation gets revoked the minute 
                         you fuck up. I want you to stay away 
                         from her altogether.

                                     HULL
                         You know the difference between a 
                         black man and a nigger?

               Carver smiles, shakes his head. He likes a good joke. Hull 
               punches him so hard in the stomach that he goes to his knees.

                                     HULL
                              (continuing)
                         The nigger's the one who'd even think 
                         about doing what you tell him.

               He walks away. Still on his knees, doubled over, Carver 
               whispers after him:

                                     CARVER
                         Don't blow your cover.

               FADE OUT.

                       Years ago, we had the Church. That
                       was only a way of saying we had
                       each other. The Knights of Columbus
                       were head-breakers. They took over
                       their piece of the city.

                       Twenty years after an Irishman
                       couldn't get a job, we had the
                       presidency. That's what the niggers
                       don't realize. If I got one thing
                       against the black chaps it's this.

          sundries, fountain drinks...and fronts a bookie operation.

                           (leaning over cluttered

                       Don't make me have to come down
                       here again.

                                 PROPRIETOR
                       Won't happen again, Mr. C.
          
          The frightened proprietor hands over money. Fifty bucks, a
          hundred, doesn't matter. COSTELLO is never the threatener.
          His demeanor is gentle, philosophical. Almost a shrink's
          probing bedside manner. He has great interest in the world
          as he moves through it. As if he originally came from a
          different world and his survival in this one depends on close
          continual observation and analysis.
          
          YOUNG COLIN looks up. CLOSE ON his eyes. He is fourteen or
          fifteen, but small for his age. Bookish.
          
          COSTELLO eyes the proprietor's TEENAGE DAUGHTER, working
          behind the counter. He takes a propane lighter, and,
          strangely, pays for it (the proprietor startled) and waits
          for change. He lights a MORE cigarette with the lighter.
          
                                 YOUNG COSTELLO
                       Carmen's developing into a fine
                       young lady. You should be proud.
                       You get your period yet, Carmen?
          
          The PROPRIETOR is uneasy. COSTELLO turns to YOUNG COLIN
          (about 14) staring at the local hero. Costello reaches up
          above and behind the counter and takes down some cigarettes.
          
                                 YOUNG COSTELLO (CONT'D)
                       You Johnny Sullivan's kid?
          
          COLIN nods.
          
                                 YOUNG COSTELLO (CONT'D)
                       You live with your grandmother?
          
          COLIN nods.
          
                                 YOUNG COLIN
                       Yeah.
          
          COSTELLO tells the Proprietor to takes three loaves of bread
          and some soup off the shelves and puts them in Colin's bag.
          
                                 COSTELLO
                       Get him three loaves of bread. And
                       a couple of half gallons of milk.
                       And some soup.
          
          He goes over to the fridge and puts two half gallons of milk
          in the bag. Some soup. Costello turns to Colin.
          
          
          
                                                                 (CONTINUED)

                    Do you like comic books?
          
          Colin nods.   He adds a couple of comic books.
          
          When the PROPRIETOR looks at him, he takes out the money he
          put in his pocket and gives back half.
          
                              YOUNG COSTELLO
                    You do good in school?
          
          YOUNG COLIN nods, holding the big bag of loot.
          
                                 COLIN
                    Yes.
          
                              YOUNG COSTELLO
                    That's good. I did good in school.
                    They call that a paradox.
          
          He gives some money to Carmen.
          
                              YOUNG COSTELLO (CONT'D)
                    Buy yourself some makeup. Keep the
                    change.
          
          Looks intently at COLIN to see if he gets it.    Colin does.
          
                              YOUNG COSTELLO (CONT'D)
                    You ever want to earn a little
                    extra money, you come by L street.
                    You know where I am on L street.
          
          COLIN nods: everybody does.
          
                                 YOUNG COLIN
                    Thank you.
          
          He pushes out with the bags of groceries.
          
          The PROPRIETOR can do shit about it.
          
          YOUNG COSTELLO watches YOUNG COLIN go off down a slummy
          street.

          COSTELLO is talking informally (we realize that this is a
          continuation of the philosophical talk, the shadowy pacing).
          YOUNG KIDS. Useful young men. YOUNG COLIN, three years older,
          is among them.
          
                                 YOUNG COSTELLO
                       Church wants you in your place.
                       What sort of man wants to be kept
                       in his place? Do this don't do
                       that, kneel, stand, kneel,
                       stand...I mean if you go for that
                       sort of thing...
          
          YOUNG COLIN, the recent altar boy, visibly doesn't go for
          that sort of thing.

                       Today, what I'm saying to you is
                       this: When you are facing a loaded
                       gun...

          ECU: COLIN'S EYES swerve up. We are now on (MATURE) COLIN'S
          EYES eyes. This is how the character transits the "age
          leap"...on the unchanging eyes.

          POLICE TRAINEES. (INCLUDING BARRIGAN, who is included in all
          Colin's trainee scenes). COLIN is in the class, wearing a
          trainee's uniform. He has a notebook, a pen. Writing.

                    The slug enters the skull by
                    forming a small entrance hole.
                    Blood and brain matter is ejected
                    backwards from this hole. The

          see COLIN, firing dry and then speed-changing a clip in a

          STATE POLICE TRAINEES standing in a pissing rain, a DI
          yelling at them OS. COLIN is staring forward. RAIN streaming

          Guys we recognize from the previous shots at the State Police
          Academy (wearing Statie t-shirts), including COLIN and
          BARRIGAN, are playing rugby against some FIREFIGHTERS. Very
          rough game. The game breaks up with each group giving each
          other the finger. FIREFIGHTERS are moving away triumphantly.

          COLIN sits on a bench looking at THE GOLD DOME OF BEACON

                       it. Your father was a janitor, and

                       a long tradition of excellence.
                       Your graduation today solidifies
                       your acceptance into one of the

                       will serve with distinction, honor
                       and integrity.
          
          CAMERA swirls around COLIN as he moves, a lone person,
          through the breaking up crowd. Other graduates are hugged by
          family. COLIN, alone, comes to the gates of the yard.

          COLIN flips open the top and then quickly closes it. NOTE:
          The box could contain an eyeball, money, drugs, a picture of
          Colin fucking his school teacher...we will never know.

          A test is reversed on a desk lit with fluorescents. BILLY
          takes up a Number Two pencil. He is in a room full of
          trainees, far enough along in their traineeship that their
          hair has grown in.

          BILLY takes the test, marking multiple choice answers swiftly
          while all around him trainees are sweating and still trying
          to read the questions.

                       This is not the regular police.
                       This is the state police. Your
                       training will illustrate the

                       our obvious superiority to other
                       forms of police, sir.
          
                                 DRILL INSTRUCTOR

          COLIN, four years a veteran of the gang unit, is on the job,
          on a raid, clearing rooms, part of a team working with
          massive aggression. He moves through a door. A SAD SACK OF
          SHIT is throwing drugs out a window.

                    Douchebag!
          
          COPS enter past Colin and pigpile the man. COLIN is chewing
          gum, all testosterone and aggression, glad to be a cop. The
          smartest guy in the room.

          A BLACK-WINDOWED, MODERN, POLICE BUILDING, beetling over a
          plaza. Older Boston reflected in the featureless glass. The
          Boston of this film is almost futuristic. COLIN looks up at
          the building with great intensity. He puts on his sunglasses
          and walks towards the door.

          As COLIN leaves the office, looking very satisfied and not a
          little saturnine (it's not as if he isn't pleased by
          recognition and it's not as if he won't get revenge on
          Dignam), he barely glances--and does not actually see--the
          TRAINEE sitting off to one side. He sees polished brogues,
          and walks on.

          BILLY looks up. He has not seen COLIN, and COLIN has not seen
          him. He has his interview on his mind.

                       So.
          
          BILLY has no idea why he is in this room with the brass.
          Sgt. Dignam is staring at him aggressively, with contempt,
          stirring his coffee. DIGNAM is more intelligent than he
          seems.

          BILLY doesn't want to answer unless he can answer correctly.
          
                                 BILLY
                       Sir, yes, sir, I have an idea...

                       Whoa, let's say you have no idea
                       and leave it there. No idea. Zip,
                       none. If you had an idea about what
                       we do we would not be good at what
                       we do. We would be cunts. Are you
                       calling us cunts?
          
          BILLY wouldn't normally take crap from this guy; but he does.
          He's openly intrigued by the situation. Dignam is staring at
          him. BILLY looks evenly at QUEENAN.

                       Staff Sergeant Dignam has a style
                       of his own. I'm afraid we all have
                       to deal with it.

          COLIN, in his good suit, moves along the hall. He owns the
          building. He looks into offices. He is looking at his future.
          From one room BARRIGAN (still working in uniform) gives him
          the thumbs up. COLIN gets a coffee. He looks at a secretary's
          ass. Caught at it, he smiles beautifully. She smiles back.
          
                              BARRIGAN
                    What you got?
                        (with admiration and envy)
                    "Staff Sergeant". In four years
                    you're a sergeant.

                       get an answer. So tell me, what's a

                    We deal in deceptions here. But
                    what we don't deal with is self-

          A TROLLEY goes past. HOSPITAL HILL, above the trolley line,
          is sinister, quiet. HOSPITAL at the top like a malign
          fortress, above rows of endlessly repeated condominiums.
          BILLY CROSSES from the Trolley stop, desperately, an angry
          young man at his life's turning point.
          
          INT. A HOSPITAL ROOM. LATER
          
          BILLY'S MOTHER lies as if floating in her bed. Tubes, lights.
          A bald head on a barely-dented pillow. She is a cancer
          patient in a coma, weighing possibly 80 lbs. Gasping for air.
          Her airways are cleared with a suction tube. BILLY sits
          watching as the tube goes in. BILLY sits looking at her.
          
          EXT. THE HOSPITAL CORRIDOR. LATER
          
          BILLY is leaning against a wall. A maternal WASP UNCLE, a not-
          bright guy (pretensions, rather than status), speaks briefly
          to a DOCTOR further along the hall, then approaches BILLY,
          hands in the pocket of a good suit.
          
                              WASP UNCLE

                       done you some good to have a
                       question from time to time. "Am I

                       "Is my wife a money-grubbing
                       whore?" Those are questions.
                            (the UNCLE starts to
                             leave)

                       During the war, Churchill used
                       river mines. He'd float them down
                       the rivers into Germany. They'd
                       either hit something, or not.
                       That's what we'll use you for. I'll
                       float you down the river. The rest
                       will happen. Or it won't...

                       Luck of the Irish. All that and
                       you're still young enough to fuck
                       undergraduates.
          
                                 QUEENAN
                       We can't conceal that you've been a
                       trainee. You'll be convicted of a
                       crime. We're thinking that a guilty
                       plea to assault and battery might
                       make sense.
          
                                 DIGNAM
                       Given your nature.
          
                                 QUEENAN
                       You'll serve enough jail time to
                       convince anyone that it's no set-
                       up. You'll be on probation. The

                       I need you, pal. You've already
                       pretended to be a Costigan from
                       South Boston.
          
          BILLY looks up with a glazed insolence. In one beat he is not
          a scared trainee but a smart criminal.

          EXT. CEMETERY. DAY
          
          Priest's cassock whipping in the wind. A few mourners (shabby
          genteel ladies, contemporaries of his mother), but Billy
          seems to have no real connection with any of them.
          
          LATER
          
          BILLY is alone at the grave. He looks at the tags on wind-
          blown wreaths. One gives him pause. Under a picture of The
          Virgin it reads: "Heaven holds the Faithful Departed" and is
          signed: "F. Costello".
          
          INT. JAIL HOLDING TANK. DAY
          
          A CELL DOOR CLOSES. On Billy. Looking like a real criminal.
          Not a pretend one. Frightened and resolute at once. BILLY is
          in a holding tank.
          
          EXT. THE BALCONY OF COLIN'S APARTMENT. MORNING
          
          COLIN, in a bathrobe, leans on the rail and looks at Boston.
          THE GOLD DOME visible. Colin drinks coffee. Not satisfied:
          worried.
          
          INT. A PROCESSING FACILITY. DAY
          
          BILLY, naked, holds his clothes in a bundle. Being processed
          out of jail. Beside him another guy, furtive, gruff, not
          trying to be friendly.

                         cousin look)
                    No offense.
          
          Billy gets his clothes.

                       Somebody, as you may already know,
                       stole one hundred microprocessors
                       from the Mass Processor Corp out
                       Route 128. They're the kind of
                       processors they put into computers
                       that can put a cruise missile up
                       the ass of a camel from the other
                       side of the planet. That's what
                       they do out there on "America's
                       Technology Highway". Worth a
                       hundred grand apiece. Guy worked

                       out the door with a box of

                           (affably to Billy)
                       You workin'?
          
                                 BILLY
                       No.
          
                                                               28.
          
          
          
          EXT. THE PORCH OF THE THREE-DECKER. LATER
          
          Sean and BILLY are still drinking beer.
          
                              SEAN
                    When did I see you after that?
          
                              BILLY
                    Not for a long time. Down the cape
                    after Rose's wedding. I think.
          
                              SEAN
                    Fuck, oh shit. I remember that,
                    dude. I had that fuckin' buck
                    knife, right, and I cut all the
                    brass numbas off the doors at the
                    hotel. I was trippin'...All of
                    them. That was a night.
          
          Sean looks deflated.
          
                               BILLY
                    Listen, I got twenty thousand
                    dollars when my mother died.
                    Insurance.
          
                                 SEAN
                    Yeah?
          
                              BILLY
                    In your line of work, if I gave you
                    ten thousand dollars what could you
                    give me back?
          
                              SEAN
                    My line of work... I'm not in that
                    line of work just presently because
                    I don't have ten thousand dollars.
                    As a matter of fact I have never
                    had ten thousand dollars.
          
                              BILLY
                    That's what I'm saying.
          
          Sean nods, and nods.
          
                              SEAN
                    You know what we usually say at
                    these moments.

                       You fuckin' moron. What are you
                       talking about? I'm not a cop. I'm
                       your cousin.
          
          INT. BILLY'S CAR. NIGHT
          
          BILLY is waiting. Sean comes out of a squalid looking house
          and gets into a car. Fast. Billy puts the car in gear.
          
                                 SEAN
                       Fuckin' Ricans think they know
                       everything. If they knew shit they
                       wouldn't be Puerto Ricans.
          
          He has a paper bag full of money. He opens a beer.
          
                                 SEAN (CONT'D)
                           (high as a kite)
                       Double the money, double the fun.
                           (confusing his TV jingles)
                       Cinnamon toasty apple bun... R is
                       for Ricans...P is for pigs...
          
          They drive past a BPD cruiser. Sean hides his beer.
          
                                 SEAN (CONT'D)
                       I can't stop drinkin.
          
          BILLY laughs.
          
                                 BILLY
                       Why would you even think of
                       stopping drinking?
          
                                  SEAN
                       He don't like it. He don't like
                       drinkin...he don't like fightin...
                           (Sean looks sad)
                       ...he says stay out of the bars...
                       You know, we're not even supposed
                       to do this on this side of fuckin'
                       Worcester.
          
                                   BILLY
                       Who says?
          
                                 SEAN
                       He says. Costello says. God says,
                       as far as you're concerned.

          INT. A HORRIBLE BAR IN SOUTHIE. NIGHT
          
          Sean, beyond wasted, is talking to some people, including
          MISTER FRENCH. A table wet with spilled beer.
          
                              SEAN
                    Not a cop. He got out of the joint
                    three weeks ago. Dead up. He talks
                    like his shit don't stink but he's
                    good people.
          
                                VILLAIN

                              MISTER FRENCH
                    I knew his father. I liked his
                    uncle Jackie better.
          
                              SEAN
                    Uncle Jackie was excellent.
          
                              AN IRISH VILLAIN
                    Fucking guineas.
          
          They solemnly toast uncle Jackie and his fate among the
          fucking guineas. Across the crowded room, BILLY is ordering
          at the bar.
          
                              BILLY
                    A cranberry juice.
          
                              WELL-DRESSED SCUMBAG AT BAR
                    It's a natural diuretic. My
                    girlfriend drinks it when she got
                    her period.
                        (to BILLY)
                    You got your period?
          
          BILLY glances over at the table where MISTER FRENCH sits with
          SEAN, and then smashes his glass into the face of the WELL
          DRESSED SCUMBAG. He stands waiting for the SCUMBAG to get up
          he is grabbed and shoved against the wall by MISTER FRENCH.
          Popped into a pay phone hard. The pay phone comes off the
          hook.
          
                              BILLY
                    Get your hands off me.
          
                              MISTER FRENCH
                    Do you know me?

          BILLY shakes his head no.
          
                                 MISTER FRENCH
                       I'm the guy who tells you there are
                       guys you hit and there are guys you
                       don't. That's not quite a guy you
                       can't hit, but it's almost a guy
                       you can't hit, so I'm fucking
                       ruling on it right now that you
                       don't hit him, understand?
          
                                 BILLY
                       Yeah. Excellent. Fine.
          
                                 MISTER FRENCH
                       I know you. I know your family.
                       Also I know you do another drug

                       grandmother was very nice to me and
                       cut your fucking nuts off. You
                       understand that?
          
                                 BILLY
                       Yeah.
          
                                 MISTER FRENCH
                       Now you know me.

          COLIN and BARRIGAN (who Colin has moved to plain clothes)
          stand at the door, talking, or trying to talk, with a fearful
          MRS KENNEFICK. MRS KENNEFICK looks like she starts drinking
          whiskey at 9 in the morning.
          
                              COLIN
                    Mrs. Kennefick, Myles and I were in
                    school together. Myles was behind
                    me in school but I knew him. I will
                    get those responsible. Don't you
                    want to see us catch whoever used
                    him to do a robbery and then killed
                    him?
          
                                 MRS KENNEFICK
                    Allegedly.

                              MRS KENNEFICK
                    If he was killed he probably did
                    something wrong.
          
                              COLIN
                    You don't mean robbery do you, Mrs
                    Kennefick? That's not what you
                    think he did wrong.
          
          MRS. KENNEFICK notices COSTELLO driving by.

          She slams the door. As COLIN walks away from the door he
          notices the TAIL: a maroon sedan and a damaged white delivery
          van.
          
                              COLIN

          French steps on it and blows through the light, leaving the

          INT. THE ELEVATOR AT POLICE HEADQUARTERS. DAY
          
          COLIN boards with a bunch of other cops and workers. On
          board, directly beside him, is MADOLYN. COLIN's age,
          beautiful, wearing a business suit. She has a thick stack of
          medical-looking files. She's a psychiatrist on contract to
          the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. She does probation
          counselling work with "violent offenders" and also sees
          policemen.

                                 MADOLYN
                       Have I seen you professionally?
          
                                 COLIN
                       No, no. I know what you do. I know
                       who you are.
          
          MADOLYN nods, and then because this is a (relatively)
          sensitive subject ignores COLIN, but she is visibly attracted
          by him.
          
                                 COLIN (CONT'D)
                       When guys have to "use their
                       "service revolvers" in the "course
                       of duty" they get to talk to you
                       about their "feelings" and whatnot.
          
          MADOLYN laughs.
          
                                 COLIN (CONT'D)
                       No. Oh, I know how it goes. You're
                       a mental health professional.
          
                                 MADOLYN
                           (laughing)
                       I have an appointment on this
                       floor.
          
          The door opens.
          
                                 COLIN
                       That's good. They're all fuckin'
                       crazy on that floor.
                           (points up)
                       I'm one floor up.
          
                                 MADOLYN
                       Oh, fancy policeman.
          
                                 COLIN
                       That's right. Fancy.
          
                                 MADOLYN
                       Are you a Statie?
          
          After she steps out he prevents the door from closing.

                              COLIN
                    Before I went to fucking Suffolk.
          
                              MADOLYN
                    I went to U Mass. I wasn't
                    insulting you.
          
                              COLIN
                    Well I thought you were, and for
                    that you have to take me to dinner.
          
                              MADOLYN
                    Maybe you could shoot someone and
                    I'd have to see you professionally.
          
                              COLIN
                    Whatever it takes. I'll stab
                    someone in the heart with an
                    icepick right now if it gets me
                    dinner with you.
          
          MADOLYN hands him a card.
          
                               COLIN (CONT'D)
                    I don't need a card, I'm a
                    detective.
          
          She hesitates. He takes the card.
          
                              COLIN (CONT'D)
                    I'm only joking. Nice to meet
                    you... "Madolyn".
          
          The doors close. The elevator takes him up. He takes out his
          cellphone as if he's forgotten something. As the doors open,
          the signal bars light up, and the phone rings.

                    I didn't know about your tail until
                    I saw it myself. I couldn't call, I
                    had the other guy with me. Blue
                    sedan and a white delivery van,
                    fucked up with graffiti on the
                    side. The van is audio
                    surveillance. OK, have a nice day.
          
          INT. A COFFEE SHOP IN SOUTHIE. MORNING
          
          The same shop in which YOUNG COSTELLO talked to YOUNG COLIN,
          all those years ago. Two ITALIANS are in the shop, talking
          hard to the Pakistani PROPRIETOR (SINGH). These are hard guys
          but they're not being threatening, just persistent: the guy
          DOES owe them money. BILLY is finishing his breakfast.
          Watching. He goes over. The two GUINEAS are amazed. [Dialog
          on separate document].
          
          Billy is finishing his breakfast. Watching. He goes over....
          
                              BILLY
                    You guys from Providence?
          
          The GUINEAS look at him. The younger one moves to intervene.
          BILLY smiles and destroys them both. Maniacal violence. The
          biggest beatdown in gangster movie history--and obviously
          that's saying something. In the course of the beat-down Billy
          breaks his left hand--a "boxer's fracture". BILLY stands over
          his victims, breathing hard, holding his broken hand.
          
                              PROPRIETOR
                    What have you done to my place! Get
                    out of here.
          
          BILLY goes.
          
          INT. EMERGENCY ROOM. NIGHT
          
          BILLY, unlit cigarette in his mouth, is having his hand
          wrapped in plaster by a lady doctor. In another life he might
          have dated her. Not in this one.
          
          INT. FRENCH RESTAURANT. NIGHT
          
          A romantic restaurant. The best Boston has (which isn't
          saying much, but whatever). COLIN, looking great, a man on
          the rise. MADOLYN in pearls, also looking great. But maybe
          the conversation has lapsed and the date gone south.

                                 MADOLYN
                       That's right. I see "violent
                       offenders".

                                 MADOLYN
                       That's one way to look at it.   Not
                       necessarily.
          
          COLIN wonders if she's breaking his balls. A DESSERT arrives:
          some towering Japanesey concoction with a fan of sugar candy
          spines, sitting in a pool of sauce. COLIN looks at it, fork
          poised. MADOLYN looks at it. He looks up at her.
          
                                 COLIN
                       That have this and they don't have
                       duck l'orange.
          
          MADOLYN smiles: she likes him. Even with the dinner-long
          bitterness over the duck l'orange.
          
                                 MADOLYN
                       Was your dinner OK?
          
                                 COLIN

                            inappropriate wine)
                       Oh, the lobster was excellent. I
                       just thought, French restaurant...
          
          The look at the dessert.
          
                                 MADOLYN
                       I'm waiting for you to make your
                       move.
          
                                 COLIN
                       I don't know what you're gonna do,
                       but if it moves I'm going to arrest
                       it (shoot it).
          
          MADOLYN laughs.    COLIN sees his shot: he's got her laughing.

                    What's it like having people "find
                    themselves?" All day long people
                    "finding themselves." Does it get
                    messy with all those feelings
                    flying around the room?

                    Don't you?
          
                              COLIN
                    Yes, course I do.
                        (a beat)
                    What Freud said about the Irish is
                    We're the only people impervious to
                    psychoanalysis.

                    Including the criminals?

                    If they don't do their jobs you
                    don't have one.
          
                              COLIN
                    Me? I'd just arrest innocent
                    people. I'll arrest you right now.
          
                              MADOLYN
                    You're trouble.
          
                              COLIN
                    You don't know the half of it.
          
          INT. A HORRIBLE BAR IN SOUTHIE. NIGHT
          
          A slow night. BILLY IS AT THE BAR bent over a glass of
          cranberry juice. The women available are two CRONES. [Dialog
          on separate document]. Stark contrast to COLIN'S EVENING. A
          BOOKMAKER on the phone. BILLY, by the glances of people
          looking at him, has made his bones. He's treated with
          respect. His hand and wrist in a cast. Out of nowhere (though
          Billy is aware conversation has stopped he does not look
          around)...
          
          COSTELLO sits down beside him AT THE BAR.
          
          BILLY observes:
          
          MISTER FRENCH sitting down at a far table. Watching. Covering
          the room.
          
          COSTELLO is brought a glass of water by the silent bartender.
          No sound whatsoever in the bar.
          
          
                                                            (CONTINUED)
          
                                                                  40.
          CONTINUED:
          
          
          They say nothing, look at each other. BILLY notices DELAHUNT
          and FITZY, entering. They stand by MISTER FRENCH.
          
          BILLY sits motionless.
          
                                 COSTELLO
                       Do you know who I am?
          
          BILLY does: but shakes his head.
          
                                 BILLY
                       No.
          
                                 COSTELLO
                       You met my friend, Mister French
                       the other night.
          
                                 BILLY
                       Is his real name Mister French?
          
                                 COSTELLO
                       No.
                            (a beat)
                       Come with me.
                            (As BILLY hesitates)
                       I'm not the cops. I'm not askin'
                       you.
          
          BILLY stands up. MISTER FRENCH stands up. BILLY, COSTELLO,
          and MISTER FRENCH move towards the back room. As they walk to
          the back room of the bar, we hear COSTELLO:
          
                                 COSTELLO (CONT'D)
                       You know something, they just do
                       not stop having the Mafia in
                       Providence, and this can cause
                       problems for me.
          
          INT. BACK ROOM OF THE BAR. CONTINUOUS.
          
                                 COSTELLO
                       Those guys you tuned up are
                       connected down Providence. What
                       they're going to do is come back up
                       with some guys and kill you.
                       Which, sure as you're born, they
                       will do unless I stop them. Do you
                       want me to stop them?
          
                                 BILLY
                       Is it something I can't do
                       personally?
          
          
                                                             (CONTINUED)

          CONTINUED:
          
          
          COSTELLO appreciates the balls of this. He looks at Mister
          French. Then back at Billy, smiling.
          
                                 COSTELLO
                       I'm going to have my associate
                       search you.
          
          BILLY tenses. Exactly as he might if he were wearing a wire.
          
                                 BILLY
                       Search me? Search me for what?
          
          MISTER FRENCH and COSTELLO look at each other.
          
                                    MISTER FRENCH
                       C'm here.
          
                                 COSTELLO
                       Contra-fucking-band.    Take your
                       fuckin' shoes off.
          
                                    MISTER FRENCH
                       Shoes off.
          
          BILLY slips out of them. MISTER FRENCH inspects the shoes.
          COSTELLO'S cold eyes are on BILLY. MISTER FRENCH searches
          BILLY. Looks into his wallet. The wallet is emptied onto a
          table.
          
                                 COSTELLO
                       I knew your father.
          
                                 BILLY
                       Yeah. He's dead.
          
                                    COSTELLO
                       I'm sorry.     How did he go?
          
                                 BILLY
                       He didn't complain.
          
                                 COSTELLO
                       That was his problem.
          
                                 BILLY
                       Who said he had a fuckin' problem.
          
                                 COSTELLO
                       I just said he had a fuckin'
                       problem. There's a man could have
                       been anything.

                    Are you saying he was nothing?
          
                              COSTELLO
                    I'm saying he worked at the
                    airport.
          
          COSTELLO turns to MISTER FRENCH.
          
                              MISTER FRENCH
                    He's clean.
          
                               COSTELLO
                    The arm.
          
          With amazing violence MISTER FRENCH smashes the cast on the
          corner of a table. Billy drops to his knees in tears of pain.
          MISTER FRENCH sorts through the pieces of the cast. Ad libs:
          "such a fuckin' pussy."
          
                              COSTELLO (CONT'D)
                        (holding Billy by the
                         collar)
                    It makes me curious to see you in
                    this neighborhood. Regressing.
                    And, if I can slander my own
                    formative environment, it makes me
                    sad, this regressing. Plus, I don't
                    know if it's beyond some cop prick
                    like fucking Queenan to pull you
                    out of the Staties, and send you
                    after me. I just can't know. I
                    don't know what they do in...that
                    department, anyway.
          
          He grabs Billy's broken right hand.
          
                              COSTELLO (CONT'D)
                    Are you still a cop?
          
                               BILLY
                    No.
          
          COSTELLO twists Billy's broken hand.
          
                              COSTELLO
                    You swear on your mother's grave
                    that you're not a cop.
          
                              BILLY

                              BILLY
                    Yes!
          
          COSTELLO lets go of Billy's hand. Billy is weeping on the
          floor. COSTELLO straightens his suit.
          
                              COSTELLO
                    Take it easy. Get your hand taken
                    care of. I'm sorry. It was
                    necessary. As for our problem with

          SEAGULLS squabble over unusual food. POWER PLANT IN THE
          DISTANCE, the MTA-train going by. TWO BODIES lie in a tidal
          ditch in the salt-marsh. They are the Italians who Billy
          fought in the restaurant. Hands taped together behind their
          backs. Two in the head each. COLIN is with the LYNN POLICE
          and the State Police forensics people. COLIN gets down and
          lifts a soaking lapel. Revealed is the tag of a men's shop in
          Providence.
          
                              COLIN
                    The principles of detection tell me
                    that these men came from
                    Providence.
          
                              LYNN DETECTIVE
                    I'd appreciate it if you got out of
                    my crime scene.
          
                              COLIN
                    This is my crime scene, but knock
                    yourself out.
          
          COLIN gets up. He walks back across the marsh. Opens his cell
          phone.

                    I saw a dead guy. I think I have
                    post traumatic stress. You
                    available for lunch? See you then.

                    at Jimmy Pappas for the hit. Of
                    course he had nothing to do with it

          COSTELLO lifts a piece of plastic on the table revealing a
          severed human hand. BILLY tries to conceal his shock.

                    The point with John Lennon is a man
                    can look at anything and make
                    something out of it. For instance,
                    I look at you and I think what can

                       Hi, Captain. And our primary
                       target is obviously Frank Costello.
                       But we don't communicate with
                       anyone else in this shop. Queenan
                       is compartmentalizing everything in
                       SIU. It's the right thing to do,
                       personally I don't trust these
                       fucking troopers either. We think
                       we might have a problem. We think
                       Costello's got a rat in the State
                       Police.

                       No. Ah...not presently. Not

          A HARD GUY sitting reaches inside his coat. BILLY in a flash
          breaks his jaw with a pistol barrel and then covers the
          sprawled HARD GUY with the gun.

                       Very interesting.
          
                                 BILLY
                       Yeah, well. Fuck.

                       Don't worry about it. Guy didn't
                       need need his teeth anyway. Maybe
                       if he was an Eskimo. But in this
                       country we eat a variety of items.

                       Okay! You gonna give me shit, it
                       wasn't no reason----he put his hand

          He takes out a cell phone and hands it to BILLY.

                       Here. From now on call the bar and

                       for Mikey because there's no Mikey.

                       you use a phone which is not clean,

          INT. A HARBOR RESTAURANT. BOSTON. DAY
          
          A lobster-bib kind of place. DAYTIME DRINKERS, MICKS in bad
          boat shoes, hyper-aware of... COSTELLO and BILLY in a back
          table. COSTELLO, having finished his lunch, is drawing. Billy
          is unused to being the subject of so many stares. He has sort
          of a coked-out nervousness, dirty hair.
          
                              BILLY
                    Don't look. There's a white van
                    across the parking lot?
          
          WE see it through the smeared glass: the WHITE VAN we always
          see. This time with a different magnetic business sign.

                    They don't have directional

          BILLY registers what seems to be inside information.
          COSTELLO looks over his half-glasses at Billy's untouched
          food. COSTELLO is sizing Billy up: has been thinking about
          him.

          be.

                    tell the difference between a rock
                    star and a career criminal.
          
                              BILLY

                       Christ, we got a nice day by the

          TWO PRIESTS and a NUN are sitting two tables over. An older
          priest and a younger one. COSTELLO notices. THE NUN gets up
          and leaves.
          
                                 COSTELLO (CONT'D)
                       You know if your father were alive
                       and saw you, sitting here with me,
                       let's say he would have a word with
                       me about this, in fact, he'd kill
                       seven guys just to cut my throat.
                       And he could do it, which is
                       something you may not know about
                       William Costigan, Sr.

                                 COSTELLO
                       He kept his own counsel. He never
                       wanted money. You can't do a thing
                       with a man like that. Your uncle
                       Jackie needed a lot of money. But
                       even though he got his money from
                       me, he also would kill my entire
                       fucking family if he saw me here
                       with you. And I think about this.
          
                                 BILLY
                       So what are talking about here?
          
                                 COSTELLO
                       Fact is you're not a guy fresh from
                       the zoo who wants to run a spring
                       water distributor and I don't see
                       you up the dog track as a general

                       Look at it this way. It's like a
                       tuba. I want to see if I can get
                       something out of it.

                    Well that's your problem. Maybe
                    someday you'll wake the fuck up.
          
          He gets up and leaves the table, leaving BILLY sitting there.

          The OLDER PRIEST is very nervous, looking around. The YOUNGER
          PRIEST concerned for his elder but personally not implicated.
          COSTELLO leans over the OLDER PRIEST, a pathetic man.

          INT. BASEMENT - NIGHT
          
          FITZY beats up a guy with a pipe.   Billy watches from the
          background.
          
          EXT. WATERFRONT - NIGHT
          
          FITZY and the Costello gang blow up a car as Billy watches.
          Laughing, they hop in their vehicles and drive off.
          
          INT. ELLERBY'S OFFICE. MORNING
          
          OFFICE decorated with golf implements. ELLERBY has a
          hangover. Sunglasses. Eating baby aspirin by the small
          fistful.
          
                              COLIN
                    I'm not making enough progress with
                    Costello?
          
                              ELLERBY
                    "Progress" is hard to define. I
                    make progress every day. In fact,
                    I'm making progress now. There are
                    guys in this department make
                    excellent progress for twenty years
                    without ever getting anything you
                    could definitively call a result.
                    It's like any American industry.
                    Nobody minds if you don't succeed
                    as long as you don't fuck up.
          
          He has a bowl of ice water on his desk.
          
                              ELLERBY (CONT'D)
                    Objectives get lost sight of: fair
                    enough. Who did the two guys from
                    Providence?
          
                              COLIN

                              ELLERBY
                    And what happened to Jimmy Pappas?
          
                              COLIN
                    He had a heart attack in jail and
                    got knifed in his bed at Boston
                    City Hospital. I believe it's been
                    in the papers.
          
          ELLERBY stares at COLIN.

                                 COLIN
                       It's a result.
          
                                 ELLERBY
                       Yeah, but cui bono? Who benefits.
          
                                 COLIN
                       Cui gives a shit. It's got a bow on
                       it.
          
                                 ELLERBY
                           (with true appreciation)
                       I think you are a cop, my son.
          
          He drops his face into the bowl of ice water.
          
          INT. BILLY'S MOTHER'S APARTMENT. MORNING
          
          A stripped HOSPITAL BED stands in a fall of light. This is
          the apartment where his mother became ill. Billy has packed
          half of his mother's things into boxes--and then stopped.
          Billy doesn't use the bedroom. He sleeps on the couch among
          boxes of pictures, papers, teacups wrapped in newspaper.
          BILLY is sitting on the couch. He reaches into a box and lays
          out photographs like cards. Scenes from his life. His former
          life. His family life, his life as a child, his romantic
          life. He sits and stares at the pictures. He rearranges the
          photographs in different ways.
          
          NOTE: THIS IS A MEMORY BILLY HAS AS HE IS LOOKING AT
          PHOTOGRAPHS ON HIS MOTHER'S APARTMENT.
          
          FRENCH and BILLY break in, surprising the MAN (BRIAN), seated
          at his dining room table. He throws a child's toy at them.
          FRENCH ducks out of the way and the toy hits BILLY in the
          cheek.
          
          FRENCH draws his pistol and approaches the table. BRIAN
          rises and starts to flee. Cut off, he retreats the other
          way.
          
                                 BRIAN
                       No, please...
          
                                 FRENCH
                       Brian, stop it, I ain't gonna hurt
                       you.

          CONTINUED:
          
          
          He fires, using a soda bottle as a silencer. BRIAN drops to
          the floor. FRENCH approaches him assessing his victim.
          
          He turns to leave, passing BILLY.     He give him a slap.
          
                                 FRENCH (CONT'D)
                       Wake the fuck up.
          
          They leave.
          
          EXT. A BEACH NEAR A POWERPLANT. DAY
          
          BILLY leans against the wall of a concession stand. His
          knuckles are cut. A cut over his eye. He is agitated.
          Smoking. A car pulls up and Queenan and Dignam get out of it.
          In appearance, if anybody's watching, they're bracing Billy.
          
                                  QUEENAN
                       Hey.   Let's go through the routine.
          
                                 DIGNAM
                       You think you can pop someone.
                       There's no special card to play.
                       The guy whose jaw you broke was
                       Boston Police Department.
          
                                 BILLY
                       I'm going fuckin' nuts. I can't be
                       someone else every day.
          
                                 DIGNAM
                       Most of the people in the world do
                       it every day. What's the big deal?
          
          Dignam is drinking coffee.
          
                                 BILLY
                       I'm not them.
          
                                 DIGNAM
                       You're nobody. You signed the
                       paper. We're the only people in
                       the world who know that you're a
                       cop. Maybe we'll just erase your
                       file.
          
          This is Billy's deepest fear.

                       And zip, you're a soldier for
                       Costello, open to arrest for how
                       many felonies? Maybe we'll do
                       that.
          
                                 BILLY
                       Maybe I'll fucking kill you.
          
          He gets free of DIGNAM and punches him.
          
                                   QUEENAN
                       Easy now.    That was a joke, Billy.
          
                                 DIGNAM
                       Just because you play a fucking
                       tough guy doesn't mean you are one,
                       you lace curtain fucking pussy.
          
          The fight. QUEENAN grabs Billy and holds him against the
          wall.
          
                                  QUEENAN

                             calming a wild animal)
                       Be smart. If someone was watching
                       how are we supposed to not arrest
                       you?
          
          BILLY looks desperately inland.
          
          REVERE BEACH condominium buildings. A thousand empty
          terraces, five thousand empty windows. BILLY is desperate.

                       Keep your act together. It's just a
                       little while longer.
          
          BILLY nods, out of it. DIGNAM is looking at blood on his
          hands in disbelief.
          
                                 BILLY
                       When are you going to take
                       Costello? What's wrong with taking
                       'em on any one of the million
                       felonies you've seen him do. Get

          COLIN walks into the office. BROWN and other team members are

                    Uniform clipped him on the Pike for
                    a suspended licence. However, as

                              COLIN

                    We can't get an address off him.
                    He paged his lawyer but the lawyer
                    hasn't called back yet.

                    All right.
          
          COLIN glances around and sees: a briefcase lying on a desk.
          He picks it up. He takes off his ID badge and tosses it on a
          desk.

                       I'm gonna take this.
          
          He picks up a BRIEFCASE. BARRIGAN touches two buttons and
          switches off the sound recorder and video feed. COLIN goes
          into the interrogation room.

          FITZY looks up at COLIN hopefully. COLIN says nothing. He
          sits down, opens his case, takes out a yellow pad.

                       any statements or phone calls I
                       need to be aware of?

                       It's all right. Guys tend to make
                       a big deal out of it. It's
                       actually quite common.

                    That's part of what I do. Although,

                    were kicked out of the Academy.

                    Sometimes they cry if they had
                    trouble at home or if they've had
                    to...use their weapons.
          
                              BILLY
                    Let me tell you something. They
                    signed up to use their fuckin'
                    weapons. Most of them. But they
                    watch enough TV so they know they
                    have to "weep" after they use their
                    weapons. No one's more full of shit
                    than a cop. Except a cop on TV.

                    here?
          
                              BILLY
                    I have to come here.
          
                              MADOLYN
                    I know it's not elective...on your
                    part...but, now that you're here,
                    what do you want?
          
                              BILLY
                    You want the truth?
                        (a beat)
                    Valium.
          
                              MADOLYN
                    If you lied, you'd have an easier
                    time getting what you wanted.
          
                              BILLY
                    What's that say about what you do
                    for a living?
          
          Madolyn is taken aback. She closes her file.
          
                              MADOLYN
                    Look, I think we better have a few
                    more meetings before we can even
                    talk about prescriptions.
          
          She closes his file and puts it in the rack behind her.
          
                              BILLY
                    I'm having panic attacks. You
                    didn't even ask about that. Last
                    night I thought I was having a
                    fucking heart attack. I puked in a
                    trash barrel on the way in here, I
                    haven't slept for weeks.

                    Is this true?
          
                              BILLY
                    Yes. I said something true. I want
                    some fucking pills and you close my
                    file? I thought I was supposed to
                    tell the truth here.
          
                              MADOLYN
                    Yes, you are.
          
                              BILLY
                    If only fuckin' here.
          
          She retrieves his folder.
          
                              BILLY (CONT'D)
                        (giving into stress)
                    Guy comes in in pain, against every
                    instinct of ...privacy, of, of,
                    self reliance... that he has, and
                    you don't help him? You send him
                    off to score smack on the fucking
                    street?! (Is that what you do, Mrs.
                    Fuckin' Doctor?)
          
          MADOLYN stares at him, then lowers her eyes, takes out a
          small packet of two pills. She hands it over to him. BILLY
          looks at it.
          
                                 BILLY (CONT'D)
                    Two pills.
          
          She nods. BILLY reaches out and deliberately places the pills
          on the desk.
          
                              BILLY (CONT'D)
                    Why don't you just give me a bottle
                    of scotch and a handgun to blow my
                    fucking head off. Are we done here
                    with this psychiatry bullshit?
          
          MADOLYN is taken aback, guilty, astonished.
          
                              MADOLYN
                    You can leave!
          
                              BILLY
                    What if that was a legitimate
                    threat? (Hot shot).

          EXT. PLAZA OUTSIDE THE OFFICE BUILDING. DAY
          
          Very windy. Papers blowing. Billy is walking. Madolyn catches
          up to him.
          
                              MADOLYN
                    Why is the hardest patient of the
                    day always the last one?
          
                              BILLY
                    Because you're bored and tired and
                    don't give a shit. It's not
                    supernatural.
          
                              MADOLYN
                    Look, I'm not just...somebody you
                    have to see or they put you in
                    jail. If you are in distress I will
                    help you.
          
          Madolyn holds out a paper and a business card.
          
                              BILLY
                    What's this?
          
                              MADOLYN
                    My card. And a prescription for
                    twenty Lorazepam.
          
          BILLY stands holding the prescription.
          
                              BILLY
                    Is it enough to kill myself?
          
                              MADOLYN
                        (she fixes him with a
                         stare)
                    Maybe it is. All right? Have I done
                    my job up to your goddamned
                    standards? Because by my standards
                    you fit the model of drug-seeking
                    behavior, and fuck you if you don't
                    like my initial clinical reaction.

          INT. COMMAND CENTER (UPSTAIRS). NIGHT. A WEEK LATER
          
          It's an otherwise disused floor of a new luxury office
          building. Cables and monitors and computers everywhere. It's
          crawling with State Cops as well as FBI (LAZIO is present,
          very nattily dressed). COLIN comes in with BROWN and
          BARRIGAN. This operation is all new to Colin.
          
                                 ELLERBY
                       All right, let's bring it in,

                           (addressing room)
                       Our target is a major transaction
                       of microprocessors. Yes, those. I
                       don't know what they are. You
                       don't know what they are. Who
                       gives a fuck? Cash will be handed
                       over in a building which we have
                       under AV surveillance. Staff
                       Sergeant Sullivan's team...
                           (he nods at COLIN)
                       Will ID the bad guys and listen in
                       on the phones.

          ON COLIN as he reflexively touches his cell phone and thinks
          about the best way out of this.

          COLIN wanders off in the mill of officers. He is taking out
          his cell phone when ELLERBY comes up to him.

                       Sorry to get you at the last

          ELLERBY walks on to a COFFEE STATION, a yard away.

                    Thank you, Captain.
          
          He gives him the clipboard, Colin goes to the work area.

          COLIN joins his team (BROWN AND BARRIGAN), who are seated in
          a U shaped work-area. COLIN, still stunned by the fact of
          this operations center, swallows as he notices on video three
          angles of a building he seems to know very well. He sits down
          and puts a headset on. A GEEK COP leans over and shakes his
          hand.
          
                              GEEK COP
                    Piece of cake. I'll operate the

          A LOCAL CHINESE-AMERICAN MAN acting as the interpreter and
          fixer stands waiting near a SUITCASE on the floor. With the
          CHINESE GANGSTERS is a more official looking MAN IN A BAD

                    gents have machine guns.
          
          COSTELLO takes it all in. The CHINESE GANGSTER looks like a
          Malay pirate. Costello's gunmen are perched above, automatic
          weapons trained on the Triad.
          
          BILLY sneaks a message to Queenan via Text Message,"$" to

          raise their MACHINE GUNS. They don't aim them.

          To Billy's surprise both Costello's men and the Chinese head
          out through the back industrial windows onto a canal-side
          pier.

                    Don't tell me those cars were
                    empty. Please don't tell me those
                    Chinamen's cars were empty.

                    Do you have a camera in the back.
          
          An IMAGE comes up. Nothing.

          Tied to the pier there are two boats, a NOVI LOBSTER BOAT and
          a BOSTON WHALER with a guys we've never seen at the wheel
          (random getaway hires). The TRIAD members get into the NOVI,
          and chug away. Fitzy carries the SUITCASES OF MONEY onto a
          BOSTON WHALER and it takes off. COSTELLO turns to Billy.
          
                              COSTELLO
                    See, no surveillance here. They

                    Always figure an exit for your
                    business partners. What with
                    everything all dug up, you can't
                    trust a slant to find the Mass Pike
                    and, with or without Staties out
                    front, frankly I don't approve of
                    orientals driving to begin with.

          The CHINESE GUYS, staring back, chug away down the canal in

          then follows him.

          A few blocks from the target building, a Police Tactical unit
          stops the departing Triad cars with a roadblock. As officers
          approach the cars they realize they are empty except for
          hired Caucasian drivers. An officer reports this to the
          command center.
          
          INT. COLIN'S APARTMENT. DAY
          
          Colin is asleep on the couch, in a bachelor disaster of
          Chinese food boxes. Something on TV: "Audition." A key in
          the door: He wakes as MADOLYN comes in carrying a bag of
          coffees and a BOX OF EFFECTS.
          
                                 MADOLYN
                       Good Morning.
          
          MADOLYN smiles at him, also shy.
          
                                 COLIN
                       Good morning.
          
                                 MADOLYN
                       I beat the movers.
          
                                 COLIN
                       How was the last night in the, ah,
                       old establishment?
          
                                 MADOLYN
                       (putting the box on the kitchen
                       counter)
                       Lonely.
          
                                  COLIN
                       I'm glad to hear that.   It sucked
                       here, too.
          
          They kiss.    MADOLYN takes in the apartment.
          
                                 MADOLYN
                       I'm gonna thank your Uncle
                       Alphonsus for the square footage.
          
                                 COLIN
                       Uncle Alphonsus is in heaven.   So
                       am I.

                                 MADOLYN
                       French donut?
          
                                 COLIN
                           (re: box of stuff)
                       Yeah. Hey, can I...
          
                                    MADOLYN
                       Sure yeah.
          
          He sorts through the box. It's all Madolyn's key stuff - a
          mug, a few critical books...framed family pictures,
          breakables...and comes up with: A PHOTOGRAPH of a young
          Madolyn standing in front of a North East rust belt slum.
          
                                 COLIN
                       Well, we're not having this out.
          
                                    MADOLYN
                       What?
          
          MADOLYN isn't prepared to be at cross-purposes. But she is
          taken aback. She puts the photo quietly away. Contaminated.
          
                                 COLIN
                       You don't see any pictures of where
                       I came from. Look, I respect who
                       you are, but not in the living
                       room. We might have company.
          
                                    MADOLYN
                       Company?
          
          She laughs.    COLIN looks at a diploma.     Veritas.
          
                                 COLIN
                       Why work for the state?
          
                                  MADOLYN
                       Why not?   You do.
          
                                  COLIN

                    Answer it.     You live here.
          
          MADOLYN, not 100% confused by his seizing on the
          interruption, gets the phone.

          After a moment she holds the receiver out to COLIN.

                         and whispers)
                    A cancer guy.
          
          COLIN reaches in his pocket and looks at his cellphone: dead.
          A bad mistake in his situation. He crams the phone into a
          table charger beside the landline and takes the handset.

                       own life.)

                                 BILLY
                       So how long you been with this guy?
          
                                 MADOLYN
                       Oh, four months. About four months.
          
                                 BILLY
                       You love this guy?
          
                                 MADOLYN
                       It's pretty serious, yeah, it is.
          
                                  BILLY
                       A head case or anything?    I'm just
                       curious...
          
                                 MADOLYN
                       No more than I am.

                       Then you're lucky.   Considering the
                       odds, right?
          
          He lifts his cup to drink.
          
                                 BILLY (CONT'D)
                       Good, give him a shot.
          
          This may not be exactly what Madolyn wants to hear. But she
          nods.
          
                                  MADOLYN
                       Doctors aren't supposed to have
                       illusions.
          
                                 BILLY
                       Yeah, that's because of vastly
                       superior intelligence. Godlike,
                       really.
          
          Smiles, called on her shit.
          
                                 MADOLYN
                       OK, I'm in a serious, newly
                       serious, relationship...there
                       are...ups and downs...everybody has
                       doubts, problems -- I mean doubts.
          
          She realizes she may have glazed and gone a little too far on
          "problems".
          
                                 BILLY
                       What would you do if he was
                       standing right there and saw us?
          
                                MADOLYN
                       I'd lie. To keep things on an even
                       keel. You know all about it.
          
          INT./EXT. BANKROBBER'S APARTMENT. CHARLESTOWN. DAY
          
          The BANKROBBER, a junkie, wakes up to a vision: JESUS,
          indicating the sacred heart.
          
          BILLY smashes the glass and the frame over the guy's head.
          
          CUT TO OUTSIDE:
          
          MISTER FRENCH has lit a cherry-bomb. He throws it. He hands
          out fireworks to KIDS.

          BACK INSIDE:
          
          BILLY shoves him down on the couch and crams the gun to his
          head.
          
                                 BILLY
                       You take off an armored car at the
                       Dedham Mall and what do you do. Do
                       you pay guineas in Providence?
          
                                 BANKROBBER
                       Fucking now I do.
          
                                 BILLY
                       What the fuck do you do.
          
                                 BANKROBBER
                       What, I pay Costello and wait for
                       him to trade me to the FBI? Cause
                       that's what he does.
          
                                 BILLY
                       FBI? What the fuck are you talking
                       about.
          
          {Firecrackers off}
          
                                 BANKROBBER
                       Oh my God, is that French out
                       there?
          
                                 BILLY
                           (grabbing him by the
                            shirt)
                       What the fuck did you just say
                       about the FBI?
          
                                 BANKROBBER
                       Forget what I said. I'm fucking
                       high, I'm high.
          
          Firecrackers continue to go off outside. The BANKROBBER knows
          what this means.
          
                                 BILLY
                       Whatever's going through your very
                       poor, very limited, brain...I'm not
                       going to hurt you. Just tell me
                       what you just fucking said.

                    Forget it, I'm high, I must be
                    high, I would never say what you
                    thought I said.
          
          As the firecracker sounds increase outside (Maybe French's
          "Do what you have to do"), BILLY, no way out of what he has
          to do, glances at the window, shoots the guy through the
          kneecap. BLOOD sprays everywhere. The bankrobber screams.
          
                              BILLY
                    Tell me what the fuck you said.
          
                              BANKROBBER
                        (covered with blood)
                    Why do you think he's not arrested?
                    Costello's a protected FBI
                    informant. He'll trade you out.
                        (a beat)
                    I thought I was supposed to go into
                    shock. I'm not in shock. It fucking
                    hurts. It fucking hurts.
          
          BILLY gets out of the house.
          
          OUTSIDE
          
          MISTER FRENCH is benignly watching kids light cherry bombs.
          
                                BILLY
                    Let's go.
          
          ON SOUND: Sextet from LUCIA di LAMMAMOOR.
          
          INT. A THEATER. NIGHT
          
          From behind COSTELLO'S HEAD, which almost fills the frame, we
          see a blur of beautiful color. ON STAGE, an opera is in
          progress----LUCIA DI LAMMAMOOR done with masks. CUT TO
          COSTELLO, revealing Costello's rapt face and PAN to reveal on
          his Left a beautiful WHITE PROSTITUTE. PAN back over
          COSTELLO'S face to reveal a beautiful BLACK PROSTITUTE.
          PERFORMERS with MASKS sing on stage. As the music soars,
          COSTELLO moves crinolines up the women's legs.
          
          INT. A BEDROOM. NIGHT.
          
          COSTELLO fucks...and fucks weird.

          EXT. QUEENAN'S HOUSE IN WEST ROXBURY. NIGHT
          
          A street of three-deckers. QUEENAN gets out of his unmarked
          cruiser. As he does: BILLY steps out into the light. The two
          men stare at each other, each lit by their own streetlight.
          
                              BILLY
                    Hey, it's me.
          
                              QUEENAN
                    What do you want? What are you
                    doing here?
          
                                 BILLY
                    Come here.
          
          QUEENAN approaches him.
          
                              BILLY (CONT'D)
                    Costello is giving people up to the
                    FBI.
          
          QUEENAN stares.

                    The FBI?
          
                              BILLY
                    He gives information to the FBI.
                    He's a protected informant. Aren't
                    they trying to make it a Federal
                    case? And it never gets made?
          
                               QUEENAN
                        (realizing he has to be
                          very careful)
                    Go around the back. Go around the
                    back.
          
          INT. QUEENAN'S HOUSE. MOMENTS LATER
          
          BILLY sits on a bench in a hallway, exhausted, staring. THE
          SACRED HEART and JFK are on the walls. QUEENAN comes along
          the hall.
          
                              QUEENAN
                    My wife's asleep. She left supper
                    out. Come and have something to
                    eat.
          
          BILLY shakes his head.

                       We'll talk in the kitchen. Come and
                       have something to eat.
          
          BILLY follows him towards the lighted kitchen door.
          
          EXT. DRIVING RANGE. DAY (WINDY)
          
          COLIN is watching ELLERBY hit golf balls. Well.
          
                                 ELLERBY
                       Congratulations. Haven't seen a guy
                       like you since me. You'll be
                       transferred to Internal
                       Investigations but you will
                       continue to work right where you
                       are in the Special Investigation
                       Unit.

                                 ELLERBY
                       We are all convinced that Costello
                       has at least one mole in the
                       Special Investigation Unit.
          
                                  COLIN
                       Right.

                       We have considered all possible
                       candidates. You have an immaculate
                       record. Some people never trust a
                       guy with an immaculate record. I
                       do.

                       That's a pity. Pretty much sucks as
                       a game but you get to form
                       relationships.

                       Everything's great. On schedule.
                       She's a doctor.

                       Outstanding. That's good. Marriage
                       is an important part of getting
                       ahead. You don't want anyone
                       thinking you're a homo. Married guy
                       seems stable. People look at a
                       wedding ring and think: someone can
                       stand the son of a bitch. Ladies
                       see the wedding ring and know
                       immediately that you must have some
                       cash and that your cock works.
          
                                 COLIN
                       Oh, it's working. Overtime.
          
                                 ELLERBY
                       I'm glad to hear that.
          
          Hits a drive. Ponk.
          
          EXT. CONSTRUCTION AREA. DAY
          
          HEAVY EQUIPMENT stands on the thrashed earth. Hoardings.
          BILLY crosses the road under what remains of the Expressway,
          and after hiding in an angle of the building and cocking the
          gun in his pocket bangs on the door of a dead bar. The door
          is unlocked by: DELAHUNT.
          
          INT. THE DEAD BAR. DAY
          
          It's another of COSTELLO'S "locations". BILLY looks around.
          Every man from the previous night is there--but no COSTELLO.
          DELAHUNT closes the door behind him and bars it. Men are
          oddly enough filling out forms. These are not men used to
          pencil and paper. Billy is nodded at.

                                 BILLY
                       I don't have a bank account.
          
                                 MISTER FRENCH
                       I'm a cash business myself.

                       What's he doing, setting up IRAs?
          
                                 MISTER FRENCH
                       You fill in the papers, real name,
                       all your numbers, no fucking
                       around, and then we all wait here.
          
                                 MISTER FRENCH (CONT'D)
                       No, I ain't.
          
          MISTER FRENCH goes off into a separate room. BILLY takes a
          paper and, sitting at the bar beside FITZY, writes down his
          information. The other men are mostly finished and DELAHUNT
          is collecting the papers. DELAHUNT tosses the brown envelope
          on the bar.
          
                                 DELAHUNT
                       Put the forms in there.
          
                                 FITZY
                       I don't know if this is how you
                       spell Citizens'.
          
          BILLY glances at what FITZY is crawling: CITTIZINS TRUST.
          
                                 BILLY
                       No, no, no. Jesus Christ.
          
          He takes the brown envelope, and writes on it CITIZENS.
          
                                 FITZY
                       What are you, retarded? That ain't
                       right.
          
          BILLY gives up. Both of their forms are stuffed in an
          envelope. BILLY gets up.
          
                                 DELAHUNT
                       Billy, he said to stay here.

                    Where you going?
          
          BILLY goes out. DELAHUNT puts his coat on. He picks up the
          brown envelope on which CITIZENS TRUST is written.
          
          EXT. THE WATERFRONT. DAY
          
          BILLY is holding his bottle of tranqs. He traces with his
          finger the doctor's name...MADOLYN MADDEN. His "police" phone
          vibrates and he takes it out.

          BILLY deletes the IM and dials Queenan directly.
          
                              BILLY

          Costello emerges, in an overcoat. Carrying the envelope. He
          gets into his Oldsmobile. BILLY starts his car and follows.
          
          INT. CINEMA. NIGHT   REVISED ON SET 5/31/05
          
          Dark theater, movie in progress. Wobbly porno music. A thin
          audience of raincoat artists. The door opens and COSTELLO
          enters. He moves slowly down the aisle and sees: COLIN
          sitting alone. He sits down in front of COLIN.
          
          Costello is wearing the dildo.   He watches the movie,
          moaning.
          
                              COSTELLO
                    Oh yeah, be dirty.
          
          Colin goes for his gun.    Costello gets up, shows him the
          dildo.

                    nothing.
          
          We see in Colin's face hurt and hatred for Costello.   His
          idol doesn't like him.
          
                              COLIN
                    Frank, for me, you've got to lay

                    Laying low is not what I do.

                    remind you, that if you don't find
                    that cheese eating rat bastard in
                    your department so we can give him
                    a halo, most likely it won't be me
                    who pays for it.

                    Why would you need to remind me of

                    never understood jerking off in a

          The door opens again at the back of the theater and we see:
          BILLY in a dark back seat. COSTELLO, after hesitating as
          Colin sweats, shoves the brown envelope to COLIN, and goes.
          
          BILLY receives a text message: "Get visual ID suspect." He
          slumps in his seat as Costello marches up the aisle and out
          of the theater. He has barely recovered from this when:
          
          The dark shape of COLIN is moving rapidly towards and through
          the emergency exit beside the screen.
          
          Billy follows.

          It's open, and gives on to what Boston keeps trying to call
          the Theater District and what keeps being The Combat Zone.
          COLIN vanishes around a corner. BILLY follows, looks left and
          right, then goes after

          COLIN, who is walking along, putting the envelope into his

          BILLY is speeding up, moving through pedestrians, desperate
          to see Colin's face.
          
          COLIN will be caught up to within seconds. He turns down
          another street. BILLY starts into a half-run. He turns the
          corner.
          
          ANOTHER STREET painted with neon light (quiet).
          
          BILLY'S POV:
          
          COLIN is halfway down the street.
          
          
                                                            (CONTINUED)
          
                                                                 101.
          CONTINUED:
          
          
          BILLY follows.
          
          BILLY is nearly up to COLIN on this quieter street
          
          (And COLIN is aware of the tail)
          
          when...
          
          BILLY'S cellphone rings. His phone has fucked up, as they
          do. Instead of turning around, COLIN accelerates. The only
          thing on his agenda is to not have his face seen.
          
          BILLY spins into a door-opening and silences the ringer.
          
                                 TEXT MESSAGE DETAIL
                       Make arrest.
          
          COLIN takes a right at the end of the street, into an alley.
          
          EXT. AROUND THE NEXT CORNER. MOMENTS LATER
          
          COLIN is waiting, in a doorway of his own. He has a knife
          open in his hand. He waits, listening to (faltering)
          footsteps: a MAN, face invisible in shadow, turns the corner.
          COLIN pulls him into the doorway and rips upwards with a
          knife.
          
          As the body falls we see: it isn't Billy. It's a CHINESE MAN.
          COLIN backs away in horror, and hurries off down the street.
          
          EXT. ANOTHER STREET. MOMENTS LATER
          
          COLIN, sweating, staggering, hurries along. No sign of Billy,
          no sign of a follower. But he does notice: CCTV cameras at
          the intersection. He spins and gets out of there, heading off
          through. CHINATOWN. Colin, holding his envelope, walks,
          sweating, fast, then faster, past repeated ideograms in neon
          (the ideograms say--flash--"Departed").
          
          EXT. CHINATOWN. MOMENTS LATER
          
          BILLY has lost Colin. He hears a hubbub from the corner where
          a small crowd of Chinese speakers is gathering and pushes
          through the crowd to see: blood running on the pavement.
          BILLY backs away, gets out of there.
          
          INT. CCTV ROOM. NIGHT
          
          COLIN is looking at CCTV tapes. We see COLIN, unrecognizable
          on cheap video. Then we see a blurred image of BILLY.
          Crossing the street in beats. No more use as ID than the
          Shroud of Turin.
          
                                                                 102.
          
          
          
          EXT. MADOLYN'S CELLAR APARTMENT. NIGHT (RAINING)
          
          Through grated windows we can see Madolyn finishing up her
          packing. BILLY KNOCKS on the door, which leads only into
          Madolyn's basement apartment. A long beat and she opens the
          door. The chain on.
          
                              BILLY
                    Your name's on the pill label. I
                    thought you weren't supposed to be
                    in the book, in case of obsessive
                    patients.
          
                              MADOLYN
                    How obsessive are you?
          
                               BILLY
                    Medium.
          
                              MADOLYN
                    Are you okay? Why are you here?
          
                              BILLY
                    I really liked our conversations.
                    I've been...regretting that we
                    didn't continue...our
                    conversations.
          
                              MADOLYN
                    I'm glad you want to see me...it's
                    nice to see you...I enjoyed
                    talking...I enjoyed having coffee
                    with you, very much...but I don't
                    see people...I don't see people in
                    my home.
          
          Billy gets soaked.
          
          INT. MADOLYN'S CELLAR APARTMENT. CONTINUOUS
          
          BILLY looks around and sees: boxes, transition. The furniture
          already gone. An air-mattress on the floor. There are still
          tea things on the counter. A basic life is still possible
          here. Madolyn has been making tea here, sleeping here,
          reading in bed. Billy, soaked, a drowned rat, is looking
          vulnerable and honest.
          
                              BILLY
                    Thanks. If this is inappropriate...
                    I can leave.
          
          MADOLYN takes a moment to react.

                                  MADOLYN
                       No, it's, it's, it's not
                       inappropriate...you're not a
                       patient...
          
                                 BILLY
                       You moving in or out?
          
                                 MADOLYN
                       I still have three weeks on the
                       lease...
          
          BILLY is looking at THE PICTURE to which Colin objected. A
          young girl in front of a rust belt slum, tilted in a box of
          effects.
          
                                    MADOLYN (CONT'D)
                       That's me.
          
                                 BILLY
                       Yeah, I know.
          
          He hangs the picture on a nail.
          
                                 MADOLYN
                           (the kettle whistles OS)
                       Would you like a cup of tea?
          
          BILLY nods.
          
                                 BILLY
                       Yeah. Yeah I would. Thank you.
          
          Madolyn leaves him looking vaguely around the apartment. In
          the kitchen, it appears that Madolyn has forgotten how to
          make a cup of tea. She perseveres, comes out holding two
          cups. Billy is looking at the handful of books still in the
          apartment.
          
                                 MADOLYN
                       Do you want some...
          
                                  BILLY
                       Sugar?   No...
          
          She hands him the cup of tea. Strung out, he spills his tea,
          slightly, unobserved by Madolyn. Madolyn looks over at the
          bed, the book, the lamp, the incontrovertible evidence that
          she's probably really, in fact, not that into Colin..
          
                                 MADOLYN
                       I've always needed my own place.

                              MADOLYN
                    No. I'm not "hedging my best"...I
                    told you when we had
                    coffee...There's a choice. You

                              MADOLYN
                    Yes. Stick by what you...otherwise
                    it's... I have to say that your
                    vulnerability is really freaking me
                    out right now. Is it real?
          
                              BILLY
                    Yeah, I think so.
          
          Tick...tick...tick.
          
                              BILLY (CONT'D)
                    You don't have cats.
          
                                MADOLYN
                    No.
          
                              BILLY
                    I like that. That's good.

          Colin is still studying the blurry image of Billy.
          
          INT. MADOLYN'S BASEMENT APARTMENT. NIGHT
          
          In the tiny kitchen BILLY is kissing MADOLYN and unbuttoning
          her shirt. Her hands start to move to push him away. He
          continues.
          
                                                                 105.

          Still studying the blurry image of Billy, COLIN tenses as
          someone comes into the office and switches off the tape. He
          glances at his coat. The envelope is visible folded into the
          breast pocket. He takes his coat and goes.
          
          EXT. CHARLES STREET. NIGHT
          
          Wet empty streets. The "gaslights" are on. About midnight.
          
          INT. CHARLES STREET BRASSERIE. NIGHT
          
          A Costello business. The restaurant is closed for the night.
          One bartender is sweeping up and the other is counting the
          takings. In a darker alcove of the bar COSTELLO sits alone at
          a broad table, drinking brandy. On sound, classical music. As
          a knocking is heard Costello looks up. A BARTENDER lets Billy
          in. COSTELLO watches Billy approach. We hear him sit down.
          
                              COSTELLO
                    You got a girlfriend?
          
                                BILLY
                    No.   No.   What does that matter?
          
                              COSTELLO
                    Depends. I'm sure you know by now
                    there's an informer in my crew.
                    Cop. Staties or Boston Police
                    department, I'm not sure.
          
          He pours Billy some brandy. Then starts to draw a sketch.
          
                              BILLY
                    What about the FBI.
          
                              COSTELLO
                    It ain't. Trust me. The ex-wife,
                    an old friend or stupid...that's
                    what brings you down in this
                    business.
          
                              BILLY
                    Stupid...Well, that leaves me out.
          
                              COSTELLO
                    Past days, case like this...I
                    killed everybody who works for me.
          
                              BILLY
                    Better safe than sorry, I suppose.

                       was only five...or six...and
                       French.
          
          But COSTELLO, maybe, is sorry.
          
                                 BILLY
                       I look around at your guys.
                       They're all murderers right? I
                       think "could I do murder?" And all
                       I can answer myself is, "what's the
                       difference".
          
                                 COSTELLO
                       Give em up to the Almighty.   Like
                       that.
          
                                 BILLY
                       Yeah, that's my point. You accuse
                       me once, I put up with it. You
                       accuse me twice, I quit. If you
                       make me fear for my life, I put a
                       fucking bullet in your head as if
                       you were anybody else.
          
          COSTELLO looks up. This is new: but he's impassive. And
          impressed.
          
                                 COSTELLO
                           (to Billy)
                       You got something you want to say
                       to me, William?
          
                                 BILLY
                       You're seventy fucking years old.
                       One of these guys is going to pop
                       you. As for running drugs, what the
                       fuck. You don't need the pain in
                       the ass, and they're going to catch
                       you. And you don't need the money.

                       I haven't needed "the money" since
                       I took Archie's milk money in the
                       third grade. Tell the truth, I
                       don't need pussy any more,but I
                       still like it.

                    You said there is one. I base most
                    of what I do on the idea that

                    you do.

                              QUEENAN
                    What do you expect? Everybody
                    knows you're assigned here to find
                    Costello's rat. They want to find
                    the leak as much as you do. What
                    they do not want is to be accused
                    of being the rat.

          In the fishbowl of his glass office, COLIN is being stared at
          by pissed-off cops. COLIN calms down. He opens the gray
          envelope. He takes out the forms that he was given by
          Costello, opens up POLICE PERSONNEL DATABASE and starts
          searching. He types in SS numbers. One, then another, then
          another. The result is always: "Person not found". He types
          in Costigan, William M, hits return. It comes up: "Person not
          found". COLIN keeps working.

          COLIN is lying in bed, his back to MADOLYN.
          
                              COLIN
                    If I wasn't with the Mass State
                    Police. If I did it full time,law
                    school, I'd be through in a year.
                    I'm thinking that. If I wasn't a
                    trooper.
          
                              MADOLYN
                    What's going on?
          
                              COLIN
                    Nothing. Nothing. There's nothing
                    going on. Just thinking.
          
                              MADOLYN
                    Okay, all right.
                        (thinking about it; blows
                         a breath)
                    And what about money?
          
                              COLIN
                    I got some money. Another
                    city...I'm thinking that.
          
          Another city doesn't seem unattractive to Madolyn, who's in
          her own cut-and-run crisis -- but maybe she can't believe
          that Colin is thinking about it. She blows a breath.
          
                              MADOLYN
                    Another city? It'd be a clean
                    slate.

          COLIN is in hell.    He looks at her intensely.
          
                                 COLIN
                       I want you to know you don't gotta
                       stay. If we're not going to make
                       it, it's got to be you that gets
                       out. I'm not capable

                       with something being wrong for the
                       rest of my life.
          
          Long pause.

          FITZY and DELAHUNT are smoking on the sidewalk outside the
          restaurant.

                       Of course I know how to spot a cop.

                       See that guy over there, he's a
                       cop. He's not paying attention to
                       us. He's a cop.
          
                                 FITZY
                       Lot of fucking cops.
          
          A WOMAN walks by definitely ignoring both men, dragging a
          lapdog.

          Too early to be opened for business. COSTELLO and NEW GUYS,
          six hard customers, come in through the fire door. At the
          BAR, BILLY is drinking coffee. He notices the NEW GUYS. Off
          the boat Dublin toughs. COSTELLO and FRENCH come in from the
          kitchen. FRENCH tells the NEW GUYS to move to the back.
          COSTELLO HAS BLOOD ON HIS SLEEVES. He comes over to the bar
          and looks at BILLY.
          
                                 COSTELLO
                       You can get out of here.   This is
                       the crew for tonight.
          
                                 BILLY
                       I thought I was on for that.
          
                                  COSTELLO
                       I changed my mind. Take the night
                       off.
                            (to Bartender)
                       Jimmy, get the mop.
          
          COSTELLO heads to the back of the restaurant. MISTER FRENCH,
          grabs the BAR KNIFE from behind the bar. BILLY looks up at
          him.
          
                                 MISTER FRENCH
                       Go out the back. Some guys answer
                       the questions right. Some don't.
          
          MISTER FRENCH goes towards the back of the restaurant,
          holding the big knife. BILLY closes his paper.

                       We're guessing who cops are. Most
                       good looking women are cops.

          INT. THE DEAD BAR. NIGHT
          
          FITZY, BILLY, and the BOYS are drinking. Dirty, paranoid,
          guilty, frightened, smoking. DELAHUNT has been shot, is
          dying, on a dirty couch.
          
          FITZY sits down and looks at Billy.
          
                              FITZY
                    And where the fuck were you?
          
                              BILLY
                    Boss told me to go home.
          
                              FITZY
                    Maybe he did and maybe he didn't.
                    At any rate you weren't fuckin'
                    home.
          
                              BILLY
                    I was in a fucking grocery store
                    with no signal. When I got a signal
                    I got the call. What the fuck do
                    you want. Was I there or was I not
                    there? Huh?
          
          FITZY walks away.

                       Two days...two days ago the Boss
                       says to me, it's been ten years
                       already, and you've never done me
                       wrong. He asked me, if one of the
                       other guys is a rat, would I take
                       him out. I told him I would but I
                       don't know if I would. Now I know I
                       can't. I've done a lot of bad
                       things but I've never been a
                       murderer.
          
          BILLY realizes that DELAHUNT is dying.
          
                                 DELAHUNT (CONT'D)
                       Hey Billy, I don't want no one to
                       put me in a dumpster. Just don't
                       put me in a dumpster.
          
                                 BILLY
                       When you're dead it makes no
                       difference where they put you.
          
          BILLY lights him a cigarette.
          
                                 DELAHUNT
                       You know what I thought today?
          
                                 BILLY
                       What's that?
          
                                 DELAHUNT
                       Who didn't show up today is the
                       rat.
          
                                   BILLY
                       Yeah, so?
          
                                  DELAHUNT
                       You never been late in your life.
                       And when I called you... I made a
                       mistake. I gave you the wrong
                       address. But you showed up at the
                       right one.
          
          DELAHUNT grips his arm. BILLY is terrified.
          
                                 DELAHUNT (CONT'D)
                       Tell me why I didn't say anything.

          He waits for DELAHUNT to continue. But DELAHUNT after an odd
          smile of complicity, finally dies. BILLY, the only one who
          knows that DELAHUNT is dead, stares down at him.

                    excessive with the cop.
          
          BILLY walks past the table.
          
                              BILLY
                    He's dead. I'm going home.
          
          BILLY leaves by the front door.
          
          INT. CONFERENCE ROOM. NIGHT
          
          All hands present. Dignam is in a black silent rage.

                    A better question is why your
                    fuckers were following him.
          
                              COLIN
                    I told Internal Investigations to
                    follow him.
          
                              DIGNAM
                    Why?
          
                              COLIN
                    That's internal Investigations
                    business.
          
          DIGNAM grabs COLIN by the neck and runs him into a wall.
          COLIN gets a palm under Dignam's chin and comes close to
          breaking his neck. The men at length are separated. COLIN
          straightens his good clothes.

          DIGNAM hits COLIN in the face. COLIN goes down hard, into the
          crook of a file cabinet and the wall. Blood from his mouth.

                    Let me straighten you out.
          
          COLIN looks out into the bullpen. People working. On a table
          he sees PLASTIC BAGS which contains Queenan's bloodstained
          effects-- broken glasses, smashed wristwatch, and CELLPHONE.
          He glances around, and picks up the CELLPHONE. Blood gets on
          his fingers. He moves into the office, and seen through the
          glass, he seizes the phone and with trembling fingers punches
          up the last incoming number.
          
          INT. BILLY'S MOTHER'S APARTMENT KITCHEN. NIGHT
          
          BILLY is looking at a chipped SANTA MUG from his childhood
          and is eating something--sheer maintenance, and drinking wine
          from the bottle. His phone rings. He looks at the ID and is
          stunned. Queenan's number! He picks up the call but remains
          silent. The caller is also doing the same.
          
          INT. COLIN'S OFFICE #2. CONTINUOUS
          
          COLIN hears that the other side has hung up the phone. He
          sees: ELLERBY looking at him through the glass. But Ellerby
          hasn't seen the phone.
          
          INTERCUT BILLY'S MOTHER'S APARTMENT/COLIN'S OFFICE #2.
          CONTINUOUS
          
          BILLY is agitated. Exhausted. Frightened. He paces, and looks
          at the phone. He begins to pack, assembling clothes, money.
          Finally, like a man committing suicide--it's that intense--
          he dials the number. INTERCUT.
          
                              COLIN
                    Yeah.
          
                              BILLY
                    You called this number on a dead
                    guy's phone. Who are you?
          
                              COLIN
                    So it is you. Thank God you're all

                       it.

                       Staff Sgt. Dignam has... taken a
                       leave of absence. He's very upset.
                       We're all very upset. The best
                       thing would be for your to come in.
                       We need you to come in.
          
          BILLY listens to Colin go on. Then shuts off the phone. His
          other phone rings.
          
          COLIN dumps out the box of Queenan's belongings. In the
          diary he sees an entry showing undercover suspects Costello
          is FBI informant.

                       have a container or a truck in
                       there.
                           (his big moment of
                            decision)
                       Go.
          
          EXT. PARKING GARAGE. NIGHT
          
          It is an unfinished structure, the lower parts used, the
          upper parts accessible but still under construction. It is
          built on a pier, the harbor lights beyond it. The COMMAND VAN
          and POLICE CARS pull up with lights off. A TACTICAL VAN
          disgorges TACTICAL OFFICERS who spread out through the dark.
          
          INT. COMMAND VAN. CONTINUOUS.
          
                                  COLIN
                           (into mic)
                       There's an exit on the other side.
                       Cover it. We'll take him when he
                       comes out.
          
          COLIN checks the load on his pistol.
          
          INT. AN UPPER FLOOR OF THE PARKING GARAGE. CONTINUOUS
          
          COSTELLO unlocks a CONTAINER with a construction company logo
          on it, opens the doors, and steps back. BILLY looks into the
          container. It's cocaine or heroin in kilo bricks. Men stand
          around with MP5s under their coats.
          
                                  COSTELLO
                       Load it.
          
          BILLY, trying to save Costello...
          
                                 BILLY
                       How do you know you don't have a
                       tail?
          
          COSTELLO looks at him.
          
          
          
                                                             (CONTINUED)

                                 COSTELLO
                       Were you in the fuckin' car?
          
                                 BILLY
                       What if they took one off and put
                       another one on, Frank?
          
                                 COSTELLO
                       Load.
          
          The drugs having been loaded fast by the crew, including
          FNG's, the container is hosed out. BILLY turns from FITZY'S
          CAR as everyone gets it.
          
                                 BILLY
                       Frank told me to check out the
                       back. You guys go ahead.
          
                                 FNG DENNIS
                       Watch your ass.
          
          Instead of getting into COSTELLO'S CAR on the other side of
          the container, he steps back into shadows as both cars leave.
          
          INT. COSTELLO'S CAR. NIGHT
          
          FOUR CARS with no headlights bracket the vehicles as soon as
          they come out of the garage. COSTELLO realizes that something
          has gone wrong.
          
                                 COSTELLO
                       Cocksucker.
          
          LIGHTS come on, and Policemen are everywhere, guns in their
          hands. COLIN is not visible among them.
          
          POLICE open fire at Costello's car. THE CAR reverses back
          into the garage. MISTER FRENCH (the driver) is shot in the
          arm, and the car crashes into a wall. A gunfight opens up.
          FNG's exchange fire with brutally efficient tactical cops and
          are shot down expertly. COSTELLO, limping, gets out of the
          action, fast. He runs into the parking garage. French drives
          away (alternately is shot, or commits suicide).
          
          INT. PARKING GARAGE. NIGHT
          
          COSTELLO, shot through the stomach, is moving through the
          dark. All that's stored in this garage is heavy equipment for
          the big dig. Plenty of places to hide. We hear gunfire in the
          distance. COSTELLO hides between two pieces of heavy
          equipment and dials his telephone. To his surprise the phone
          rings quite nearby. And keeps ringing.

          CONTINUED:
          
          COSTELLO moves out into the open, and sees, at a near
          distance, COLIN, his shadow long on the concrete. He has a
          gun in his hand. Costello moves out to face him.
          
                                 COLIN
                       You're an FBI informant.
          
          COSTELLO comes out of the shadows.
          
                                 COSTELLO
                       Jesus Colin, grow up. Course I'm
                       talking to the FBI.
          
                                 COLIN
                       Do they know who I am?
          
          COSTELLO says nothing for a moment.
          
                                 COSTELLO
                       I never gave up anybody who wasn't
                       goin' down anyway.
          
          COLIN instantly raises the pistol to shoot him.
          
                                 COLIN
                       Did you give me up?
          
          COLIN'S PISTOL wavers.
          
                                 COSTELLO
                       Nobody knows nothin'.
          
          COLIN shakes his head and cocks the gun.
          
                                 COLIN
                       Frank, Frank, do they know about
                       me?
          
                                 COSTELLO
                       I know you, Colin. You know I'd
                       never give you up. You're like...
          
                                 COLIN
                       A son...to you? Is that what it is
                       about, all that murderin' and
                       fuckin' and no sons? What are you,
                       shooting blanks?
          
          COSTELLO tries to raise his gun which is inside his sleeve.
          He's sitting on his coat so that the shot goes off sideways
          as COLIN shoots him.

          COSTELLO topples backward into the bucket of the bucket
          loader.
          
          ANGLE ON COLIN.
          
          Then from the bucket loader, a post death tremor sets off one
          last shot from COSTELLO'S gun. Ricochet. COLIN fires into the
          dead body again and again. He backs away.
          
                              COLIN (CONT'D)
                    I got Costello! I got Costello
                    here!
          
          INT. POLICE HQ/CONFERENCE ROOM - NIGHT
          
          Colin is debriefed concerning the shooting of Costello.
          [Dialog separate document].
          
          INT. BULLPEN AREA. DAY
          
          COLIN enters, tired from a debriefing. Applause from everyone
          in the office--the full crew. COLIN is embarrassed by the
          attention. BROWN is leading the whole team to a standing
          ovation. COLIN looks past the heads of the crowd and sees:
          Dignam, staring at him evenly.
          
                              COLIN
                        (to crowd)
                    It's not any reason for, ah...
          
          QUEENAN'S SECRETARY brings him some wine.
          
                                 COLIN (CONT'D)
                    Thank you.
          
                              QUEENAN'S SECRETARY
                    No, thank you.
          
          He takes a glass of wine. Then guiltily, almost in tears, he
          drinks. BROWN jerks a thumb towards Colin's office #2.
          
                              BROWN
                    He's waited a long time for you.
                        (COLIN looks up and sees
                         BILLY)
                    How'd you get him without the
                    files?
          
                              COLIN

          COLIN goes off.
          
          INT. COLIN'S OFFICE #2. NIGHT
          
          In Colin's office BILLY sits with his ankle on his knee. He
          looks very tired, dirty. Wearing a VISITOR badge.
          
                                 COLIN
                       Good to see you Trooper.

                       Colin Sullivan. We spoke on the
                       phone. How long have you been
                       undercover?
          
                                    BILLY

                                 COLIN
                       I can't begin to tell you what a
                       debt we owe you. I want you to
                       know I'll be recommending you for
                       the Medal of Merit.
          
                                 BILL
                       Medal of Merit. Oh, yeah. That's
                       kinda like a gold star around here,
                       right?
          
                                 COLIN
                       It's the highest honor we got.
          
                                 BILLY

                       I'm gonna find him. Don't you
                       worry about that. You got

                                 COLIN
                       Fair enough. You've given a lot.
                       I can get you your file. I just

                       on me.
          
          Billy nods.    He goes.

          Billy takes a drink from the bottle COLIN has put on the
          desk. As he puts the bottle down he sees, sticking out of a
          box, a BROWN ENVELOPE. On it is written "CITIZENS." BILLY
          picks up the envelope...and knows everything.

          COLIN enters, holding a printout of Billy's personnel file.
          He looks around the empty room. He sees the BROWN ENVELOPE
          lying on the desk, and understands everything. He sits down
          at his own computer--which does in fact work, and opens the
          personnel file.
          
          COLIN clicks DELETE. "Do You Really Want to Delete?" COLIN
          clicks "Yes" and Billy's picture, file, life, disappear.

          BILLY waits outside Madolyn's office.
          
          MADOLYN, carrying work, breakfast, rounds the corner and sees
          him standing and waiting for her. She's a little spooked,
          opens her mouth to speak...
          
                              BILLY
                    I know. I'm not here to...I'm not
                    here for that. I've got something
                    to...to give to you...something I
                    need you to keep. For me.

                       you to hold.
          
          He gives her a manila envelope.

          Madolyn is a friend. She's not going to ask questions.           She
          accepts the envelope.
          
                                    MADOLYN

                                 BILLY
                       I'm sorry to show up here like
                       this. There was no one else I
                       could give it to. I'm sorry.
                       There was no one else.
          
          He backs away, and then turns to go.

                       just want to say...
          
          He turns and looks at her.          She doesn't speak: can't.
          
                                 BILLY
                       Whatever you have to say, really
                       think about it, and if you still
                       want to tell me, tell me in two
                       weeks, all right?
          
          She moves her head slightly, watches him go.

          MADOLYN sits at her desk, devastated, looking at a fall of
          light. The envelope lies on her blotter. She sits on ...
          then straightens up, takes a marker and writes "COSTIGAN" on

          A SONOGRAM picture of a fetus. It looks to him at first like
          a CCTV picture blown up. COLIN stares as if at something in a
          horror film.
          
                                 COLIN

                       It's not a joke, it's a human
                       being.

          COLIN is in the shower. MADOLYN moves into the     kitchen and
          puts the kettle on. She checks the mail, lying     there on the
          counter. It's tied with a string. She undoes       the string and
          sorts through the mail. Suddenly, she freezes      looking at:
          
          AN OVERSIZED ENVELOPE addressed to COLIN: [COLIN SULLIVAN, 20
          Pickering Street, Apt TK, Boston, MA, zip TK], with a return
          address of Wm. Costigan, 13 Conant St., Boston, etc., etc.]
          
          MADOLYN stares at the envelope, listening to the shower
          going. Billy has written to her fiance. She starts to put
          the envelope down, and then realizes...she has to hide
          it...she has to open it.
          
          Inside the envelope is a jewel case: EXILE ON MAIN STREET.
          And a note: PLAY ME NOW. MADOLYN puts the CD into the
          machine. She puts on the headset and listens...and listens.
          
          COLIN comes out of the bathroom, dressed in jeans and t-
          shirt, barefoot, his hair wet. He looks at Madolyn,
          realizing that something is wrong.
          
                                 COLIN
                       What?
          
          MADOLYN pulls the headphone jack out of the stereo and
          roughly the following booms out of the speakers. [NOTE: THIS
          RECORDING WAS DONE IN POST -- I THINK FROM THE PORN THEATRE

          COLIN stares at her and we ought to think murder is a

          COLIN looks out through the door, no gun drawn, but very much
          a cop clearing his corners. He steps out and--BILLY takes him
          from behind the door, his only blind side, and grabs the back
          of his collar and crams a pistol into the bottom of his
          skull.

          BILLY turns Colin around and puts the pistol to Colin's
          forehead, hard enough to break the skin. He takes out Colin's

          BILLY cracks him across the jaw with the gun. COLIN goes
          down. COLIN is drooling blood, his bell rung, one eye open.
          Billy throws away Colin's ankle gun.

                       fuckin' maggot, you came here to
                       get arrested.
          
                                 COLIN
                       Arrested? Arrested for what.
                           (as BILLY cuffs him)
                       So you got tapes of what? Costello
                       was my informant. I was his rat?
                       Fuck you. Prove it. I say he was
                       my informant.

                       What is this, a citizen's arrest?
                       Blow me, prick. Only one of us is
                       a cop, here, Bill. Nobody knows who
                       you are. Nobody knows who you are.
          
                                 BILLY
                       Would you shut the fuck up.
          
                                 COLIN
                       I'm a sergeant in the Mass. State
                       Police. Who the fuck are you?
                       Nobody. I ERASED YOU.
          
          BILLY puts the gun to Colin's head.
          
                                 BILLY
                       You erased me?
          
                                 COLIN
                       Go ahead. Shoot a cop, Einstein.
                       See what happens.

                       would go right through your fuckin'

                    What, you think you're gonna get
                    the parade? The bagpipes and
                    bullshit? Fuck you.
                        (safeties the gun)
                    I'm arresting you.
          
                              COLIN
                    That's the stupidest thing you
                    could do.
          
                               BILLY
                    Shut up, shut up, shut the fuck up.
                         (hits him)
                    I don't give a fuck if these
                    charges don't stick.
                         (whaling him in the beats)
                    But I'm still fucking arresting
                    you.
          
          COLIN is hammered to his knees. Head down, blood in his
          hair, drooling blood, thinking (impossibly) about his next
          move. He seems to realize he's fucked.
          
                              BILLY (CONT'D)
                    [You are what you do.] Get up.
                        (COLIN doesn't move.)
                    I said get the fuck up.
          
          BILLY grabs the back of Colin's collar and puts the gun to
          Colin's head. A crunch of gravel, off. BILLY and COLIN both
          hear it.
          
                              BROWN
                    Put down the weapon and step away
                    from Sergeant Sullivan.
          
          BILLY drags COLIN to his feet and using Colin as a shield
          aims the pistol at: BROWN. Brown is aiming his weapon.
          
                              BILLY
                    I called you. You specifically.
                    You know who I am. I'm not gonna
                    shoot. I told you to meet me
                    downstairs.

                    Put the weapon on the deck and step
                    away from Sergeant Sullivan.

                    Put the weapon on the ground and

                              BROWN
                    Maybe you do, but right now I need
                    you to drop the weapon.
          
                              BILLY
                    I told you I've got the evidence

                                 BILLY
                       I am killing you.
          
          The doors open and for a frozen moment BILLY, holding the gun
          on COLIN, stares out of the car. A LOUD BANG. BILLY is shot
          through the head. BLOOD sprays the walls, and COLIN is hit by
          flying blood and matter. BILLY falls, crumpled, on his face,
          half in and half out of the elevator. The doors try to
          close...open...COLIN, covered with blood, looks up.
          
          BARRIGAN lowers his pistol.
          
          COLIN slumps, covered with blood. BARRIGAN uncuffs him. COLIN
          feels his wrists. BARRIGAN picks up BILLY'S gun. The other
          elevator doors open and BROWN emerges. He looks into the
          bloody elevator and down at the dead man.

          BARRIGAN raises BILLY'S GUN and shoots BROWN in the head.
          COLIN stares at him.

                       Did you think you were the only one
                       he had? Costello was going to sell
                       us to the FBI. It's you and me now.
                       We have to take care of each other.

                       At that time, Trooper Barrigan, who
                       I now understand to have been
                       Francis Costello's informer in SIU,
                       intercepted us in the lobby and
                       shot Trooper William Costigan once
                       in the head.
                           (drinks water)
                       At that time Barrigan retrieved
                       Trooper Costigan's undercover
                       weapon and shot Trooper Brown as he
                       was approaching our location. I
                       attempted to subdue Trooper
                       Barrigan and in the ensuing
                       struggle was struck several times
                       with the Walther pistol. I was
                       able to wrestle the weapon away, at
                       which time Barrigan drew his own
                       weapon and took aim at me. I was
                       able to get off a single shot,
                       striking Barrigan in the head. I
                       then checked for vital signs of
                       Troopers Brown and Costigan and
                       discovered that they had expired.
          
          COLIN looks up, eyes clear, perfectly believable.   As we
          transition to the FUNERAL...bagpipes coming up.

          INT. THE STAIRWAY OF COLIN'S APARTMENT. EVENING
          
          COLIN has a bag of expensive groceries and wine. Living the
          Beacon Hill dream. He climbs the steps slowly. He nods to a
          neighbor, an old lady coming down with her dog (who
          incidentally will never accept him as a neighbor, and COLIN
          briefly seems aware of this). (Don't be afraid to get a bit
          French here). He gets to his door, and starts to cry, and
          nearly crumples. But he gets the door open. He looks up and
          sees a gun. Behind it, stepping fast out of the shadows,
          DIGNAM. Avenging a guy he didn't even like, because it's the
          right thing to do. COLIN looks down and sees that Dignam has
          plastic hospital boots on his feet.
          
                                   COLIN
                             (accepting it, sort of,
                              but only in a COLIN way)
                       OK.
          
          DIGNAM fires. Flash groceries fall all over the floor.
          DIGNAM'S FEET step over COLIN's body, crushing one of a half
          dozen croissants, and DIGNAM goes down the expensive
          staircase, leaving the door to the apartment open. The
          strangest thing happens: a rat emerges and begins to eat the
          dead man's croissants. The rat hears something and runs so
          it's not in the shot when it
          
          FREEZES.

1   INT. CHAMPION AIRCRAFT - BENNY GIACOMO'S OFFICE                1

    A battered wooden desk drawer groans open and light brown
    skinned hands with dirty fingernails twist the cap off a
    pint of rye whiskey and pour liquor into a coffee cup.

                             O.S. VOICE
                You know, when you fire somebody
                you have to stick to your guns.

    They screw the cap back on and lay the bottle in the drawer.

                             O.S. VOICE
                      (continuing)
                The men might get to thinkin' that
                I'm weak if I take you back.

    The cup rises to the face of BENNY GIACOMO, late forties,
    with salt and pepper hair that was once jet black. Skin
    darker than a Louisiana Creole.

    He takes a sip and bares his teeth in a grimace from the
    whiskey. As he talks we gradually see more of him -- feet
    kicked up on the desk, fully in charge.

    A Betty Grable like pin-up girl is giving us background in
    more ways than one in a swimsuit and high heels on a
    calendar tacked to the wall: May, 1948.

                             BENNY
                      (continuing)
                And I didn't tell Dupree that I'd
                give you your job back... All I
                said was that I'd be glad to talk
                to you if you said the right
                thing... Do you have something to
                say?

    A stream of cigarette smoke snakes through as the back of a
    man's head and shoulder nudges in and shifts nervously.

                             MAN
                Mr. Giacomo, when one of the white
                guys has come off a double shift
                and says he's too tired to work
                overtime, you don't fire him.

                             BENNY
                Fella, what'd I tell ya? If you're
                not willing to give a little extra,
                Champion can't use you.

    EASY RAWLINS, thirty, handsome and a much darker brown than
    Giacomo, takes a drag off a Chesterfield cigarette.

                                                                2.

    Through the window behind him, a team of men pour over a
    partly assembled airplane, their voices echoing in the
    hangar that surrounds the office.

    Benny measures out his words one at a time.

                              BENNY (O.S.)
                 Now... Do... you... have...
                 something... to say?

    Easy swallows his frustration in silence and thinks about
    swallowing his pride as well. And then:

                              EASY
                 I want my job back, Mr. Giacomo. I
                 need to work and I need a good job.

                                BENNY (O.S.)
                 Is that all?

    Easy looks down into the smoke and sits up straight to keep
    from bowing his head.

                              EASY
                 No, that's not all... I need money
                 so that I can pay my mortgage and
                 eat... I need a house to live in
                 and a place to raise children... I
                 need to buy clothes so I can--

                              BENNY
                 I'm sorry, fella, but I gotta get
                 back to work...

    And he swings his feet down and stands up to go.   But Easy
    is up too, blocking his way out the door.

                              EASY
                 Ezekiel, Mr. Giacomo.

                                BENNY
                 Hunh?

                              EASY
                 My name is Ezekiel... Ezekiel
                 Rawlins.

    Benny clinches his fists and focuses on Easy's chest like a
    fighter. And Easy rocks back on one foot ready to score a
    field goal with his right knee.

    Slowly, Giacomo's face creases into a plastic grin and he
    shrugs.

                                                                3.

                              BENNY
                 S'cuse me, Ezekiel.

    And he walks around Easy, shaking his head as if amused.

    Easy watches him go as the low moan of the baritone sax from
    Duke Ellington's "Absinthe" snakes up like sin and we

2   FADE TO BLACK                                                    2

    And watch the titles, the last one reading "Two Weeks
    Later"...

    FADE IN:

    Black and grey cars, Packards and Buicks from 1928 to 1948,
    come and go on Central Avenue. Two-storied storefronts with
    canvas awnings, above black men and women in hats... all in
    a hurry.

    The Red Car rumbles through and then a white Cadillac
    convertible pulls to the curb in front of a butcher shop.

    Above the shop on the next floor are large partly open
    windows with JOPPY'S BAR in boldface letters. Inside sits
    Easy, back to the window reading the classified ads.

4   INT. JOPPY'S BAR                                                 4

    T-Bone Walker's "Westside Baby" plays on the jukebox as Easy
    takes a final drag off his cigarette and stubs it out.

    THE FRONT PAGE of the LOS ANGELES TIMES lies face up on the
    table beneath the ashtray displaying A PHOTOGRAPH of a
    middle-aged white man and his pretty young woman companion
    smiling and waving.

    Above the happy couple is a headline "CARTER DROPS OUT OF
    RACE"... The caption under the photo reads "Wealthy civic
    leader, Todd Carter, shown here with his lovely bride-to-be,
    Daphne Monet, at a fundraiser last month was unavailable for
    comment on his surprising withdrawal from the Mayor's race."

                              O.S. VOICE
                 Catch ya later, Joppy.

    BACK TO SCENE

    SPLACK! An older black man hitching up his pants underneath
    a bloodstained butcher's apron has slapped his empty beer
    glass down hard on the counter on his way out.

                                                               4.

4   CONTINUED:                                                      4

                              JOPPY
                 Hey, watch the marble!   Dammit,
                 what'd I tell you?

    The fifty-year-old burly bartender leans over his big
    stomach checking for cracks and buffing the veiny marble top
    of the bar with a filthy rag. Behind him is a yellow
    billboard from 1932 with big black letters reading "Fuller
    vs. Shag. 10 ROUND MAIN EVENT." We could make out more of
    the poster and the eight-by-ten framed boxing photos around
    it if it wasn't so smoky in the place.

                              EASY
                 Joppy, how much they payin' out
                 there at McDonell Douglas?

                               JOPPY
                 I don't know.   Don't it say--

    His words hang as his eyes stray toward the door.

    Easy looks up also at

    THE DOORWAY which fills with the large frame of the white
    MAN in an off-white linen suit, his pale eyes surveying the
    room. Satisfied that all but two of the six tables in the
    tiny room are unoccupied, he smiles at Joppy and walks to
    the far end of the bar.

    Easy is surprised to see Joppy, tough ex-heavyweight that he
    is, duck his head and smile as he makes his way over like
    he's answering a summons. The white man extends a friendly
    hand and the two of them shake like old friends and lean in
    close to talk in private.

    Easy finds it hard not to watch their conversation as he
    takes a sip from a short glass of bourbon on the rocks.
    After a moment...

                              JOPPY
                 Easy, come on over here. This
                 here's somebody I want ya to
                 meet... Come on. This here's a
                 friend of mine.

    Easy drains his glass and stands up, then walks over.

                               JOPPY
                 Yeah, Easy.   This here's Mr.
                 Albright.

                              ALBRIGHT
                 You can call me Dewitt, Easy.

                                                             5.

    He extends his hand and Easy shakes it.

                              EASY
                 How ya doin'?

                              JOPPY
                       (bowing and grinning)
                 Mr. Albright and me goes back to
                 before the war when I was still in
                 the fight game.

                              ALBRIGHT
                       (to Easy)
                 Ever seen this guy fight...? Any
                 time Joppy Shag stepped in the ring
                 you knew you were gonna see some
                 real knock-down-drag-out-
                 fisticuffs... Where you from, Easy?

                              EASY
                       (awkwardly)
                 Houston.

                              ALBRIGHT
                 Houston... Joppy's hometown.

    Joppy pours Albright a straight shot of Wild Turkey and the
    big man sips it.

                              ALBRIGHT
                 So I hear you need a job.

    Easy throws a look at Joppy, but Joppy is busy buffing the
    bar and putting more of Easy's business in the street.

                              JOPPY
                 Aw yeah, Easy always tryin' to do
                 better. Got his high school
                 certificate from night school.
                 He's threatenin' up on some
                 college. And he's one of the few
                 colored men around here who owns
                 his own house. Shoot, he pays a
                 mortgage every month just like a
                 white man.

                              ALBRIGHT
                 Property owner, hunh?

    He turns up his drink and sets the empty glass down on the
    counter.

                                                             6.

                              ALBRIGHT
                       (continuing)
                 These big companies, don't give a
                 damn, do they?

    He reaches in his coat pocket and produces a business card
    and scribbles something on it.

                              ALBRIGHT
                       (continuing)
                 If you need a job, drop by this
                 address at seven tonight.

    Easy takes the card and glances at it.

                              EASY
                 What kind of work you do?

                              ALBRIGHT
                 I do favors... I do favors for
                 friends. Drop by.

    He nods to Joppy and walks out the door.

                              EASY
                 Who the hell is that, Joppy?

                              JOPPY
                 Just somebody I know... A bidness
                 man.

                              EASY
                 What kinda business?

                              JOPPY
                 Oh, I don't ask him all that. He
                 comes in here every so often
                 looking for somebody to do a little
                 job for him... He pays good.

                              EASY
                 In other words, he's a gangster.

                              JOPPY
                 I didn't say that... But if there's
                 a dollar laying in the street I
                 don't think he'll let a little dirt
                 stop him from picking it up. If
                 you worried about making that house
                 note this month, maybe you wanna
                 pay him a call. All them pretty
                 girls you be with ain't gonna buy
                 you a house.

                                                                7.

    Easy cocks his head "Are you crazy?"

                              JOPPY
                       (continuing)
                 Sound like he just wants you to
                 keep your eyes open for somebody...
                 He'll pay you whether you see
                 anything or not... If it was me I'd
                 take that man's money and go on
                 about my bidness... Ain't nothin'
                 to worry about.

    Easy is still suspicious, but can't take his eyes off the
    card.

                              EASY (V.O.)
                 When somebody tells me "Don't
                 worry," I usually look down to see
                 if my fly is open... I noticed
                 Albright didn't bother to pay for
                 his drink.

    heads for home in thought.

                               EASY (V.O.)
                       (continuing)
                 DeWitt Albright reminded me of
                 somebody I knew back in Houston.
                 His name was Raymond Alexander but
                 we called him Mouse... Mouse called
                 hisself a businessman too. And I
                 found out that I shouldn't be
                 nowhere around when Mouse got down
                 to his business... I learned that
                 the hard way.

    A neighbor sweeps out her front porch and waves at Easy as
    he slows down in front of his house.

7   EXT. EASY'S HOUSE - DAY                                          7

    He gets out of his car and a group of children chasing a man
    giving goat cart rides, washes past him in the street.

                                                                8.

     A MAN with an unruly head of hair and full beard pushing a
     wheelbarrow with a double edged axe wheels up behind Easy as
     he opens his gate.

                               WOODCUTTER
                  Want me to knock down some of them
                  trees back there for you?

                               EASY
                        (irritated)
                  No... Just leave the trees alone.

     Easy continues up his walkway past flower beds of dahlias
     and wild roses and stops on his front porch to check on his
     African violets in a jar next to the front door.

8    INT. EASY'S HOUSE                                                8

     He walks into his tiny living room and tosses his jacket
     onto the sofa. Then moves on through the kitchen and out
     the back door.

9    EXT. EASY'S HOUSE - BACKYARD - DAY                              9

     He picks up a water hose and turns on the faucet, watering
     and admiring his apple, avocado, pomegranate and banana
     trees as he lights a cigarette.

                               EASY (V.O.)
                  I had moved to Los Angeles right
                  after the war with three hundred
                  dollars and the G.I. Bill... And I
                  liked coming home to a place that
                  was mine... According to President
                  Truman I had that comin' to me
                  'cause I had fought in 'the good
                  war' against Hitler in Europe...
                  But that didn't mean a damn thing
                  to a lotta white folks including
                  the foreman on my job... So, here I
                  was out of work needin' thirty-two
                  dollars to pay the mortgage... That
                  was three days pay on my old job --
                  and I had about three days to get
                  it.

10   EXT. OFFICE BUILDING - NIGHT                                    10

     Easy parks in front of a large Spanish-style building.   He
     gets out and walks to the black wrought iron entrance.

                                                                 9.

11    EXT. COURTYARD - NIGHT                                           11

      Easy makes his way through the overgrown patio with roses
      and vines cascading down from office windows on the second
      floor.

A12   INT. OFFICE - NIGHT                                             A12

      Someone is watching Easy as he looks for the right office.

12    EXT. COURTYARD - NIGHT                                           12

      A small white MAN pops out from behind a hedge startling
      Easy. He wears a suit that also serves as a uniform.

                               SECURITY GUARD
                  What are you doing here?

                               EASY
                  I'm looking for, uh...

                               SECURITY GUARD
                  We only take deliveries between
                  nine and six...

                               EASY
                  No, no... I...

                                SECURITY GUARD
                  Yes, we do!   Now you'd better
                  leave.

      He clutches a baton in his hand and swats it into his open
      palm.

                               EASY
                  Uh... Albright!

                                SECURITY GUARD
                  What?

                               EASY
                  I'm here to see Mr. Albright.
                  DeWitt Albright!

                               SECURITY GUARD
                  Where's your delivery?

      He holds out his scrawny hand.

                               EASY
                  I have an appointment -- I'm
                  supposed to meet him.

                                                              10.

12   CONTINUED:                                                     12

                               SECURITY GUARD
                  Did he give you a note to come in
                  here after hours?

     Easy only stares, hating this little man.

                                SECURITY GUARD
                  Well, did he?   Because if he
                  didn't--

                               EASY
                  Forget it, man. Next time I see
                  him I'll just tell him you wouldn't
                  let me in.

     Disgusted, Easy turns to leave.

                                SECURITY GUARD
                  Hold on.

     He sizes up Easy and then points across the courtyard.

                               SECURITY GUARD
                        (like an order)
                  Across that way to the left and
                  down the stairs...

     Easy half nods/half glares and walks away.

13   OMIT                                                           13

     At the other side of the garden Easy turns a corner and
     heads down concrete steps. At the bottom he opens a door
     leading into

14   INT. BASEMENT - CORRIDOR                                       14

     He looks into the boiler room but turns into an empty
     corridor stopping at a heavy steel door at the end.

     He knocks. After a moment a tall and slight MAN with curly
     brown hair and the complexion of an East Indian opens the door.

15   INT. MAINTENANCE ROOM                                          15

     A short and stocky kind of Chinese-looking MAN stands
     against the door at the far end. The Tall Man ushers Easy
     into the clutter of heavy metal tools, cans of paint and
     cleaning solutions. A card table with two chairs sits idly.
     The Tall Man closes the door and holds out his hand. Easy
     reaches to shake it but the man starts to pat Easy on his
     side and Easy pushes him away.

                                                             11.

15   CONTINUED:                                                     15

                                 EASY
                  Hey, man!    What's wrong with you?

     The Chinese Man slips a hand inside his coat and the Tall
     Man smiles.

                               TALL MAN
                        (with an accent)
                  Mr. Rawlins, put your hands up a
                  little from your sides, please.

                               EASY
                  Keep your hands to yourself. I
                  don't let no man feel on me like
                  that.

     The Chinese Man pulls some kind of weapon halfway out and
     takes a step forward, and the Tall Man tries to put his hand
     against Easy's chest but Easy grabs his wrist.

                                TALL MAN
                  Don't worry, Manny. He's okay.
                  Just a little shaky.
                        (indicating the door)
                  Let him know.

     Manny pushes his weapon back in his coat and knocks on the
     door behind him.

     After a moment, DeWitt Albright opens up.

                                 ALBRIGHT
                          (smiling)
                  Easy.

                               TALL MAN
                  He doesn't want us to touch him.

                               ALBRIGHT
                  Leave it, Shariff. I just wanted
                  to make sure he was solo.

                               SHARIFF
                  You're the boss.

                               ALBRIGHT
                  You guys can go now. Easy and I
                  have some business.

16   INT. MAINTENANCE OFFICE                                        16

     Easy follows Albright inside and the big man goes behind a
     big wooden desk and puts his bone-colored shoes up next to a
     half full bottle of Wild Turkey. On the other end of the
     desk a small radio scratches out the Glen Gray Orchestra's
     "Gotta Be This or That."

                                                             12.

16   CONTINUED:                                                     16

     There is a paper calendar hanging on the wall behind him
     with a picture of a basket of blackberries, but other than
     that the room is bare.

                               ALBRIGHT
                  Have a seat, Mr. Rawlins.

     Easy takes a seat in a chair in front of the desk and tries
     not to stare at the tan leather shoulder holster under
     Albright's arm with the muzzle of the pistol almost reaching
     his belt.

                               EASY
                        (gesturing back)
                  Your friends, hunh?

                               ALBRIGHT
                  Like you, Easy. I need a little
                  help? I give 'em a call... Drink?

                               EASY
                  Sure.

     Albright pulls another glass from the desk drawer and pours
     a fresh one for Easy and fresher one for himself.

                               ALBRIGHT
                  One thing I like about working for
                  myself... I always have a bottle on
                  the table... You wanna drink with
                  me? Fine. You don't? Door's
                  right behind you... Joppy tells me
                  you're a war hero... Said you went
                  in with Patton.

     Easy nods, proud but polite, and Albright pushes him a glass
     of whiskey.

                               ALBRIGHT
                  So, you want the job?

                               EASY
                  Depends on what kind of job. I
                  don't want to get mixed up in
                  nothing.

                               ALBRIGHT
                  Walk out the door in the morning,
                  Easy, and you're mixed up in
                  something. Only thing that matters
                  is if you're mixed up to the top or
                  not.

                                                             13.

16   CONTINUED:   (2)                                               16

                               EASY
                  I mean I don't wanna get mixed up
                  with the law...

                               ALBRIGHT
                  Neither one of us wants to get
                  mixed up in that. That's just rich
                  people trying to keep me and you in
                  our place.

     He laughs and takes a healthy swig and Easy takes a drink
     too.

                               ALBRIGHT
                  I'm looking for somebody for a
                  friend.

     He pushes a newspaper across the desk to Easy and Easy holds
     it up.

     NEWSPAPER

     It's the front page with the photograph of the wealthy Todd
     Carter and his beautiful bride-to-be... Despite her smile,
     there's a sadness in the eyes.

                               ALBRIGHT (O.S.)
                  Daphne Monet... fiancée of Todd
                  Carter, one of the richest men in
                  town... Been gone for two weeks...

     BACK TO SCENE

                               EASY
                  She leave him?

                                ALBRIGHT
                  Evidently... You know how it is
                  with women, Easy... Happens to the
                  best of us...

     He rears back in his chair as if expecting a sign of
     recognition.

                               EASY
                  I ain't never heard of her before.
                  I wouldn't know how to find a woman
                  like that.

                               ALBRIGHT
                  That's a shame.

     He laughs a conspiratorial, lecher's laugh and Easy allows a
     smile.

                                                               14.

16   CONTINUED:   (3)                                                16

                               ALBRIGHT
                  See, Daphne has a predilection for
                  the company of Negroes. She likes
                  jazz and pigs feet and dark meat,
                  know what I mean.

     The insult takes Easy off guard but he should've known.

                               EASY
                  So you think she might be down in
                  Watts.

                               ALBRIGHT
                  I'm sure of it. But I can't go
                  looking for her myself because I'm
                  not of the right persuasion, so to
                  speak. I've been asking Joppy for
                  over a week, but all he could do
                  was introduce me to you.

                               EASY
                  What do you want me to do?

                               ALBRIGHT
                  Just get a location on her. Mr.
                  Carter wants to make up with her...

                                EASY
                  That's all.

                               ALBRIGHT
                        (smiling)
                  That's all.

     He pulls out a brown secretary-type wallet and counts out 10
     ten-dollar bills into a neat stack next to the whiskey.

                               ALBRIGHT
                  One hundred dollars, and I pay in
                  advance.

     Easy eyes the money.   All he has to do is pick it up.

                               EASY
                  I just have to tell you where she
                  is?

                               ALBRIGHT
                  That's right. And keep it, you
                  know, confidential...

     He freshens Easy's drink and Easy eyes the money some more.

                                                             15.

                  Joppy tells me you used to frequent
                  an illegal club down on Eighty-
                  ninth and Central. Somebody saw
                  Daphne there a few nights ago. You
                  could start tonight.

     Easy takes a drink and looks again at the money.

17   EXT. JOHN'S PLACE (MARKET) - NIGHT                             17

     Stripped down to its dark, naked self, Central Avenue has
     drawn a crowd from all over town. Neon glistens off slick
     pomade and silk clings to the contours of simmering flesh.

     An outrage to police even before the era of Police Chief
     Parker's personal crusade, a squad car sits idling while two
     dicks in blue manhandle a brother in a grey sharkskin zoot
     suit, prodding and whapping with nightsticks, searching for
     something -- anything -- because his date is a young white
     woman. A few onlookers stand back watching, but since this
     white woman is not Daphne Monet, Easy only glances and walks
     inside.

18   INT. JOHN'S BAR                                                18

     Easy sees his fifth white MAN that day in a disheveled but
     expensive dark blue suit staggering toward him, reeking of
     gin.

                               DRUNK
                  Hey, colored brother. I need you
                  to do somethin' for me--

                               O.S. WOMAN'S VOICE
                  Go on. What'd I tell you about
                  hair-assing my customers.

     Easy looks over to see HATTIE PARSONS, the small, brown-
     skinned manager of the place, glaring daggers at the drunk
     man while watching the commotion out the window.

     Easy starts over toward Hattie and the drunk turns and tries
     to grab Easy's arm. But his desperation causes him to trip
     and he winds up sitting against the wall.

     Easy steps over him and joins Hattie at the window.

                               HATTIE
                  I just paid these damn cops and
                  they still roustin' my customers.
                  Well, that's what he gets for being
                  with that white woman.

                                                             16.

18   CONTINUED:                                                     18

     She walks over to the cash register of this neighborhood
     corner store; and Easy follows, the drunk beckoning him to
     bend down to talk as he passes.

                               DRUNK
                  Come on, brother help me...

                               HATTIE
                  Don't worry 'bout him. I rung
                  Junior ten minutes ago to come get
                  him.

     Easy pulls out two dollars and Hattie deposits them into the
     till.

                               HATTIE
                  I ain't got nobody tonight but Lips
                  and his trio -- Holiday came
                  through here last Tuesday.

                                 EASY
                  Yeah?

                                 HATTIE
                  Yeah.

     Heavy FOOTSTEPS are heard pounding down a stairway in the
     back of the store and big burly JUNIOR FORNAY lumbers in
     with a cigarette hanging from his lips.

                               JUNIOR
                  Where's he at?

     Hattie points to the drunk man as he struggles to get to his
     feet.

                               HATTIE
                  Over there. Let Easy in upstairs
                  and when these cops leave throw his
                  ass out.

                                 EASY
                  Hey, Junior.    What's goin' on?

                                 JUNIOR
                  Not too much.    But stick around.

     Junior leads the way back up the stairs.

19   OMIT                                                           19

                               EASY
                  You got a cigarette?

                                 JUNIOR
                  Sure.

      He pulls out his pack and stops to light Easy up.   Easy
      starts coughing as they continue up the stairs.

                              EASY
                  Damn! How do you smoke these
                  things?

                               JUNIOR
                  Don't you hafta work tomorrow?

                                 EASY
                  Naw.    I got fired.

      A hint of a smile appears on Junior's face.

                               JUNIOR
                  The last time I heard these fellas
                  playin' tonight was back in
                  Houston, the night your ole buddy
                  Mouse had to pull me up off your
                  ass.

      Easy grins and shakes his head.

                               EASY
                  That's the way you remember it,
                  hunh?

                               JUNIOR
                  Hell, that's the way it was.

      And he stops to unlock the door.

                               JUNIOR
                        (continuing)
                  When you gonna admit that you
                  helped Mouse kill old man
                  Navrochet?

                               EASY
                  Aw, man, get off that. I ain't had
                  nothin' to do with that.

      Junior opens the door and Lips' alto horn slaps Easy in the
      face. Half of Houston, Texas seems to be jammed into this
      place.

                                                              18.

                   Boy, it's happenin' tonight.
                   Where's all the white women at?

                                JUNIOR
                   I don't pay them white girls no
                   mind.

                                EASY
                         (sarcastically)
                   Yeah... I bet you don't.

      And he steps in.

                                JUNIOR
                   That's right. Just like you didn't
                   help mouse kill his stepfather.

                                 EASY
                   Go on, man.

      And he starts away inside.

                                JUNIOR
                   Hey, Easy. Did you help him kill
                   his stepbrother, too?

      Easy turns to glare at Junior and the surly field hand slaps
      his thigh and roars with laughter as he closes the door.
      After all these years the two men still hate each other.

20    INT. JOHN'S SPEAKEASY                                          20

      Easy looks around to see couples trying to dance; finding
      themselves wrestling between tables packed with five and six
      people each.

      He heads for the bar pointing a finger at a man in a black
      silk shirt and a foot-high pompadour hairdo.

                                EASY
                   Alphonso Jenkins!

      ALPHONSO flashes pearls.

                                 ALPHONSO
                   Hey, Easy!

                                EASY
                   Hey, man, you seen a girl named
                   Dahlia or somethin'... White girl
                   supposed to be somethin' to look
                   at.

                                                                19.

                                ALPHONSO
                   Naw, but if I see her I'm gonna
                   keep her to myself.

     Easy claps him on the shoulder and waves at skinny RITA COOK
     who is sitting at a table with five MEN.

                                 RITA
                   Hey, Baby.

                                EASY
                   Hey, Rita!
                         (under his breath)
                   What do they see in you?

     Finally, Easy spots a fifty-year-old MAN in an old grey
     tweed jacket sitting in a corner at a table by himself.
     Looking like the God fearing, all fearing Baptist deacon
     that he is -- he is as out of place as a whore in church as
     he nervously gazes about the room and massacres a plate of
     barbecued ribs.

     Easy leans over the counter to the bartender.

                                EASY
                   Hey, Lewis. Gimme a couple glasses
                   and a pail of ice and send a quart
                   of bourbon over there to Odell's
                   table.

     Lewis scoops up ice into a small bucket and plops it onto
     the bar with two short glasses.

     Easy lays a dollar on the counter and carries the set up
     over to the corner as he watches...

     THE BAND

     burn it up.

     BACK TO SCENE

     Easy stops at Odell's table.

                                 EASY
                   Hey, Odell.

                                 ODELL
                   Easy.

                   How's it going tonight?

     Odell doesn't miss a bite as he scopes the crowd.

                                                             20.

                        (slowly)
                  Well... It's goin' alright.   It

                               O.S. VOICE
                  Easy Rawlins, is that you?

     Easy looks up to see

     DUPREE, a big black man with a wide white grin in a white
     suite with blue pinstripes and a ten-gallon hat.

                               DUPREE
                  You ain't jumped outta no windows
                  yet?

                               EASY
                  Not yet, Dupree.

                               DUPREE
                  Miss you down at the plant... You
                  know Coretta, don't ya?

     He has her in tow like a toy wagon and she offers a coy
     smile. Short and roundish with cherry-brown skin, she leads
     with her bosom.

                               EASY
                  Hey, Coretta, how are ya?

     Coretta rests her sloe-eyes on Easy and Odell and the church
     going man almost chokes.

                               ODELL
                  Oh, my goodness.

                               CORETTA
                  Could we sit down with y'all?

                                  EASY
                  Sure.   Sure.

     Dupree and Coretta settle in.

                               DUPREE
                  You know Benny just wants you to
                  say you're sorry, Easy. And he'll
                  give you your job back.

                               EASY
                  I'm a sorry man, all right. Any
                  man without his paycheck is sorry.

                                                                21.

20   CONTINUED:   (3)                                                 20

     Dupree laughs, smacking the table so hard it rattles like an
     earthquake. And Coretta's smile ignites like a slow fuse
     causing Easy to feel it all the way down his spine.

     A man with his hair marcelled back swoops in and pulls a
     quart of Old Crow from his overcoat and sits it on the
     table.

     Easy reaches for his wallet but Dupree beats him to it.

                               DUPREE
                  I got it, Easy. Your money ain't
                  no good up in here.

                                 EASY
                  Naw, Dupree.    This one's mine--

                                DUPREE
                  You sure?   You the one outta work.

     Coretta frowns at Dupree as Easy counts out three dollars.

                               CORETTA
                  And you're the one ain't never got
                  no money.

                               DUPREE
                  Aw, Baby...
                        (to bootlegger)
                  Get us another couple glasses.

     And he peels off a dollar and hands it off.

                               EASY
                  Either one of y'all seen a white
                  girl named Dahlia or somethin' with
                  a 'D'?

     Odell shakes his head "no," and Coretta looks away as if
     insulted leaving silence until

                               DUPREE
                  Hey, Coretta got a new job at the
                  phone company.

     He squeezes his woman in close and Coretta softens up and
     burns that smile again.

     Easy grins and nods "congratulations."

     It's less than a quarter full now because it's three hours
     later.

                                                                22.

     BACK TO SCENE

     John's is only half full and the band is gone. The jukebox
     echoes Lena Horne's "Prisoner of Love" and Dupree leans back
     in his chair, snoring -- mouth wide open.

     Odell gets up and starts to amble off.

                               EASY
                  Hey, you goin' home, Odell?

     Concentrating totally on keeping his balance, Odell waves
     feebly without looking back.

     Easy is droopy-eyed from the booze but Coretta just looks a
     little sexier. She straightens Dupree's hat on his head and
     twists up her nose.

                               CORETTA
                  He used to play till the cock
                  crowed. But that ole cock don't
                  crow nearly so much now...

     She levels her perpetual "come on" onto Easy and he nods
     sluggishly and lifts himself to his feet.

                               EASY
                  Think I'm gonna head out.

                               CORETTA
                  You be sorry if you go.

     She slides her hand inside her blouse and discreetly lifts
     her bodice to air her breasts.

                               EASY
                  I think I'd be more sorry if I
                  stay...

     He turns to go.

                               CORETTA
                  Daphne sleep by now. You can't get
                  none of that tonight.

     Easy turns and Coretta plays with the ice in her glass.

                               CORETTA
                  You been telling everybody Dahlia,
                  but her name is Daphne.

                               EASY
                  You know her?

                                                             23.

     Coretta leans back and fans her bosom.

22   EXT. CORETTA'S HOUSE - NIGHT                                  22

     Easy struggles with Dupree, and Coretta gives him a hand as
     they drag him from Easy's car to her front door, the big
     man's feet plowing two deep furrows in the lawn.

23   INT. CORETTA'S HOUSE                                          23

     Coretta pushes the door open and Easy hauls him in.

                                CORETTA
                   Throw him in there on the bed,
                   Easy.

     Easy pulls and pushes Dupree's dead weight into

     THE BEDROOM

                                CORETTA
                   Throwed him outta his place, 'cause
                   he couldn't pay the rent. I
                   shouldn't even let him sleep here.

     Finally Easy manages to pile Dupree onto the bed and then
     stands up panting and sweating.

                                EASY
                   Damn...

     Coretta leads him out into

24   THE LIVING ROOM                                               24

                                EASY
                   I need a cigarette.

     Coretta shines her hazel eyes on him.

                                CORETTA
                   That all you need?

     Easy grins nervously and clears his throat.

                                EASY
                   Coretta, sun catch me tip-toein'
                   out your door and no tellin' what
                   your neighbors say...

                                                              24.

                               CORETTA
                  Dupree run through his money, fall
                  asleep on me. And you just gonna
                  walk out on me like I was dog
                  food...

                               EASY
                  You got a man in the other room...
                  Why don't you tell me 'bout your
                  friend Daphne?

     Coretta strolls up to Easy, pressing her body against his.

                               CORETTA
                  Why you keep askin' 'bout her?
                  Colored women ain't good enough for
                  you no more?

     She undoes a button on his shirt and kisses his chest, and
     unbuttons another working her way down. Easy sweats harder
     than when he was lifting Dupree.

                               EASY
                  What if he hears somethin'?

                               CORETTA (O.S.)
                  Way he snorin'?

     ON THE SOFA - MINUTES LATER

                               CORETTA
                  Oh yeah, daddy. You hittin' my
                  spot! Oh yeah... yeah!

     The top of her dress undone, Coretta is straddling Easy who
     is hitting her spot and his too, in a rhythm. Eyes
     closed, he bites his lip to hold in the ecstasy so as not to
     awaken Dupree, who is sawing logs -- shredding 'em -- in the
     bedroom.

     Suddenly Coretta tears herself off of him and sits back on
     his knees. Easy writhes and shakes like a power line
     shorting out.

                               CORETTA
                        (coy, shy)
                  Oooh, that's just too good, Easy.

     Easy tries to pull her back but she twists down to the
     floor.

                               CORETTA
                  I can't give up that much love,
                  daddy, not the way things is.

                                                             25.

                        (out loud)
                  What things?

     She shushes him with a finger and twists her head toward the
     bedroom.

                               CORETTA
                  You know, Dupree's right there in
                  the next room.

                               EASY
                        (full voice)
                  Forget about him! You got me
                  goin', Coretta!

     Coretta quiets him again and he comes back to his senses.

                               CORETTA
                  But it ain't right, Easy. Here I
                  am doin' this right in the next
                  room and all you doin' is nosin'
                  after my friend Daphne...

                               EASY
                  Daphne?
                        (and then remembers)
                  Oh, yeah... I ain't after her,
                  baby. That's just a job.

                               CORETTA
                  What job?

                               EASY
                  Man wants me to find her.

                               CORETTA
                  What man?

                               EASY
                  Who cares, what man?   I don't want
                  nobody but you...

     He pulls her toward him but she pushes him away.

                               CORETTA
                  But Daphne's my friend--

     Frustrated, he sits back against the sofa and Coretta,
     sensing that he is snapping out of her spell, slides forward
     onto him giving him her spot again. And within moments
     they are back at it.

                                                                26.

                               EASY (V.O.)
                  I went on hittin' her spot until
                  just before sun-up.

     The sky is light purple as Easy stumbles down Coretta's
     porch. She waves half-heartedly and closes the door as he
     straightens his clothes and looks around for any "witnesses"
     on his way to his car.

                                                DISSOLVE TO:

     Easy's Pontiac pulls to a stop in front and he gets out.

                               EASY (V.O.)
                  It occurred to me that Coretta had
                  found out a lot more about what I
                  was up to than I had wanted her to.
                  But I had found out that the rich
                  man's woman had a colored
                  boyfriend... It had cost me a
                  sawbuck to get Coretta to give me
                  that information... Well, let's
                  just say somethin' had cost me ten
                  dollars.

27   INT. EASY'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - LATER                              27

     Golden morning light streams in through the window.
     Outside, a dog is barking at a bird on the fence.

     Coffee percolates on the stove and Easy walks over and pours
     himself a cup. He moves to the breakfast table and sits
     down by the window looking out onto the street as he opens
     up a blue envelope in a stack of mail.

     Gradually he begins to silently mouth the words and sits up,
     his eyes getting bigger until he finds himself reading
     aloud.

     Easy waters his lawn in deep thought.

                               EASY (V.O.)
                  The letter from Mouse was worrying
                  me in more ways than one... All I
                  had to do was call Albright to earn
                  the hundred dollars I already had
                  in my pocket... But the last time I
                  got money that easy I got it from
                  Mouse -- fifty dollars -- And the
                  next day I had to join the Army to
                  leave town.

29   INT. STOLEN CAR - NIGHT                                       29

     A younger Easy is driving, his hair greased up high in a
     pompadour with a pencil line moustache framing his top lip.

     A man in a wide brim Homburg hat looks away out the
     passenger window.

                               MAN
                  Drive to the trainyard, Easy!

                  Just drive this sumbitch!

     The drone of the engine takes us

30   BACK TO SCENE                                                 30

     A TRUCK with a whole family's belongings tied down onto a
     flatbed rolls up. A WOMAN and a bunch of KIDS fill up the
     cab.

                               WOMAN
                  Bye, Easy!

                   Back to Texas... It's too fast for
                   me out here.

     She waves and keeps on trucking.

     He watches her wistfully and then catches sight of

     THE WOODCUTTER across the street in a neighbor's front yard,
     axe in hand, about to swing on a lemon tree.

                                EASY
                   Get away from there!

     He picks up a rock and throws it, and then chucks another
     sending the scruffy vagabond wheeling his barrow off down
     the street.

     Easy shuts off the water and walks back up on his porch.    He
     picks up a glass of lemonade that sits at the foot of a
     chair on top of

     A NEWSPAPER

     A front page heading reads "CARTER'S WITHDRAWAL LEAVES TERAN
     ON TOP." Below it

     A PHOTOGRAPH of a smiling Matthew Teran, with lips too thick
     for a white man, getting out of a limousine.

     Easy is asleep on the porch. Finally, he wakes up to the
     ringing and heads into the house.

      He realizes that Albright has hung up, and swears under his
      breath.

33    EXT. PACIFIC COAST HIGHWAY - NIGHT                                33

      The headlights from Easy's car illuminate the cliffs that
      fall alongside the winding two-lane highway.

34    INT. EASY'S CAR - NIGHT                                           34

      Easy is cautious, checking the rearview mirror more often
      than usual.

                                EASY (V.O.)
                   I wasn't used to going to white
                   communities, like Malibu, to
                   conduct business. Champion
                   Aircraft was in Santa Monica but I
                   drove out there in the daytime, did
                   my work and came home. I never
                   loitered nowhere except among my
                   own people, in my own neighborhood.

A35   EXT. MALIBU PIER - PARKING LOT - NIGHT                           A35

      The lights from the   pier can be seen in the distance as Easy
      parks his car. And    the voices of teenagers in raucous
      conversation can be   heard above Glenn Miller's big band
      playing "Silhouette   In The Moonlight" on the jukebox.

                                                               30.

A35   CONTINUED:                                                     A35

      Easy gets out and starts toward the pier.

35    EXT. MALIBU PIER - NIGHT                                       35

      Easy walks past the hamburger stand and on to the railing
      that looks out over the ocean.

                                 O.S. VOICE
                   Hi.

      He spins around and sees a chubby 17-year-old white GIRL in
      a tight-fitting skirt.

      He nods respectfully and turns away to look out at the
      water, hoping she'll leave.

                                GIRL
                   It's pretty out here, huh?

                                 EASY
                   Yeah.   It's all right.

                                 GIRL
                   I'm from Des Moines in Iowa.    Where
                   are you from?

                                EASY
                         (without looking back)
                   Huh?... Uh... Texas...

                                GIRL
                   Do they have an ocean in Texas?

                                EASY
                   The Gulf, they have the Gulf.

      She leans on the rail next to Easy and he glances over his
      shoulder, seeing a couple of the young men looking around
      like they've lost someone.

                                EASY
                   I think they're looking for you.

                                BARBARA
                   Who cares? My sister brought me
                   'cause my parents made her. All
                   she wants to do is make out with
                   Herman and smoke cigarettes.

                                 PIMPLY-FACED BOY
                   Hey, you!   What are you doing?

      The five-foot-six-inch twenty-year-old charges straight up
      to Easy.

                                                                31.

35   CONTINUED:                                                       35

                                BARBARA
                        (yelling)
                  Leave him alone, Herman!   We were
                  just talking!

                                HERMAN
                  You were, huh?
                         (to Easy)
                  We don't need you talking to our
                  women.

     Easy braces himself as five of Herman's FRIENDS rush over,
     including one built like a football player.

                                FOOTBALL
                  Hey!   What's wrong?

                               HERMAN
                  Nigger's trying to pick up Barbara.

                               BARBARA
                  Leave him alone! We were just
                  talking about the ocean!

                                BARBARA'S SISTER
                  Barbara!

     Football gets right in Easy's face.

                               FOOTBALL
                  Hey, fella, what's wrong with you?

     A couple of the other boys have picked up sticks and are
     surrounding Easy against the rail.

                               EASY
                  I don't want no trouble.

                               FOOTBALL
                  You already got trouble, boy.

                               EASY
                  Listen... I was just being polite.

                               HERMAN
                  No, you weren't. You were talkin'
                  about the ocean!

                                O.S. VOICE
                  Excuse me.

     Easy sees Albright's Panama hat appear behind Football.

                                                                32.

                               FOOTBALL
                  What do you want?

     And he whirls around to Albright's smiling face, just in
     time to see him pull that rifle-like pistol from inside his
     coat, leveling it at his eyes.

                               ALBRIGHT
                  I want to see brains.    I want you
                  to die for me.

     Albright cocks the hammer. It sounds like a bone breaking,
     and Barbara starts crying in her sister's arms.

                               FOOTBALL
                        (quickly)
                  I'm sorry, sir.

     Easy nods but Albright is not satisfied.

                               ALBRIGHT
                  The question is: "Are you sorry
                  enough?"

                               FOOTBALL
                  Yessir.

                               ALBRIGHT
                  Then prove it... Show him... Get
                  down on your knees and suck his
                  peter.

     Football starts crying.

                               EASY
                        (to Albright)
                  I think he got the point--

                                ALBRIGHT
                        (to Football)
                  You heard me.

     He presses the barrel to the boy's forehead and Football
     goes down to his knees. The other young men look on in
     horror.

                               ALBRIGHT
                  Son of a gun. You were gonna do
                  it, weren't you?

     THUNK! He slaps the barrel of the pistol into the side of
     the boy's head. Football screams and the others scatter.

                                                                33.

35   CONTINUED:   (3)                                                 35

                               ALBRIGHT
                  Sick bastard.

     THUNK!   He smacks him again, and blood is everywhere.

                               ALBRIGHT
                  Get out of here. You call the
                  cops, I'll kill ya!

     Football manages to stagger to his feet and stumbles away
     into the darkness back out toward the parking lot.

36   Albright wipes his gun with a handkerchief and slides it         36
     back into the holster.

                               ALBRIGHT
                  I don't think they'd dare call the
                  cops.
                        (giggles)
                  But it'll cost me a few bucks if
                  they do.

     He claps Easy on the back as if it's all been in fun and
     giggles like a kid on his way toward the hamburger stand.

     Easy looks at him numbly and tags alongside, clutching his
     anger in tightly clenched jaws.

                               ALBRIGHT
                  What you got, Easy?

                               EASY
                  You sure no harm is gonna come to
                  that woman 'cause of me?

     Albright doesn't break stride.

                               ALBRIGHT
                  Course not. Mr. Carter wants to
                  buy her a gold ring and live
                  happily ever after -- What do ya
                  got?

     Easy exhales, feeling trapped, but he's come this far...

                               EASY
                  Woman told me she's with a man
                  named Frank Green.

     Albright stops; the charm gone, he's all business.

                               ALBRIGHT
                  Where?

                                                             34.

36   CONTINUED:                                                    36

                               EASY
                  He's got an apartment at the Skyler
                  Arms on Skyler and Eighty-third.

     Albright scribbles it down on a note pad.

                               ALBRIGHT
                  Anything else?

                               EASY
                  Frank's a gangster. A hijacker...
                  Liquor and cigarettes. He's real
                  good with a knife.

     Albright is unable to suppress a smile.

                               ALBRIGHT
                  Ever seen him in action?

                                EASY
                  Naw.   I just heard about him.

     Albright, still grinning, pulls out the brown "secretary"
     and counts out more bills.

                               ALBRIGHT
                  Here's another hundred.

     He shoves the money into Easy's hand.

                               ALBRIGHT
                  Buy ya a burger, Easy?

     He starts into the screen door of the hamburger stand but
     Easy declines.

                               EASY
                  No thanks, Mr. Albright.

                               ALBRIGHT
                  How come you let those boys get
                  around you like that? War hero
                  should have been able to pick 'em
                  off one by one before they got you
                  against the rail.

                               EASY
                  I don't kill children.

     For some reason this is hilarious to Albright. He throws
     his head back and wheezes out an almost silent belly laugh,
     then winds down.

                                                                35.

                                 ALBRIGHT
                  Take it easy.

     He disappears into the hamburger joint and Easy walks away
     back toward his car.

37   EXT. EASY'S HOUSE - NIGHT                                        37

     Easy pulls in front of his house and notices a dark Ford
     parked across the street as he gets out of his car.

     A tall, skinny white MAN in a dark blue suit gets out just
     ahead of his slightly shorter and heavyset FRIEND.

     Easy watches them as he moves toward his walkway.

                                 SKINNY MAN
                  Mr. Rawlins.

                                 EASY
                  Yeah.

     They approach fast but cautiously, the fat one with a hand
     in his pocket.

                               SKINNY MAN
                  Mr. Rawlins, I'm Miller and this is
                  my partner, Mason.

     They both hold out badges. Mason is a slob with grease
     spots on his wrinkled tan suit.

                               MILLER
                  We want you to come with us.

                                 EASY
                  Where?

                                 MASON
                  You'll see.

     And he takes Easy by the arm.

                               EASY
                  You arresting me?

                                 MASON
                  You'll see.

     And he starts pulling Easy toward the street.

                               EASY
                  I got a right to know why you're
                  taking--

                                                               36.

37   CONTINUED:                                                      37

     WHOMP! Easy takes one to the diaphragm, and as he doubles
     over the fat detective slips the handcuffs on behind his
     back.

                                MASON
                  You got a right to fall down and
                  break your face, nigger. You got a
                  right to die.

     The two cops drag Easy to the car and dump him into the back
     seat where he lies gagging as the car whisks away.

38   INT. POLICE STATION                                             38

     Easy's head sags down as he's dragged through the front door
     past blurred blue bodies that talk.

                               POLICEMAN (O.S.)
                  You got 'im, huh, Miller?

                               MILLER (O.S.)
                  Yeah, we got him coming home.
                  Nothing on 'im.

     A door opens and Easy finds himself being flung inside.

39   INT. INTERROGATION ROOM                                         39

     On his knees he hears the door close and looks up at a
     single, bare wooden chair resting on the corroded linoleum
     floor.

     He crawls to one of the urine-stained corners, and looks down
     on a dry, flat corpse of a mouse. He pushes his shoulder
     against the unpainted plaster until he's standing and then
     stumbles over to the chair and sits. He looks up at the
     bare pipes that run along the ceiling, dripping water, and
     at a window with criss-cross chairs instead of glass framing,
     overgrown branches and leaves pushing their way in.

     THE DOOR opens and Miller comes in first carrying a
     notebook.

                               MILLER
                  Ezekiel Rawlins.

                               EASY
                  Yes, sir.

     Mason follows and closes the door.

                               MILLER
                  We can take off the cuffs if you
                  wanna cooperate.

                                                              37.

                               EASY
                  I'm cooperating.

     Miller motions to Mason and he removes the cuffs.

                               MILLER
                  Where were you this morning at
                  about five A.M.?

                               EASY
                        (stalling)
                  What do you mean?

                               MASON
                  He means--

     He plants his foot in Easy's chest and pushes him over
     backwards.

                               MASON
                  --this morning.

     Easy has caught himself and stands back up.

                               EASY
                  I don't know... I was out drinkin'
                  and I helped carry a friend home.
                  I could've been on my way home... I
                  don't know... I didn't look at a
                  clock...

                               MASON
                        (wandering over)
                  He didn't look at a clock.

     WHOCK! Easy takes a fist to the ear and struggles to keep
     his balance, wiping away blood streaming down.

                               MILLER
                  You were drinkin' down on Eighty-
                  ninth and Central... At an illegal
                  club called John's, weren't you?

     Mason moves again but this time Easy turns to face him and
     the fat man looks back with an innocent face, his palms
     turned up.

                               MILLER
                  You may as well answer 'cause you
                  got bigger troubles than us bustin'
                  an illegal bar, Ezekiel.

                               EASY
                  What do you mean?    What's goin' on?

                                                             38.

     Mason has taken off his shoe and is swatting it against the
     palm of his hand.

                               MASON
                  Means we can take your black ass
                  out behind the station and put a
                  bullet in your head.

                               MILLER
                  Now. What time did you leave
                  Coretta James' house this morning?

                               EASY
                  I guess about five... five-
                  thirty...

     Miller and Mason glance at each other, and Mason kicks the
     chair over toward Easy.

                                MASON
                  Sit down.

                               EASY
                  Why, I'm gonna sit down and you
                  keep trying to knock me down?

     But he sits down anyway.

                               MILLER
                  Did you go back and see Miss James
                  later in the day?

                                EASY
                  No, sir.

                               MILLER
                  Did you and Dupree Brouchard have
                  words over Miss James?

                                EASY
                  Huh?

                               MASON
                  You heard 'im. Did you two argue
                  over Coretta James?

                                EASY
                  Naw.   He was asleep.

                               MILLER
                  She went to sleep too, Ezekiel.
                  But she won't be waking up...

     Easy's face goes sick...

                                                               39.

                        (continuing)
                  Where'd you go when you left Miss
                  James' house?

     Easy is too stunned to answer.

                               MASON
                  You heard him, where'd you go?

     Easy stares into space, answering in barely a whisper.

                               EASY
                  I went home with a hangover...

     CHOONK! CHOONK! Mason fires off two punches and Easy grabs
     his wrists and pulls him down to the floor, swinging around,
     straddling Mason sitting on his ass...

     Miller's police special presses into Easy's temple and
     Miller speaks to him quietly, deadly.

                               MILLER
                  Get up slow... Real fuckin' slow or
                  you know what's gonna happen.

     Easy raises his hands and uncoils to his feet, backing away
     cautiously.

     Mason is winded and furious.

                                MASON
                  Okay.   Let's take him out back.

     He gets to his feet and reaches for his gun, but Miller
     stops his hand.

                                MILLER
                  No.   Let's go.

                               MASON
                  Bullshit, I'm gonna blow his--

                                MILLER
                  Let's go!

     He pushes Mason toward the door.

                               MASON
                  Son-of-a-bitch! Son-of-a-bitch!

     They exit the door and Easy rubs at his bloody ear.

                                                               40.

40   EXT. L.A. CITY JAIL - NIGHT                                     40

     Easy walks down the steps of the station buttoning up his
     top shirt button, his hand cupped to his aching ear to keep
     out the chill of the night air.

     The street is dark and deserted like a giant black alley
     except for the black and white patrol car that sits at the
     curb. A taut-faced officer leans out the window.

                              OFFICER
                 Hey, Buddy!... It's a long walk...
                 why don't you let us give you a
                 ride?

     Easy walks across the street off into the darkness...

41   EXT. FOURTH STREET BRIDGE - NIGHT                               41

     A snatch of MUSIC and LAUGHTER startles Easy as he trudges
     home and a car full of teenagers shoots by. And then...

     A BLACK CADILLAC LIMOUSINE

     cruises up behind and drives alongside.

                               VOICE FROM CAR
                 Hey, you!   Ezekiel Rawlins!

     The window rolls down all the way and a white face in a
     black cap appears in the window.

                              CHAUFFEUR
                 Ezekiel, hold on.

     Easy keeps walking.

                              CHAUFFEUR
                 Come on, fella. Somebody in the
                 back wants to talk to you.

                              EASY
                 I don't have time right now.

     He doubles his pace, almost running.

                              CHAUFFEUR
                 Jump in. We'll take you.    My boss
                 wants to talk to you.

     Easy cuts behind the limo and into the street headed for the
     other side of the bridge but

                                                               41.

41   CONTINUED:                                                      41

     The Cadillac whips a U-turn blocking his way in the middle
     of the street while cars pass, honking, on either side. The
     tall angular chauffeur gets out of the car and holds up his
     hands as if making peace.

     Easy starts to make another move to escape but:

                               CHAUFFEUR
                        (continuing)
                  Come on. If we wanted to hurt you
                  it would have already happened...

     He opens the back door and after a few moments, Easy gets
     in.

42   INT. LIMOUSINE - NIGHT                                          42

     Easy settles into the seat with his back to the driver.

     Edith Piaf's "Parles Moi D'Amour" adds sugar to the strong
     smell of cologne and the portly form of Matthew Teran sits
     across from him with a small MEXICAN BOY in pajamas seated
     next to him holding a small elephant.

                               TERAN
                  I can see that the police roughed
                  you up a bit... That's a terrible
                  practice of theirs which has to
                  change, Mr. Rawlins... Has to
                  change.

     He opens his gold cigarette case and offers Easy a
     cigarette. Easy accepts and Teran lights them both up.

                               TERAN
                        (continuing)
                  She was beaten. And died from a
                  heavy blow to the back of the head,
                  Mr. Rawlins.

     Easy begins to feel nauseous.

                               TERAN
                  The evening's events have caught my
                  adopted son and I quite off
                  guard... My household was asleep
                  when we got the call that the
                  police had a suspect in Coretta
                  James' murder... Did you know that
                  she was a friend of mine, Mr.
                  Rawlins!?

                               EASY
                  No I didn't, Mr. Teran.

                                                             42.

42   CONTINUED:                                                    42

                               TERAN
                  Oh, you know who I am?

                               EASY
                  I read the papers.   You're runnin'
                  for mayor.

                               TERAN
                        (correcting)
                  I am the next mayor, Mr. Rawlins...
                  And luckily for you, a friend of
                  the Negro... When I arrived at the
                  station I knew right off that you
                  were being improperly detained as
                  is Coretta's boyfriend, Dupree
                  Brouchard. It's this sort of thing
                  that my administration will not
                  tolerate, Mr. Rawlins. Absolutely
                  will not...

     He sits back in his seat self righteously and offers a nod
     of assurance and awaits Easy's gratitude... Then after a
     moment...

                               TERAN
                        (continuing)
                  Yes... Coretta answered phones for
                  a while in my campaign office on
                  103rd and Western. In fact my
                  people got her a job in the phone
                  company. So when I heard what had
                  happened I got out of bed
                  immediately, personally because of
                  my concern... Was anyone there with
                  you Mr. Rawlins besides Mr. Dupree
                  Brouchard?... Any... other friends
                  of Coretta's?

                               EASY
                  No, sir...

                               TERAN
                  No young lady perhaps?

                               EASY
                  Nobody...

                               TERAN
                  Of course not, Mr. Rawlins. And
                  why should you tell a man whom
                  you've only just met. But, believe
                  me, Mr. Rawlins. You can trust me.

                                                                43.

                        (shrugging)
                  There was no one else.

     Teran's face sags with disappointment and then...

                               TERAN
                  Well don't worry, Mr. Rawlins... I
                  won't tolerate your being
                  harassed... You or any of my
                  constituency -- I was a city
                  councilman in the Watts area for
                  two terms with a large contingent
                  of colored -- I value all of my
                  supporters equally... humble though
                  they may be -- where can we drop
                  you, Mr. Rawlins?

                               EASY
                  You can let me out here.

                               TERAN
                  Are you sure, Mr. Rawlins? This
                  must be quite out of your way.

                               EASY
                  It's okay.

     The little boy stares up at Easy through big, dark almond-
     shaped eyes in the silence that follows. And then, Teran
     picks up the ivory horn that hangs next to his head.

                               TERAN
                  Norman, pull the car over.

43   EXT. WAREHOUSE AREA - NIGHT                                      43

     The limousine stops and Easy pushes the door open and gets
     out.

                               TERAN
                  Mr. Rawlins, may I offer you cab
                  fare?

     Teran's stubby fingers hold out crumpled bills.

                               EASY
                  No thanks.

     Easy closes the door and watches the long Cadillac glide
     away.

                                                               44.

                               EASY (V.O.)
                  There had been nights during the
                  war that I still had trouble
                  claiming as part of my life...
                  Insane nights I wasn't sure ever
                  really happened. And here I was
                  again... Had I really just gotten
                  out of a rich man's car who was
                  runnin' for mayor?.. Running
                  against the man I was supposed to
                  be working for... Was he really
                  lookin' for the same woman I was
                  trying to find? My ear was killin'
                  me and the buses had stopped
                  running. And I was feeling sick...
                  Sick from wondering if I had really
                  hard that Coretta was dead.

44   INT. EASY'S HOUSE - BEDROOM                                     44

     The room is a mess; trousers strewn here, shirt and shoes
     over there. And from the corners are haunting, ghostly
     whispers.

                               CORETTA'S VOICE
                  You be sorry if you go...
                        (heavy breathing)
                  I can't give up that much love,
                  daddy, not the way things is.

     A PINT OF BOURBON, 3/4 full, sits atop the cherry wood
     nightstand. Another empty bottle lies next to it on its
     side, in front of a water glass with 1/2 inch of liquor at
     the bottom.

     EASY'S HEAD rests on a pillow on the bed behind it,
     sweating, tossing and turning as the ghost gets louder.

                               CORETTA'S VOICE
                  Oh yeah, daddy. You hittin' my
                  spot... Oh yeah... oh yeah...

     The voice of the ghost is reaching closer for his ear.

                               CORETTA'S VOICE
                  Oh, that's just too good, Easy.   Oh
                  daddy... oh yeah...

     The voice is right up in his face.

                              CORETTA'S VOICE
                  Oh, baby. Oh, daddy, yeah... Oh
                  yeah!! Oh Yea-a-h!!

                                                              45.

     SCREAM. He jerks up, awake, and the phone is RINGING.    It
     jingles a couple more times and Easy almost knocks the
     receiver out of its cradle reaching for it.

                                 EASY
                  Huh?

                               VOICE
                        (a woman's)
                  Hello? Is this Mr. Rawlins?

                                 EASY
                  Who is this?

                               VOICE
                  Daphne... Daphne Monet...

     He sits straight up.

                               DAPHNE
                  You're looking for me.

     A pause on the line.

                               DAPHNE
                  I think you should come and talk to
                  me, Mr. Rawlins... alone.

                               EASY
                  Look, it's late--

                               DAPHNE
                  Mr. Rawlins, Coretta has been
                  killed...

     Another pause.

                               DAPHNE
                  And if you don't want any trouble
                  from the police then you'll come...
                  And you won't tell anyone that
                  you're coming.

                               EASY
                  Now wait a minute, Daphne. I don't
                  know nothin' about all this
                  stuff...

                               DAPHNE
                  I'm at the Sunridge Motel on 112th
                  and Grand, Room 102.

                                                                46.

44   CONTINUED:   (2)                                                 44

     Easy holds his hands up, helplessly -- "what do you want
     from me?" -- but no one can see and she has hung up the
     phone.

45   EXT. SUNRIDGE MOTEL - NIGHT                                      45

     It's a Spanish-style set of rooms with tile roofs set around
     a square parking lot.

     Easy's car pulls into the alley behind it.

     He gets out and scans the area looking down from a rise at
     the back entrance to the parking lot. And then walks down.

46   OMIT                                                             46

47   EXT. SUNRIDGE MOTEL - ROOM 102 - NIGHT                           47

     Before Easy can knock, he hears:

                                 DAPHNE (O.S.)
                  Mr. Rawlins?

                                 EASY
                  Yeah.

     The door opens and she's standing there, more beautiful than
     the photograph. They take each other in for a moment before
     she steps back from the door.

                               DAPHNE
                  Please come in.

48   INT. MOTEL ROOM                                                  48

     It's a regular drab, cheap motel that she has given a warmer
     touch with colorful scarves draped over the two lamps.

                               DAPHNE
                  Would you like a drink?

     She indicates a pint of scotch on the dresser with an empty
     glass and one that she's been drinking from.

                                 EASY
                  No, thanks.

     She indicates the chair.

                               DAPHNE
                  Please sit down.

     She's wearing a blue dress that's plain, cutting just below
     her knee with a ceramic pin just over her left breast.

                                                             47.

48   CONTINUED:                                                     48

                               DAPHNE
                  What happened to you?   Have you
                  been fighting?

     Easy stubs out his cigarette in an ashtray and sits down.

                               EASY
                  Why don't you just tell me what you
                  want?

     She sits down too, her calm but brittle exterior betrayed at
     the hands. She stops wringing them when she sees that he
     notices and takes a drink -- more medicine than pleasure.

                               DAPHNE
                  I should be asking you that
                  question. Why have you been asking
                  about me?

                               EASY
                  I heard about you. Fellas at
                  John's said you were something to
                  see.

                                DAPHNE
                  So...?   You've found me.

                               EASY
                  Uh... yeah... Guess I have. But
                  you got a boyfriend I don't want no
                  part of... Frank Green.

     She lights a cigarette.

                               DAPHNE
                  You can stop pretending, Mr.
                  Rawlins. I know someone hired you
                  to look for me. In fact I had to
                  pay Coretta not to tell you where I
                  was... you know how Coretta is...
                        (forces a weak smile)
                  She told me you two became 'good
                  friends' yesterday...
                        (tears gather in her
                         eyes)
                  I talked to her this morning before
                  she died.
                        (regaining control)
                  I... uh... need to go across town
                  to see someone. It's very
                  important... I can't seem to reach
                  him by phone. I'm afraid I'd
                  better have someone go with me.

                                                                48.

                               DAPHNE
                  Call me Daphne.

                               EASY
                  Daphne--

                               DAPHNE
                  I can understand why you'd be
                  nervous... because I threatened you
                  with Coretta... I'm very sorry, but
                  I couldn't think of any other way
                  to get you to come.

     She takes another drink and stubs out her cigarette though
     it's less than a third gone.

                               EASY
                  I can't -- why don't you ask Frank?

     She gets up and starts to pace nervously about the room.

                               DAPHNE
                  He's out of town -- I... I'm
                  willing to pay you.

                               EASY
                  That's nice of you but, see, I'm
                  not really a detective--

                               DAPHNE
                  --I know that.

                               EASY
                  I was just hired to ask around to
                  try to find you for a man--

                               DAPHNE
                  I know all about that, Mr. Rawlins.

                               EASY
                  But this is a gettin' a little out of
                  hand--

                               DAPHNE
                  --Mr. Rawlins--

                               EASY
                  --Easy.

                  Easy... If you don't help me, then
                  I'll call the police and tell them
                  that you were with Coretta before
                  she died and that you've been after
                  me too.

     That stops Easy.

                               EASY
                  You'd do that?

                                 DAPHNE
                  Yes, I would.    I don't want to but
                  I would.

     She hates herself for threatening and decides to change
     direction, moving in close.

                               DAPHNE
                  Please let me pay you.

                                 EASY
                  No.    I can't do that.

                                 DAPHNE
                  Why?

                               EASY
                  I don't want no part of all this.

                  Please, I'll pay you twenty
                  dollars.

                                 EASY
                  No dice.

                               DAPHNE
                  Thirty... or even more.    Name your
                  price.

     She moves in closer, massaging with her voice.

                               DAPHNE
                        (continuing)
                  Go ahead. There's gotta be
                  something that you want.

     Her eyes make an offer, but he's a better man than me and
     he's not taking.

                                                              50.

                         sarcastically)
                  What? Are you afraid I'll yell
                  rape or something?

     She walks away and turns up her glass, her desperation, raw,
     unguarded.

                  Uh, Miss Monet... Daphne, I'm sorry
                  but I really better be goin'.

     He starts out and she runs to stop him.

                               DAPHNE
                  Easy, don't touch that door--

     He opens it and

     SCREAM!   Like an alarm, she's SHRIEKING all of the scale.

49   He looks out and sees                                          49

     LIGHTS GOING ON in other rooms.

50   BACK TO SCENE                                                  50

     He looks back frantically and grabs her by the shoulders.

                               EASY
                  Crazy assed broad!   What the hell
                  are you doing?!

                  I'm really very sorry.   I really
                  am.

     She pulls on a coat and grabs her purse.

                               DAPHNE
                        (continuing)
                  I didn't want to do this but...
                  Shall we?

     She grabs an already packed suitcase and is out the door.

51   EXT. LAUREL CANYON - NIGHT                                     51

     Easy's Pontiac snakes up the winding road, city lights
     glimmering in flashes below as it rounds the curves.

                                                               51.

52   INT. EASY'S CAR - NIGHT                                         52

     Ben Webster's "I've   Got It Bad" plays on the road as Easy
     shifts nervously in   his seat, his eyes searching in the
     rearview mirror and   all around for headlights that might be
     unfriendly. Daphne    leans back against the passenger door,
     taking him in.

     Easy passes a police car pulled over to the side.

     He looks in the rearview mirror and its headlights go on.
     He takes a deep breath, bracing for the worst and Daphne
     looks back concerned.

     But the lights arch a U-turn and head back the other way.

                              DAPHNE
                 They must not have seen us that
                 well... God, Frank and I have been
                 pulled over so many times I
                 thought--

     She catches herself and looks over at Easy.

                              DAPHNE
                       (continuing)
                 Easy, I'm sorry... Don't be mad at
                 me.

     Easy keeps his eyes on the road.

                              DAPHNE
                       (continuing)
                 Come on.

     She tries to touch his arm and he pulls away.

                              DAPHNE
                       (continuing)
                 You really hate me, don't you?

                              EASY
                 How much further is it?

                               DAPHNE
                 Around the next bend...
                        (she grins)
                 You remind me of Frank when he gets
                 angry.

                              EASY
                 Ain't nothin' about me like Frank.

                              DAPHNE
                 Your jaw sets just like his when--

                                                               52.

                               EASY
                  I don't get no kick outta risking
                  my life for some white woman's
                  entertainment.

                               DAPHNE
                        (sighing)
                  Just park behind the Studebaker.

53   EXT. RICHARD'S CABIN / INT. EASY'S PONTIAC                      53

     The Studebaker is parked at a deadend in the street.    Easy
     pulls in behind.

     The cabin is so overgrown with ivy that all this is visible
     is the mailbox and address.

                               DAPHNE
                  Did you bring a gun or something?

                                EASY
                  What?   No.

                               DAPHNE
                  Easy, that's not very smart.
                  Everybody carries a weapon now a
                  days.

                               EASY
                        (defensively)
                  Well then where's yours?

                               DAPHNE
                  Search me sometime.   You'll find
                  it.

     She gets out of the car.

                                EASY
                  Damn...

     He frowns and gets out of the car.

54   OMIT                                                            54

55   EXT. RICHARD'S CABIN - NIGHT                                    55

     Daphne waits, clutching her suitcase and lets Easy lead the
     way.

     They get to the door and find it ajar.    Easy takes a look
     inside and then cautiously steps in.

                                                                   53.

56   INT. RICHARD'S CABIN - NIGHT                                        56

     He flicks on the wall switch. It's a typical little
     hideaway that the rich kept for summer use. The living
     room, dining room, and kitchen are all in one with a long
     counter separating the kitchen.

     On the left is a wooden couch with a Mexican rug thrown
     across it and a metal chair with tan cushions for the seat
     and back. The opposite wall is all glass with the city
     lights blinking in the distance.

                                 DAPHNE
                  Mr. McGee...

     No answer.   Easy leads them to a door and opens it.

57   BEDROOM                                                             57

     Another wall of glass and

     A DEAD MAN spread out on the king-sized bed, with the
     contents of the dresser and closet strewn all over the room.

                                 DAPHNE
                  Oh, my God!

     She gags and backs out of the room with her hand over her
     mouth in case she throws up.

     Easy takes out a handkerchief and holds it over his mouth
     and nose as he gets a closer look at the body.

     It's the drunk white man he had seen at John's Speakeasy in
     the same blue suit. He's lying on his back like a crucifix
     with a butcher knife buried in his chest. There's blood
     that has drained from his chest and gathered around his face
     and hair so dark and thick you could scoop it up like Jello.

     Easy actually does throw up and doubles over, dropping to a
     knee to keep his balance and some control. He stays there
     for several moments regaining his composure and then spots a
     spilled ashtray and a cigarette butt. He lifts it off the
     floor and smells it. He wipes his mouth with the
     handkerchief and then wraps the butt inside and puts it in
     his pocket. He gets up.

                                 EASY
                  Daphne!

     He hears a CAR ENGINE start up and GEARS SHIFTING.     Then
     runs out the door.

                                                                 54.

58   EXT. RICHARD'S HOUSE - NIGHT                                       58

     A pink Studebaker whips backward out the driveway. Easy
     runs alongside trying to stop Daphne as she screeches into
     the street.

                                EASY
                   Hey, wait a minute!

     She speeds off down the canyon.

                                EASY
                   Dammit!

     He stands in the middle of the street, watching her go.

59   INT. EASY'S CAR - SUNRISE                                          59

     Fiery orange light bounces off the hood of the car into
     Easy's face as he turns the corner onto his block. He is
     surprised to see

     A WHITE CADILLAC parked in front of his house.      And now it's
     his front door that's open.

     BACK TO EASY

     He pulls in behind the Caddy and gets out.

60   INT. EASY'S HOUSE                                                  60

     He pushes open the door. Shariff loiters just inside,
     grinning at him, and Manny stands in the middle of the
     living room looking at the floor. From a RADIO in another
     room Tommy Dorsey plays "Blue Skies" with Frank Sinatra out
     front. And so Easy walks past the two hoods into

     THE KITCHEN

     Albright turns from looking out the backyard window with a
     porcelain coffee cup cradled in his right hand.

                                ALBRIGHT
                   Easy.

     Easy looks at the coffee pot on the stove and again at
     Albright, smiling loose and friendly but looking tired in
     the same clothes he had on at the pier.

                                EASY
                   What you doin' in my house, man?

                                ALBRIGHT
                   I expected you to be home, so Manny
                   used a screwdriver on the door.
                   What happened to your face?

                                                               55.

60   CONTINUED:                                                      60

                               EASY
                  You got no excuse to be breakin'
                  into my house -- What if I broke
                  into your place?

                               ALBRIGHT
                        (still smiling)
                  I'd tear your nigger head out by
                  its root.

     Easy boils inside and then goes over to the counter to pour
     himself a cup of coffee.

                               EASY
                  So what do you want?

                               ALBRIGHT
                  Where have you been this time of
                  morning, Easy?

                               EASY
                  I went to see a girl. Don't you
                  get none, Mr. Albright?

     The smile leaves Albright's face and his eyes turn even
     colder.

                               ALBRIGHT
                  I didn't come here to play, boy.
                  You got my money in your pocket and
                  we've been over at that address
                  waitin' all night for Frank Green
                  and now we've found out that he
                  moved from there over a year ago.

     Easy is scared and confused but he plays it off.

                               EASY
                  So what do you want me to do about
                  it? You don't think I did my job.
                  Shit, I give you the money back.

     And he reaches for his pocket, but Albright reaches too --
     and suddenly, Manny and Shariff are in the room and on Easy
     like a vice. Albright presses the barrel of the .45 against
     Easy's forehead.

                               ALBRIGHT
                  Do you believe in God, Easy?
                  'Cause I'm curious to see if death
                  is any different for a religious
                  man.

     Easy looks down, away from the gun, and swallows hard.

                                                               56.

                                EASY
                  I seen her.

     After a moment, everyone relaxes and Easy sags out from
     under their grip and staggers into

61   THE LIVING ROOM                                                 61

     Manny and Shariff surround him as he sits down in a chair
     and Albright stalks in holstering his gun.

                                ALBRIGHT
                  Where?

                               EASY
                  She called me. Had me drive up to
                  the Hollywood Hills.

                               ALBRIGHT
                  How'd she know about you?

                               EASY
                  I guess Coretta... the girl that
                  told me about Daphne and Frank
                  Green.

                               ALBRIGHT
                  Why didn't you call me?

                               EASY
                  I couldn't. She threatened to tell
                  the cops that I had killed
                  Coretta...

     Albright looks over at his henchmen.

                                ALBRIGHT
                  Where is she?

                                EASY
                  She took off.

                        (dangerously)
                  Where is she?

                               EASY
                  I don't know! While I was looking
                  at the body she split.

                               ALBRIGHT
                        (nodding)
                  Uh-hunh.

                                                                57.

     Albright looks around the room as if answers lie in the
     corners, but he is not surprised to hear about a body.

                               ALBRIGHT
                  You call the cops?

                               EASY
                  I tried my best to keep in the
                  speed limit. That's all I did.

                               ALBRIGHT
                  What'd she do, take his car?

                                EASY
                  Hunh?

                                ALBRIGHT
                  McGee.   Did she take his car?

     Easy hesitates, "How did Albright know his name?"

                                EASY
                  Uh... Yeah...

                               ALBRIGHT
                  Where'd you pick her up at?

                               EASY
                  She left that place--

                               ALBRIGHT
                  --Write it down!

     To his shame Easy flinches and gets paper from his end
     table, then scribbles down the address and hands it to
     Albright who takes Easy's seat and examines the note.

                               ALBRIGHT
                  Get me some whiskey, Easy.

     Easy studies Albright who sits knees wide apart, now the
     master of the house, and he can't help himself.

                               EASY
                  Get it yourself... Bottle's in the
                  cabinet.

     Albright looks up and Easy braces himself for Albright to
     bring on the end, all at once. But slowly a smile spreads
     across Albright's face and he laughs, stamping his foot.

                                                             58.

                               ALBRIGHT
                  Well, I'll be damned. Get us a
                  drink, Manny... Easy, you're a
                  brave man. I need a brave man
                  working for me... But you gotta
                  find Frank Green, so he can lead us
                  to her.

                               EASY
                  No, thanks, Mr. Albright. People
                  are gettin' killed all around me...
                  You never said anything about all
                  this...

                               ALBRIGHT
                  Easy, you're connectable to two
                  murders. You'll do whatever I tell
                  you to do.

     Manny brings Albright's drink and the captain turns it up
     and gives Manny back the glass.

                                ALBRIGHT
                         (continuing)
                  Now you got three days to find him.
                  And you make sure you count 'em
                  right.

     He walks out the screen door with Manny and Shariff
     following.

62   KITCHEN                                                        62

     Easy grabs the bottle from the counter, where Manny has left
     it, and pours himself a stiff one. But he only stares into
     the glass.

     FLASHBACK:

63   EXT. BATTLEFIELD - DAY                                         63

     Dense black smoke masks everything but two vague figures in
     a struggle. The BOOM of heavy artillery gives way only to
     the deafening CHATTER of automatic fire.

     We are hurtling forward into a horror-stricken Easy in
     combat gear, repeatedly stabbing an already lifeless German
     soldier. Tears are streaming down Easy's face, his mouth
     gaped open in an inaudible SCREAM.

64   BACK TO SCENE                                                  64

     He studies the glass and pushes it away.   Then looks

                                                               59.

65    OUT THE WINDOW                                                  65

      Albright and his two goons get in the white Caddy and cruise
      away.

66    BEDROOM                                                         66

      He dials the operator.

                               EASY (V.O.)
                  I needed help... Albright didn't
                  flinch at hearing that Coretta was
                  dead and he seemed to know all
                  about Richard McGee too...

                               OPERATOR (O.S.)
                  Number please...

                               EASY
                  Raymond Alexander on...

      He pauses, speechless as

                                 OPERATOR (O.S.)
                  Yes?

                               EASY
                        (after a moment)
                  Forget about it, operator.

      He hangs up, his eyes trained in thought.

A67   EXT. JOPPY'S BAR - DAY                                         A67

      A crowd has gathered along the street to watch a three
      convertible car caravan: the first car bearing a four-place
      band playing "Happy Days Are Here Again"; the second with
      someone who could be Lana Turner holding up a "Teran for
      Mayor" placard with a man in the front passenger seat
      announcing through a megaphone; and last, but hardly least,
      Matthew Teran blowing kisses and waving two small American
      flags.

      Easy looks up for a moment as he closes the trunk of his car
      to watch the parade. Then stuffs a ball peen hammer in the
      waistband at the small of his back, under his jacket.

      He walks with a purpose into the open door next to the
      butcher shop.

B67   INT. JOPPY'S BAR                                               B67

      Easy stops in the doorway, seeing

      JOPPY as usual buffing the marble top of his bar. T-Bone
      Walker's "They Call It Stormy Monday" is on the jukebox.

                                                              60.

B67   CONTINUED:                                                    B67

      BACK TO EASY

      He scans the bar and sees that there are no customers, and
      walks in.

                                 JOPPY
                   Hey, Easy.

      Easy stops at the bar and stares at Joppy.

                                EASY
                   That girl called me last night.

                                JOPPY
                   What girl is that?

                                EASY
                   The one your friend is lookin' for.

                                 JOPPY
                   Uh, huh.   That's pretty lucky,
                   hunh?

                                EASY
                   No, Joppy... Wasn't no luck at all.
                   It was you.

      Joppy inadvertently clenches his fists and notices Easy's
      aggressive stance.

                                EASY
                   You and Coretta was the only ones
                   that had my phone number who knew I
                   was lookin' for her. And Coretta
                   was busy scammin' Daphne so she
                   wouldn't have done it... It was
                   you, man.

                                JOPPY
                   Maybe she looked in the phone book.

                                EASY
                   I ain't in the phone book, Joppy...

      Joppy's eyes narrow.

                                JOPPY
                   What the hell you mean, coming up
                   here all mad like you gonna do
                   something?!...

                                                              61.

B67   CONTINUED:   (2)                                              B67

                                EASY
                         (yelling)
                   You damn right! Coretta's dead!
                   Your friend Albright is on my ass.
                   The cops done brought me down once
                   -- Why didn't you just tell
                   Albright your damn self?

                                JOPPY
                         (yelling back)
                   What did I tell you? To just take
                   that man's money! I didn't tell
                   you to do nothin'! I call myself
                   trying to help you save your
                   house... Don't come up in here
                   startin' no shit with me.

      And he pulls a baseball bat from behind the bar, but Easy
      has pulled his hammer and SMACKS it down hard, cracking the
      beveled wood that frames the marble.

                                JOPPY
                         (continuing; panicked)
                   Easy, wait! Watch my marble! My
                   uncle left me that when he died!

                                EASY
                   And goddammit, he's about to get it
                   back.

      He draws back for the downswing, and Joppy drops the
      baseball bat, holding up his hands.

                                 JOPPY
                   Let's talk.   Let's just talk.

                                EASY
                   What you got me into, Joppy?!

      Joppy inhales, forcing himself to be calm.

                                JOPPY
                   She asked me to help her 'cause I
                   told her that Albright was lookin'
                   for her. And I figured I could
                   help you make a few bucks and throw
                   Albright off the trail too. She
                   wanted to know something about you
                   so I told her... I guess I must've
                   give her your phone number...

                                EASY
                   Where is she, man?

                                                                62.

B67   CONTINUED:   (3)                                                B67

                                JOPPY
                   I don't know...

                                EASY
                   Don't lie to me, Joppy!

                                JOPPY
                   I ain't lyin'... I don't even know
                   her that good. She just asked me
                   to help her. And she asked me not
                   to tell nobody... I guess 'cause of
                   her and Frank Green.

                                EASY
                   What's she runnin' from Joppy?

                                JOPPY
                   I swear I don't know. She didn't
                   tell me. I didn't mean to get you
                   into nothin', Easy... I just... she
                   just... I mean you seen her,
                   Easy... Man, she's something else.

      Easy can see "sucker" written all over Joppy as he fumbles
      for a cigarette with one hand and shakes his head with
      disgust as he lights up.

                                EASY
                   Damn, Joppy. Is there any white
                   woman that ever gave you the time
                   of day that you wasn't a sucker
                   for?

      Joppy frowns painfully and continues to wipe the bar.

67    EXT. T. CARTER FOUNDATION - DAY                                 67

      Easy turns into the winding driveway through the stone
      entrance way that bears the name of this distinguished
      institution on a bronze plate.

      He parks the car and gets   out, adjusting his dark brown
      Stetson which matches his   pin-stripped suit. He looks
      around at the massive and   well manicured grounds and walks
      into a patio area of this   Spanish-style complex.

                                EASY (V.O.)
                   Albright had said that when you're
                   mixed up in something it's best to
                   be mixed up to the top. I could
                   see his point. So that's where I
                   was going... all the way to the
                   top.

                                                              63.

68   EXT. CARTER FOUNDATION PATIO                                   68

     An ELDERLY SECRETARY descends an outdoor curved stairway
     carrying a file. She spots Easy looking around confused and
     immediately becomes annoyed.

                              SECRETARY
                 May I help you?

                               EASY
                 Uh... yes.   I came to see Mr.
                 Carter.

                              SECRETARY
                 Do you have an appointment?

                                EASY
                 No, I don't.

                              SECRETARY
                 Well, I'm sorry, but Mr. Carter is
                 a very busy man.

     Easy pulls out Albright's business card and hands it to her.

                              EASY
                 Well, tell him Mr. Albright sent
                 me, and it's real important.

     She looks at the card and then up at Easy with annoyed
     superiority.

                              SECRETARY
                 May I ask the nature of your call,
                 Mister...?

                              EASY
                 Rawlins. But I'm not so sure he'd
                 want me to tell you.

                              SECRETARY
                 I'm quite sure, Mr. Rawlins, that
                 whatever you know is nothing I
                 can't know as well.

                              EASY
                 Okay. Well, anyway, tell him I'm
                 here with information about that
                 little chippy of his that dumped
                 him.

                              SECRETARY
                 Is this some sort of joke?

                              O.S. VOICE
                 Uh... Excuse me...

                                                             64.

68   CONTINUED:                                                     68

     Easy and the secretary turn to see a TALL MAN in a dark grey
     suit with bushy black hair and thick eyebrows standing in
     the doorway. He forces a smile and comes out.

                               BAXTER
                  Mr. Rawlins was it?

     He holds out his hand and Easy shakes it.

                                EASY
                  Yes.   Mister...

                               BAXTER
                  Baxter.
                        (to the secretary)
                  I'll take care of this.
                        (and back to Easy)
                  Why don't you come with me, sir?

     They walk through the door into

69   A HALLWAY                                                      69

                               BAXTER
                  Not very smart talking about Mr.
                  Carter's business to a secretary.

                               EASY
                  I don't wanna hear it, man. It's
                  too much goin' on for me to give a
                  damn about what you think is smart.

     Baxter bristles up and slows down his walk, about to put
     Easy in his place. But Easy slows down too and squares up
     on him. Baxter reconsiders and leads the way up a stone
     staircase.

70   INT. CARTER'S OFFICE                                           70

     Baxter ushers Easy into a huge elegantly furnished room more
     closely resembling a hall than an office with large arched
     doors and windows leading out onto a stone veranda
     overlooking a canyon.

     Alone looking out at the greenery on the opposite hillside
     is TODD CARTER.

     Baxter walks out and speaks with Carter, while Easy watches
     them from inside the office. The rich man perks up with
     interest and hurries inside with Baxter who throws Easy a
     dirty look on his way out. He pauses uncertainly wearing a
     simple Sears Roebuck-looking tan suit with a plain open-
     collared white shirt. The dark circles under his eyes show
     nights without sleep.

                                                             65.

70   CONTINUED:                                                    70

                                 CARTER
                  Mr. Rawlins.

     He runs a hand through his thinning red hair, and offers an
     overstuffed sofa. They sit on either end.

                               CARTER
                        (distraught)
                  Has something happened to Daphne?

                               EASY
                  The last time I saw her she looked
                  fine.

                                 CARTER
                  You saw her?

                                EASY
                  Yeah.   Last night.

                               CARTER
                  She's still in town?

                               EASY
                  She was last night.

                               CARTER
                  What did she say -- what was she
                  wearing?

                                 EASY
                  A blue dress.    Blue heels.

                               CARTER
                  And a pin on her chest?

                               EASY
                  Yeah, on the left side.

                                CARTER
                         (carried away)
                  Oh yes, that's her. That's her.
                  You know I've never known a woman
                  who could wear perfume so slight
                  that--

                               EASY
                  --Mr. Carter, Mr. Carter--

                               CARTER
                  What did she say? What did she
                  say?... Oh, I'm sorry. Brandy?

                                                             66.

     He points to a crystal decanter near Easy. Easy pours
     himself a drink and takes in Carter as he wrings his hands
     to keep from going to pieces. This guy's got it bad.

                                EASY
                  Mr. Carter. I came here to get
                  some answers.

                               CARTER
                  Yes...?

                               EASY
                  I don't know... I'm takin' a
                  helluva chance...

     Carter runs his hand through his hair again, the suspense
     killing him.

                               EASY
                        (continuing)
                  I guess it's just that when I'm
                  working for somebody, I wanna know
                  what I'm gettin' myself into...

     Carter leans in as if he missed something.

                               CARTER
                  I beg your pardon.

                               EASY
                  Well, I'd like to know the real
                  reason why Mr. Albright hired me.

                                CARTER
                        (after a moment)
                  Mr. Albright?

                              EASY
                  Yeah. The man you hired to find
                  Daphne.

                               CARTER
                  There must be some mistake... I'm
                  sorry, busy... Who are you talking
                  about?

     Easy and Carter stare at each other, not sure how to
     proceed.

                               EASY
                  You didn't hire somebody to find
                  your girlfriend?

                                                                67.

                               CARTER
                  No... Until just now I was sure
                  that she was hundreds of miles away
                  from here... You say someone is
                  looking for her?

     Easy nods, his brow furrowed in thought. Carter gets up and
     walks to the door, looking out into the canyon.

                               CARTER
                        (half to himself)
                  Someone is looking for her.

                               EASY
                  What's goin' on between you two?

     Carter shrugs and stammers nervously.

                               CARTER
                  Uh... I don't know... We were going
                  to be married... We had a fight...
                        (then recovering)
                  Uh... that's none of your concern,
                  Mr. Rawlins.

     He stops and looks to the floor, the gravity pulling him
     down... way down.

                               CARTER
                        (continuing)
                  Someone's... after her? A Mr.
                  Albright? And he said he's working
                  for me?

                               EASY
                  Yeah... Do you know a man named
                  Richard McGee?

                               CARTER
                  No... I can't say that I do.

                               EASY
                  Why would someone be after her, Mr.
                  Carter?

                  Uh... I can't say -- I don't
                  know...

     He's lying and Easy knows it.

                                                             68.

                  Do you think you could find her
                  again?

                                EASY
                  I don't know.

                               CARTER
                  It's important, Mr. Rawlins, for
                  her sake... I'm willing to pay you.

                               EASY
                  Mr. Carter, why did she leave?

                  her...

     Easy thinks about it, and then nods.

                               EASY
                  Okay... a thousand dollars.

                  Yeah.   I'll take two hundred right
                  now.

                               CARTER
                  Mr. Rawlins. I think you're trying
                  to take advantage of me. But left
                  me inform you that the incumbent
                  mayor and the chief of police eat
                  at my house regularly.

                                EASY
                  Good.   Then they can help us--

                                CARTER
                  --No.   They can't!

     Carter is too emphatic and Easy waits for him to give more,
     but instead he turns and gazes out again at the canyon.

                               BAXTER
                  I'll have Baxter write you out a
                  check.

      Easy takes him in and then holds out his hand.

                                EASY
                   I'll take cash, Mr. Carter.

      Carter fumbles in his wallet, and too nervous to count the
      money, shoves the wallet at Easy.

                                CARTER

A72   EXT. T. CARTER FOUNDATION - DAY                               A72

      Easy walks to his car, gets in and drives away toward the
      entrance.

                                EASY (V.O.)
                   So Albright was working for Matthew
                   Teran. And whatever Teran had on
                   Carter was strong stuff... too
                   strong even for Carter to go to the
                   police... But because Teran was
                   desperate to find the girl too,
                   that gave me the best hand. I had
                   seen her once, and if I played it
                   right, I'd see her again.

76   POOL HALL - THAT NIGHT                                           76

     Easy talks to the short, squat, suspicious woman who runs
     the place. Through the smoke, other distrustful eyes fix on
     him from pool tables and dark corners.

                              EASY (V.O.)
                 Everywhere I went was a familiar
                 place, but different because I was
                 asking about buying hijacked liquor
                 from the man nobody wanted to talk
                 about. Frank Green...

     Upscale, with a balcony. Billy Eckstine fronts the band.
     Blacks and whites are dressed to impress, including Easy,
     who leans into the bartender.

                              EASY (V.O.)
                 It was actually looking more and
                 more like I might not make it
                 through this little adventure I was
                 having. But I was likin' the chill
                 in my blood, and the freedom of
                 working on my own.

     liquor in a wooden crate.

                              EASY (V.O.)
                 There were times in the war when I
                 had felt like this. When life or
                 death where the only two choices.
                 That made it simple. And that was
                 alright by me.

     Easy unlatches the gate and pushes it open. He's tired, and
     he trudges up the walkway to the porch. He sees

     THE WOODCUTTER standing on the front lawn of the next door
     neighbor's, waving at him.

                                                               71.

     He throws a rock and then unlocks the door. But he notices
     THE POT OF AFRICAN VIOLETS lying broken on the cement. He
     looks up just in time to see a TWO-BY-FOUR swing down.
     BONK! And Easy is seeing stars.

     A big man, dressed in black, kicks open the door and drives
     Easy head first into

80   INT. EASY'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM                                 80

     Easy slams to the floor but manages to roll out of the way
     of a lethal CRACK! of the board onto the floor.

     He grabs a lamp and hurls it at the oncoming figure who
     catches it on the arm and keeps on coming, snapping a blade
     from his fist which leaps out like a chrome-colored flame.

     Easy scrambles back, his head butting up against the couch,
     his forehead streaming blood, his eyes wide with the sight
     of sure death advancing.

                  talk to you!

     Frank looms over him, his   sinister but handsome brown face
     framed by a short-rimmed,   black Stetson hat and a black
     shirt and coat. He holds    the knife to Easy's neck, letting the
     blade press into the skin   as he talks.

                               FRANK
                  You the reason why she told me to
                  lay low, hunh.

     Easy buries himself back against the sofa.

                  for you. Rich man wants to talk to
                  a white girl you know. Daphne...

     Frank's eyes flame and he presses the knife, drawing blood.

                               FRANK
                  You a dead man--

     WHAP!   WHAP!   WHAP!

                  Easy, you in there?

     Frank's head whips toward the door and Easy knocks the knife
     away and comes up tussling.

     Frank scrambles to get away and Easy tackles him, straining
     to keep Frank from reaching the knife.

     THE FRONT DOOR springs open and SPATS ON PATENT LEATHER
     SHOES clump in, the last one stomping down on Frank's
     outstretched fingers. Frank screams and cradles his hand in
     agony.

     Easy scrambles up to his knees and gawks up at

     MOUSE, dressed in a plaid zoot suit with Broadway suspenders
     down the front of his shirt, a long-barreled .41 caliber
     pistol held loosely in his hand.

                               MOUSE
                  Want me to kill him?

                               MOUSE
                  Well, what's happenin'?

     He holds out his hand and helps Easy to his feet.

     Frank makes a slight move towards the knife and Mouse levels
     the pistol at his head, his gold-rimmed teeth glittering
     from a smile that wants Frank to go for it.

                               MOUSE
                  I'll blow your goddamned nose

     Frank just stares up at Easy, his eyes sharp and defiant.

                  Look, if you don't know where she
                  is, maybe we can help each other
                  find her.

     After a moment, Mouse cocks the hammer.

                                                                73.

                               MOUSE
                  Nigga, you heard him.

                                 EASY
                  No, Mouse.    Don't kill him.

     The phone RINGS next to Mouse and he picks it up, eyes still
     on Frank.

                               MOUSE
                  Huh?... He's busy right now, you
                  gonna have to call back.

     He hangs up.

                               EASY
                  Frank, a rich man she knows is
                  willing to pay a thousand dollars
                  just to talk to her. A thousand
                  bucks, man.

     Frank still won't talk and that does it for Mouse.   He
     releases the hammer.

                               MOUSE
                  Easy, lemme try.

     THUNK!   He slaps Frank upside the head with the pistol.

                                MOUSE
                  You better...
                        (THUNK!)
                  Talk...
                        (THUNK!)
                  You stupid--

     Easy grabs Mouse's arm and Frank slumps to the floor.

                                 EASY
                  Let him go!

                               MOUSE
                  Get out of my way!

                                 EASY
                  Let him be!

     The two friends struggle, and Frank rears up and plows into
     Easy, sending him sprawling to the floor on top of Mouse.
     Then Frank, covered in blood, hurls himself across the room,
     out the door.

                                                              74.

81   Mouse gets to his feet and runs to the door aiming the       81
     pistol, but it's too late. Easy stands up and Mouse points the
     gun at him.

                              MOUSE
                 Damn you, Easy. Don't you never
                 grab me when I got a gun in my
                 hand!

     Easy silently eyes the pistol and gives Mouse a chance to
     calm down. After a moment Mouse looks down at his jacket.

                              MOUSE
                 Look at the blood you done got on
                 my coat. Why you wanna go and do
                 that?

     He looks out the door and grabs a small suitcase. Then
     spots the bathroom and moves to it, taking off his jacket
     and hanging the pistol in his belt.

     Easy holds his fingers to the bump on his forehead and
     catches his breath as Mouse runs water in the bathtub.

                              MOUSE
                 Now we got to find that girl so we
                 can get that money.

                              EASY
                 No, we don't, Mouse. I don't need
                 your kinda help or I would've
                 called you.

     Mouse comes out of the bathroom, scrubbing at a spot on his
     jacket with a washcloth.

                              MOUSE
                 You standing there with a knot on
                 your head the size of a twelve-
                 year-old tittie and you "don't need
                 my kind of help"?

                              EASY
                       (angrily)
                 This is the same shit you pulled
                 five years ago when you asked me to
                 drive you out to your stepfather's
                 house, then come to find out you
                 killed him and your stepbrother.

                              MOUSE
                 Aw, easy, that was a long time ago.

     Easy glares at Mouse and dabs blood from his forehead with a
     handkerchief.

                                                              75.

                               MOUSE
                        (after a moment)
                  Come on, Easy. Cut me in on this.
                  I could help you. I let you run
                  the show. I swear I will.

     He ambles over to Easy apologetically and holds Easy's
     shoulders with both hands.

                               MOUSE
                  I swear, I ain't gonna do nothin'
                  you don't tell me to do.

     Easy knows he can't believe this but

                               EASY
                  Everything I say?

                               MOUSE
                  Everything you say.

     With no choice, Easy nods and walks into

82   THE BATHROOM                                                   82

     He runs cold water onto a washcloth and looks in the mirror,
     dabbing at his forehead.

                               EASY
                  Who was that called?

                               MOUSE (O.S.)
                  I don't know... Sound like some
                  white girl.

     Easy turns toward the door "Aw Man!"

83   INT. EASY'S CAR - DAY                                          83

     Mouse, in a plum colored double-breasted suit and a brown
     felt derby hat, turns on the radio and the Ink Spots' "We'll
     Meet Again" purrs out. He starts to turn the key, but then
     remembers and honks the horn.

84   EXT. EASY'S HOUSE - DAY                                        84

     Easy opens the door and stands on the porch.

                               MOUSE
                  Hey, Easy, was it a left on
                  Richland or a right?

                                                             76.

                               EASY
                  A right. And if Dupree ain't over
                  there in Compton, just come on back
                  'cause I might have heard from the
                  girl.

     Just then a car cruises around the corner and Easy watches
     MASON AND MILLER pull up across the street and get out. He
     glances over at Mouse.

85   INT. EASY'S CAR - DAY                                          85

     Mouse shuts off the radio and slumps down in the seat out of
     view.

86   EXT. EASY'S HOUSE - DAY                                        86

     Easy watches them stroll up the walkway.

                               MILLER
                  Mr. Rawlins... We came to ask you a
                  few more questions.

                               MASON
                        (grinning)
                  So why don't you just invite us
                  inside...
                        (holding open the door)
                  After you.

     And Easy and Miller go in.

                               MASON
                  What happened to your head? I
                  don't remember doing all that.

     He laughs and closes the door behind them.

87   INT. EASY'S HOUSE                                              87

     Miller looks around suspiciously. The room still shows
     signs of the struggle with Frank Green. He exchanges a look
     with Mason.

                               MILLER
                  Been having a party, Ezekiel?

     Mason pushes Easy into the chair and Miller plants his foot
     on the seat between Easy's legs and leans in.

                               MASON
                  You got a lotta cuts and bruises to
                  be an ordinary working stiff.

                               MILLER
                  It's looking worse and worse for
                  you, my friend. What do you know
                  about Richard McGee?

                               EASY
                  Who?

     On the other side of the room Mason picks up a chunk of the
     broken lamp from the fight.

                               MILLER
                  A dead white man in a cabin in
                  Laurel Canyon.

     Mason comes over and stands over Easy next to his partner.
     He fingers the sharp porcelain shard of the lamp,
     threatening.

                               MASON
                  He hangs out with some of those
                  same nigger friends of yours down
                  on Central Avenue.

     Easy eyes the sharp edge, making up his mind to kill this
     fat son-of-a-bitch if he gets too creative, and die with
     him.

                               MILLER
                  He just happened to have a note in
                  his pocket with 'C. James' written
                  on it.

     He holds the slip of paper up for Easy to see.

                               MASON
                  Any of this making you feel
                  talkative at all, 'cause I'll bet
                  ya six bits to a bottle of piss
                  that we're looking at a double
                  here... All we need is to place you
                  in the dead man's house.

                               EASY
                  I ain't been there.

                               MILLER
                  Where?

                               EASY
                  I ain't been in no dead man's
                  house.

     Miller stands back and pats his pockets for a smoke.

                                                              78.

                  How 'bout a smoke, Ezekiel?

     Easy taps out one and Miller places it in his mouth.

                                 MILLER
                  Got a light?

     Easy pulls out his lighter and sparks the flame.

                                 MILLER
                  May I?

     Easy shrugs and passes the lighter to Miller who fires
     himself up.

                               MILLER
                  Nice lighter...

     He holds the lighter out of Mason who wraps it up in a
     handkerchief.

                               MILLER
                  And we got our print.

                  down.

     As Mason reaches for the cuffs, Easy sees Mouse peek out
     from the kitchen doorway then disappear inside.

     give the signal, but then:

92    EXT. PORTLAND COURT - DAY                                        92

      It's a horseshoe of tiny apartments with over a dozen little
      porches and doorways staggered in a semi-circle around a
      small yard that has a half-dozen stunted magnolia trees
      growing in brick pots.

      Easy and Mouse step into the courtyard, passing elderly
      tenants sitting inside screened doors. Jimmy Lunceford's
      "I'm Walking Through Heaven With You" floats out into the
      yard.

      They arrive at the closed door of number eight. Easy knocks
      and then knocks again, hard. Something CRASHES on the
      inside and heavy FOOTSTEPS pound to the door.

93   INT. JUNIOR'S APARTMENT - DAY                                    93

     Filthy and junky, with old car parts scattered amongst old
     furniture, the room is unpleasant with only the benefit of a
     dim light -- just like Junior.

                               JUNIOR
                  Y'all want a beer?

     He nods at a card table with one folding chair and throws
     two others into place on his way to the refrigerator.

     Easy and Mouse sit down and Junior brings over a quart of
     PABST BLUE RIBBON BEER and two glasses that he wipes out
     with a rag.

     Junior tosses his pack onto the table and pours beer into
     the glasses for Easy and Mouse, and drinks from the bottle.

     Easy unfolds the handkerchief in his pocket on the table,
     uncovering the cigarette butt from Richard McGee's house.

                               EASY
                        (to Junior)

                               MOUSE
                  Sit down, Junior.

     Junior shifts awkwardly from side to side and then sits back
     down.

     a child throwing a fit.

                  Aw, man...

     And he aims the pistol and cocks the hammer, causing Junior
     to throw himself around some more.

                  today. My sister gone to work and
                  I didn't feel much like talking...
                  Raymond...

                                 MOUSE
                  Hey, big man!    Them pigtails I
                  smell?

                                DUPREE
                  Yeah. Lula Mae made some 'fore she
                  went to work.

     Dupree ushers them in.

98   INT. DUPREE'S SISTER'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - DUSK                    98

     Dupree's face under the kitchen light shows two swollen
     black eyes from a brutal police "questioning." His eyes are
     heavy with liquor and tears glisten down his cheeks.

                               DUPREE
                  Why somebody wanna kill her like
                  that? Why?

                               EASY
                  I don't know, Dupree... I don't
                  know...

                                                                88.

98   CONTINUED:                                                       98

     Dupree pours rye whiskey into a water glass in front of
     Mouse, who swallows half the shot without looking up from
     his plate of food.

     Easy declines when the bottle comes his way, feeling the
     pressure of time running out.

                               EASY
                  Did Coretta ever say anything to
                  you about a letter she was keeping?

                                DUPREE
                  Letter?   What kinda letter?

                               EASY
                  For that white girl...

                               DUPREE
                  Naw. But I know it was on account
                  of her that Coretta got killed.

     Easy rears back in his chair with keen interest and Mouse
     looks up from his pigtails.

     Dupree takes a drink and his eyes narrow in anger.

                               DUPREE
                        (continuing)
                  Everything between Coretta and that
                  Daphne was always such a damn
                  secret... I mean that ole girl
                  didn't think nothin' about two-
                  timin' on Frank... She probably
                  'innerduced' Coretta to one of them
                  ole guys she knew... And when he
                  came to the house after Coretta...
                        (starting to break)
                  ...he found out she wasn't that
                  kinda woman... Cops said she fought
                  him... aw my Gawd... fought him
                  'cause she wouldn't have nobody but
                  me-e-e...

     He buries his face into his hands and Easy throws a sad but
     frustrated look to Mouse.

                               DUPREE
                        (continuing)
                  Aw Gawd, I can't even go to
                  sleep... 'cause I can still see her
                  face that mornin' 'fore I went to
                  work...
                               (MORE)

                                                                89.

                                DUPREE (CONT'D)
                   Junior had been by and just left
                   the house... and she came runnin'
                   out to the car carrying her
                   bible... And she said, 'Keep this
                   for me, baby.'

      Easy and Mouse exchange looks.   JACKPOT!   And Dupree falls
      apart.

                                DUPREE
                         (continuing)
                   Police won't even let me go near
                   her house. So it's the only thing
                   I got left from her. It was a
                   sign... I know it was a sign,
                   'cause she was so religious...

                                MOUSE
                   It's all right, big man... it's all
                   right...

      And he pours Dupree a half glass of rye.

99    THE BOTTLE - LATER, NIGHT                                        99

      Barely a "corner" of whiskey lies at the bottom and

      DUPREE is snoring like a buzzsaw, sound asleep.

      MOUSE squints into his glass, wondering why it's empty, and
      looks down the length of the kitchen leading into

100   THE BEDROOM - NIGHT                                             100

      Drawers are pulled out on the dresser, and Easy is rifling
      through another until he pulls out a bible. He fans the
      pages, finding

      THE LETTER

      already opened.    His fingers pull out a photograph and then
      two more.

      BACK TO EASY

      His excited face goes sick, and he silently mouths:

                                EASY
                   Holy shi-it...

                                                                 90.

                                EASY (V.O.)
                   I was as nauseated from fear as I
                   was from what I saw... Pictures of
                   a much younger Matthew Teran and
                   children... innocent, helpless,
                   naked children...

101   KITCHEN                                                          101

      Easy hurries in holding up the letter.

                                EASY
                   I got it. Come on, I think that
                   girl is gonna call again.

                                MOUSE
                   That Dupree is a good man, but he
                   sure can't hold his liquor.

      Easy grabs his coat off a chair and starts to put it on,
      stuffing the letter in his coat pocket.

                                 EASY
                   You got your sails up pretty far
                   too, Raymond.

                                MOUSE
                   You callin' me drunk?

                                EASY
                   Well, you been puttin' it away
                   along with him and--

                                MOUSE
                   If I was drunk could I do this?

      And in less than a heartbeat he has pulled that long-
      barreled pistol and is aiming it at Easy's forehead.

                                MOUSE
                   Ain't a man in Texas can outdraw
                   me!

                                EASY
                         (forced calm)
                   Put it down.

                                MOUSE
                   Go on.

      And he puts the gun back in his shoulder holster.

                                                              91.

                                MOUSE
                   Go for your gun. Let's see who
                   gets kilt.

                                 EASY
                   I don't have a gun, Raymond.   Come
                   on, let's go.

                                MOUSE
                   You fool enough to go without a
                   piece then you must wanna be dead.

      He lays the pistol on the table then draws a .32 automatic
      from his waist, this time cocking the hammer, the muzzle
      only inches from Easy's head.

      Easy can tell from the glazed look in Mouse's eye that
      instead of seeing him, his friend is glaring at some demon
      he carries around in his head. So he stands stock still.

                                EASY
                         (quiet, soothing)
                   Let him go, Raymond... He done
                   learned his lesson. If you kill
                   him then he won't have got it.

                                MOUSE
                   He fool enough to call me out and
                   he ain't even got no gun? I'll
                   kill the motherfucker.

                                EASY
                   Let him live, Raymond, and he be
                   scared whenever you walk in the
                   room.

                                MOUSE
                   Motherfucker better be scared. I
                   kill a motherfucker. I kill him!

      Easy stares down the barrel of the gun for a long moment
      until Mouse blinks, then nods and lets the pistol fall down
      into his lap. His head on his chest, he's sound asleep.

      Easy takes the gun and puts it on the table with the other.
      Then walks to the doorway and turns out the light.

102   INT. EASY'S CAR - NIGHT                                       102

      The dim street lamps of Easy's neighborhood streak past as
      Easy scans the streets and sidewalks, wary for anybody who
      might be staking him out.

                                                              91.

                   The pictures were burnin' a hole in
                   my pocket... I had no doubt that
                   Albright had killed McGee... and
                   that he had done it for Matthew
                   Teran... But Teran hadn't known who
                   killed Coretta. I was sure of
                   that, too.

103   EXT. EASY'S HOUSE - NIGHT                                      103

      Easy's car pulls up and he gets out and looks around
      cautiously before starting up the walkway.

                                EASY (V.O.)
                         (continuing)
                   For the first time I hated walking
                   up to my house... I still didn't
                   know if I could go to the police.
                   But Albright was liable to be
                   showing up in a few hours asking
                   about Frank Green. I was thinking
                   I oughta forget the girl and leave
                   town, back to Houston or Galveston
                   where they didn't know me too good.

      Easy gets to the door, still literally looking over his
      shoulder, and hears the phone RINGING inside. He unlocks
      the door and bursts in.

104   INT. EASY'S HOUSE                                              104

      He races through the dark living room and into

105   INT. BEDROOM                                                   105

      And picks up the phone but the dial tone DRONES on the other
      end.

                                   EASY
                   Shit!   Damn!

      He whacks the nightstand with the receiver, dying with
      frustration. And SOMETHING MOVES in the dark. He lunges
      and grabs

      DAPHNE MONET

      and pulls her into the light, then sits down onto the bed
      before the shock can knock him down.

                                DAPHNE
                   Are you all right?

      Easy shakes his head in disbelieving relief and she reaches
      to touch the bump on his forehead.

                                DAPHNE
                   What happened?

                   I'm sorry, Easy...

      He pulls away.

                                DAPHNE
                         (continuing)

      Easy shakes his head, amused, and lights a cigarette.

                   --I already have the pictures...

      Daphne stiffens, as if from an electrical shock, and then:

                                DAPHNE
                   Easy, I paid seven thousand dollars
                   for those pictures. They belong to
                   me.

                   Coretta's life was important to a
                   few people too. What's say you
                   tell me who killed her?

                                DAPHNE
                   Easy, honey, I don't know.

                                EASY
                   'Honey?' Do Frank and Carter
                   really fall for that stuff? Come
                   on... You and Todd Carter have a
                   fight and all of a sudden he
                   doesn't wanna be mayor no more...
                   You leave, he's worried but he
                   can't even get his buddies in the
                   police department to help him find
                   you... And now you wanna buy some
                   pictures of Teran. Why? 'Cause
                   he's got some dirt on you.

      She gets up and walks away.

                                DAPHNE
                   Easy, why don't you just take the
                   money!

                                EASY
                   Is that what Frank told Coretta?

      She whirls around to face him.

                                EASY
                         (continuing)
                   Was she being too nosy? Or was she
                   just being Coretta and trying to
                   bargain up the price?

                                DAPHNE
                   Easy, please.  How much do you
                   want?

                                                             95.

                               EASY
                   Tell me. Is Frank your husband or
                   your pimp?

      SMACK! She swings and open hand across his face, and SMACK!
      He returns the gesture, sending her back onto the bed...

      He picks up the phone and dials "O."

                                DAPHNE
                   Easy, put the phone down.

                                EASY
                   Why don't you try screaming again?
                   'Cause I bet police like white
                   women with Negro boyfriends who
                   hijack trucks...

                                DAPHNE
                   Easy, please.

      She reaches for the phone and he pushes her away.

                                EASY
                   I bet they like pimps, and whores,
                   too, who scam rich white men like
                   Carter runnin' for mayor.

                                DAPHNE
                   Easy, please, put it down...

                                EASY
                   And I'm sure they like it when
                   these white girls tell their
                   colored men to lay low 'cause they
                   killed a woman over some pictures
                   of another rich white man.

      She gathers herself, just as:

                   Number please...

                   Frank is my brother.

      Easy is about to speak, but then stands still.

                                OPERATOR'S VOICE
                   Number please?

      He hangs up.

      She looks away, worn out, tired.

                                DAPHNE
                   We have different fathers. Mine is
                   white... Frank doesn't even know
                   that Todd and I broke up. So far
                   I've kept him out of all this.

      She gets up and takes Easy's cigarettes and taps one out.

                                DAPHNE
                   See, Coretta's the only one out
                   here in L.A. besides my brother who
                   knew about me...
                         (she lights up)
                   And about a month ago she took a
                   job working for, of all people,
                   Matthew Teran. She made friends
                   with one of the girls in the office
                   who told her that she'd heard that
                   Teran was a pedophile. And Coretta
                   got carried away and told her that
                   Todd Carter was engaged to a
                   colored woman. She was sorry and
                   didn't think it would get to
                   Teran... but it did and he got a
                   hold of my birth records.

                                EASY
                   Who killed her, Daphne?

      Daphne exhales smoke and brushes hair out of her face
      ignoring the question.

                                DAPHNE
                         (continuing)
                   Todd and I broke up and I paid a
                   guy for the pictures of Teran. But
                   somehow Coretta got them.

                                EASY
                   Who killed her?

                                 DAPHNE
                   It was an accident. Coretta and I
                   were still mad at each other. I
                   mean, she threatened to sell Teran
                   the pictures.

                                EASY
                   Who killed her goddammit!?

                                                              97.

                   I just asked Joppy to go over and
                   put a scare in her... It was an
                   accident.

      FLASHBACK:

106   INT. KITCHEN - CORETTA'S HOUSE                                 106

      Joppy points a finger in Coretta's face, backing her against
      the counter. She grabs a knife from a rack of dishes left
      out to dry.

                                DAPHNE (V.O.)
                   Joppy said she pulled a knife and
                   tried to dump hot water on him...

      She swipes at Joppy and he backhands her against the
      stove... She struggles to grab a pot of boiling water, but
      he wrests it from her and slings her across the room against
      the counter, her head striking the tile on the way down.

107   BACK TO SCENE                                                  107

      Daphne looks down at her hands.

      She stubs out her cigarette and sits on the bed.

                                DAPHNE
                   God, I didn't mean to hurt
                   anybody... It's just that with the
                   pictures I can--

                   What? Marry Carter?   Be white
                   again?

                                DAPHNE
                   Don't judge me, Easy! Do you think
                   I like pretending that I'm someone
                   else? Do you know how I've been
                   treated by people, colored and
                   white, when I've tried to live as a
                   colored woman in a colored
                   community. Do you have any idea
                   what any colored man whose ever
                   been with me has had to go through?
                   Don't you dare judge me!

      She sees Easy hesitate and she stands up.

                         (continuing)
                   Come on, Easy. Help me.

                                DAPHNE
                         (continuing)
                   Come on, you know it's the right
                   thing to do... You know if things
                   were different what would happen
                   between us.

                                EASY
                   I'll tell you what can happen
                   between us. You get Carter to
                   clear me up from all this and you
                   can have your pictures. That's all
                   that could have ever happened
                   between us.

                                 DAPHNE
                         (genuinely hurt)
                   Sure, baby. Of course,
                   sweetheart...

      The sound of the front door pushing open startles them, and
      Albright knocks on his way in.

                                ALBRIGHT
                   Well I'll be damned. You found
                   her.

      And Manny and Shariff step in, too, carrying baseball bats.

                                EASY
                   Wait a minute, Albright.

      Daphne breaks for the back way and Easy tries to bar Shariff
      from going after her.

                                EASY
                   Hey!

      Manny swings the baseball bat into Easy's side. and Easy
      yells and plows into him, wrestling him against the wall.

      Albright grabs Easy from behind and pries him free enough
      for Manny to uppercut him to the chin with the fat end of
      the bat.

      Easy sinks to his knees seeing double.

      Shariff leads Daphne back into the room, her face contorted
      into tears, her arm twisted up behind her in a hammerlock.

                                                              99.

                   I don't know.

      SMACK!   He backhands her.

      Easy grabs for the wall to get to his feet and Manny swings
      the bat down into his kidney.

                                ALBRIGHT
                   Where are they?

                   I wouldn't tell him! And I won't
                   tell you!

                                ALBRIGHT
                   Sure you will.
                         (to Shariff)
                   Let's go.

      Shariff leads Daphne outside and Manny draws his forty-five
      automatic and trains it on Easy, cocking the hammer.

                                ALBRIGHT
                   What're you doin'? Who are we
                   gonna give 'em to cover this shit,
                   hunh?... Use your head.

      He shoves Manny through the door and pushes Easy onto his
      side with his foot and he's out the door.

      Easy strains to get back to his knees as car doors slam and
      the sound of a car engine growls to life.

      He thrusts himself up from the floor and stumbles toward the
      front door like a boxer who should have stayed down for the
      count. He gets it open in time to see...

108   EXT. EASY'S HOUSE - NIGHT                                      108

      The blurred white form of Albright's Caddy screaming away,
      shattering the dark, shrieking in flight.

      Dogs are barking and a baby is screaming somewhere in the
      neighborhood while lights are going on up and down the
      block.

      Easy stumbles back inside and into

                                                                 100.

      He puts down the receiver, missing the cradle, and staggers
      out of the room.

      Easy is ripping through the night, the streetlights flashing
      by in blurs of light. The windows down, he's coming to.

                    It had come to me in less time than
                    it takes to think that Albright was
                    taking Daphne someplace more
                    isolated than that office building
                    downtown... Someplace where there
                    would be no witnesses... And I was
                    being left alive to take the fall.

111   EXT. BUTCHER SHOP/JOPPY'S BAR - NIGHT                             111

      The street is still alive. A couple of late night juke
      joints are coughing up the last drunken bits of the party
      onto the sidewalk to straggle home. Easy's car screams
      around the corner, and then skids in, sending a heavy-hipped
      young sister, about to cross the street, scrambling for
      cover.

      He jumps out just as Mouse scorches the tires on Dupree's

                   twenty bucks for them stockings you
                   got on.

      It takes a moment to register, but when she sees him pull
      a twenty from his pocket, she gets busy.

      He runs back to Mouse.

                                EASY
                   Gimme one of them guns you got.

      Mouse smiles, loving this side of Easy, and trades him a set
      of car keys for a .32 automatic.

      He runs back to the woman he almost hit and hands off the
      twenty, grabbing one of the nylons, leaving her still
      stripping as he runs into

112   INT. STAIRWAY                                                  112

      He takes the steps two at a time, pulling the stocking down
      over his face as he reaches the top and bursts through the
      open door leading into

113   INT. JOPPY'S BAR                                               113

      He charges through the raucous laughter of the half-full
      room right up to the bar.

      Joppy nearly drops the glasses he is clearing away as he
      looks down the barrel of the pistol aimed at his face.

                                EASY
                   Come on, Joppy. Let's go!

      Joppy hesitates, recognizing the voice.

                   You heard me.  I'll blow your head
                   off!

      And he cocks the hammer, causing Joppy to get a move on from
      behind the bar.

      Easy shoves him through the door, calling back to the
      startled crowd on his way out.

                                                              102.

       Easy hides the piece in his coat pocket as he bum rushes
       Joppy to the car.

       him.

       Mouse pulls off, around the corner, down the street into an
       alley.

       And he pulls out his pistol, aiming it back over the seat at
       Joppy as he drives. KABLAAM! The bullet slams through the
       rear window just to the side of Joppy's head.

                                  EASY

                    Hey!   Watch out!

       The car screeches to a halt and Mouse tries to aim again.
       But Easy struggles with Mouse's gun hand still holding a
       pistol on Joppy.

       Joppy's yelling, afraid that Easy's gun will go off.

123   EXT. ALBRIGHT'S CABIN - NIGHT                                   123

      The cabin draws nearer as Easy scrambles up the hill. He
      can hear Daphne crying out something, but he can't make out
      the words.

      It quiets down as he nears and sees shadows crossing a
      window with the shade pulled down.

      He moves cautiously, quietly to the window and peers through
      the crack between the shade and the windowsill. He can make
      out a sliver of what looks like a large room with a low
      ceiling. SMACK! And Daphne screams again.

                                ALBRIGHT'S VOICE
                   Come on, talk to me. Talk to me

                   Please! I don't have them!     Easy
                   has them!

      Easy can barely make out Shariff passing the window.   He
      strains to see more.

                                ALBRIGHT'S VOICE
                   You said he didn't know anything.

                   Okay. Grab that for me, Shariff.
                   It's ready.

      And then SCRE-E-EAM!! The kind that drops the bottom out of
      your stomach. The kind more akin to fear than the word
      itself... The kind that fries your skin with the cold chill
      of horror. S-C-R-E-EAMS again!!

                                 DAPHNE'S VOICE

                   No-o-o!

124   Easy's gotta make a move. KABLANGALANGLE! He smashes the           124
      window with the gun and the shade rattles all the way up.

      Manny looks right up at his face as Daphne arches and
      flails, trying to get free from his hands that are pinning
      her down on a battered old sofa.

      Albright is holding a glowing red poker that Shariff,
      standing in front of the fireplace, has just handed him.

      Easy starts blasting.   KABLAAM!   Manny takes one to the
      throat. KABLAAM!

      Albright and Shariff lunge for cover, and Daphne ducks down
      behind the back of the sofa, screaming and screaming.

      Manny, hand to his throat, pulls his gun on reflex, firing
      into the floor and then half runs, half staggers out the
      side door just ahead of another KABLAAM! that digs out a
      chunk of the wall.

      Easy hears the screen door open and then ducks down, getting
      ready for Manny who should be coming his way from the side
      door. He HEARS more steps stumble out and then... SILENCE.

      And then, KABLAAM! BLAAM! Two huge blasts rip right
      through the wall next to Easy's head, and he scrambles to
      the side of the house, underneath another window with the
      shade pulled down.

                                ALBRIGHT (O.S.)
                         (to Shariff)

                                ALBRIGHT (O.S.)
                   That you, Easy?
                         (SILENCE)
                   Tell us what you want, buddy.   See
                   what we can work out.

      Easy HEARS footsteps coming alongside the house where he had
      been moments ago. KABLAAM! BLAAM! Albright has fired from
      the inside again, thinking it's him.

                                EASY
                         (whispering)

      But it's Manny, clutching his throat, gurgling for air,
      stumbling aimlessly off down the hill. A walking dead
      man... EASY hears him tumble into some shrubbery and after a
      moment the gurgling stops.

                                ALBRIGHT (O.S.)
                   Easy... Hey, Buddy
                         (then to Shariff)
                   Come on, goddammit!

      Daphne cries out and KLABLANGLE! Easy breaks the window
      with the gun but KABLAAM! BLAAM! BLAAM! The windowsill
      tears out above his head and Daphne screams again.

      Easy looks up to see Shariff, holding her in front of him as
      a shield. He's headed straight for Easy, drawing a bead on
      him for the kill. And then KABLAAM! the back of Shariff's
      skull flies off and

      MOUSE is in the side door, blasting.     BLAAM!

      Albright breaks for the window. BLAAM! The slug spins him
      halfway around but he hurls himself through the window
      backwards.

      Easy scurries to the front of the house and BLAAM! The
      bullet goes wide and Albright manages to get into his car
      and returns fire. BLAAM! BLAAM!... Easy hits the deck.

      Albright's engine roars to life and he SQUEALS out on the
      gravel. Mouse appears on the other side of the house and
      CLICK! CLICK! he's out of ammo. He pulls out the other
      pistol, but it's too late.

                                MOUSE
                   Damn, damn, damn! I hit him!     I
                   hit him!

      Easy gets up from the ground and trudges into the front
      door.

125   INT. ALBRIGHT'S CABIN                                            125

      Easy finds Daphne standing in the middle of the room, her
      whole body quaking in shock. He takes off his jacket and
      drapes it around her.

                                EASY
                   Come on... You all right?

      Her top lip is swollen and bloody and she has a dark bruise
      on her cheek... She jerks her head, nodding "yes."

                                                             109.

125   CONTINUED:                                                     125

      As he leads her through the doorway, he stops to look back
      at Shariff's legs sprawling out on the floor from behind the
      sofa.

126   EXT. ALBRIGHT'S CABIN - NIGHT                                  126

      He leads her down the front porch and hears.

                                MOUSE
                   There's blood all over here... I
                   got him.

      Mouse gets up from squatting down, grinning, the gold rims
      of his teeth catching a glint from the light coming through
      the door. He looks Daphne over, admiring.

                                 MOUSE
                   Damn.   Sweetheart.

      Easy leads her past, quickly.

                                 MOUSE
                   She okay?

                                 EASY
                   Yeah.   Let's go.

127   EXT. ROUTE 9 - NIGHT                                           127

      Mouse opens the back seat door of the car and Easy sees that
      there's no one there.

                                EASY
                   Where's Joppy?

      And then he looks around quickly, seeing

      JOPPY'S BODY lying off on the side of the road.

                                EASY
                   What happened?

      Mouse shrugs.

                                MOUSE
                   I didn't have time to be tying him
                   up.

      Daphne sees the body too and starts gagging. Easy's face
      twists into helpless pain and he holds a handkerchief to
      Daphne's mouth.

                                 EASY
                   Why, man?   Why?

                                                                 110.

127    CONTINUED:                                                        127

                                 MOUSE
                    Why what? You just said don't
                    shoot him. And I didn't... I
                    choked his ass...

       Easy helps Daphne into the car and closes the door.

                                  EASY
                    Damn Mouse!   Why?

                                 MOUSE
                    How I'm gonna help you back there
                    foolin' 'round with him?

                                 EASY
                    He was tied up! Why?!

                                 MOUSE
                    Aw, man. If you didn't want him
                    kilt you shouldn't have left him
                    with me.

       And he goes around to the passenger side of the car to get
       in.

       Unlike up at the house this was murder -- the same as it had
       been in Texas with Mouse's stepfather and brother. Tears of
       rage well up in Easy's eyes as he hears the car door close.

                                                  DISSOLVE TO:

A128   EXT. GLENDALE TRAIN STATION - NIGHT                              A128

       Daphne sits in the car, her eyes staring straight ahead,
       still in shock.

128    EXT. PLATFORM - NIGHT                                             128

       A few people hurry to board the train, Easy and Mouse among
       them.

                                 EASY (V.O.)
                    I convinced Mouse to take the two
                    o'clock train to Pomona and to let
                    me handle everything else. He
                    could get a train back to Houston
                    later that morning... He was fine
                    with that but only because he was
                    seven thousand dollars richer.
                    Daphne had gotten the money out of
                    a locker at the YMCA without a
                    word...
                                 (MORE)

                                                                111.

128   CONTINUED:                                                       128

                                EASY (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                   Because she was still in shock and
                   couldn't really talk... Maybe too
                   because she had stolen about four
                   times that much from Carter.

                                MOUSE
                   Listen, if you think you gonna have
                   trouble with that dude Frank, I can
                   run by and kill him and take that
                   evening train to Houston.

                                 EASY
                   Naw, man.

      He has had enough of Mouse for a while.

                                 MOUSE
                   Oh.   This is for you.

      And he pulls out something wrapped up in a brown paper bag
      from his coat.

                                MOUSE
                   I cut you in for half 'cause I knew
                   you was too big a fool to take your
                   share from that white girl
                   yourself.

      Easy stares numbly at the package and then takes it.

      The conductor gets on board and the train starts making
      those metal on metal sounds.

                                MOUSE
                   Send my grip to Etta Mae. I'm
                   gonna see if she'll take me back
                   now that I'm flush.

      He slaps Easy on the shoulder and boards the train.

                                MOUSE
                   Oh, here's the keys to Dupree's
                   car.

      He tosses them, and the train starts moving.

                                MOUSE
                   And if you need somebody to run
                   them streets with ya, gimme a call.
                   You know how to put some money in a
                   nigga's pocket.

      And he laughs, flashing gold teeth pulling away.

                                                             112.

128   CONTINUED:   (2)                                               128

      Easy watches.

                                EASY (V.O.)
                   I knew I would see him again and I
                   didn't know how I felt about
                   that... 'cause, unlike Mouse, my
                   legs were like rubber... the way
                   they had been in the war the whole
                   two years I was there.

129   EXT. GRIFFITH PARK OBSERVATORY - NIGHT                         129

      Easy sits in his car smoking a cigarette, rubbing his aching
      chin, looking out at

      DAPHNE AND CARTER

      standing on the lawn in front of the planetarium. Carter
      wanders after Daphne, explaining while she paces back and
      forth in anger.

                                EASY
                   I could tell how it was gonna go
                   when Carter asked us to meet him at
                   the Observatory instead of at his
                   house... She knew it, too. But she
                   had come this far and she had to
                   play it out.

      Suddenly, Daphne stops abruptly and strides hurriedly back
      toward the car. Carter follows behind.

                                 CARTER
                   Daphne!   Daphne, sweetheart!

      He starts over, too, but then stops, knowing here's no use.

130   INT. CAR - NIGHT                                               130

      She gets in.

                                DAPHNE
                   Come on, Easy. Let's go.

      Easy throws a look over at Carter.

                                DAPHNE
                         (continuing)
                   Don't worry, you can give him the
                   pictures yourself.

      And she throws them down on the seat.

                                                             113.

132   Easy fires up the engine and pulls away with Daphne            132
      looking straight ahead.

                               EASY
                  Hey, I'm sorry.

      The slight twist of her head amounts to a shrug and then the
      tears flow. The sun is coming up over the city below...

                               EASY (V.O.)
                  For the first time I felt that I
                  could fall in love with her, too...
                  I was even wondering if it was
                  starting to happen when I dropped
                  her off at 63rd and Dinker where
                  her brother, Frank, was waiting...
                  Then it occurred to me that she
                  still had Carter's money... and I
                  felt like a fool.

133   INT. CITY HALL                                                 133

      Easy walks onto the rotunda holding a hand to his aching
      kidney. A secretary comes out to meet him and as she
      leaves, Todd Carter and a group of men in business suits
      converge on him, shaking hands.

                               EASY (V.O.)
                  Evidently Carter had told all his
                  cronies about the pictures because
                  they were all smiles and handshakes
                  and "how do ya do"... The Mayor,
                  the police chief... The newspaper;
                  land developers. All the men who
                  ran the City, and who really stood
                  to gain by who was the Mayor for
                  the next six years.

      The group fans out leaving Carter and Easy alone to walk off
      down a hallway.

134   OMIT                                                           134

      Spacious and heavy in leather and wood with a not-so-
      spectacular view of the mountains. It's cold and official
      like the job itself.

      Carter pulls a brown envelope from inside his coat pocket,
      not unlike Albright.

                                                             114.

136   CONTINUED:                                                    136

                                CARTER
                   Here's the remaining eight hundred
                   that I owe you... in cash... And
                   another thousand which I hope will
                   keep this whole thing... you know.

      Easy nods a tentative "sure."

                                CARTER
                         (continuing)
                   And I've taken care of your
                   problems with the police. You'll
                   have no more trouble there. And
                   that's a promise.

      Easy nods and starts to go, but...

                                CARTER
                         (continuing; to Easy)
                   Mr. Rawlins... did Daphne ever
                   say... she loved me?

      Easy shrugs, not knowing how to answer.

                                EASY
                   Would it really matter if she did,
                   Mr. Carter?

      Carter nods sadly and Easy walks away leaving him a lonely
      figure amidst all his power.

137   EXT. CITY HALL - DAY                                          137

      Easy holds his kidney and lowers himself gingerly down the
      granite steps.

                                EASY (V.O.)
                   I'd been thinking about Daphne,
                   too... wondering if she meant what
                   she said about what could have
                   happened between us... But at the
                   moment I was wondering if there was
                   any such thing as a sprained chin.
                   But other than that and a headache,
                   a loose tooth and a kidney that a
                   doctor would need to look at, I
                   felt like five thousand, three
                   hundred dollars... And unless
                   Albright was alive somewhere, that
                   feelin' was gonna last a while.

                                O.S. VOICE

      Miller and Mason are waiting outside their car at the curb.
      They come over.

                                MILLER
                   You got some mighty powerful
                   friends up there... mighty
                   powerful. But, see, we got a
                   problem.

      Easy listens disinterestedly.

                                MILLER
                         (continuing)
                   With the Chief sealing these things
                   up like this, it doesn't do much
                   for the morale of the men who've
                   been working on these cases.

                                 MASON
                   Yeah.   Makes 'em feel like shit.

                                MILLER
                   There's a guy who's been callin' on
                   the phone. And we're pretty sure
                   that he was up there with McGee.

                                 MASON
                   A... uh... colored guy... sounds
                   kinda dumb...

                                MILLER
                         (correcting)
                   Not very bright... But he said you
                   accused him of the murder. And he
                   swears you were up there, too...

                                MASON
                   In fact, he's out and out pointing
                   the finger at ya.

                                MILLER
                   How about a name?

                                MASON
                   He'd do it to you...

      Easy waits to make sure they're finished, and...

                                EASY
                   Sorry, fellas. But I gotta go.

      He starts away.

                   my call.

                                MASON
                   You son-of-a-bitch... You watch
                   yourself, you hear! Don't you even
                   spit on the fucking sidewalk... I
                   better not even--

      Mason's voice fades under.

                                EASY (V.O.)
                   It might be the last moment of my
                   adult life spent free was walking
                   away from City Hall.

138   EXT. EASY'S HOUSE - DAY                                       138

      A NEWSPAPER HEADLINE reads: "Carter Back In Race."

      The subheading reads: "Quiet Civic Leader Returns As
      Flamboyant Teran Quits."

                                EASY (V.O.)
                   The paper treated the mysterious
                   flip-flop like it happened every
                   day. And I could tell that Matthew
                   Teran wouldn't spend a day in
                   jail... Back in the second section
                   of the paper was a small article
                   about an unidentified man found
                   dead, slumped over the steering
                   wheel of a white Cadillac just
                   north of Malibu...

      FURTHER BACK, we see that Odell is reading the newspaper,
      nursing a can of ale.

                                EASY (V.O.)
                   It scared me to think about a world
                   that could kill a man like DeWitt
                   Albright... What could a world like
                   that do to me?

                                ODELL
                   Hey, Easy, where's your car?

      Easy looks up from pulling weeds.

                                                         117.

                   In the shop... I'm havin' it fixed
                   up a little.

                                ODELL
                   Yeah. Man can't get no decent job
                   in this town without a car.

                                 EASY
                   Shoot.   I ain't studyin' no job.

                                ODELL
                   Ain't thinkin' 'bout no job?   How
                   you gonna live?

                                EASY
                   I'm gonna go to work for myself.
                   Take a little money I got saved up
                   and go into real estate... Start
                   fixin' up folks' gardens again...
                   and do a few favors on the side...
                   Favors for friends.

                                ODELL
                   What you talkin' 'bout, 'favors'?

                                EASY
                   Well, like a woman offered me
                   thirty dollars to go track down her
                   husband for her.

                                ODELL
                   You talkin' about private
                   investigatin' or somethin'... You
                   could get in trouble doin' that.

      Easy keeps working.

                                EASY
                   Like a man once said to me, Odell:
                   'Walk out your door in the morning
                   and you're already in trouble'...
                   It's just how you're mixed up in
                   that trouble that counts.

      Easy gets up and turns on the water hose.

                                EASY
                         (continuing)
                   Odell?

                                 ODELL
                   Yeah, Easy...

                                                             118.

138   CONTINUED:   (2)                                               138

                                EASY
                   If you got a friend that does bad
                   and you still keep him as your
                   friend, even though you know what
                   he's like... Do you think that's
                   right?

                                ODELL
                   All you got is your friends,
                   Easy...

      Easy starts to nod, but then spots

      THE WOODCUTTER

      hovering over a rosebush in a neighbor's yard across the
      street, his shears ready to cut.

                                EASY
                         (calling out)
                   Get out of that yard!
                         (to Odell)
                   Bastard cut down two of my trees.

      Easy picks up a rock and sails it. Odell comes off the
      porch and does the same. Then a neighbor from across the
      street joins in.

      THE WOODCUTTER ambles off toward another block, leaving
      Easy, Odell and the neighbor gathered in the middle of the
      street.

139   UP THE BLOCK                                                   139

      a man with a pony is setting up a camera. A few children
      have gathered, and more are running over from other parts of
      the neighborhood.

      The man props up a hand-painted sign, "Cowboy Pictures -- 15
      Cents," and lifts the first customer onto the pony
      positioning a cowboy hat on the child's head.

140   BACK TO SCENE                                                  140

      Another neighbor joins Easy and company, and they continue
      to laugh and talk, looking up from time to time to wave at
      friends in passing cars.

                                EASY (V.O.)
                   I thought about what Odell had said
                   about friends and it made sense to
                   me...
                                (MORE)

                                EASY (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                   Odell goes to church every Sunday,
                   so he would know... Later on, he
                   challenged me to a game of
                   dominoes. And what'd he do that
                   for? We got to talkin' 'bout Texas
                   and fooled around and drunk almost
                   a quart of whiskey... And I forgot
                   about Daphne Monet, DeWitt Albright
                   and Carter and them... And sat with
                   my friend, on my porch at my
                   house... and we laughed a long
                   time...

                                                 FADE OUT.

    Donnie looks up to the Bartender. The Bartender nods. Lefty reaches

    A FIVE-CARAT DIAMOND RING
                           LEFTY
              That's a beauty, eh? That's some

              Are you for real? I'm asking if

              How can you say it's a fugazy?
              You looked at it two seconds.

              who you're talking to?
    The Bartender, SCARED--he knows what Lefty's capable of. Quickly
    mixes a SPRITZER.
                        BARTENDER
              Here, Left, have a spritzer.

              neighborhood in the city when she
              walks down the Clock. In all the
              Five Boroughs I'm known,
              fuggedaboudit--I'm known all over
              the world. You ask around--ask
              anybody about Lefty from Mulberry
              Street.
                        DONNIE
              I'm sorry. It was just a
              misunderstanding. Okay?
    Donnie backs off, EXITS. Lefty takes the diamond out, looks at i-
    FUMES. The Bartender slides the spritzer over.

                  You don't raise your hands to a
                  wiseguy. You don't mess with his

                 for three weeks. Or three
                 months. Then he expects

                 wants it. Be vacuums the entire
                 house. Do you know another man
                 who vacu ums? It's abno rmal. Of
                 course, he expects the girls to

                  Being the distancer forces Maggie
                  into the role of the pursuer.
                  That gives you a feeling of
                  power. Simultaneously you resent
                  Maggie for expressing the very

72   INT. M ORNING.       PISTONE HO ME
     Donnie convenes a FAMILY MEETING over breakfast. Terry, Kerry and
     Maggie sit, sullen, around the kitchen table. Sherry runs down the
     stairs, sits down.
                           SHERRY
               Sorry I ' m late.
                               DONNIE
               Okay. I called this family
               meeting because there's something
               we have to t alk a bout. I kn ow
               what I'm doing involves a lot of
               sacrifice from everyone, but this
               is something patriotic for the
               country that you can all be proud
               of.
                    (beat)
               I called the meeting because
               we're gonna have to move.
                              TERRY
                  I ' m not moving.
                               DONNIE
               This isn't a democracy, Terry.
               This is a dictatorsh ip. And
               that's my decision. It's getting
               too dangerous.
                          MAGGIE
               Well, I don't want to move
               eithe r, Joe. Mo ve where?
                               DONNIE
               There's too many people here who
               know us.
                         MAGGIE
               Those people are known as
               'friends,' Joe. You told me when
               we started this that we'd be
               moving back close to the family.
               That was the deal.

                  Well, Mr. 'Anderson', you've

               Minnesota's great. Lakes and
               everything. We can get a nice
               piece of land there. Maybe we

     Donnie nods toward the parking lot. Lefty looks, sees a LINCOLN TOWN
     CAR pull up.
                            LEFTY
                  That's him. That's Trafficante.
     Lefty jogs up the dock as STEVE DISALVO, 40s, Trafficante's ENFORCER,
     emerges from the Lincoln.

                  This's Mr. Trafficante.
     Lefty turns as SANTO TRAFFICANTE, 70s, a feeble old man with a pork
     pie hat, is helped from the car by his entourage of FLORIDA WISEGUYS.
     He and Lefty shake hands.

                  If Donnie had a dollar for every
                  broad of all his broads, he could
                  buy the fucking boat himself.

                  If Donnie's got so many broads,
                  how come we never seen none of
                  them?

     Sonny catches up. Grabs his .45 by the barrel and savagely SMASHES
     Boobie in the head. A thick sound--like a melon falling off a shelf.
     Again and again...Blood EVERYWHERE... Donnie backs off, looks up, as
     LEFTY ARRIVES
     in his Cadillac. Nicky beside him. Sonny tosses Boobie's keys to

110   INT. DAY.    HOSPITAL
      Maggie convalesces--her wounds have begun to heal and she's no longer
      intubated, although her eyes are still bandaged. Jules enters, sits
      down beside her. Takes her hand.
                             JULES
                   It's Jules, Maggie.

                   I could hear your cheap shoes all

                   You mean did Joe see me?

                   He'll never come out.

                   Joe? He wouldn't have the
                   imagination. I wish he'd become
                   a gangster--at least we could pay
                   our frigging bills.
                                  JULE S
                   Maybe you could talk to him.

                 rules . The job is the job .
                 Start what you finish. When he's

                best and when he's in the Mafia
                h e wants t o be the"b est--like

               FADE IN:

               A-1 LOS ANGELES - A DOWNTOWN INTERSECTION

               It is night, about two o'clock, very light traffic.

               At the left and in the immediate foreground a semaphore 
               traffic signal stands at GO. Approaching it at about thirty 
               miles per hour is a Dodge 1938 coupe. It is driven erratically 
               and weaving a little, but not out of control.

               When the car is about forty feet away, the signal changes to 
               STOP. Car makes no attempt to stop but comes on through.

               A-2 A LIGHT NEWSPAPER TRUCK

               is crossing the intersection at right angles. It swerves and 
               skids to avoid the Dodge, which goes on as though nothing 
               had happened. The truck stops with a panicky screech of tires. 
               There is a large sign on the truck: "READ THE LOS ANGELES 
               TIMES". The truck driver's infuriated face stares after the 
               coupe.

               A-3 THE COUPE

               continues along the street, still weaving, then slows down 
               and pulls over towards the curb in front of a tall office 
               building.

               A-4 THE COUPE

               stops. The headlights are turned off. For a second nothing 
               happens, then the car door opens slowly. A man eases himself 
               out onto the sidewalk and stands a moment leaning on the 
               open door to support himself. He's a tall man, about thirty-
               five years old. From the way he moves there seems to be 
               something wrong with his left shoulder.

               He straightens up and painfully lowers his left hand into 
               his jacket pocket. He leans into the car. He brings out a 
               light-weight overcoat and drapes it across his shoulders. He 
               shuts the car door and walks toward the building.

               A-5 ENTRANCE OF THE BUILDING

               Above the closed, double-plate glass doors is lettered: 
               "PACIFIC BUILDING". To the left of entrance there is a 
               drugstore, closed, dark except for a faint light in the back. 
               The man comes stiffly up to the doors. (CAMERA HAS MOVED UP 
               WITH HIM). He tries the doors. They are locked. He knocks on 
               the glass. Inside, over his shoulder, the lobby of the 
               building is visible: a side entrance to the drugstore on the 
               left, in the rear a barber shop and cigar and magazine stand 
               closed up for the night, and to the right two elevators. One 
               elevator is open and its dome light falls across the dark 
               lobby.

               The man knocks again. The night watchman sticks his head out 
               of the elevator and looks toward entrance. He comes out with 
               a newspaper in one hand and a half-eaten sandwich in the 
               other. He finishes the sandwich on the way to the doors, 
               looks out and recognizes the man outside, unlocks the door 
               and pulls it open.

                                     NIGHT WATCHMAN
                         Hello there, Mr. Neff.

               Neff walks in past him without answering.

               A-6 INT. LOBBY

               Neff is walking towards elevator. Night watchman looks after 
               him, relocks door, follows to elevator. Neff enters elevator.

               A-7 ELEVATOR

               Neff stands leaning against wall. He is pale and haggard 
               with pain, but deadpans as night watchman joins him.

                                     NIGHT WATCHMAN
                         Working pretty late aren't you, Mr. 
                         Neff?

                                     NEFF
                              (Tight-lipped)
                         Late enough.

                                     NIGHT WATCHMAN
                         You look kind of all in at that.

                                     NEFF
                         I'm fine. Let's ride.

               Night watchman pulls lever, doors close and elevator rises.

                                     NIGHT WATCHMAN
                         How's the insurance business, Mr. 
                         Neff?

                                     NEFF
                         Okay.

                                     NIGHT WATCHMAN
                         They wouldn't ever sell me any. They 
                         say I've got something loose in my 
                         heart. I say it's rheumatism.

                                     NEFF
                              (Scarcely listening)
                         Uh-huh.

               Night watchman looks around at him, turns away again and the 
               elevator stops.

                                     NIGHT WATCHMAN
                              (Surly)
                         Twelve.

               The door opens. Across a small dark reception room a pair of 
               frosted glass doors are lettered: PACIFIC ALL-RISK INSURANCE 
               COMPANY - FOUNDED 1906 - MAIN OFFICE. There is a little light 
               beyond the glass doors.

               Neff straightens up and walks heavily out of the elevator, 
               across reception room to doors. He pushes them open. The 
               night watchman stares after him morosely, works lever, 
               elevator doors start to close.

               A-8 TWELFTH FLOOR INSURANCE OFFICE

               (Note for set-designer: Our Insurance Company occupies the 
               entire eleventh and twelfth floors of the building. On the 
               twelfth floor are the executive offices and claims and sales 
               departments. These all open off a balcony which runs all the 
               way around. From the balcony you see the eleventh floor below: 
               one enormous room filled with desks, typewriters, filing 
               cabinets, business machines, etc.)

               Neff comes through the double entrance doors from the 
               reception room. The twelfth floor is dark. Some light shines 
               up from the eleventh floor. Neff takes a few steps then holds 
               on to the balcony railing and looks down.

               A-9 THE ELEVENTH FLOOR FROM ABOVE - NEFF'S POINT OF VIEW

               Two colored women are cleaning the offices. One is dry-mopping 
               the floor, the other is moving chairs back into position, 
               etc. A colored man is emptying waste baskets into a big square 
               box. He shuffles a little dance step as he moves, and hums a 
               little tune.

               A-10 NEFF

               Moves away from the railing with a faint smile on his face, 
               and walks past two or three offices (CAMERA WITH HIM) towards 
               a glass door with number twenty-seven on it and three names: 
               HENRY B. ANDERSON, WALTER NEFF, LOUIS L. SCHWARTZ. Neff opens 
               the door.

               A-11 INT. NEFF'S OFFICE - DARK

               Three desks, filing cabinets, one typewriter on stand, one 
               dictaphone on fixed stand against wall with rack of records 
               underneath, telephones on all three desks. Water cooler with 
               inverted bottle and paper cup holder beside it. Two windows 
               facing toward front of building. Venetian blinds. No curtains. 
               Waste basket full, ash trays not emptied. The office has not 
               been cleaned.

               Neff enters, switches on desk lamp. He looks across at dicta 
               phone, goes heavily to it and lifts off the fabric cover. He 
               leans down hard on the dictaphone stand as if feeling faint. 
               He turns away from dictaphone, takes a few uncertain steps 
               and falls heavily into a swivel chair. His head goes far 
               back, his eyes close, cold sweat shows on his face. For a 
               moment he stays like this, exhausted, then his eyes open 
               slowly and look down at his left shoulder. His good hand 
               flips the overcoat back, he unbuttons his jacket, loosens 
               his tie and shirt. This was quite an effort. He rests for a 
               second, breathing hard. With the help of his good hand he 
               edges his left elbow up on the arm-rest of the chair, supports 
               it there and then pulls his jacket wide. A heavy patch of 
               dark blood shows on his shirt. He pushes his chair along the 
               floor towards the water cooler, using his feet and his right 
               hand against the desk, takes out a handkerchief, presses 
               with his hand against the spring faucet of the cooler, soaks 
               the handkerchief in water and tucks it, dripping wet, against 
               the wound inside his shirt. Next, he gets a handful of water 
               and splashes it on his face. The water runs down his chin 
               and drips. He breathes heavily, with closed eyes. He fingers 
               a pack of cigarettes in his shirt pocket, pulls it out, looks 
               at it. There is blood on it. He wheels himself back to the 
               desk and dumps the loose cigarettes out of the packet. Some 
               are blood-stained, a few are clean. He takes one, puts it 
               between his lips, gropes around for a match, lights cigarette. 
               He takes a deep drag and lets smoke out through his nose.

               He pulls himself toward dictaphone again, still in the swivel 
               chair, reaches it, lifts the horn off the bracket and the 
               dictaphone makes a low buzzing sound. He presses the button 
               switch on the horn. The sound stops, the record revolves on 
               the cylinder. He begins to speak:

                                     NEFF
                         Office memorandum, Walter Neff to 
                         Barton Keyes, Claims Manager. Los 
                         Angeles, July 16th, 1938. Dear Keyes: 
                         I suppose you'll call this a 
                         confession when you hear it. I don't 
                         like the word confession. I just 
                         want to set you right about one thing 
                         you couldn't see, because it was 
                         smack up against your nose. You think 
                         you're such a hot potato as a claims 
                         manager, such a wolf on a phoney 
                         claim. Well, maybe you are, Keyes, 
                         but let's take a look at this 
                         Dietrichson claim, Accident and Double 
                         Indemnity. You were pretty good in 
                         there for a while, all right. You 
                         said it wasn't an accident. Check. 
                         You said it wasn't suicide. Check. 
                         You said it was murder. Check and 
                         double check. You thought you had it 
                         cold, all wrapped up in tissue paper, 
                         with pink ribbons around it. It was 
                         perfect, except that it wasn't, 
                         because you made a mistake, just one 
                         tiny little mistake. When it came to 
                         picking the killer, you picked the 
                         wrong guy, if you know what I mean. 
                         Want to know who killed Dietrichson? 
                         Hold tight to that cheap cigar of 
                         yours, Keyes. I killed Dietrichson. 
                         Me, Walter Neff, insurance agent, 35 
                         years old, unmarried, no visible 
                         scars --
                              (He glances down at 
                              his wounded shoulder)
                         Until a little while ago, that is. 
                         Yes, I killed him. I killed him for 
                         money -- and a woman -- and I didn't 
                         get the money and I didn't get the 
                         woman. Pretty, isn't it?

               He interrupts the dictation, lays down the horn on the desk. 
               He takes his lighted cigarette from the ash tray, puffs it 
               two or three times, and kills it. He picks up the horn again.

                              (His voice is now 
                              quiet and contained)
                          It began last May. About the end of 
                         May, it was. I had to run out to 
                         Glendale to deliver a policy on some 
                         dairy trucks. On the way back I 
                         remembered this auto renewal on Los 
                         Feliz. So I decided to run over there. 
                         It was one of those Calif. Spanish 
                         houses everyone was nuts about 10 or 
                         15 years ago. This one must have 
                         cost somebody about 30,000 bucks -- 
                         that is, if he ever finished paying 
                         for it.

               As he goes on speaking, SLOW DISSOLVE TO:

               A-12 DIETRICHSON HOME - LOS FELIZ DISTRICT

               Palm trees line the street, middle-class houses, mostly in 
               Spanish style. Some kids throwing a baseball back and forth 
               across a couple of front lawns. An ice cream wagon dawdles 
               along the block. Neff's coupe meets and passes the ice cream 
               wagon and stops before one of the Spanish houses. Neff gets 
               out. He carries a briefcase, his hat is a little on the back 
               of his head. His movements are easy and full of ginger. He 
               inspects the house, checks the number, goes up on the front 
               porch and rings the bell.

                                     NEFF'S VOICE
                         It was mid-afternoon, and it's funny, 
                         I can still remember the smell of 
                         honeysuckle all along that block. I 
                         felt like a million. There was no 
                         way in all this world I could have 
                         known that murder sometimes can smell 
                         like honeysuckle...

               A-13 EXT. DIETRICHSON HOME - ENTRANCE DOOR

               Neff rings the bell again and waits. The door opens. A maid, 
               about forty-five, rather slatternly, opens the door.

                                     NEFF
                         Mr. Dietrichson in?

                                     MAID
                         Who wants to see him?

                                     NEFF
                         The name is Neff. Walter Neff.

                                     MAID
                         If you're selling something --

                                     NEFF
                         Look, it's Mr. Dietrichson I'd like 
                         to talk to, and it's not magazine 
                         subscriptions.

               He pushes past her into the house.

               A-14 HALLWAY - DIETRICHSON HOME

               Spanish craperoo in style, as is the house throughout. A 
               wrought-iron staircase curves down from the second floor. A 
               fringed Mexican shawl hangs down over the landing. A large 
               tapestry hangs on the wall. Downstairs, the dining room to 
               one side, living room on the other side visible through a 
               wide archway. All of this, architecture, furniture, 
               decorations, etc., is genuine early Leo Carrillo period. 
               Neff has edged his way in past maid who still holds the door 
               open.

                                     MAID
                         Listen, Mr. Dietrichson's not in.

                                     NEFF
                         How soon do you expect him?

                                     MAID
                         He'll be home when he gets here, if 
                         that's any help to you.

               At this point a voice comes from the top of the stairs.

                                     VOICE
                         What is it, Nettie? Who is it?

               Neff looks up.

               A-15 UPPER LANDING OF STAIRCASE - (FROM BELOW)

               Phyllis Dietrichson stands looking down. She is in her early 
               thirties. She holds a large bath-towel around her very 
               appetizing torso, down to about two inches above her knees. 
               She wears no stockings, no nothing. On her feet a pair of 
               high-heeled bedroom slippers with pom-poms. On her left ankle 
               a gold anklet.

                                     MAID'S VOICE
                         It's for Mr. Dietrichson.

                                     PHYLLIS
                              (Looking down at Neff)
                         I'm Mrs. Dietrichson. What is it?

               A-16 SHOOTING DOWN FROM UPPER LANDING

               Neff looks up, takes his hat off.

                                     NEFF
                         How do you do, Mrs. Dietrichson. I'm 
                         Walter Neff, Pacific All-Risk.

                         Pacific All-Risk Insurance Company. 
                         It's about some renewals on the 
                         automobiles, Mrs. Dietrichson. I've 
                         been trying to contact your husband 
                         for the past two weeks. He's never 
                         at his office.

               A-19 PHYLLIS

                                     PHYLLIS
                         Is there anything I can do?

               A-20 NEFF

                                     NEFF
                         The insurance ran out on the 
                         fifteenth. I'd hate to think of your 
                         getting a smashed fender or something 
                         while you're not fully covered.

               A-21 PHYLLIS

               She glances over her towel costume.

                                     PHYLLIS
                              (With a little smile)
                         Perhaps I know what you mean, Mr. 
                         Neff. I've just been taking a sun 
                         bath.

               A-22 NEFF

                                     NEFF
                         No pigeons around, I hope... About 
                         those policies, Mrs. Dietrichson -- 
                         I hate to take up your time --

               A-23 PHYLLIS

                                     PHYLLIS
                         That's all right. If you can wait 
                         till I put something on, I'll be 
                         right down. Nettie, show Mr. Neff 
                         into the living room.

               She turns away as gracefully as one can with a towel for a 
               wrapper.]

               A-24 ENTRANCE HALL

               Neff watches Phyllis out of sight. He speaks to the maid 
               while still looking up.

                                     NEFF
                         Where would the living room be?

                                     MAID
                         In there, but they keep the liquor 
                         locked up.

                                     NEFF
                         That's okay. I always carry my own 
                         keys.

               He goes through the archway. Maid goes off the other way.

               A-25 LIVING ROOM

               Neff comes into the room and throws his briefcase on the 
               plush davenport and tosses his hat on top of it. He looks 
               around the room, then moves over to a baby grand piano with 
               a sleazy Spanish shawl dangling down one side and two cabinet 
               photographs standing in a staggered position on top. Neff 
               glances them over: Mr. Dietrichson, age about fifty-one, a 
               big, blocky man with glasses and a Rotarian look about him; 
               Lola Dietrichson, age nineteen, wearing a filmy party dress 
               and a yearning look in her pretty eyes. Neff walks away from 
               the piano and takes a few steps back and forth across the 
               rug. His eyes fall on a wrinkled corner. He carefully 
               straightens it out with his foot. His back is to the archway 
               as he hears high heels clicking on the staircase. He turns 
               and looks through the arch.

                                     NEFF'S VOICE
                         The living room was still stuffy 
                         from last night's cigars. The windows 
                         were closed and the sunshine coming 
                         in through the Venetian blinds showed 
                         up the dust in the air. The furniture 
                         was kind of corny and old-fashioned, 
                         but it had a comfortable look, as if 
                         people really sat in it. On the piano, 
                         in couple of fancy frames, were Mr. 
                         Dietrichson and Lola, his daughter 
                         by his first wife They had a bowl of 
                         those little red goldfish on the 
                         table behind the davenport, but, to 
                         tell you the truth, Keyes, I wasn't 
                         a whole lot interested in goldfish 
                         right then, nor in auto renewals, 
                         nor in Mr. Dietrichson and his 
                         daughter Lola. I was thinking about 
                         that dame upstairs, and the way she 
                         had looked at me, and I wanted to 
                         see her again, close, without that 
                         silly staircase between us.

               A-26 STAIRCASE (FROM NEFF'S POINT OF VIEW)

               Phyllis Dietrichson is coming downstairs. First we see her 
               feet, with pom-pom slippers and the gold anklet on her left 
               ankle. CAMERA PULLS BACK SLOWLY as she descends, until we 
               see all of her. She is wearing a pale blue summer dress.

                                     PHYLLIS' VOICE
                         I wasn't long, was I?

                                     NEFF'S VOICE
                         Not at all, Mrs. Dietrichson.

               CAMERA PULLS BACK WITH HER INTO THE LIVING ROOM.

                                     PHYLLIS
                         I hope I've got my face on straight.

                                     NEFF
                         It's perfect for my money.

                                     PHYLLIS
                              (Crossing to the mirror 
                              over the fireplace)
                         Won't you sit down, Mr. -- Neff is 
                         the name, isn't it?

                                     NEFF
                         With two f's, like in Philadelphia. 
                         If you know the story.

                                     PHYLLIS
                         What story?

                                     NEFF
                         The Philadelphia story. What are we 
                         talking about?

                                     PHYLLIS
                              (She works with her 
                              lipstick)
                         About the insurance. My husband never 
                         tells me anything.

                                     NEFF
                         It's on your two cars, the La Salle 
                         and the Plymouth.

               He crosses to the davenport to get the policies from his 
               briefcase. She turns away from the mirror and sits in a big 
               chair with her legs drawn up sideways, the anklet now clearly 
               visible.

                                     NEFF
                         We've been handling this insurance 
                         for three years for Mr. Dietrichson...
                              (His eyes have caught 
                              the anklet)
                         That's a honey of an anklet you're 
                         wearing, Mrs. Dietrichson.

               Phyllis smiles faintly and covers the anklet with her dress.

                                     NEFF
                         We'd hate to see the policies lapse. 
                         Of course, we give him thirty days. 
                         That's all we're allowed to give.

                                     PHYLLIS
                         I guess he's been too busy down at 
                         Long Beach in the oil fields.

                                     NEFF
                         Could I catch him home some evening 
                         for a few minutes?

                                     PHYLLIS
                         I suppose so. But he's never home 
                         much before eight.

                                     NEFF
                         That would be fine with me.

                                     PHYLLIS
                         You're not connected with the 
                         Automobile Club, are you?

                                     NEFF
                         No, the All-Risk, Mrs. Dietrichson. 
                         Why?

                                     PHYLLIS
                         Somebody from the Automobile Club 
                         has been trying to get him. Do they 
                         have a better rate?

                                     NEFF
                         If your husband's a member.

                                     PHYLLIS
                         No, he isn't.

               Phyllis rises and walks up and down, paying less and less 
               attention.

                                     NEFF
                         Well, he'd have to join the club and 
                         pay a membership fee to start with. 
                         The Automobile Club is fine. I never 
                         knock the other fellow's merchandise, 
                         Mrs. Dietrichson, but I can do just 
                         as well for you. I have a very 
                         attractive policy here. It wouldn't 
                         take me two minutes to put it in 
                         front of your husband.

               He consults the policies he is holding.

                                     NEFF
                         For instance, we're writing a new 
                         kind of fifty percent retention 
                         feature in the collision coverage.

               Phyllis stops in her walk.

                                     PHYLLIS
                         You're a smart insurance man, aren't 
                         you, Mr. Neff?

                                     NEFF
                         I've had eleven years of it.

                                     PHYLLIS
                         Doing pretty well?

                                     NEFF
                         It's a living.

                                     PHYLLIS
                         You handle just automobile insurance, 
                         or all kinds?

               She sits down again, in the same position as before.

                                     NEFF
                         All kinds. Fire, earthquake, theft, 
                         public liability, group insurance, 
                         industrial stuff and so on right 
                         down the line.

                                     PHYLLIS
                         Accident insurance?

                                     NEFF
                         Accident insurance? Sure, Mrs. 
                         Dietrichson.

               His eyes fall on the anklet again.

                                     NEFF
                         I wish you'd tell me what's engraved 
                         on that anklet.

                                     PHYLLIS
                         Just my name.

                                     NEFF
                         As for instance?

                                     PHYLLIS
                         Phyllis.

                                     NEFF
                         Phyllis. I think I like that.

                                     PHYLLIS
                         But you're not sure?

                                     NEFF
                         I'd have to drive it around the block 
                         a couple of times.

                                     PHYLLIS
                              (Standing up again)
                         Mr. Neff, why don't you drop by 
                         tomorrow evening about eight-thirty. 
                         He'll be in then.

                                     NEFF
                         Who?

                                     PHYLLIS
                         My husband. You were anxious to talk 
                         to him weren't you?

                                     NEFF
                         Sure, only I'm getting over it a 
                         little. If you know what I mean.

                                     PHYLLIS
                         There's a speed limit in this state, 
                         Mr. Neff. Forty-five miles an hour.

                                     NEFF
                         How fast was I going, officer?

                                     PHYLLIS
                         I'd say about ninety.

                                     NEFF
                         Suppose you get down off your 
                         motorcycle and give me a ticket.

                                     PHYLLIS
                         Suppose I let you off with a warning 
                         this time.

                                     NEFF
                         Suppose it doesn't take.

                                     PHYLLIS
                         Suppose I have to whack you over the 
                         knuckles.

                                     NEFF
                         Suppose I bust out crying and put my 
                         head on your shoulder.

                                     PHYLLIS
                         Suppose you try putting it on my 
                         husband's shoulder.

                                     NEFF
                         That tears it.

               Neff takes his hat and briefcase.

                                     NEFF
                         Eight-thirty tomorrow evening then, 
                         Mrs. Dietrichson.

                                     PHYLLIS
                         That's what I suggested.

               They both move toward the archway.

               A-27 HALLWAY - PHYLLIS AND NEFF GOING TOWARDS THE ENTRANCE 
               DOOR

                                     NEFF
                         Will you be here, too?

                                     PHYLLIS
                         I guess so. I usually am.

                                     NEFF
                         Same chair, same perfume, same anklet?

                                     PHYLLIS
                              (Opening the door)
                          I wonder if I know what you mean.

                                     NEFF
                         I wonder if you wonder.

               He walks out.

               A-28 EXT. DIETRICHSON HOME - (DAY)

               Shooting past Neff's parked car towards the entrance door, 
               which is just closing. Neff comes towards the car, swinging 
               his briefcase. He opens the car door and looks back with a 
               confident smile.

                                     NEFF'S VOICE
                              (Over scene)
                         She liked me. I could feel that. The 
                         way you feel when the cards are...

               A-29 ENTRANCE DOOR, DIETRICHSON HOME

               In the upper panel the peep window opens and Phyllis looks 
               out after Neff.

                                     NEFF'S VOICE
                         falling right for you, with a nice 
                         little pile of blue and yellow chips 
                         in the middle of the table. Only 
                         what I didn't know then was that I 
                         wasn't playing her. She was playing 
                         me -- with a deck of marked cards -- 
                         and the stakes weren't any blue and 
                         yellow chips. They were dynamite. I 
                         went back to the office that afternoon 
                         to see if I had any mail. It was the 
                         same afternoon you had that Sam 
                         Gorlopis on the carpet, that truck 
                         driver from Inglewood, remember, 
                         Keyes?

               A-30 NEFF

               He sits in his car, presses the starter button, looking back 
               towards the little window in the entrance door.

               A-31 ENTRANCE DOOR

               The peep window is quickly closed from inside.

               A-32 STREET

               Neff makes a U-turn and drives back down the block.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               A-33 LONG SHOT - INSURANCE OFFICE - TWELFTH FLOOR - (DAY) - 
               CAMERA HIGH

               Activity on the eleventh floor below. Typewriters working, 
               adding machines, filing clerks, secretaries, and so forth. 
               Neff, wearing his hat and carrying his briefcase, enters 
               from the vestibule. He walks towards his office. He passes a 
               few salesmen, etc. There is an exchange of greetings. Just 
               as he reaches his office a secretary comes out. She stops.

                                     SECRETARY
                         Oh, Mr. Neff, Mr. Keyes wants to see 
                         you. He's been yelling for you all 
                         afternoon.

                                     NEFF
                         Is he sore, or just frothing at the 
                         mouth a little? Here, park these for 
                         me, sweetheart.

               He hands her his hat and briefcase and continues right on, 
               CAMERA WITH HIM, to a door lettered:

                              BARTON KEYES - CLAIMS MANAGER

               Keyes' voice is heard inside, plenty loud. Neff grins as he 
               opens the door and goes in.

               A-34 KEYES: OFFICE - (DAY)

               A minor executive office, not too tidy: large desk across 
               one corner, good carpet, several chairs, filing cabinet 
               against one wall, a dictaphone on the corner of the desk.

               Keyes is sitting behind the desk with his coat off but his 
               hat on. A cigar is clamped in his mouth, ashes falling like 
               snow down his vest, a gold chair and elk's tooth across it. 
               On the other side of the desk sits Sam Gorlopis. He is a 
               big, dumb bruiser, six feet three inches tall -- a dirty 
               work shirt and corduroy pants, rough, untidy hair, broad 
               face, small piggish eyes. He holds a sweat-soaked hat on his 
               knee with a hairy hand. He is chewing gum rapidly. As Neff 
               opens the door, Keyes is giving it to Gorlopis.

                                     KEYES
                         Wise up, Gorlopis. You're not kidding 
                         anybody with that line of bull. You're 
                         in a jam and you know it.

                                     GORLOPIS
                         Sez you. All I want is my money.

                                     KEYES
                         Sez you. All you're gonna get is the 
                         cops.

               He sees Neff standing inside the door.

                                     KEYES
                         Come in, Walter. This is Sam Gorlopis 
                         from Inglewood.

                                     NEFF
                         Sure, I know Mr. Gorlopis. Wrote a 
                         policy on his truck. How are you, 
                         Mr. Gorlopis?

                                     GORLOPIS
                         I ain't so good. My truck burned 
                         down.

               He looks cautiously sideways at Keyes.

                                     KEYES
                         Yeah, he just planted his big foot 
                         on the starter and the whole thing 
                         blazed up in his face.

                                     GORLOPIS
                         Yes, sir.

                                     KEYES
                         And didn't even singe his eyebrows.

                                     GORLOPIS
                         No sir. Look, mister. I got twenty-
                         six hundred bucks tied up in that 
                         truck. I'm insured with this company 
                         and I want my money.

                                     KEYES
                         You got a wife, Gorlopis?

                                     GORLOPIS
                         Sure I got a wife.

                                     KEYES
                         You got kids?

                                     GORLOPIS
                         Two kids.

                                     KEYES
                         What you got for dinner tonight?

                                     GORLOPIS
                         We got meat loaf.

                                     KEYES
                         How do you make your meat loaf, 
                         Gorlopis?

                                     GORLOPIS
                         Veal and pork and bread and garlic. 
                         Greek style.

                                     KEYES
                         How much garlic?

                                     GORLOPIS
                         Lotsa garlic, Mr. Keyes.

                                     KEYES
                         Okay, Gorlopis. Now listen here. 
                         Let's say you just came up here to 
                         tell me how to make meat loaf. That's 
                         all, understand? Because if you came 
                         up here to claim on that truck, I'd 
                         have to turn you over to the law, 
                         Gorlopis, and they'd put you in jail. 
                         No wife. No kids --

                                     GORLOPIS
                         What for?

                                     KEYES
                              (Yelling)
                         And no meat loaf, Gorlopis!

                                     GORLOPIS
                         I didn't do nothin'.

                                     KEYES
                         No? Look, Gorlopis. Every month 
                         hundreds of claims come to this desk. 
                         Some of them are phonies, and I know 
                         which ones. How do I know, Gorlopis?
                              (He speaks as if to a 
                              child)
                         Because my little man tells me.

                                     GORLOPIS
                         What little man?

                                     KEYES
                         The little man in here.

               He pounds the pit of his stomach.

                                     KEYES
                         Every time one of those phonies comes 
                         along he ties knots in my stomach. 
                         And yours was one of them, Gorlopis. 
                         That's how I knew your claim was 
                         crooked. So what did I do? I sent a 
                         tow car out to your garage this 
                         afternoon and they jacked up that 
                         burned-out truck of yours. And what 
                         did they find, Gorlopis? They found 
                         what was left of a pile of shavings.

                                     GORLOPIS
                         What shavings?

                                     KEYES
                         The ones you soaked with kerosene 
                         and dropped a match on.

               Gorlopis cringes under the impact.

                                     GORLOPIS
                         Look, Mr. Keyes, I'm just a poor 
                         guy. Maybe I made a mistake.

                                     KEYES
                         That's one way of putting it.

                                     GORLOPIS
                         I ain't feelin' so good, Mr. Keyes.

                                     KEYES
                         Sign this and you'll feel fine.

               He puts a blank form in front of him and points.

                                     KEYES
                         Right there. It's a waiver on your 
                         claim.

               Gorlopis hesitates, then signs laboriously.

                                     KEYES
                         Now you're an honest man again.

                                     GORLOPIS
                         But I ain't got no more truck.

                                     KEYES
                         Goodbye, Gorlopis.

                                     GORLOPIS
                              (Still bewildered)
                         Goodbye, Mr. Keyes.

               He stands up and goes slowly to the door and turns there.

                                     GORLOPIS
                         Twenty-six hundred bucks. That's a 
                         lot of dough where I live.

                                     KEYES
                         What's the matter, Gorlopis? Don't 
                         you know how to open the door? Just 
                         put your hand on the knob, turn it 
                         to the right, pull it toward you --

                                     GORLOPIS
                              (Doing just as Keyes 
                              says)
                         Like this, Mr. Keyes?

                                     KEYES
                         That's the boy. Now the same thing 
                         from the outside.

                                     GORLOPIS
                              (Stupefied)
                         Thank you, Mr. Keyes.

               He goes out, closing the door after him. Keyes takes his 
               cigar stub from his mouth and turns it slowly in the flame 
               of a lighted match. He turns to Neff.

                                     KEYES
                         What kind of an outfit is this anyway? 
                         Are we an insurance company, or a 
                         bunch of dimwitted amateurs, writing 
                         a policy on a mugg like that?

                                     NEFF
                         Wait a minute, Keyes. I don't rate 
                         this beef. I clipped a note to that 
                         Gorlopis application to have him 
                         thoroughly investigated before we 
                         accepted the risk.

                                     KEYES
                         I know you did, Walter. I'm not 
                         beefing at you. It's the company. 
                         The way they do things. The way they 
                         don't do things. The way they'll 
                         write anything just to get it down 
                         on the sales sheet. And I'm the guy 
                         that has to sit here up to my neck 
                         in phony claims so they won't throw 
                         more money out of the window than 
                         they take in at the door.

                                     NEFF
                              (Grinning)
                         Okay, turn the record over and let's 
                         hear the other side.

                                     KEYES
                         I get darn sick of picking up after 
                         a gang of fast-talking salesmen dumb 
                         enough to sell life insurance to a 
                         guy that sleeps in the same bed with 
                         four rattlesnakes. I've had twenty-
                         six years of that, Walter, and I --

                                     NEFF
                         And you loved every minute of it, 
                         Keyes. You love it, only you worry 
                         about it too much, you and your little 
                         man. You're so darn conscientious 
                         you're driving yourself crazy. You 
                         wouldn't even say today is Tuesday 
                         without you looked at the calendar, 
                         and then you would check if it was 
                         this year's or last year's calendar, 
                         and then you would find out what 
                         company printed the calendar, then 
                         find out if their calendar checks 
                         with the World Almanac's calendar.

                                     KEYES
                         That's enough from you, Walter. Get 
                         out of here before I throw my desk 
                         at you.

                                     NEFF
                         I love you, too.

               He walks out, still grinning.

               A-35 EXT. OFFICES - TWELFTH FLOOR

               Neff comes out of Keys' office and walks back along the 
               balcony. Activity of secretaries going in and out of doors, 
               etc. Neff enters his own office.

                                     NEFF'S VOICE
                              (Over scene)
                         I really did, too, you old crab, 
                         always yelling your fat head off, 
                         always sore at everyone. But behind 
                         the cigar ashes on your vest I kind 
                         of knew you had a heart as big as a 
                         house... Back in my office there was 
                         a phone message from Mrs. Dietrichson 
                         about the renewals. She didn't want 
                         me to come tomorrow evening. She 
                         wanted me to come Thursday afternoon 
                         at three-thirty instead. I had a lot 
                         of stuff lined up for that Thursday 
                         afternoon, including a trip down to 
                         Santa Monica to see a couple of live 
                         prospects about some group insurance. 
                         But I kept thinking about Phyllis 
                         Dietrichson and the way that anklet 
                         of hers cut into her leg.

               A-36 INT. NEFF'S OFFICE

               Anderson, a salesman, sits at one of the desks, filling out 
               a report. Neff enters, goes to his own desk. He looks down 
               at some mail. On top there is a typewritten note. He reads 
               it, sits down and leafs through his desk calendar.

               A-37 INSERT - CLOSEUP - CALENDAR PAGE

               Showing date: THURSDAY 23 May and five or six appointments 
               penciled in tightly on the page.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               A-38 DIETRICHSON HOME - ENTRANCE HALL - (DAY)

               THE CAMERA PANS with Phyllis Dietrichson's feet and ankles 
               as she comes down the stairs, her high heels clicking on the 
               tiles. The anklet glistens on her leg as she moves. THE CAMERA 
               PANS ON. Phyllis has reached the entrance hall, and as she 
               walks toward the front door her whole body becomes visible. 
               She wears a gay print dress with a wide sash over her hips. 
               She opens the door. Outside is Neff, wearing a sport coat, 
               flannel slacks. He takes his hat off.

                                     PHYLLIS
                         Hello, Mr. Neff.

               He stands there with a little smile.

                                     PHYLLIS
                         Aren't you coming in?

                                     NEFF
                         I'm considering it.

               He comes in.

                                     PHYLLIS
                         I hope you didn't mind my changing 
                         the appointment. Last night wasn't 
                         so convenient.

                                     NEFF
                         That's okay. I was working on my 
                         stamp collection.

               She leads him toward living room.

               A-39 DIETRICHSON LIVING ROOM

               Phyllis and Neff come through archway. She heads toward a 
               low tea table which stands in front of the davenport, with 
               tall glasses, ice cubes, lemon, a pot of tea, etc.

                                     PHYLLIS
                         I was just fixing some iced tea. 
                         Would you like a glass?

                                     NEFF
                         Unless you have a bottle of beer 
                         that's not working.

                                     PHYLLIS
                         There might be some. I never know 
                         what's in the ice box.
                              (Calls)
                         Nettie!... 

               She pours herself a glass of tea.

                                     PHYLLIS
                         About those renewals, Mr. Neff. I 
                         talked to my husband about it.

                                     NEFF
                         You did?

                                     PHYLLIS
                         Yes. He'll renew with you he told 
                         me. In fact, I thought he'd be here 
                         this afternoon.

                                     NEFF
                         But he's not?

                                     PHYLLIS
                         No.

                                     NEFF
                         That's terrible.

                                     PHYLLIS
                              (Calls again, 
                              impatiently)
                         Nettie!... Nettie!... Oh, I forgot, 
                         it's the maid's day off.

                                     NEFF
                         Don't bother, Mrs. Dietrichson. I'd 
                         like some iced tea very much.

                                     PHYLLIS
                         Lemon? Sugar?

                                     NEFF
                         Fix it your way.

               She fixes him a glass of tea while he is looking around. He 
               slowly sits down.

                                     NEFF
                         Seeing it's the maid's day off maybe 
                         there's something I can do for you.

               She hands him the tea.

                                     NEFF
                         Like running the vacuum cleaner.

                                     PHYLLIS
                         Fresh.

                                     NEFF
                         I used to peddle vacuum cleaners. 
                         Not much money but you learn a lot 
                         about life.

                                     PHYLLIS
                         I didn't think you'd learned it from 
                         a correspondence course.

                                     NEFF
                         Where did you pick up this tea 
                         drinking? You're not English, are 
                         you?

                                     PHYLLIS
                         No. Californian. Born right here in 
                         Los Angeles.

                                     NEFF
                         They say native Californians all 
                         come from Iowa.

                                     PHYLLIS
                         I wanted to ask you something, Mr. 
                         Neff.

                                     NEFF
                         Make it Walter.

                                     PHYLLIS
                         Walter.

                                     NEFF
                         Right.

                                     PHYLLIS
                         Tell me, Walter, on this insurance -- 
                         how much commission do you make?

                                     NEFF
                         Twenty percent. Why?

                                     PHYLLIS
                         I thought maybe I could throw a little 
                         more business your way.

                                     NEFF
                         I can always use it.

                         I was thinking about my husband. I 
                         worry a lot about him, down in those 
                         oil fields. It's very dangerous.

                                     NEFF
                         Not for an executive, is it?

                                     PHYLLIS
                         He doesn't just sit behind a desk. 
                         He's right down there with the 
                         drilling crews. It's got me worried 
                         sick.

                                     NEFF
                         You mean a crown block might fall on 
                         him some rainy night?

                                     PHYLLIS
                         Please don't talk like that.

                                     NEFF
                         But that's the idea.

                                     PHYLLIS
                         The other day a casing line snapped 
                         and caught the foreman. He's in the 
                         hospital with a broken back.

                                     NEFF
                         Bad.

                                     PHYLLIS
                         It's got me jittery just thinking 
                         about it. Suppose something like 
                         that happened to my husband?

                                     NEFF
                         It could.

                                     PHYLLIS
                         Don't you think he ought to have 
                         accident insurance?

                                     NEFF
                         Uh huh.

                                     PHYLLIS
                         What kind of insurance could he have?

                                     NEFF
                         Enough to cover doctors' and hospital 
                         bills. Say a hundred and twenty-five 
                         a week cash benefit. And he'd rate 
                         around fifty thousand capital sum.

                                     PHYLLIS
                         Capital sum? What's that?

                                     NEFF
                         That's if he got killed. Maybe I 
                         shouldn't have said that.

                                     PHYLLIS
                         I suppose you have to think of 
                         everything in your business.

                                     NEFF
                         Mr. Dietrichson would understand. 
                         I'm sure I could sell him on the 
                         idea of some accident protection. 
                         Why don't I talk to him about it.

                                     PHYLLIS
                         You could try. But he's pretty tough 
                         going.

                                     NEFF
                         They're all tough at first.

                                     PHYLLIS
                         He's got a lot on his mind. He doesn't 
                         want to listen to anything except 
                         maybe a baseball game on the radio. 
                         Sometimes we sit all evening without 
                         saying a word to each other.

                                     NEFF
                         Sounds pretty dull.

               Phyllis shrugs.

                                     PHYLLIS
                         So I just sit and knit.

                                     NEFF
                         Is that what you married him for?

                                     PHYLLIS
                         Maybe I like the way his thumbs hold 
                         up the wool.

                                     NEFF
                         Anytime his thumbs get tired --

                                     PHYLLIS
                         I want to ask you something, Mr. 
                         Neff. Could I get an accident policy 
                         for him -- without bothering him at 
                         all?

                                     NEFF
                         How's that again.

                                     PHYLLIS
                         That would make it easier for you, 
                         too. You wouldn't even have to talk 
                         to him. I have a little allowance of 
                         my own. I could pay for it and he 
                         needn't know anything about it.

                                     NEFF
                         Wait a minute. Why shouldn't he know?

                                     PHYLLIS
                         Because I know he doesn't want 
                         accident insurance. He's superstitious 
                         about it.

                                     NEFF
                         A lot of people are. Funny, isn't 
                         it?

                                     PHYLLIS
                         If there was a way to get it like 
                         that, all the worry would be over. 
                         You see what I mean, Walter?

                                     NEFF
                         Sure. I've got good eyesight. You 
                         want him to have the policy without 
                         him knowing it. And that means without 
                         the insurance company knowing that 
                         he doesn't know. That's the set-up, 
                         isn't it?

                                     PHYLLIS
                         Is there anything wrong with it?

                                     NEFF
                         I think it's lovely. And then, some 
                         dark wet night, if that crown block 
                         fell on him --

                                     PHYLLIS
                         What crown block?

                                     NEFF
                         Only sometimes they have to have a 
                         little help. They can't quite make 
                         it on their own.

                                     PHYLLIS
                         I don't know what you're talking 
                         about.

                                     NEFF
                         Of course, it doesn't have to be a 
                         crown block. It can be a car backing 
                         over him, or he can fall out of an 
                         upstairs window. Any little thing 
                         like that, as long as it's a morgue 
                         job.

                                     PHYLLIS
                         Are you crazy?

                                     NEFF
                         Not that crazy. Goodbye, Mrs. 
                         Dietrichson.

               He picks up his hat.

                                     PHYLLIS
                         What's the matter?

                                     NEFF
                         Look, baby, you can't get away with 
                         it.

                                     PHYLLIS
                         Get away with what?

                                     NEFF
                         You want to knock him off, don't 
                         you, baby.

                                     PHYLLIS
                         That's a horrible thing to say!

                                     NEFF
                         Who'd you think I was, anyway? A guy 
                         that walks into a good-looking dame's 
                         front parlor and says "Good afternoon, 
                         I sell accident insurance on husbands. 
                         You got one that's been around too 
                         long? Somebody you'd like to turn 
                         into a little hard cash? Just give 
                         me a smile and I'll help you collect." 
                         Boy, what a dope I must look to you!

                                     PHYLLIS
                         I think you're rotten.

                                     NEFF
                         I think you're swell. So long as I'm 
                         not your husband.

                                     PHYLLIS
                         Get out of here.

                                     NEFF
                         You bet I will. You bet I'll get out 
                         of here, baby. But quick.

               He goes out. She looks after him.

               A-40 EXT. DIETRICHSON HOME - (DAY)

               Neff bangs the front door shut, walks quickly to his car and 
               drives away.

                              (Over scene)
                         So I let her have it, straight between 
                         the eyes. She didn't fool me for a 
                         minute, not this time. I knew I had 
                         hold of a redhot poker and the time 
                         to drop it was before it burned my 
                         hand off. I stopped at a drive-in 
                         for a bottle of beer, the one I had 
                         wanted all along, only I wanted it 
                         worse now, to get rid of the sour 
                         taste of her iced tea, and everything 
                         that went with it. I didn't want to 
                         go back to the office, so I dropped 
                         by a bowling alley at Third and 
                         Western and rolled a few lines to 
                         get my mind thinking about something 
                         else for a while.

               Neff bowling. He rolls the ball with an effort at

               A-43 EXT. APARTMENT HOUSE - (DUSK)

               It is late afternoon. The apartment house is called the LOS 
               OLIVOS APARTMENTS. It is a six-story building in the Normandie-
               Wilshire district, with a basement garage. THE CAMERA PANS 
               UP the front of the building to the top floor windows, as a 
               little rain starts to fall.

                         I didn't feel like eating dinner 
                         when I left, and I didn't feel like 
                         a show, so I drove home, put the car 
                         away and went up to my apartment.

               A-44 INT. NEFF'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - (DUSK)

               It is a double apartment of conventional design, with kitchen, 
               dinette, and bathroom, squarecut overstuffed borax furniture. 
               Gas logs are lit in the imitation fireplace. Neff stands by 
               the window with his coat off and his tie loose. Raindrops 
               strike against the glass. He turns away impatiently, paces 
               up and down past a caddy bag with golf clubs in it, pulls 
               one out at random, makes a couple of short swings, throws 
               the club on the couch, paces again.

                         It had begun to rain outside and I

                         turn on the light. That didn't help 
                         me either. I was all twisted up 
                         inside, and I was still holding on 
                         to that red-hot poker. And right 
                         then it came over me that I hadn't 
                         walked out on anything at all, that 
                         the hook was too strong, that this 
                         wasn't the end between her and me. 
                         It was only the beginning.

               The doorbell rings.

                                     NEFF'S VOICE
                              (Continuing)
                         So at eight o'clock the bell would 
                         ring and I would know who it was 
                         without even having to think, as if 
                         it was the most natural thing in the 
                         world.

               Neff goes to the door and opens it.

                                     PHYLLIS
                         Hello.

               Neff just looks at her.

                                     PHYLLIS
                         You forgot your hat this afternoon.

               She has nothing in her hands but her bag.

                                     NEFF
                         Did I?

               He looks down at her hands.

                                     PHYLLIS
                         Don't you want me to bring it in?

                                     NEFF
                         Sure. Put it on the chair.

               She comes in. He closes the door.

                                     NEFF
                         How did you know where I live?

                                     PHYLLIS
                         It's in the phone book.

               Neff switches on the standing lamp.

                                     PHYLLIS
                         It's raining.

                                     NEFF
                         So it is. Peel off your coat and sit 
                         down.

               She starts to take off her coat.

                                     NEFF
                         Your husband out?

                                     PHYLLIS
                         Long Beach. They're spudding in a 
                         new well. He phoned he'd be late. 
                         About nine-thirty.

               He takes her coat and lays it across the back of a chair.

                                     PHYLLIS
                         It's about time you said you're glad 
                         to see me.

                                     NEFF
                         I knew you wouldn't leave it like 
                         that.

                                     PHYLLIS
                         Like what?

                                     NEFF
                         Like it was this afternoon.

                                     PHYLLIS
                         I must have said something that gave 
                         you a terribly wrong impression. You 
                         must surely see that. You must never 
                         think anything like that about me, 
                         Walter.

                                     NEFF
                         Okay.

                                     PHYLLIS
                         It's not okay. Not if you don't 
                         believe me.

                                     NEFF
                         What do you want me to do?

                                     PHYLLIS
                         I want you to be nice to me. Like 
                         the first time you came to the house.

                                     NEFF
                         It can't be like the first time. 
                         Something has happened.

                                     PHYLLIS
                         I know it has. It's happened to us.

                                     NEFF
                         That's what I mean.

               Phyllis has moved over to the window. She stares out through 
               the wet window-pane.

                                     NEFF
                         What's the matter now?

                                     PHYLLIS
                         I feel as if he was watching me. Not 
                         that he cares about me. Not any more. 
                         But he keeps me on a leash. So tight 
                         I can't breathe. I'm scared.

                                     NEFF
                         What of? He's in Long Beach, isn't 
                         he?

                                     PHYLLIS
                         I oughtn't to have come.

                                     NEFF
                         Maybe you oughtn't.

                                     PHYLLIS
                         You want me to go?

                                     NEFF
                         If you want to.

                                     PHYLLIS
                         Right now?

                                     NEFF
                         Sure. Right now.

               By this time, he has hold of her wrist. He draws her to him 
               slowly and kisses her. Her arms tighten around him. After a 
               moment he pulls his head back, still holding her close.

                                     NEFF
                         How were you going to do it?

                                     PHYLLIS
                         Do what?

                                     NEFF
                         Kill him.

                                     PHYLLIS
                         Walter, for the last time --

               She tries to jerk away but he holds her and kisses her again.

                                     NEFF
                         I'm crazy about you, baby.

                                     PHYLLIS
                         I'm crazy about you, Walter.

                                     NEFF
                         That perfume on your hair. What's 
                         the name of it?

                                     PHYLLIS
                         Something French. I bought it down 
                         at Ensenada.

                                     NEFF
                         We ought to have some of that pink 
                         wine to go with it. The kind that 
                         bubbles. But all I have is bourbon.

                                     PHYLLIS
                         Bourbon is fine, Walter.

               He lets her go and moves toward the dinette.

               A-45 THE DINETTE AND KITCHEN

               It contains a small table and some chairs. A low glass-and-
               china cabinet is built between the dinette and kitchen, 
               leaving a space like a doorway. The kitchen is the usual 
               apartment house kitchen, with stove, ice-box, sink, etc. It 
               is quite small.

               Neff goes to the ice-box and Phyllis drifts in after him.

                                     NEFF
                         Soda?

                                     PHYLLIS
                         Plain water, please.

                                     NEFF
                         Get a couple of glasses, will you.

               He points at the china closet. He has taken a tray of ice 
               cubes from the refrigerator and is holding it under the hot-
               water faucet.

                                     NEFF
                         You know, about six months ago a guy 
                         slipped on the soap in his bathtub 
                         and knocked himself cold and drowned. 
                         Only he had accident insurance. So 
                         they had an autopsy and she didn't 
                         get away with it.

               Phyllis has the glasses now. She hands them to him. He dumps 
               some ice cubes into the glasses.

                                     PHYLLIS
                         Who didn't?

                                     NEFF
                         His wife.

               He reaches for the whiskey bottle on top of the china closet.

                                     NEFF
                         And there was another case where a 
                         guy was found shot and his wife said 
                         he was cleaning a gun and his stomach 
                         got in the way. All she collected 
                         was a three-to-ten stretch in 
                         Tehachapi.

                                     PHYLLIS
                         Perhaps it was worth it to her.

               Neff hands her a glass.

                                     NEFF
                         See if you can carry this as far as 
                         the living room.

               They move back toward the living room.

               A-46 LIVING ROOM

               Phyllis and Neff go toward the davenport. She is sipping her 
               drink and looking around.

                                     PHYLLIS
                         It's nice here, Walter. Who takes 
                         care of it for you?

                                     NEFF
                         A colored woman comes in twice a 
                         week.

                                     PHYLLIS
                         You get your own breakfast?

                                     NEFF
                         Once in a while I squeeze a 
                         grapefruit. The rest I get at the 
                         corner drugstore.

               They sit on the davenport, fairly close together.

                                     PHYLLIS
                         It sounds wonderful. Just strangers 
                         beside you. You don't know them. You 
                         don't hate them. You don't have to 
                         sit across the table and smile at 
                         him and that daughter of his every 
                         morning of your life.

                                     NEFF
                         What daughter? Oh, that little girl 
                         on the piano.

                                     PHYLLIS
                         Yes. Lola. She lives with us. He 
                         thinks a lot more of her than he 
                         does of me.

                                     NEFF
                         Ever think of a divorce?

                                     PHYLLIS
                         He wouldn't give me a divorce.

                                     NEFF
                         I suppose because it would cost him 
                         money.

                                     PHYLLIS
                         He hasn't got any money. Not since 
                         he went into the oil business.

                                     NEFF
                         But he had when you married him?

                                     PHYLLIS
                         Yes, he had. And I wanted a home. 
                         Why not? But that wasn't the only 
                         reason. I was his wife's nurse. She 
                         was sick for a long time. When she 
                         died, he was all broken up. I pitied 
                         him so.

                                     NEFF
                         And now you hate him.

                                     PHYLLIS
                         Yes, Walter. He's so mean to me. 
                         Every-time I buy a dress or a pair 
                         of shoes he yells his head off. He 
                         won't let me go anywhere. He keeps 
                         me shut up. He's always been mean to 
                         me. Even his life insurance all goes 
                         to that daughter of his. That Lola.

                                     NEFF
                         Nothing for you at all, huh?

                                     PHYLLIS
                         No. And nothing is just what I'm 
                         worth to him.

                                     NEFF
                         So you lie awake in the dark and 
                         listen to him snore and get ideas.

                                     PHYLLIS
                         Walter, I don't want to kill him. I 
                         never did. Not even when he gets 
                         drunk and slaps my face.

                                     NEFF
                         Only sometimes you wish he was dead.

                                     PHYLLIS
                         Perhaps I do.

                                     NEFF
                         And you wish it was an accident, and 
                         you had that policy. For fifty 
                         thousand dollars. Is that it?

                                     PHYLLIS
                         Perhaps that too.

               She takes a long drink.

                                     PHYLLIS
                         The other night we drove home from a 
                         party. He was drunk again. When we 
                         got into the garage he just sat there 
                         with his head on the steering wheel 
                         and the motor still running. And I 
                         thought what it would be like if I 
                         didn't switch it off, just closed 
                         the garage door and left him there.

                                     NEFF
                         I'll tell you what it would be like, 
                         if you had that accident policy, and 
                         tried to pull a monoxide job. We 
                         have a guy in our office named Keyes. 
                         For him a set-up like that would be 
                         just like a slice of rare roast beef. 
                         In three minutes he'd know it wasn't 
                         an accident. In ten minutes you'd be 
                         sitting under the hot lights. In 
                         half an hour you'd be signing your 
                         name to a confession.

                                     PHYLLIS
                         But Walter, I didn't do it. I'm not 
                         going to do it.

                                     NEFF
                         Not if there's an insurance company 
                         in the picture, baby. So long as 
                         you're honest they'll pay you with a 
                         smile, but you just try to pull 
                         something like that and you'll find 
                         out. They know more tricks than a 
                         carload of monkeys. And if there's a 
                         death mixed up in it, you haven't 
                         got a prayer. They'll hang you as 
                         sure as ten dimes will buy a dollar, 
                         baby.

               She begins to cry. He puts his arms around her and kisses 
               her.

                                     NEFF
                         Just stop thinking about it, will 
                         you.

               He holds her tight. Their heads touch, side by side, THE 
               CAMERA SLOWLY STARTS TO RECEDE as we

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               A-47 INT. NEFF'S OFFICE - (NIGHT)

               Neff sits in the swivel chair, talking into the dictaphone. 
               He has hooked the wastebasket under his feet to sit more 
               comfortably. As he talks, a little cough shakes him now and 
               then.

                                     NEFF
                         So we just sat there, and she kept 
                         on crying softly, like the rain on 
                         the window, and we didn't say 
                         anything. Maybe she had stopped 
                         thinking about it, but I hadn't. I 
                         couldn't. Because it all tied up 
                         with something I had been thinking 
                         about for years, since long before I 
                         ever ran into Phyllis Dietrichson. 
                         Because, in this business you can't 
                         sleep for trying to figure out the 
                         tricks they could pull on you. You're 
                         like the guy behind the roulette 
                         wheel, watching the customers to 
                         make sure they don't crook the house. 
                         And then one night, you get to 
                         thinking how you could crook the 
                         house yourself. And do it smart. 
                         Because you've got that wheel right 
                         under your hands. And you know every 
                         notch in it by heart. And you figure 
                         all you need is a plant out in front, 
                         a shill to put down the bet. And 
                         suddenly the doorbell rings and the 
                         whole set-up is right there in the 
                         room with you... Look, Keyes, I'm 
                         not trying to whitewash myself. I 
                         fought it, only maybe I didn't fight 
                         it hard enough. The stakes were fifty 
                         thousand dollars, but they were the 
                         life of a man, too, a man who'd never 
                         done me any dirt. Except he was 
                         married to a woman he didn't care 
                         anything about, and I did...

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               A-48 INT. NEFF'S APARTMENT LIVING ROOM

               CAMERA MOVES SLOWLY towards the davenport again. Neff sits 
               in one corner with his feet on the low table. He is smoking 
               his cigarette and staring at the ceiling. Phyllis has been 
               sitting fairly close to him. She gets up slowly and crosses 
               to her rain coat, lying over a chair.

                                     PHYLLIS
                         I've got to go now, Walter.

               Neff does not answer. He keeps on staring at the ceiling. 
               She starts to put the rain coat on.

                                     PHYLLIS
                         Will you call me, Walter?

               Neff still does not answer.

                                     PHYLLIS
                         Walter!

               He looks at her slowly, almost absently.

                                     PHYLLIS
                         I hate him. I loathe going back to 
                         him. You believe me, don't you, 
                         Walter?

                                     NEFF
                         Sure I believe you.

                                     PHYLLIS
                         I can't stand it anymore. What if 
                         they did hang me?

                                     NEFF
                         You're not going to hang, baby.

                                     PHYLLIS
                         It's better than going on this way.

                                     NEFF
                         -- you're not going to hang, baby. 
                         Not ever. Because you're going to do 
                         it the smart way. Because I'm going 
                         to help you.

                                     PHYLLIS
                         You!

                                     NEFF
                         Me.

                                     PHYLLIS
                         Do you know what you're saying?

                                     NEFF
                         Sure I know what I'm saying.

               He gets up and grips her arm.

                                     NEFF
                         We're going to do it together. We're 
                         going to do it right. And I'm the 
                         guy that knows how.

               There is fierce determination in his voice. His fingers dig 
               into her arm.

                                     PHYLLIS
                         Walter, you're hurting me.

                                     NEFF
                         There isn't going to be any slip up. 
                         Nothing sloppy. Nothing weak. It's 
                         got to be perfect.

               He kisses her.

                                     NEFF
                         You go now.

               He leads her towards the door.

                                     NEFF
                         Call me tomorrow. But not from your 
                         house. From a booth. And watch your 
                         step. Every single minute. It's got 
                         to be perfect, understand. Straight 
                         down the line.

               They have now reached the door. Neff opens it. Phyllis stands 
               in the doorway, her lips white.

                                     PHYLLIS
                         Straight down the line.

               She goes quietly. He watches her down the corridor. Slowly 
               he closes the door and goes back into the room. He moves 
               across the window and opens it wide. He stands there, looking 
               down into the dark street. From below comes the sound of a 
               car starting and driving off. The rain drifts in against his 
               face. He just stands there motionless. His mind is going a 
               hundred miles a minute.

                                                                  FADE OUT:

               B-1 INT. NEFF'S OFFICE - (NIGHT)

               Neff sits slumped in his chair before the dictaphone. On the 
               desk next to him stands a used record. The cylinder on the 
               dictaphone is not turning. He is smoking a cigarette. He 
               kills it then lifts the needle and slides off the record 
               which is on the machine and stands it on end on the desk 
               beside the other used record. He reaches down painfully to 
               take another record from the rack beneath the dictaphone, 
               looks at it against the light to make sure it has not been 
               used, then slides it into place on the machine and resets 
               the needle. He lifts the horn and resumes his dictation.

                                     NEFF
                         The first thing we had to do was fix 
                         him up with that accident policy. I 
                         knew he wouldn't buy, but all I wanted 
                         was his signature on an application. 
                         So I had to make him sign without 
                         his knowing what he was signing. And 
                         I wanted a witness other than Phyllis 
                         to hear me give him a sales talk. I 
                         was trying to think with your brains, 
                         Keyes. I wanted all the answers ready 
                         for all the questions you were going 
                         to spring as soon as Dietrichson was 
                         dead.

               Neff takes a last drag on his cigarette and kills it by 
               running it under the ledge of the dictaphone stand. He drops 
               the stub on the floor and resumes.

                                     NEFF
                         A couple of nights later I went to 
                         the house. Everything looked fine, 
                         except I didn't like the witness 
                         Phyllis had brought in. It was 
                         Dietrichson's daughter Lola, and it 
                         made me feel a little queer in the 
                         belly to have her right there in the 
                         room, playing Chinese checkers, as 
                         if nothing was going to happen.

                                                                  DISSOLVE:

               The checker-board is on the davenport between Phyllis and 
               Lola. Mr. Dietrichson sits in a big easy chair. His coat and 
               tie are over the back of the chair, and the evening paper is 
               lying tumbled on the floor beside him. He is smoking a cigar 
               with the band on it. He has a drink in front of him and 
               several more inside him. In another chair sits Neff, his 
               briefcase on the floor, leaning against his chair. He holds 
               his rate book partly open, with a finger in it for a marker. 
               He is going full swing.

                                     NEFF
                         I suppose you realize, Mr. 
                         Dietrichson, that, not being an 
                         employee, you are not covered by the 
                         State Compensation Insurance Act. 
                         The only way you can protect yourself 
                         is by having a personal policy of 
                         your own.

                                     DIETRICHSON
                         I know all about that. The next thing 
                         you'll tell me I need earthquake 
                         insurance and lightning insurance 
                         and hail insurance.

               Phyllis looks up from the checker-board and cuts in on the 
               dialogue. Lola listens without much interest.

                                     PHYLLIS
                              (To Dietrichson)
                         If we bought all the insurance they 
                         can think up, we'd stay broke paying 
                         for it, wouldn't we, honey?

                                     DIETRICHSON
                         What keeps us broke is you going out 
                         and buying five hats at a crack. Who 
                         needs a hat in California?

                                     NEFF
                         I always say insurance is a lot like 
                         a hot water bottle. It looks kind of 
                         useless and silly hanging on the 
                         hook, but when you get that stomach 
                         ache in the middle of the night, it 
                         comes in mighty handy.

                                     DIETRICHSON
                         Now you want to sell me a hot water 
                         bottle.

                                     NEFF
                         Dollar for dollar, accident insurance 
                         is the cheapest coverage you can 
                         buy, Mr. Dietrichson.

                                     DIETRICHSON
                         Maybe some other time, Mr. Neff. I 
                         had a tough day.

                                     NEFF
                         Just as you say, Mr. Dietrichson.

                                     DIETRICHSON
                         Suppose we just settle that automobile 
                         insurance tonight.

                                     NEFF
                         Sure. All we need on that is for you 
                         to sign an application for renewal.

               Phyllis throws a quick glance at Neff. As she looks back she 
               sees that Lola is staring down at her wrist watch.

                                     LOLA
                         Phyllis, do you mind if we don't 
                         finish this game? It bores me stiff.

                                     PHYLLIS
                         Got some thing better to do?

                                     LOLA
                         Yes, I have.

               She gets up.

                                     LOLA
                              (To Dietrichson)
                         Father, is it all right if I run 
                         along now?

                                     DIETRICHSON
                         Run along where? Who with?

                                     LOLA
                         Just Anne. We're going roller skating.

                                     DIETRICHSON
                         Anne who?

                                     LOLA
                         Anne Matthews.

                                     PHYLLIS
                         It's not that Nino Zachetti again?

                                     DIETRICHSON
                         It better not be that Zachetti guy. 
                         If I ever catch you with that ---

                                     LOLA
                         It's Anne Matthews, I told you. I 
                         also told you we're going roller 
                         skating. I'm meeting her at the corner 
                         of Vermont and Franklin -- the north-
                         west corner, in case you're 
                         interested. And I'm late already. I 
                         hope that is all clear. Good night, 
                         Father. Good night, Phyllis.

               She starts to go.

                                     NEFF
                         Good night, Miss Dietrichson.

                                     LOLA
                         Oh, I'm sorry. Good night, Mr. --

                                     NEFF
                         Neff.

                                     LOLA
                         Good night, Mr. Neff.

                                     PHYLLIS
                         Now you're not going to take my car 
                         again.

                                     LOLA
                         No thanks. I'd rather be dead.

               She goes out through the archway.

                                     DIETRICHSON
                         A great little fighter for her weight.

               Dietrichson sucks down a big swallow of his drink.

               Neff has taken two blank forms from his briefcase. He puts 
               the briefcase on Mr. Dietrichson's lap and lays the forms on 
               top. Phyllis is watching closely.

                                     NEFF
                         This is where you sign, Mr. 
                         Dietrichson.

                                     DIETRICHSON
                         Sign what?

                                     NEFF
                         The applications for your auto

                         until the new policies are issued.

                                     DIETRICHSON
                         When will that be?

                                     NEFF
                         In about a week.

                                     DIETRICHSON
                         Just so I'm covered when I drive up 
                         North.

               Neff takes out his fountain pen.

                                     NEFF
                         San Francisco, Mr. Dietrichson?

                                     DIETRICHSON
                         Palo Alto.

                                     PHYLLIS
                         He was a Stanford man, Mr. Neff. And 
                         he still goes to his class reunion 
                         every year.

                                     DIETRICHSON
                         What's wrong with that? Can't I have 
                         a little fun even once a year?

                                     NEFF
                         Great football school, Stanford. Did 
                         you play football, Mr. Dietrichson?

                                     DIETRICHSON
                         Left guard. Almost made the varsity, 
                         too.

               Neff has unscrewed his fountain pen. He hands it to Mr. 
               Dietrichson. Dietrichson puts on his glasses.

                                     NEFF
                         On that bottom line, Mr. Dietrichson.

               Dietrichson signs. Neff's and Phyllis' eyes meet for a split 
               second.

                                     NEFF
                         Both copies, please.

               He withdraws the top copy barely enough to expose the 
               signature line on the supposed duplicate.

                                     DIETRICHSON
                         Sign twice, huh?

                                     NEFF
                         One is the agent's copy. I need it 
                         for my files.

                                     DIETRICHSON
                              (In a mutter)
                         Files. Duplicates. Triplicates.

               Dietrichson grunts and signs again. Again Neff and Phyllis 
               exchange a quick glance.

                                     NEFF
                         No hurry about the check, Mr. 
                         Dietrichson. I can pick it up at 
                         your office some morning.

               Casually Neff lifts the briefcase and signed applications 
               off Dietrichson's lap.

                                     DIETRICHSON
                         How much you taking me for?

                                     NEFF
                         One forty-seven fifty, Mr. 
                         Dietrichson.

               Dietrichson stands up. He is about Neff's height but a little 
               heavier.

                                     PHYLLIS
                         I guess that's enough insurance for 
                         one evening, Mr. Neff.

                                     DIETRICHSON
                         Plenty.

               Dietrichson has poured some more whisky into his glass. He 
               tries the siphon but it is empty. He gathers up his coat and 
               tie and picks up his glass.

                                     DIETRICHSON
                         Good night, Mr. Neff.

               Neff is zipping up his briefcase.

                                     NEFF
                         Good night, Mr. Dietrichson. Good 
                         night, Mrs. Dietrichson.

                                     DIETRICHSON
                         Bring me some soda when you come up, 
                         Phyllis.

               Dietrichson trundles off towards the archway.

                                     PHYLLIS
                              (To Neff)
                         I think you left your hat in the 
                         hall.

               Phyllis leads the way and Neff goes after her, his briefcase 
               under his arm.

               B-3 HALLWAY DIETRICHSON RESIDENCE - (NIGHT)

               Phyllis enters through the living room archway with Neff 
               behind her. She leads him towards the door. On the way he 
               picks up his hat. In the BACKGROUND Dietrichson begins to 
               ascend the stairs, carrying his coat and glass. Phyllis and 
               Neff move close to the door. They speak in very low voices.

                                     PHYLLIS
                         All right, Walter?

                                     NEFF
                         Fine.

                                     PHYLLIS
                         He signed it, didn't he?

                                     NEFF
                         Sure he signed it. You saw him.

               Phyllis opens the door a crack. Both look at the stairs, 
               where Dietrichson is going up. Phyllis takes her hand off 
               the doorknob and holds on to Neff's arm.

                                     NEFF
                              (Looking up)
                         Watch it, will you.

               Phyllis slowly drops her hand from his arm. Both look up as 
               Dietrichson goes across the balcony and out of sight.

                                     NEFF
                         Listen. That trip to Palo Alto When 
                         does he go?

                                     PHYLLIS
                         End of the month.

                                     NEFF
                         He drives, huh?

                                     PHYLLIS
                         He always drives.

                         Not this time. You're going to make 
                         him take the train.

                                     PHYLLIS
                         Why?

                                     NEFF
                         Because it's all worked out for a 
                         train.

               For a second they stand listening and looking up as if they 
               had heard a sound.

                                     PHYLLIS
                         It's all right. Go on, Walter.

                                     NEFF
                         Look, baby. There's a clause in every 
                         accident policy, a little something 
                         called double indemnity. The insurance 
                         companies put it in as a sort of 
                         come-on for the customers. It means 
                         they pay double on certain accidents. 
                         The kind that almost never happen. 
                         Like for instance if a guy got killed 
                         on a train, they'd pay a hundred 
                         thousand instead of fifty.

                                     PHYLLIS
                         I see.
                              (Her eyes widen with 
                              excitement)

                                     NEFF
                         We're hitting it for the limit, baby. 
                         That's why it's got to be a train.

                                     PHYLLIS
                         It's going to be a train, Walter. 
                         Just the way you say. Straight down 
                         the line.

               They look at each other. The look is like a long kiss. Neff 
               goes out. Slowly Phyllis closes the door and leans her head 
               against it as she looks up the empty stairway.

               B-4 EXT. DIETRICHSON RESIDENCE - (NIGHT)

               Neff, briefcase under his arm, comes down the steps to the 
               street, where his Dodge coupe is parked at the curb. He opens 
               the door and stops, looking in.

               Sitting there in the dark corner of the car, away from the 
               steering wheel, is Lola. She wears a coat but no hat.

                                     LOLA
                         Hello, Mr. Neff. It's me.

               Lola gives him a sly smile. Neff is a little annoyed.

                                     NEFF
                         Something the matter?

                                     LOLA
                         I've been waiting for you.

                                     NEFF
                         For me? What for?

                                     LOLA
                         I thought you could let me ride with 
                         you, if you're going my way.

               Neff doesn't like the idea very much.

                                     NEFF
                         Which way would that be?

                                     LOLA
                         Down the hill. Down Vermont.

                              (Remembering)
                         Oh, sure. Vermont and Franklin. North-
                         west corner, wasn't it? Be glad to, 
                         Miss Dietrichson.

               Neff gets into the car.

               B-5 INT. COUPE - (NIGHT) - (TRANSPARENCY)

               Neff puts the briefcase on the ledge behind the driver's 
               seat. He closes the door and starts the car. They drift down 
               the hill.

                                     NEFF
                         Roller skating, eh? You like roller 
                         skating?

                                     LOLA
                         I can take it or leave it.

               Neff looks at her curiously. Lola meets his glance.

                                     NEFF
                         Only tonight you're leaving it?

               This is an embarrassing moment for Lola.

                                     LOLA
                         Yes, I am. You see, Mr. Neff, I'm 
                         having a very tough time at home. My 
                         father doesn't understand me and 
                         Phyllis hates me.

                                     NEFF
                         That does sound tough, all right.

                                     LOLA
                         That's why I have to lie sometimes.

                                     NEFF
                         You mean it's not Vermont and 
                         Franklin.

                                     LOLA
                         It's Vermont and Franklin all right. 
                         Only it's not Anne Matthews. It's 
                         Nino Zachetti. You won't tell on me, 
                         will you?

                                     NEFF
                         I'd have to think it over.

                                     LOLA
                         Nino's not what my father says at 
                         all. He just had bad luck. He was 
                         doing pre-med at U.S.C. and working 
                         nights as an usher in a theater 
                         downtown. He got behind in his credits 
                         and flunked out. Then he lost his 
                         job for talking back. He's so hot-
                         headed.

                                     NEFF
                         That comes expensive, doesn't it?

                                     LOLA
                         I guess my father thinks nobody's 
                         good enough for his daughter except 
                         maybe the guy that owns Standard 
                         Oil. Would you like a stick of gum?

                                     NEFF
                         Never use it, thanks.

               Lola puts a stick of gum in her mouth.

                                     LOLA
                         I can't give Nino up. I wish father 
                         could see it my way.

                         It'll straighten out all right, Miss

                                     LOLA

                         This is the corner right here, Mr. 
                         Neff.

               Neff brings the car to a stop by the curb.

                                     LOLA
                         There he is. By the bus stop.

               Neff looks out.

               B-6 CORNER VERMONT AND FRANKLIN - (NIGHT)

               Zachetti stands waiting, hands in trouser pockets. He is 
               about twenty-five, Italian looking, open shirt, not well 
               dressed.

                         He needs a hair-cut, doesn't he. 
                         Look at him. No job, no car, no money, 
                         no prospects, no nothing.
                              (Pause)
                         I love him.

               She leans over and honks on the horn.

               He turns around and looks towards the car.

               Zachetti walks towards the car.

               B-9 THE COUPE

               Neff and Lola. She has opened the door. Zachetti comes up.

                              first word)
                         The name is Zachetti.

                                     LOLA
                         Nino. Please. Mr. Neff gave me a 
                         ride from the house. I told him all 
                         about us.

                                     ZACHETTI
                         Why does he have to get told about 
                         us?

                                     LOLA
                         We don't have to worry about Mr. 
                         Neff, Nino.

                                     ZACHETTI
                         I'm not doing any worrying. Just 
                         don't you broadcast so much.

                                     LOLA
                         What's the matter with you, Nino? 
                         He's a friend.

                                     ZACHETTI
                         I don't have any friends. And if I 
                         did, I like to pick them myself.

                                     NEFF
                         Look, sonny, she needed the ride and 
                         I brought her along. Is that anything 
                         to get tough about?

                                     ZACHETTI
                         All right, Lola, make up your mind. 
                         Are you coming or aren't you?

                                     LOLA
                         Of course I'm coming. Don't mind 
                         him, Mr. Neff.

               Lola steps out of the car.

                                     LOLA
                         Thanks a lot. You've been very sweet.

               Lola catches up with Zachetti and they walk away together.

               B-10 INT. COUPE

               Neff looks after them. Slowly he puts the car in gear and 
               drives on. His face is tight. Behind his head, light catches 
               the metal of the zipper on the briefcase. Over the shot comes 
               the COMMENTARY:

                                     NEFF'S VOICE
                         She was a nice kid and maybe he was 
                         a little better than he sounded. I 
                         kind of hoped so for her sake, but 
                         right then it gave me a nasty feeling 
                         to be thinking about them at all, 
                         with that briefcase right behind my 
                         head and her father's application in 
                         it. Besides, I had other problems to 
                         work out. There were plans to make, 
                         and Phyllis had to be in on them...

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               B-11 EXT. SUPER MARKET - (DAY)

               There is a fair amount of activity but the place is not 
               crowded. Neff comes along the sidewalk into the shot. He 
               passes in front of the fruit and vegetable display and goes 
               between the stalls into the market.

                                     NEFF'S VOICE
                              (Continued)
                         ...but we couldn't be seen together 
                         any more and I had told her never to 
                         call me from her house and never to 
                         call me at my office. So we had picked 
                         out a big market on Los Feliz. She 
                         was to be there buying stuff every 
                         day about eleven o'clock, and I could 
                         run into her there. Kind of 
                         accidentally on purpose.

               B-12 INT. MARKET

               Neff stops by the cashier's desk and buys a pack of 
               cigarettes. As he is opening the pack he looks back casually 
               beyond the turnstile into the rear part of the market.

               B-13 ROWS OF HIGH SHELVES IN MARKET

               The shelves are loaded with canned goods and other 
               merchandise. Customers move around selecting articles and 
               putting them in their baskets. Phyllis is seen among them, 
               standing by the soap section. Her basket is partly filled. 
               She wears a simple house dress, no hat, and has a large 
               envelope pocketbook under her arm.

               B-14 INT. MARKET

               Neff has spotted Phyllis. Without haste he passes through 
               the turnstile towards the back.

               B-15 THE SHELVES

               Phyllis is putting a can of cleaning powder into her basket. 
               Neff enters the shot and moves along the shelves towards 
               her, very slowly, pretending to inspect the goods. A customer 
               passes and goes on out of scene. Phyllis and Neff are now 
               very close. During the ensuing low-spoken dialogue, they 
               continue to face the shelves, not looking at each other

                                     PHYLLIS
                         Walter.

                                     NEFF
                         Not so loud.

                                     PHYLLIS
                         I wanted to talk to you, Walter. 
                         Ever since yesterday.

                                     NEFF
                         Let me talk first. It's all set. The 
                         accident policy came through. I've 
                         got it in my pocket. I got his check 
                         too. I saw him down in the oil fields. 
                         He thought he was paying for the 
                         auto insurance. The check's just 
                         made out to the company. It could be 
                         for anything. But you have to send a 
                         check for the auto insurance, see. 
                         It's all right that way, because one 
                         of the cars is yours.

                                     PHYLLIS
                         But listen, Walter ---

                                     NEFF
                         Quick, open your bag.

               She hesitates, then opens it. Neff looks around quickly, 
               slips the policy out of his pocket and drops it into her 
               bag. She snaps the bag shut.

                                     NEFF
                         Can you get into his safe deposit 
                         box?

                                     PHYLLIS
                         Yes. We both have keys.

                                     NEFF
                         Fine. But don't put the policy in 
                         there yet. I'll tell you when. And 
                         listen, you never touched it or even 
                         saw it, understand?

                                     PHYLLIS
                         I'm not a fool.

                                     NEFF
                         Okay. When is he taking the train?

                                     PHYLLIS
                         Walter, that's just it. He isn't 
                         going.

                                     NEFF
                         What?

                                     PHYLLIS
                         That's what I've been trying to tell 
                         you. The trip is off.

                                     NEFF
                         What's happened?

               He breaks off as a short, squatty woman, pushing a child in 
               a walker, comes into sight and approaches. She stops beside 
               Neff, who is pretending to read a label on a can. Phyllis 
               puts a few cakes of soap into her basket.

                                     WOMAN
                              (To Neff)
                         Mister, could you reach me that can 
                         of coffee?
                              (She points)
                         That one up there.

                                     NEFF
                              (Reaching up)
                         This one?

               She nods. Neff reaches a can down from the high shelf and 
               hands it to her.

                                     WOMAN
                         I don't see why they always have to 
                         put what I want on the top shelf.

               She moves away with her coffee and her child. Out of the 
               corner of his eye Neff watches her go. He moves closer to 
               Phyllis again.

                                     NEFF
                         Go ahead. I'm listening.

                                     PHYLLIS
                         He had a fall down at the well. He 
                         broke his leg. It's in a cast.

                                     NEFF
                         That knocks it on the head all right.

                                     PHYLLIS
                         What do we do, Walter?

                                     NEFF
                         Nothing. Just wait.

                                     PHYLLIS
                         Wait for what?

                                     NEFF
                         Until he can take a train. I told 
                         you it's got to be a train.

                                     PHYLLIS
                         We can't wait. I can't go on like 
                         this.

                                     NEFF
                         We're not going to grab a hammer and 
                         do it quick, just to get it over 
                         with.

                                     PHYLLIS
                         There are other ways.

                                     NEFF
                         Only we're not going to do it other 
                         ways.

                                     PHYLLIS
                         But we can't leave it like this. 
                         What do you think would happen if he 
                         found out about this accident policy?

                                     NEFF
                         Plenty. But not as bad as sitting in 
                         that death-house.

                                     PHYLLIS
                         Don't ever talk like that, Walter.

                                     NEFF
                         Just don't let's start losing our 
                         heads.

                                     PHYLLIS
                         It's not our heads. It's our nerve 
                         we're losing.

                                     NEFF
                         We're going to do it right. That's 
                         all I said.

                                     PHYLLIS
                         Walter maybe it's my nerves. It's 
                         the waiting that gets me.

                                     NEFF
                         It's getting me just as bad, baby. 
                         But we've got to wait.

                                     PHYLLIS
                         Maybe we have, Walter. Only it's so 
                         tough without you. It's like a wall 
                         between us.

               Neff looks at his watch.

                                     NEFF
                         Good-bye baby. I'm thinking of you 
                         every minute.

               He goes off. She stares after him.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               B-16 NEFF'S OFFICE - (DAY)

               He is wearing a light grey suit and has his hat on. He is 
               standing behind his desk opening some mail, taking a few 
               papers out of his briefcase, checking something in his rate 
               book, making a quick telephone call. But nothing of this is 
               heard.

                                     NEFF'S VOICE
                         After that a full week went by and I 
                         didn't see her once. I tried to keep 
                         my mind off her and off the whole 
                         idea. I kept telling myself that 
                         maybe those fates they say watch 
                         over you had gotten together and 
                         broken his leg to give me a way out. 
                         Then it was the fifteenth of June. 
                         You may remember that date, Keyes. I 
                         do too, only for a very different 
                         reason. You came into my office around 
                         three in the afternoon...

               Keyes enters with some papers in his hand.

                                     NEFF
                         Hello, Keyes.

                                     KEYES
                         I just came from Norton's office. 
                         The semi-annual sales records are 
                         out. You're high man, Walter. That's 
                         twice in a row. Congratulations.

                                     NEFF
                         Thanks. How would you like a cheap 
                         drink?

                                     KEYES
                         How would you like a fifty dollar 
                         cut in salary?

                                     NEFF
                         How would I -- Do I laugh now, or 
                         wait until it gets funny?

                                     KEYES
                         I'm serious, Walter. I've been talking 
                         to Norton. There's too much stuff 
                         piling up on my desk. Too much 
                         pressure on my nerves. I spend half 
                         the night walking up and down in my 
                         bed. I've got to have an assistant. 
                         I thought that you --

                                     NEFF
                         Me? Why pick on me?

                                     KEYES
                         Because I've got a crazy idea you 
                         might be good at the job.

                                     NEFF
                         That's crazy all right. I'm a 
                         salesman.

                                     KEYES
                         Yeah. A peddler, a glad-hander, a 
                         back-slapper. You're too good to be 
                         a salesman.

                                     NEFF
                         Nobody's too good to be a salesman.

                                     KEYES
                         Phooey. All you guys do is ring door-
                         bells and dish out a smooth line of 
                         monkey talk. What's bothering you is 
                         that fifty buck cut, isn't it?

                                     NEFF
                         That'd bother anybody.

                                     KEYES
                         Look, Walter. The job I'm talking 
                         about takes brains and integrity. It 
                         takes more guts than there is in 
                         fifty salesman. It's the hottest job 
                         in the business.

                                     NEFF
                         It's still a desk job. I don't want 
                         a desk job.

                                     KEYES
                         A desk job. Is that all you can see 
                         in it? Just a hard chair to park 
                         your pants on from nine to five. 
                         Just a pile of papers to shuffle 
                         around, and five sharp pencils and a 
                         scratch pad to make figures on, with 
                         maybe a little doodling on the side. 
                         That's not the way I see it, Walter. 
                         To me a claims man is a surgeon, and 
                         that desk is an operating table, and 
                         those pencils are scalpels and bone 
                         chisels. And those papers are not 
                         just forms and statistics and claims 
                         for compensation. They're alive, 
                         they're packed with drama, with 
                         twisted hopes and crooked dreams. A 
                         claims man, Walter, is a doctor and 
                         a blood-hound and a cop and a judge 
                         and a jury and a father confessor, 
                         all in one.

               The telephone rings on Neff's desk. Automatically Keyes grabs 
               the phone and answers.

                                     KEYES
                         Who? Okay, hold the line.

               He puts the phone down on the desk and continues to Neff:

                                     KEYES
                         And you want to tell me you're not 
                         interested. You don't want to work 
                         with your brains. All you want to 
                         work with is your finger on a door-
                         bell. For a few bucks more a week. 
                         There's a dame on your phone.

               Neff picks the phone up and answers.

                                     NEFF
                         Walter Neff speaking.

               Phyllis is on the phone.

                         I had to call you, Walter. It's 
                         terribly urgent. Are you with 
                         somebody?

               B-18 NEFF'S OFFICE

               Neff on the phone. His eye catches Keyes', who is walking up 
               and down.

                                     NEFF
                         Of course I am. Can't I call you 
                         back... Margie?

                         Walter, I've only got a minute. It 
                         can't wait. Listen. He's going 
                         tonight. On the train. Are you 
                         listening, Walter? Walter!

               B-20 NEFF - ON PHONE

               His eyes are on Keyes. He speaks into the phone as calmly as 
               possible.

                                     NEFF
                         I'm listening. Only make it short... 
                         Margie.

                         He's on crutches. The doctor says he 
                         can go if he's careful. The change 
                         will do him good. It's wonderful, 
                         Walter. Just the way you wanted it. 
                         Only with the crutches it's ever so 
                         much better, isn't it?

               B-22 NEFF'S OFFICE

               Neff on phone.

                                     NEFF
                         One hundred percent better. Hold the 
                         line a minute.

               He covers the receiver with his hand and turns to Keyes, who 
               is now standing at the window.

                                     NEFF
                         Suppose I join you in your office, 
                         Keyes --

               He makes a gesture as if expecting Keyes to leave. Keyes 
               stays right where he is.

                                     KEYES
                         I'll wait. Only tell Margie not to 
                         take all day.

               Neff looks at Keyes' back with a strained expression, then 
               lifts the phone again.

                                     NEFF
                         Go ahead.

                         I'm driving him. Is it still that 
                         same dark street?

               B-24 NEFF, ON PHONE

               He is still watching Keyes cautiously.

                                     NEFF

                         Oh, sure. The blue suit, Walter. 
                         Navy blue. And the cast on his left 
                         leg.

                         a leaf. But it's straight down the 
                         line now for both of us. I love you, 
                         Walter. Goodbye.

               B-28 NEFF'S OFFICE

               Neff on the phone.

                                     NEFF
                         So long, Margie.

               He hangs up. His mouth is grim, but he forces a smile as 
               Keyes turns.

                                     NEFF
                         I'm sorry, Keyes.

                                     KEYES
                         What's the matter? The dames chasing 
                         you again? Or still? Or is it none 
                         of my business?

                                     NEFF
                              (With a sour smile)
                         If I told you it was a customer --

                                     KEYES
                         Margie! I bet she drinks from the 
                         bottle. Why don't you settle down 
                         and get married, Walter?

                                     NEFF
                         Why don't you, for instance?

                                     KEYES
                         I almost did, once. A long time ago.

               Neff gets up from his desk.

                                     NEFF
                         Look, Keyes, I've got a prospect to 
                         call on.

               Keyes drives right ahead.

                                     KEYES
                         We even had the church all picked 
                         out, the dame and I. She had a white 
                         satin dress with flounces on it. And 
                         I was on my way to the jewelry store 
                         to buy the ring. Then suddenly that 
                         little man in here started working 
                         on me.

               He punches his stomach with his fist.

                                     NEFF
                         So you went back and started 
                         investigating her. That it?

               Keyes nods slowly, a little sad and a little ashamed.

                                     KEYES
                         And the stuff that came out. She'd 
                         been dyeing her hair ever since she 
                         was sixteen. And there was a manic-
                         depressive in her family, on her 
                         mother's side. And she already had 
                         one husband, a professional pool 
                         player in Baltimore. And as for her 
                         brother --

                                     NEFF
                         I get the general idea. She was a 
                         tramp from a long line of tramps.

               He picks up some papers impatiently.

                                     KEYES
                         All right, I'm going. What am I to 
                         say to Norton? How about that job I 
                         want you for?

                                     NEFF
                         I don't think I want it. Thanks, 
                         Keyes, just the same.

                                     KEYES
                         Fair enough. Just get this: I picked 
                         you for the job, not because I think 
                         you're so darn smart, but because I 
                         thought maybe you were a shade less 
                         dumb than the rest of the outfit. I 
                         guess I was all wet. You're not 
                         smarter, Walter. You're just a little 
                         taller.

               He goes out. Neff is alone. He watches the door close, then 
               turns and goes slowly to the water cooler. He fills a paper 
               cup and stands holding it. His thoughts are somewhere else. 
               After a moment he absently throws the cupful of water into 
               the receptacle under the cooler. He goes back to the desk. 

               He takes his rate book out of his brief case and puts it on 
               the desk. He buttons the top button of his shirt, and pulls 
               his tie right. He leaves the office, with his briefcase under 
               his arm.

                                     NEFF'S VOICE
                         That was it, Keyes, and there was no 
                         use kidding myself any more. Those 
                         fates I was talking about had only 
                         been stalling me off. Now they had 
                         thrown the switch. The gears had 
                         meshed. The machinery had started to 
                         move and nothing could stop it. The 
                         time for thinking had all run out. 
                         From here on it was a question of 
                         following the time table, move by 
                         move, just as we had it rehearsed. I 
                         wanted my time all accounted for for 
                         the rest of the afternoon and up to 
                         the last possible moment in the 
                         evening. So I arranged to call on a 
                         prospect in Pasadena about a public 
                         liability bond. When I left the office 
                         I put my rate book on the desk as if 
                         I had forgotten it. That was part of 
                         the alibi.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               B-29 EXT. NEFF'S APT. HOUSE DAY

               Neff's coupe comes down the street and swings into the garage 
               and goes down the ramp into the basement.

                                     NEFF'S VOICE
                         I got home about seven and drove 
                         right into the garage. This was 
                         another item to establish my alibi.

               B-30 INT. GARAGE

               There are about eight cars parked. A colored attendant in 
               coveralls and rubber boots is washing a car with a hose and 
               sponge. Neff's car comes into the shot and stops near the 
               attendant. Neff gets out with his briefcase under his arm.

                                     ATTENDANT
                         Hiya there, Mr. Neff.

                                     NEFF
                         How about a wash job on my heap, 
                         Charlie?

                                     ATTENDANT
                         How soon you want it, Mr. Neff? I 
                         got two cars ahead of you.

                                     NEFF
                         Anytime you get to it, Charlie. I'm 
                         staying in tonight.

                                     ATTENDANT
                         Okay, Mr. Neff. Be all shined up for 
                         you in the morning.

               Neff is crossing to the elevator. He speaks back over his 
               shoulder:

                                     NEFF
                         That left front tire looks a little 
                         soft. Check it, will you?

                                     ATTENDANT
                         You bet. Check 'em all round. Always 
                         do.

               Neff enters the elevator.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               B-31 NEFF'S APT. - (DAY)

               Neff enters. He walks straight to the phone, dials, and starts 
               speaking into the mouthpiece, but only the COMMENTARY is 
               heard.

                                                                  DISSOLVE:

                         Up in my apartment I called Lou 
                         Schwartz, one of the salesmen that 
                         shared my office. He lived in 
                         Westwood. That made it a toll call 
                         and there'd be a record of it. I 
                         told him I had forgotten my rate 
                         book and needed some dope on the 
                         public liability bond I was figuring. 
                         I asked him to call me back. This 
                         was another item in my alibi, so 
                         that later on I could prove that I 
                         had been home.

               B-32 INT. NEFF'S LIVING ROOM

               Neff comes into the living room from the bedroom, putting on 
               the jacket of his blue suit. THE PHONE RINGS. He picks up 
               the receiver and starts talking, unheard, as before. He makes 
               notes on a pad.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

                                     NEFF'S VOICE
                         I changed into a navy blue suit like 
                         Dietrichson was going to wear. Lou 
                         Schwartz called me back and gave me 
                         a lot of figures...

               B-33 NEFF

               He is folding a hand towel and stuffing it into his jacket 
               pocket. He then takes a large roll of adhesive tape and puts 
               that into his pants pocket.

                              (Cont'd)
                         I stuffed a hand towel and a big 
                         roll of adhesive tape into my pockets, 
                         so I could fake something that looked 
                         like a cast on a broken leg... Next 
                         I fixed the telephone and the 
                         doorbell, so that the cards would 
                         fall down if the bells rang. That 
                         way I would know there had been a 
                         phone call or visitor while I was 
                         away. I left the apartment house by 
                         the fire stairs and side door. Nobody 
                         saw me. It was already getting dark. 
                         I took the Vermont Avenue bus to Los 
                         Feliz and walked from there up to 
                         the Dietrichson house. There was 
                         that smell of honeysuckle again, 
                         only stronger, now that it was 
                         evening.

               B-34 & B-35 INSERTS OF OPEN TELEPHONE BELL BOX (ON BASEBOARD) 
               & DOORBELL (ABOVE ENTRANCE DOOR)

               Neff's hand places a small card against the bell clapper in 
               each of these.

               B-36 FIRE STAIRS, APT. HOUSE (NIGHT)

               CAMERA PANS with Neff going down the stairs in his blue suit, 
               with a hat pulled down over his eyes.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               B-37 EXT. DIETRICHSON HOME - (NIGHT) - LONG SHOT - NO 
               TRAFFIC

               Some windows are lit. Neff comes into the shot and approaches 
               cautiously. He looks around and then slides open the garage 
               door.

               B-38 INT. GARAGE

               Neff closes the garage door. Very faint light comes in at a 
               side window. He opens the rear door of the sedan, gets in 
               and closes the door after him. The dark interior of the car 
               has swallowed him up.

                                     NEFF'S VOICE
                         Then I was in the garage. His car 
                         was backed in, just the way I told 
                         Phyllis to have it. It was so still 
                         I could hear the ticking of the clock 
                         on the dashboard. I kept thinking of 
                         the place we had picked out to do 
                         it, that dark street on the way to 
                         the station, and the three honks on 
                         the horn that were to be the signal... 
                         About ten minutes later they came 
                         down.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               B-39 EXT. DIETRICHSON HOUSE

               The front door has opened and Dietrichson is half-way down 
               the steps. He is walking with crutches, wearing the dark 
               blue suit and a hat. The cast is on his left leg. There is 
               no shoe on his left foot. Only the white plaster shows. 
               Phyllis comes after him, carrying his suitcase and his 
               overcoat. She wears a camel's-hair coat and no hat. She 
               catches up with him.

                                     PHYLLIS
                         You all right, honey? I'll have the 
                         car out in a second.

               Dietrichson just grunts. She passes him to the garage, CAMERA 
               WITH HER, and slides the door open.

               B-40 INT. GARAGE

               THE CAMERA IS VERY LOW INSIDE THE SEDAN, shooting slightly 
               upwards from Neff's hiding place. The garage door has just 
               been opened. Phyllis comes to the car, opens the rear door. 
               She looks down, almost INTO THE CAMERA. A tight, cool smile 
               flashes across her face. Then, very calmly, she puts the 
               suitcase and overcoat in back on the seat (out of shot). She 
               closes the door again.

               B-41 EXT. GARAGE

               Dietrichson stands watching Phyllis as she gets into the car 
               and drives out to pick him up. She stops beside him and opens 
               the right-hand door. Dietrichson climbs in with difficulty. 
               She helps him, watching him closely.

                                     PHYLLIS
                         Take it easy, honey. We've got lots 
                         of time.

                                     DIETRICHSON
                         Just let me do it my own way. Grab 
                         that crutch.

               She takes one of the crutches from him.

                                     DIETRICHSON
                         They ought to make these things so 
                         they fold up.

               For a moment, as he leans his hand on the back of the seat, 
               there is danger that he may see Neff. He doesn't. He slides 
               awkwardly into the seat and pulls the second crutch in after 
               him. He closes the door. The car moves off.

               Phyllis driving and Dietrichson beside her, face TOWARDS THE 
               CAMERA. Dietrichson has a partly smoked cigar between his 
               teeth. They are in the middle of a conversation.

                                     DIETRICHSON
                         Aw, stop squawkin' can't you, Phyllis? 
                         No man takes his wife along to a 
                         class reunion. That's what class 
                         reunions are for.

                         Mrs. Tucker went along with her 
                         husband last year, didn't she.

                                     DIETRICHSON
                         Yeah, and what happened to her? She 
                         sat in the hotel lobby for four days 
                         straight. Never even saw the guy 
                         until we poured him back on the train.

               DIETRICHSON

               His face is partly covered by the edge of a traveling rug 
               which he has pulled up over him. He looks up at Dietrichson 
               and Phyllis in the front seat.

                         All right, honey. Just so long as 
                         you have a good time.

                                     DIETRICHSON'S VOICE
                         I won't do much dancing, I can tell 
                         you that.

                         Remember what the doctor said. If 
                         you get careless you might end up 
                         with a shorter leg.

                                     DIETRICHSON
                         So what? I could break the other one 
                         and match them up again.

                                     PHYLLIS
                         It makes you feel pretty good to get 
                         away from me, doesn't it?

                         It's only for four days. I'll be 
                         back Monday at the latest.

                                     PHYLLIS
                         Don't forget we're having the Hobeys 
                         for dinner on Monday.

                                     DIETRICHSON
                         The Hobeys? We had them last. They 
                         owe us a dinner, don't they?

                                     PHYLLIS
                         Maybe they do but I've already asked 
                         them for Monday.

                                     DIETRICHSON
                         Well, I don't want to feed the Hobeys.

               B-46 CLOSEUP - PHYLLIS' FACE ONLY

               There is a look of tension in her eyes now. She glances around 
               quickly. The car has reached the dark street Neff and she 
               picked out.

                                     DIETRICHSON'S VOICE
                         And I don't want to eat at their 
                         house either. The food you get there, 
                         and that rope he hands out for cigars. 
                         Call it off, can't you?

               Phyllis does not answer. She doesn't even breathe. Her hand 
               goes down on the horn button. She honks three times.

                                     DIETRICHSON'S VOICE
                         What are you doing that for? What 
                         the --

               This is as far as his voice will ever get. It breaks off and 
               dies down in a muffled groan. There are struggling noises 
               and a dull sound of something breaking. Phyllis drives on 
               and never turns her head. She stares straight in front of 
               her. Her teeth are clenched.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               B-47 PARKING SPACE ADJOINING GLENDALE STATION - NIGHT

               The station is visible about sixty yards away. There is no 
               parking attendant. Ten or twelve cars are parked diagonally, 
               not crowded. The train is not in yet, but there is activity 
               around the station. Passengers and their friends, redcaps 
               and baggage men, news vendors, etc.

               The Dietrichson sedan drives into the shot past CAMERA and 
               parks in the foreground at the outer end of the line, several 
               spaces from the next car, facing away from the CAMERA. Both 
               front doors are open. Phyllis gets out and from the other 
               side crutches emerge, and a man (seen entirely from behind, 
               and apparently Dietrichson) climbs out awkwardly. While he 
               is steadying himself on the ground with the crutches, Phyllis 
               has taken out Dietrichson's suitcase and overcoat. She walks 
               around the car and rolls up the right front window. She closes 
               and locks the car door. She tries the right rear door and 
               takes a last look into the dim interior of the car. Then she 
               and the man walk slowly away from the car to the end of the 
               station platform and along it toward the station building, 
               Phyllis walks several steps ahead of the man.

                         From there it's exactly eight-tenths 
                         of a mile to the dump beside the 
                         tracks. Remember?

                                     PHYLLIS
                         I remember everything.

                         You'll be there a little ahead of 
                         the train. No speeding. You don't 
                         want any cops stopping you -- with 
                         him in the back.

                                     PHYLLIS
                         Walter, we've been through all that 
                         so many times.

                                     NEFF
                         When you turn off the highway, cut 
                         all your lights. I'm going to be 
                         back on the observation platform. 
                         I'll drop off as close to the spot 
                         as I can. Wait for the train to pass, 
                         then blink your lights twice.

               Phyllis nods. They go on. Over them is heard the noise of 
               the train coming into the station and its lights are seen.

               B-50 GLENDALE STATION PLATFORM

               The train is just coming to a stop. The passengers move 
               forward to the tracks. Phyllis, carrying the suitcase and 
               overcoat, and Neff, still a little behind her, come TOWARDS 
               THE CAMERA. A redcap sees them and runs up. He takes the 
               suitcase out of Phyllis' hand.

                                     REDCAP
                         San Francisco train, lady?

               Phyllis takes an envelope containing Dietrichson's ticket 
               from the pocket of the overcoat. She reads from the envelope.

                                     PHYLLIS
                         Car nine, section eleven. Just my 
                         husband going.

                                     REDCAP
                         Car nine, section eleven. Yessum, 
                         this way please.

               Phyllis hands the overcoat to the redcap, who leads her and 
               Neff towards car number nine. Neff still hangs back and keeps 
               his head down, the way a man using crutches might naturally 
               do.

               B-51 EXT. CAR #9: B-52: B-53

               The pullman conductor and porter stand at the steps. The 
               conductor is checking the tickets of passengers getting on. 
               The redcap leads Phyllis and Neff into the SHOT. The conductor 
               and porter see Neff on his crutches and move to help him.

                                     PHYLLIS
                         It's all right, thanks. My husband 
                         doesn't like to be helped.

               The redcap goes up the steps into the car. Neff laboriously 
               swings himself up onto the box and from there up on the steps, 
               keeping his head down. Meantime, Phyllis is holding the 
               attention of the conductor and porter by showing them the 
               ticket.

                                     CONDUCTOR
                         Car nine, section eleven. The 
                         gentleman only. Thank you.

               Phyllis nods and takes the ticket back. Neff has reached the 
               top of the steps. She goes up after him and gives him the 
               ticket. They are now close together.

                                     PHYLLIS
                         Goodbye, honey. Take awful good care 
                         of yourself with that leg.

                                     NEFF
                         Sure, I will. Just you take it easy 
                         going home.

                                     PHYLLIS
                         I'll miss you, honey.

               She kisses him. There are shouts of "ALL ABOARD". The redcap 
               comes from inside the car.

                                     REDCAP
                         Section eleven, suh.

               Phyllis takes a quarter from her bag and gives it to the 
               redcap.

                                     PORTER
                              (Shouting)
                         All aboard!

               Redcap descends. Phyllis kisses Neff again quickly.

                                     PHYLLIS
                         Good luck, honey.

               She runs down the steps. The porter picks up the box. He and 
               the conductor get on board the train. Phyllis stands there 
               waving goodbye as the train starts moving, and the porter 
               begins to close the car door. Phyllis turns and walks out of 
               the shot in the direction of the parked car.

               B-54 INT. PLATFORM CAR NUMBER NINE - MOVING TRAIN - (NIGHT) - 
               DIM LIGHT

               Neff and the Porter. The conductor is going on into the car. 
               Neff is half turned away from the porter.

                                     NEFF
                         Can you make up my berth right away?

                                     PORTER
                         Yes, sir.

                                     NEFF
                         I'm going back to the observation 
                         car for a smoke.

                                     PORTER
                         This way, sir. Three cars back.

               He holds the vestibule door open. Neff hobbles through.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               B-55 INT. PULLMAN CAR - DIM

               Most of the berths are made up. As Neff hobbles along, another 
               porter and some passengers make way for the crippled man 
               solicitously.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               B-56 PLATFORM BETWEEN TWO CARS - VERY DIM

               The train conductor meets Neff and opens the door for him. 
               Neff hobbles on through.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               B-57 INT. PARLOR CAR - MOVING TRAIN

               Four or five passengers are reading or writing. As Neff comes 
               through on his crutches they pull in their feet to make room 
               for him. One old lady, seeing that he is headed for the 
               observation platform, opens the door for him. He thanks her 
               with a nod and hobbles through.

               B-58 OBSERVATION PLATFORM

               Dark except for a little light coming from inside the parlor 
               car. The train is going at about fifteen miles an hour between 
               Glendale and Burbank. Neff has come out and hobbled to the 
               railing. He stands looking back along the rails. SUDDENLY A 
               MAN'S VOICE speaks from behind him.

                                     MAN'S VOICE
                         Can I pull a chair out for you?

               Neff looks around. He sees a man sitting in the corner smoking 
               a hand-rolled cigarette. He is about fifty-five years old, 
               with white hair, and a broad-brimmed Stetson hat. He looks 
               like a small town lawyer or maybe a mining man. Neff does 
               not like the man's presence there very much. He turns to him 
               just enough to answer.

                                     NEFF
                         No thanks, I'd rather stand.

                                     MAN
                         You going far?

                                     NEFF
                         Palo Alto.

                                     MAN
                         My name's Jackson. I'm going all the 
                         way to Medford. Medford, Oregon. Had 
                         a broken arm myself once.

                                     NEFF
                         Uh-huh.

                                     JACKSON
                         That darn cast sure itches something 
                         fierce, don't it? I thought I'd go 
                         crazy with mine.

               Neff stands silent. His mind is feverishly thinking of how 
               to get rid of Jackson.

                                     JACKSON
                         Palo Alto's a nice little town. You 
                         a Stanford man?

                                     NEFF
                         Used to be.

               He starts patting his pockets as if looking for something.

                                     JACKSON
                         I bet you left something behind. I 
                         always do.

                                     NEFF
                         My cigar case. Must have left it in 
                         my overcoat back in the section.

               Jackson takes out a small bag of tobacco and a packet of 
               cigarette papers.

                                     JACKSON
                         Care to roll yourself a cigarette, 
                         Mr. --?

                                     NEFF
                         Dietrichson. Thanks. I really prefer 
                         cigars.
                              (Looking around)
                         Maybe the porter --

                                     JACKSON
                         I could get your cigars for you. Be 
                         glad to, Mr. Dietrichson.

                                     NEFF
                         That's darn nice of you. It's car 
                         nine, section eleven. If you're sure 
                         it's not too much trouble.

                                     JACKSON
                         Car nine, section eleven. A pleasure.

               He rises and exits into the parlor car. Neff turns slowly 
               and watches Jackson go back through the car. Then he moves 
               to one side of the platform and looks ahead along the track 
               to orientate himself. He gives one last glance back into the 
               parlor car to make sure no one is watching him. He slips the 
               crutches from under his arms and stands on both feet. He 
               drops the crutches off the train onto the tracks, then quickly 
               swings his body over the rail.

               B-59 EXT. MOVING OBSERVATION CAR - CAMERA FOLLOWING

               Neff is hanging onto the railing. He looks down, then lets 
               go and drops to the right-of-way. THE CAMERA STOPS. The train 
               recedes slowly into the night. Neff has fallen on the tracks. 
               He picks himself up, rubs one knee and looks back along the 
               line of the tracks and off to one side.

               B-60 DARK LANDSCAPE - RAILROAD TRACKS

               Close beyond the edge of the right-of-way, the silhouette of 
               a dump shows up. Beside it looms the dark bulk of the 
               Dietrichson sedan. The headlights blink twice and go out.

               B-61 NEFF

               He starts running towards the car. He runs a little awkwardly 
               because of the improvised cast on his left foot.

               B-62 CAR IN THE DARK

               The front door opens and Phyllis steps out. She closes the 
               door and looks in the direction of the tracks. The uneven 
               steps of Neff running towards her are heard. She opens the 
               back door of the car and leans in. She pulls the rug off the 
               corpse (which is not visible) and stands looking into the 
               car, unable to take her eyes off what she sees, while at the 
               same time her hands mechanically begin to fold the rug. The 
               running steps grow louder and Neff comes into the SHOT 
               breathing hard. He reaches her.

                                     NEFF
                         Okay. This has to go fast. Take his 
                         hat and pick up the crutches.

               Neff points back towards the tracks. He reaches into the car 
               and begins to drag out the body by the armpits. Phyllis coolly 
               reaches past him and takes the hat off the dead man's head. 
               She turns to go.

                                     NEFF
                         Hang on to that rug. I'll need it.

               Phyllis moves out of the shot carrying the hat and rug.

               B-63 NEFF

               He gets a stronger hold on the dead Dietrichson and drags 
               him free of the car and towards the tracks. The corpse is 
               not seen.

               B-64 PHYLLIS

               She has reached the point where one of the crutches lies. 
               She picks it up and goes for the other crutch a short distance 
               away. She carries both crutches, the hat and the rug towards 
               Neff.

               B-65 NEFF

               He has reached the railroad tracks. The corpse is lying beside 
               the tracks, face down. Phyllis comes up to Neff. He takes 
               the crutches and the hat from her. He throws the crutches 
               beside the corpse. He takes the hat from Phyllis and tosses 
               it carelessly along the track.

                                     NEFF
                         Let's go. Stay behind me.

               He takes the rug from her and they move back towards the 
               car, Phyllis first, then Neff walking almost backwards, 
               sweeping the ground over which the body was dragged with the 
               rug as they go.

               B-66 THE CAR

               They reach it together.

                                     NEFF
                         Get in. You drive.

               She gets in. Neff sweeps the ground after him as he goes 
               around the car to get in beside her. He throws the rug into 
               the back of the car.

               B-67 INT. CAR

               Phyllis is behind the wheel. Neff beside her is just closing 
               the door. He props his wrapped foot against the dashboard 
               and begins to tear off the adhesive tape while at the same 
               time Phyllis presses the starter button. The starter grinds, 
               but the motor doesn't catch. She tries again. It still doesn't 
               catch. Neff looks at her. She tries a third time. The starter 
               barely turns over. The battery is very low.

               Phyllis leans back. They stare at each other desperately. 
               After a moment Neff bends forward slowly and turns the 
               ignition key to the OFF position. He holds his left thumb 
               poised over the starter button. There is a breathless moment. 
               Then he presses the starter button with swift decision. The 
               starter grinds with nerve-wracking sluggishness. Neff twists 
               the ignition key to ON and instantly pulls the hand-throttle 
               wide open. With a last feeble kick of the starter, the motor 
               catches and races. He eases the throttle down and slides 
               back into his place. They look at each other again. The 
               tenseness of the moment still shows in their faces.

                                     NEFF
                         Let's go, baby.

               Phyllis releases the hand brake and puts the car in reverse. 
               Neff is again busy unwrapping the tape from his leg. The car 
               moves.

               B-68 DARK LANDSCAPE - WITH DUMP

               The car, with the headlights out, backs up, swings around 
               and moves off along the dirt road the way it came.

               B-69 INT. SEDAN - DRIVING ALONG HIGHWAY IN TRAFFIC

               Phyllis and Neff facing towards CAMERA. Neff is bent over, 
               peeling the towel and plaster off his foot, which is out of 
               shot. Phyllis is calm, almost relaxed. Neff straightens up. 
               They are talking to each other. Their lips are seen moving 
               but what they say is not heard. They stop talking. Phyllis 
               stares straight ahead. Neff is pulling adhesive tape off the 
               wrapped towel that was on his foot. He folds the adhesive 
               into a tight ball, rolls the towel up, puts both into his 
               pockets.

                         On the way back we went over once 
                         more what she was to do at the 
                         inquest, if they had one, and about 
                         the insurance, when that came up. I 
                         was afraid she might go to pieces a 
                         little, now that we had done it, but 
                         she was perfect. No nerves. Not a 
                         tear, not even a blink of the eyes...

               B-70 DARK STREET NEAR NEFF'S APT. HOUSE

               The sedan drives into the shot and stops without pulling 
               over to the curb.

                         She dropped me a block from my 
                         apartment house.

               The car door opens. Neff starts to get out.

                                     PHYLLIS
                         Walter.

               Neff turns back to her.

                                     PHYLLIS
                         What's the matter, Walter. Aren't 
                         you going to kiss me?

                                     NEFF
                         Sure, I'm going to kiss you.

               Phyllis bends towards him and puts her arms around him.

                                     PHYLLIS
                         It's straight down the line, isn't 
                         it?

               Phyllis kisses him. In the kiss he is passive.

                                     PHYLLIS
                         I love you, Walter.

                         It was two minutes past eleven as I 
                         went up the fire stairs again. Nobody 
                         saw me this time either.

                         In the apartment I checked the bells. 
                         The cards hadn't moved. No calls. No

               Neff comes from the bedroom, wearing the light grey suit he 
               wore before the murder, only with out a tie. He buttons his 
               jacket, looks around the room, and opens the corridor door.

                         I changed the blue suit. There was 
                         one last thing to do. I wanted the 
                         garage man to see me again.

               B-75 BASEMENT GARAGE - (NIGHT)

               Fifteen or twenty cars are parked now. Charlie, the attendant 
               has washed Neff's car and is now polishing the glass and 
               metal work. Neff comes from the elevator. Charlie sees him. 
               He straightens up.

                                     CHARLIE
                         You going to need it after all, Mr. 
                         Neff? I'm about through.

                                     NEFF
                         It's okay, Charlie. Just walking 
                         down to the drug store for something 
                         to eat. Been working upstairs all 
                         evening. My stomach's getting sore 
                         at me.

               He walks up the ramp towards the garage entrance.

               B-76 STREET OUTSIDE APT. HOUSE - (NIGHT) - SHOOTING TOWARDS 
               GARAGE ENTRANCE

               Neff comes out at the top of the ramp and starts to walk 
               down the street, not too fast. CAMERA PRECEDES HIM. He walks 
               about ten or fifteen yards. At first his steps sound hard 
               and distinct on the sidewalk and echo in the deserted street. 
               But slowly, as he goes on, they fade into utter silence. He 
               walks a few feet without sound, then becomes aware of the 
               silence. He stops rigidly and looks back. CAMERA STOPS WITH 
               HIM. He stands like that for a moment, then turns toward the 
               CAMERA again. There is a look of horror on his face now. He 
               walks on, CAMERA AHEAD OF HIM again. Still his steps make no 
               sound.

                                     NEFF'S VOICE
                         That was all there was to it. Nothing 
                         had slipped, nothing had been 
                         overlooked, there was nothing to 
                         give us away. And yet, Keyes, as I 
                         was walking down the street to the 
                         drug store, suddenly it came over me 
                         that everything would go wrong. It 
                         sounds crazy, Keyes, but it's true, 
                         so help me: I couldn't hear my own 
                         footsteps. It was the walk of a dead 
                         man.

                                                                  FADE OUT:

               C-1 NEFF'S OFFICE - NIGHT

               Neff sits before the dictaphone. There are four cylinders on 
               end on the desk next to him. He gets up from the swivel chair 
               with great effort and stands a moment unsteadily. The wound 
               in his shoulder is paining him. He is very weak as he slowly 
               crosses to the water cooler. He takes the blood stained 
               handkerchief from inside his shirt and soaks it with fresh 
               water.

               The office door opens behind him. He turns, hiding the 
               handkerchief behind his back. In the doorway stands the 
               colored man who has been cleaning up downstairs. He is 
               carrying his big trash box by a rope handle.

                                     COLORED MAN
                         Didn't know anybody was here, Mr. 
                         Neff. We ain't cleaned your office 
                         yet.

                                     NEFF
                         Let it go tonight. I'm busy.

                                     COLORED MAN
                         Whatever you say, Mr. Neff.

               He closes the door slowly, staring at Neff with an uneasy 
               expression. Neff puts the soaked handkerchief back on his 
               wounded shoulder, then walks heavily over to his swivel chair 
               and lowers himself into it. He takes the dictaphone horn and 
               speaks into it again.

                                     NEFF
                         That was the longest night I ever 
                         lived through, Keyes, and the next 
                         day was worse, when the story broke 
                         in the papers, and they were talking 
                         about it at the office, and the day 
                         after that when you started digging 
                         into it. I kept my hands in my pockets 
                         because I thought they were shaking, 
                         and I put on dark glasses so people 
                         couldn't see my eyes, and then I 
                         took them off again so people wouldn't 
                         get to wondering why I wore them. I 
                         was trying to hold myself together, 
                         but I could feel my nerves pulling 
                         me to pieces....

               C-2 INSURANCE OFFICE - TWELFTH FLOOR - DAY

               Neff comes through the reception room doors with his hat on 
               and his briefcase under his arm. He walks towards his office, 
               but half way there he runs into Keyes. Keyes is wearing his 
               vest and hat, no coat. He is carrying a file of papers and 
               smoking a cigar.

                                     KEYES
                         Come on, Walter. The big boss wants 
                         to see us.

                                     NEFF
                         Okay.

               He turns and walks beside Keyes, CAMERA AHEAD of them

                                     NEFF
                         That Dietrichson case?

                                     KEYES
                         Must be.

                                     NEFF
                         Anything wrong?

                                     KEYES
                         The guy's dead, we had him insured 
                         and it's going to cost us money. 
                         That's always wrong.

               He stops by a majolica jar full of sand and takes a pencil 
               from his vest. He stands over the jar extinguishing his cigar 
               carefully so as not to damage it.

                                     NEFF
                         What have you got so far?

                                     KEYES
                         Autopsy report. No heart failure, no 
                         apoplexy, no predisposing medical 
                         cause of any kind. He died of a broken 
                         neck.

                                     NEFF
                         When is the inquest?

                                     KEYES
                         They had it this morning. His wife 
                         and daughter made the identification. 
                         The train people and some passengers 
                         told how he went through to the 
                         observation car.. It was all over in 
                         forty-five minutes. Verdict, 
                         accidental death.

               Keyes puts the half-smoked cigar into his vest pocket with 
               the pencil. They move on.

                                     NEFF
                         What do the police figure?

                                     KEYES
                         That he got tangled up in his crutches 
                         and fell off the train. They're 
                         satisfied. It's not their dough.

               They stop at a door lettered in embossed chromium letters: 
               EDWARD S. NORTON, JR. PRESIDENT. Keyes opens the door. They 
               go in.

               C-3 INT. RECEPTION ROOM - MR. NORTON'S OFFICE

               A secretary sitting behind a desk. As Keyes and Neff enter, 
               the door to Norton's private office is opened. From inside, 
               Mr. Norton is letting out three legal looking gentlemen. 
               Norton is about forty-five, very well groomed, rather pompous 
               in manner.

                                     NORTON

                              leaving)
                         I believe the legal position is now 
                         clear, gentlemen. Please stand by. I 
                         may need you later.

               He sees Keyes and Neff.

                                     NORTON
                         Come in, Mr. Keyes. You too, Mr. 
                         Neff.

               Neff has put down his hat and briefcase. He and Keyes pass 
               the legal looking men and follow Norton into his office.

               C-4 INT. NORTON'S OFFICE

               Naturally it is the best office in the building; modern but 
               not modernistic, spacious, very well furnished; flowers, 
               smoking stands, easy chairs, etc. Norton has gone behind his 
               desk. Keyes has come in, and Neff after him closes the door 
               quietly. Norton looks disapprovingly at Keyes' shirt sleeves.

                                     NORTON
                         You find this an uncomfortably warm 
                         day Mr. Keyes?

               Keyes takes his hat off but holds it in his hands.

                                     KEYES
                         Sorry, Mr. Norton. I didn't know 
                         this was formal.

               Norton smiles frostily.

                                     NORTON
                         Sit down, gentlemen.
                              (To Keyes)
                         Any new developments?

               Keyes and Neff sit down, Norton remains standing.

                                     KEYES
                         I just talked to this Jackson long 
                         distance. Up in Medford, Oregon.

                                     NORTON
                         Who's Jackson?

                                     KEYES
                         The last guy that saw Dietrichson 
                         alive. They were out on the 
                         observation platform together talking. 
                         Dietrichson wanted a cigar and Jackson 
                         went to get Dietrichson's cigar case 
                         for him. When he came back to the 
                         observation platform, no Dietrichson. 
                         Jackson didn't think anything was 
                         wrong until a wire caught up with 
                         the train at Santa Barbara. They had 
                         found Dietrichson's body on the tracks 
                         near Burbank.

                                     NORTON
                         Very interesting, about the cigar 
                         case.

               He walks up and down behind his desk thinking hard.

                                     NORTON
                         Anything else?

                                     KEYES
                         Not much. Dietrichson's secretary 
                         says she didn't know anything about 
                         the policy. There is a daughter, but 
                         all she remembers is Neff talking to 
                         her father about accident insurance 
                         at their house one night.

                                     NEFF
                         I couldn't sell him at first. Mrs. 
                         Dietrichson opposed it. He told me 
                         he'd think it over. Later on I went 
                         down to the oil fields and closed 
                         him. He signed the application and 
                         gave me his check.

                                     NORTON
                              (Dripping with sarcasm)
                         A fine piece of salesmanship that 
                         was, Mr. Neff.

                                     KEYES
                         There's no sense in pushing Neff 
                         around. He's got the best sales record 
                         in the office. Are your salesmen 
                         supposed to know that the customer 
                         is going to fall off a train?

                                     NORTON
                         Fall off a train? Are we sure 
                         Dietrichson fell off the train?

               There is a charged pause.

                                     KEYES
                         I don't get it.

                                     NORTON
                         You don't, Mr. Keyes? Then what do 
                         you think of this case? This policy 
                         might cost us a great deal of money. 
                         As you know, it contains a double 
                         indemnity clause. Just what is your 
                         opinion?

                                     KEYES
                         No opinion at all.

                                     NORTON
                         Not even a hunch? One of those 
                         interesting little hunches of yours?

                                     KEYES
                         Nope. Not even a hunch.

                                     NORTON
                         I'm surprised, Mr. Keyes. I've formed 
                         a very definite opinion. I think I 
                         know -- in fact I know I know what 
                         happened to Dietrichson.

                                     KEYES
                         You know you know what?

                                     NORTON
                         I know it was not an accident.

               He looks from Keyes to Neff and back to Keyes.

                                     NORTON
                         What do you say to that?

                                     KEYES
                         Me? You've got the ball. Let's see 
                         you run with it.

                                     NORTON
                         There's a widespread feeling that 
                         just because a man has a large office --

               The dictograph on his desk buzzes. He reaches over and 
               depresses a key and puts the earpiece to his ear.

                                     NORTON
                              (Into dictograph)
                         Yes?... Have her come in, please.

               He replaces the earpiece. He turns back to Keyes and Neff.

                                     NORTON
                         -- that just because a man has a 
                         large office he must be an idiot. 
                         I'm having a visitor, if you don't 
                         mind.

               Keyes and Neff start to get up.

                                     NORTON
                         No, no. I want you to stay and watch 
                         me handle this.

               The secretary has opened the door.

                                     SECRETARY
                         Mrs. Dietrichson.

               Neff stands staring at the door. He relaxes with an obvious 
               effort of will. Phyllis comes in. She wears a gray tailored 
               suit, small black hat with a veil, black gloves, and carries 
               a black bag. The secretary closes the door behind her. Mr. 
               Norton goes to meet her.

                                     NORTON
                         Thank you very much for coming, Mrs. 
                         Dietrichson. I assure you I appreciate 
                         it.

               He turns a little towards Keyes.

                                     NORTON
                         This is Mr. Keyes.

                                     KEYES
                         How do you do.

                                     PHYLLIS
                         How do you do.

                                     NORTON
                         And Mr. Neff.

                                     PHYLLIS
                         I've met Mr. Neff. How do you do.

               Norton has placed a chair. Phyllis sits. Norton goes behind 
               his desk.

                                     NORTON
                         Mrs. Dietrichson, I assure you of 
                         our sympathy in your bereavement. I 
                         hesitated before asking you to come 
                         here so soon after your loss.

               Phyllis nods silently.

                                     NORTON
                         But now that you're here I hope you 
                         won't mind if I plunge straight into 
                         business. You know why we asked you 
                         to come, don't you?

                                     PHYLLIS
                         No. All I know is that your secretary 
                         made it sound very urgent.

               Keyes sits quietly in his chair with his legs crossed. He 
               has hung his hat on his foot and thrust his thumbs in the 
               armholes of his vest. He looks a little bored. Neff, behind 
               him, stands leaning against the false mantel, completely 
               dead-pan.

                                     NORTON
                         Your husband had an accident policy 
                         with this company. Evidently you 
                         don't know that, Mrs. Dietrichson.

                                     PHYLLIS
                         No. I remember some talk at the house --

               She looks towards Neff.

                                     PHYLLIS
                         -- but he didn't seem to want it.

                                     NEFF
                         He took it out a few days later, 
                         Mrs. Dietrichson.

                                     PHYLLIS
                         I see.

                                     NORTON
                         You'll probably find the policy among 
                         his personal effects.

                                     PHYLLIS
                         His safe deposit box hasn't been 
                         opened yet. It seems a tax examiner 
                         has to be present.

                                     NORTON
                         Please, Mrs. Dietrichson, I don't 
                         want you to think you are being 
                         subjected to any questioning. But 
                         there are a few things we should 
                         like to know.

                                     PHYLLIS
                         What sort of things?

                                     NORTON
                         We have the report of the coroner's 
                         inquest. Accidental death. We are 
                         not entirely satisfied. In fact we 
                         are not satisfied at all.

               Phyllis looks at him coolly.

               Keyes looks vaguely interested.

               Neff is staring straight at Phyllis.

                                     NORTON
                         Frankly, Mrs. Dietrichson, we suspect 
                         suicide.

               Phyllis doesn't bat an eyelash.

                                     NORTON
                         I'm sorry. Would you like a glass of 
                         water?

                                     PHYLLIS
                         Please.

                                     NORTON
                         Mr. Neff.

               He indicates a thermos on a stand near Neff. Neff pours a 
               glass of water and carries it over to Phyllis. She has lifted 
               her veil a little. She takes the glass from his hand.

                                     PHYLLIS
                         Thank you.

               Their eyes meet for a fraction of a second.

                                     NORTON
                         Had your husband been moody or 
                         depressed lately, Mrs. Dietrichson? 
                         Did he seem to have financial worries, 
                         for instance?

                                     PHYLLIS
                         He was perfectly all right and I 
                         don't know of any financial worries.

                                     NORTON
                         There must have been something, Mrs. 
                         Dietrichson. Let us examine this so-
                         called accident. First, your husband 
                         takes out this policy in absolute 
                         secrecy. Why? Because he doesn't 
                         want his family to suspect what he 
                         intends to do.

                         Do what?

                                     NORTON
                         Commit suicide. Next, he goes on 
                         this trip entirely alone. He has to 
                         be alone. He hobbles all the way out 
                         to the observation platform, very 
                         unlikely with his leg in a cast, 
                         unless he has a very strong reason. 
                         Once there, he finds he is not alone. 
                         There is a man there. What was his 
                         name, Keyes?

               Norton flips his fingers impatiently at Keyes who doesn't 
               even bother to look up.

                                     KEYES
                         His name was Jackson. Probably still 
                         is.

                                     NORTON
                         Jackson. So your husband gets rid of 
                         this Jackson with some flimsy excuse 
                         about cigars. And then he is alone. 
                         And then he does it. He jumps. 
                         Suicide. In which case the company 
                         is not liable.
                              (Pause)
                         You know that, of course. We could 
                         go to court --

                                     PHYLLIS
                         I don't know anything. In fact I 
                         don't know why I came here.

               She makes as if to rise indignantly.

                                     NORTON
                         Just a moment, please. I said we 
                         could go to court. I didn't say we 
                         want to. Not only is it against our 
                         practice, but it would involve a 
                         great deal of expense, a lot of 
                         lawyers, a lot of time, perhaps years.

               Phyllis rises coldly.

                                     NORTON
                         So what I want to suggest is a 
                         compromise on both sides. A settlement 
                         for a certain sum, a part of the 
                         policy value --

                                     PHYLLIS
                         Don't bother, Mr. Norton. When I 
                         came in here I had no idea you owed 
                         me any money. You told me you did. 
                         Then you told me you didn't. Now you 
                         tell me you want to pay me a part of 
                         it, whatever it is. You want to 
                         bargain with me, at a time like this. 
                         I don't like your insinuations about 
                         my husband, Mr. Norton, and I don't 
                         like your methods. In fact I don't 
                         like you, Mr. Norton. Goodbye, 
                         gentlemen.

               She turns and walks out. The door closes after her. There is 
               a pregnant pause. Keyes straightens up in his chair.

                                     KEYES
                         Nice going, Mr. Norton. You sure 
                         carried that ball.

               Norton pours himself a glass of water and stands holding it.

                                     KEYES
                         Only you fumbled on the goal line. 
                         Then you heaved an illegal forward 
                         pass and got thrown for a forty-yard 
                         loss. Now you can't pick yourself up 
                         because you haven't got a leg to 
                         stand on.

                                     NORTON
                         I haven't eh? Let her claim. Let her 
                         sue. We can prove it was suicide.

               Keyes stands up.

                                     KEYES
                         Can we? Mr. Norton, the first thing 
                         that hit me was that suicide angle. 
                         Only I dropped it in the wastepaper 
                         basket just three seconds later. You 
                         ought to take a look at the statistics 
                         on suicide sometime. You might learn 
                         a little something about the insurance 
                         business.

                                     NORTON
                         I was raised in the insurance 
                         business, Mr. Keyes.

                                     KEYES
                         Yeah. In the front office. Come on, 
                         you never read an actuarial table in 
                         your life. I've got ten volumes on 
                         suicide alone. Suicide by race, by 
                         color, by occupation, by sex, by 
                         seasons of the year, by time of day. 
                         Suicide, how committed: by poisons, 
                         by fire-arms, by drowning, by leaps. 
                         Suicide by poison, subdivided by 
                         types of poison, such as corrosive, 
                         irritant, systemic, gaseous, narcotic, 
                         alkaloid, protein, and so forth. 
                         Suicide by leaps, subdivided by leaps 
                         from high places, under wheels of 
                         trains, under wheels of trucks, under 
                         the feet of horses, from steamboats. 
                         But Mr. Norton, of all the cases on 
                         record there's not one single case 
                         of suicide by leap from the rear end 
                         of a moving train. And do you know 
                         how fast that train was going at the 
                         point where the body was found? 
                         Fifteen miles an hour. Now how could 
                         anybody jump off a slow moving train 
                         like that with any kind of expectation 
                         that he would kill himself? No soap, 
                         Mr. Norton. We're sunk, and we're 
                         going to pay through the nose, and 
                         you know it. May I have this?

               Keyes' throat is dry after the long speech. He grabs the 
               glass of water out of Norton's hand and drains it in one big 
               gulp.

               Norton is watching him almost stupefied. Neff stands with 
               the shadow of a smile on his face. Keyes puts the glass down 
               noisily on Norton's desk.

                                     KEYES
                         Come on, Walter.

               Norton doesn't move or speak. Keyes puts his hat on and 
               crosses towards the door, Neff after him. With the doorknob 
               in his hand Keyes turns back to Norton with a glance down at 
               his own shirt sleeves.

                                     KEYES
                         Next time I'll rent a tuxedo.

               They go out.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               C-5 NEFF - AT DICTAPHONE - (NIGHT)

               There is a tired grin on his face as he talks into the horn.

                                     NEFF
                         I could have hugged you right then 
                         and there, Keyes, you and your 
                         statistics. You were the only one we 
                         were really scared of, and instead 
                         you were almost playing on our team...

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               C-6 NEFF'S APARTMENT - EVENING - ALMOST DARK IN THE ROOM

               The corridor door opens letting light in. Neff enters with 
               his hat on and his briefcase under his arm. He switches the 
               lights on, closes the door, puts the lights on, closes the 
               door, puts the key in his pocket. At this moment the telephone 
               rings. He picks up the phone.

                                     NEFF'S VOICE
                         That evening when I got home my nerves 
                         had eased off. I could feel the ground 
                         under my feet again, and it looked 
                         like easy going from there on it.

                                     NEFF
                         Hello... Hello, baby.... Sure, 
                         everything is fine... You were 
                         wonderful in Norton's office.

               C-7 INT. TELEPHONE BOOTH IN A DRUG STORE

               Phyllis is on the phone. She is not dressed as in Norton's 
               office.

                                     PHYLLIS
                         I felt so funny. I wanted to look at 
                         you all the time.

               C-8 NEFF ON TELEPHONE IN HIS APARTMENT

                                     NEFF
                         How do you think I felt? Where are 
                         you, baby?

               C-9 PHYLLIS ON PHONE

                                     PHYLLIS
                         At the drug store. Just a block away. 
                         Can I come up?

               C-10 NEFF'S APARTMENT - (NIGHT) - NEFF ON PHONE

                                     NEFF
                         Okay. But be careful. Don't let 
                         anybody see you.

               He hangs up, takes off his hat and drops hat and briefcase 
               on the davenport. He looks around the room and crosses to 
               lower the venetian blinds and draw the curtains. He gathers 
               up the morning paper which is lying untidily on the floor 
               and puts it in the waste-paper basket.

               The door bell rings.

               Neff stops in sudden alarm. It can't be Phyllis. The time is 
               too short. For a second he stands there motionless, then 
               crosses to the door and opens it.

               In the open door stands Keyes.

                                     NEFF
                         Hello, Keyes.

               Keyes walks past him into the room. His hands are clasped 
               behind his back. There is a strange, absent-minded look in 
               his eyes. Neff closes the door without taking his eyes off 
               Keyes.

                                     NEFF
                         What's on your mind?

               Keyes stops in the middle of the room and turns.

                                     KEYES
                         That broken leg. The guy broke his 
                         leg.

                                     NEFF
                         What are you talking about?

                                     KEYES
                         Talking about Dietrichson. He had 
                         accident insurance, didn't he? Then 
                         he broke his leg, didn't he?

                                     NEFF
                         So what?

                                     KEYES
                         And he didn't put in a claim. Why 
                         didn't he put in a claim? Why?

                                     NEFF
                         What the dickens are you driving at?

                                     KEYES
                         Walter. There's something wrong. I 
                         ate dinner two hours ago. It stuck 
                         half way.

               He prods his stomach with his thumb.

                                     KEYES
                         The little man is acting up again. 
                         Because there's something wrong with 
                         that Dietrichson case.

                                     NEFF
                         Because he didn't put in a claim? 
                         Maybe he just didn't have time.

                                     KEYES
                         Oh maybe he just didn't know he was 
                         insured.

               He has stopped in front of Neff. They look at each other for 
               a tense moment. Neff hardly breathes.

               Keyes shakes his head suddenly.

                                     KEYES
                         No. That couldn't be it. You delivered 
                         the policy to him personally, didn't 
                         you, Walter? And you got his check.

                                     NEFF
                              (Stiff-lipped, but 
                              his voice is as well 
                              under control as he 
                              can manage)
                         Sure, I did.

               Keyes prods his stomach again.

                                     KEYES
                         Got any bicarbonate of soda?

                                     NEFF
                         No I haven't.

               Keyes resumes his pacing.

                                     KEYES
                         Listen, Walter. I've been living 
                         with this little man for twenty-six 
                         years. He's never failed me yet. 
                         There's got to be something wrong.

                                     NEFF
                         Maybe Norton was right. Maybe it was 
                         suicide, Keyes.

                                     KEYES
                         No. Not suicide.
                              (Pause)
                         But not accident either.

                                     NEFF
                         What else?

               There is another longer pause, agonizing for Neff. Finally 
               Keyes continues:

                                     KEYES
                         Look. A man takes out an accident 
                         policy that is worth a hundred 
                         thousand dollars if he is killed on 
                         a train. Then, two weeks later, he 
                         is killed on a train. And not in a 
                         train accident, mind you, but falling 
                         off some silly observation car. Do 
                         you know what the mathematical 
                         probability of that is, Walter? One 
                         out of I don't know how many billions. 
                         And add to that the broken leg. It 
                         just can't be the way it looks, 
                         Walter. Something has been worked on 
                         us.

                                     NEFF
                         Such as what?

               Keyes doesn't answer. He goes on pacing up and down. Finally 
               Neff can't stand the silence any longer.

                                     NEFF
                         Murder?

                                     KEYES
                              (Prods stomach again)
                         Don't you have any peppermint or 
                         anything?

                                     NEFF
                         I'm sorry.
                              (Pause)
                         Who do you suspect?

                                     KEYES
                         Maybe I like to make things easy for 
                         myself. But I always tend to suspect 
                         the beneficiary.

                                     NEFF
                         The wife?

                                     KEYES
                         Yeah. That wide-eyed dame that didn't 
                         know anything about anything.

                                     NEFF
                         You're crazy, Keyes. She wasn't even 
                         on the train.

                                     KEYES
                         I know she wasn't, Walter. I don't 
                         claim to know how it was worked, or 
                         who worked it, but I know that it 
                         was worked.

               He crosses to the corridor door.

                                     KEYES
                         I've got to get to a drug store. It 
                         feels like a hunk of concrete inside 
                         me.

               He puts his hand on the knob to open the door.

               C-11 CORRIDOR - APARTMENT HOUSE - NIGHT - LIGHTS ON

               The hallway is empty except for Phyllis who has been standing 
               close to the door of Neff's apartment, listening. The door 
               has just started to open. Phyllis moves away quickly and 
               flattens herself against the wall behind the opening door. 
               Keyes is coming out.

                                     KEYES
                         Good night, Walter.

               Neff, behind him, looks anxiously down the hallway for 
               Phyllis. Suddenly his eye catches a glimpse of her through 
               the crack of the partly opened door. He pushes the door wide 
               so as to hide her from Keyes.

                                     NEFF
                         Good night, Keyes.

                                     KEYES
                         See you at the office in the morning.

               He has reached the elevator. He pushes the call button and 
               turns.

                                     KEYES
                         But I'd like to move in on her right 
                         now, tonight, if it wasn't for Norton 
                         and his stripe-pants ideas about 
                         company policy. I'd have the cops 
                         after her so quick her head would 
                         spin. They'd put her through the 
                         wringer, and, brother, what they 
                         would squeeze out.

                                     NEFF
                         Only you haven't got a single thing 
                         to go on, Keyes.

               The elevator has come up and stopped.

                                     KEYES
                         Not too much. Twenty-six years 
                         experience, all the percentage there 
                         is, and this lump of concrete in my 
                         stomach.

               He pulls back the elevator door and turns to Neff with one 
               last glance of annoyance.

                                     KEYES
                              (Almost angrily)
                         No bicarbonate of soda.

               Keyes gets into the elevator. The door closes. The elevator 
               goes down.

               Neff stands numb, looking at the spot where Keyes was last 
               visible. Without moving his eyes he pulls the door around 
               towards him with his left hand. Phyllis slowly comes out.

               Neff motions quickly to her to go into the apartment. She 
               crosses in front of him and enters. He steps in backwards 
               after her.

               C-12 INT. NEFF'S APARTMENT

               Phyllis has come a few steps into the room. Neff, backing in 
               after her, closes the door from inside and turns slowly. 
               They look at each other for a long moment in complete silence.

                                     PHYLLIS
                         How much does he know?

                                     NEFF
                         It's not what he knows. It's those 
                         stinking hunches of his.

                                     PHYLLIS
                         But he can't prove anything, can he?

                                     NEFF
                         Not if we're careful. Not if we don't 
                         see each other for a while.

                                     PHYLLIS
                         For how long a while?

               She moves toward him but he does not respond.

                                     NEFF
                         Until all this dies down. You don't 
                         know Keyes the way I do. Once he 
                         gets his teeth into something he 
                         won't let go. He'll investigate you. 
                         He'll have you shadowed. He'll watch 
                         you every minute from now on. Are 
                         you afraid, baby?

                                     PHYLLIS
                         Yes, I'm afraid. But not of Keyes. 
                         I'm afraid of us. We're not the same 
                         any more. We did it so we could be 
                         together, but instead of that it's 
                         pulling us apart. Isn't it, Walter?

                                     NEFF
                         What are you talking about?

                                     PHYLLIS
                         And you don't really care whether we 
                         see each other or not.

                                     NEFF
                         Shut up, baby.

               He pulls her close and kisses her.

                                                                  FADE OUT:

                                       SEQUENCE "D"

               FADE IN:

               D-1 INSURANCE OFFICE - TWELFTH FLOOR - ANTEROOM - (DAY)

               Two telephone operators and a receptionist are at work. 
               Several visitors are waiting in chairs. Lola Dietrichson is 
               one of them. She's wearing a simple black suit and hat, 
               indicating mourning. Her fingers nervously pick at a 
               handkerchief and her eyes are watching the elevator doors 
               anxiously.

               (Now and then the telephone operators in the background are 
               heard saying, "PACIFIC ALL-RISK. GOOD AFTERNOON.")

               The elevator comes up and the doors open. Several people 
               come out, among them Neff, carrying his briefcase. Lola sees 
               him and stands up, and as he is about to pass through the 
               anteroom without recognizing her she stops him.

                                     LOLA
                         Hello, Mr. Neff.

               Neff looks at her a little startled.

                                     NEFF
                         Hello.

               His voice hangs in the air.

                                     LOLA
                         Lola Dietrichson. Don't you remember 
                         me?

                                     NEFF
                              (On his guard)
                         Yes. Of course.

                                     LOLA
                         Could I talk to you, just for a few 
                         minutes? Somewhere where we can be 
                         alone?

                                     NEFF
                         Sure. Come on into my office.

               He pushes the swing door open and holds it for her. As she 
               passes in front of him his eyes narrow in uneasy speculation.

               D-2 TWELFTH FLOOR - BALCONY

               Neff comes up level with Lola and leads her towards his 
               office, CAMERA WITH THEM.

                                     NEFF
                         Is it something to do with -- what 
                         happened?

                                     LOLA
                         Yes, Mr. Neff. It's about my father's 
                         death.

                                     NEFF
                         I'm terribly sorry, Miss Dietrichson.

               He opens the door of his office and holds it for her. She 
               enters.

               D-3 INT. NEFF'S OFFICE - (DAY)

               Lou Schwartz, one of the other salesmen, is working at his 
               desk. Lola enters, Neff after her.

                                     NEFF
                              (To Schwartz)
                         Lou, do you mind if I use the office 
                         alone for a few minutes?

                                     SCHWARTZ
                         It's all yours, Walter.

               He gets up and goes out. Lola has walked over to the window 
               and is looking out so Schwartz won't stare at her. Neff places 
               a chair beside his desk.

                                     NEFF
                         Won't you sit down?

               At the sound of the closing door she turns and speaks with a 
               catch in her voice.

                                     LOLA
                         Mr. Neff, I can't help it, but I 
                         have such a strange feeling that 
                         there is something queer about my 
                         father's death.

                                     NEFF
                         Queer? Queer in what way?

                                     LOLA
                         I don't know why I should be bothering 
                         you with my troubles, except that 
                         you knew my father and knew about 
                         the insurance he took out. And you 
                         were so nice to me that evening in 
                         your car.

                         Sure. We got along fine, didn't we.

               He sits down. His face is grim and watchful.

                         Look at me, Mr. Neff. I'm not crazy. 
                         I'm not hysterical. I'm not even 
                         crying. But I have the awful feeling 
                         that something is wrong, and I had 
                         the same feeling once before -- when 
                         my mother died.

                         When your mother died?

                                     LOLA
                         We were up at Lake Arrowhead. That 
                         was six years ago. We had a cabin 
                         there. It was winter and very cold 
                         and my mother was very sick with 
                         pneumonia. She had a nurse with her. 
                         There were just the three of us in 
                         the cabin. One night I got up and 
                         went into my mother's room. She was 
                         delirious with fever. All the bed 
                         covers were on the floor and the 
                         windows were wide open. The nurse 
                         wasn't in the room. I ran and covered 
                         my mother up as quickly as I could. 
                         Just then I heard a door open behind 
                         me. The nurse stood there. She didn't 
                         say a word, but there was a look in 
                         her eyes I'll never forget. Two days 
                         later my mother was dead.
                              (Pause)
                         Do you know who that nurse was?

               Neff stares at her tensely. He knows only too well who the 
               nurse was.

                         Phyllis. I tried to tell my father, 
                         but I was just a kid then and he 
                         wouldn't listen to me. Six months 
                         later she married him and I kind of 
                         talked myself out of the idea that 
                         she could have done anything like 
                         that. But now it's all back again, 
                         now that something has happened to 
                         my father, too.

                         You're not making sense, Miss 
                         Dietrichson. Your father fell off a 
                         train.

                         Yes, and two days before he fell off 
                         that train what was Phyllis doing? 
                         She was in her room in front of a 
                         mirror, with a black hat on, and she 
                         was pinning a black veil to it, as 
                         if she couldn't wait to see how she 
                         would look in mourning.

                         I caught her eyes in the mirror, and 
                         they had that look in them they had 
                         before my mother died. That same 
                         look.

                         not going to pay her, are you, Mr.

                         with it this time. I'm going to speak 
                         up. I'm going to tell everything I 
                         know.

               She turns again to the window so he won't see that she is 
               crying. Neff gets up and goes to her.

                         Street where nobody would see us. I

               Neff and Lola driving along the beach near Santa Monica. 
               Neff is wearing a light summer suit, very much in contrast 
               to Lola's mourning. Apparently she is telling him a story 
               and now and then she laughs, but there is no sound.

               CAMERA MOVES PAST HER TO A: CLOSE SHOT OF NEFF behind the 
               steering wheel. He is only half listening to Lola. His mind 
               is full of other thoughts.

                         Next day was Sunday and we went for 
                         a ride down to the beach. She had 
                         loosened up a bit and she was even 
                         laughing... I had to make sure she 
                         wouldn't tell that stuff about Phyllis 
                         to anybody else. It was dynamite, 
                         whether it was true or not. And I 
                         had no chance to talk to Phyllis. 
                         You were watching her like a hawk, 
                         Keyes. I couldn't even phone her for 
                         fear you had the wires tapped.

               D-6 INSURANCE OFFICE - 12TH FLOOR - DAY

               Neff, with his hat on and no briefcase, is walking toward 
               Keyes' office. As he comes up close to the door, he stops 
               with a startled expression on his face. On a chair beside 
               the door sits a familiar figure. He is Jackson, the man from 
               the observation platform of the train. He is wearing his 
               Stetson hat and smoking a cigar. He is studying something in 
               the file folder. Neff recognizes him immediately but Jackson 
               does not look up. Neff controls his expression and goes on 
               to open the door to Keyes' office.

                         Monday morning there was a note on 
                         my desk that you wanted to see me, 
                         Keyes. For a minute I wondered if it 
                         could be about Lola. It was worse. 
                         Outside your door was the last guy 
                         in the world I wanted to see.

               D-7 INT. KEYES' OFFICE

               Neff is just closing the door from the inside. Keyes, his 
               coat off, is lying on his office couch, chewing on a cigar, 
               as usual.

                                     KEYES
                         Come in. Come in, Walter. I want to 
                         ask you something. After all the 
                         years we've known each other, do you 
                         mind if I make a rather blunt 
                         statement?

                                     NEFF

                         About me. Walter, I'm a very great 
                         man. This Dietrichson business. It's 
                         murder, and murders don't come any 
                         neater. As fancy a piece of homicide 
                         as anybody ever ran into. Smart and 
                         tricky and almost perfect, but --

               Keyes bounces off the couch like a rubber ball.

                                     KEYES
                         but, I think Papa has it all figured 
                         out, figured out and wrapped up in 
                         tissue paper with pink ribbons on 
                         it.

                         I'm listening.

               Keyes levels a finger at him.

                                     KEYES
                         You know what? That guy Dietrichson 
                         was never on the train.

                                     NEFF
                         He wasn't?

                                     KEYES
                         No, he wasn't, Walter. Look, you 
                         can't be sure of killing a man by 
                         throwing him off a train that's going 
                         fifteen miles an hour. The only way 
                         you can be sure is to kill him first 
                         and then throw his body on the tracks. 
                         That would mean either killing him 
                         on the train, or -- and this is where 
                         it really gets fancy -- you kill him 
                         somewhere else and put him on the 
                         tracks. Two possibilities, and I 
                         personally buy the second.

                                     NEFF
                         You're way ahead of me, Keyes.

                                     KEYES
                         Look, it was like this. They killed 
                         the guy -- the wife and somebody 
                         else -- and then the somebody else 
                         took the crutches and went on the 
                         train as Dietrichson, and then the 
                         somebody else jumped off, and then 
                         they put the body on the tracks where 
                         the train had passed. An 
                         impersonation, see. And a cinch to 
                         work. Because it was night, very few 
                         people were about, they had the 
                         crutches to stare at, and they never 
                         really looked at the man at all.

                         It's fancy all right, Keyes. Maybe 
                         it's a little too fancy.

                         Is it? I tell you it fits together 
                         like a watch. And now let's see what 
                         we have in the way of proof. The 
                         only guy that really got a good look 
                         at this supposed Dietrichson is 
                         sitting right outside my office. I 
                         took the trouble to bring him down 
                         here from Oregon. Let's see what he 
                         has to say.

               Keyes goes to the door and opens it.

                                     KEYES
                         Come in, Mr. Jackson.

               Jackson enters with the file folder.

                                     JACKSON
                         Yes sir, Mr. Keyes. These are fine 
                         cigars you smoke.

               He indicates the cigar he himself is smoking.

                                     KEYES
                         Two for a quarter.

                                     JACKSON
                         That's what I said.

                                     KEYES
                         Never mind the cigar, Jackson. Did 
                         you study those photographs? What do 
                         you say?

                                     JACKSON
                         Yes, indeed, I studied them 
                         thoroughly. Very thoroughly

                                     KEYES
                         Well? Did you make up your mind?

                                     JACKSON
                         Mr. Keyes, I'm a Medford man. Medford, 
                         Oregon. Up in Medford we take our 
                         time making up our minds --

                                     KEYES
                         Well you're not in Medford now. I'm 
                         in a hurry. Let's have it.

               Jackson indicates the file folder he is holding.

                                     JACKSON
                         Are these photographs of the late 
                         Mr. Dietrichson?

                                     KEYES
                         Yes.

                                     JACKSON
                         Then my answer is no.

                                     KEYES
                         What do you mean no?

                                     JACKSON
                         I mean this is not the man that was 
                         on the train.

                                     KEYES
                         Will you swear to that?

                                     JACKSON
                         I'm a Medford man. Medford, Oregon. 
                         And if I say it, I mean it, and if I 
                         mean it, of course I'll swear it.

                                     KEYES
                         Thank you.

               Keyes turns to Neff.

                                     KEYES
                         There you are, Walter. There's your 
                         proof.

               Keyes remembers he forgot to introduce Jackson.

                                     KEYES
                         Oh, Mr. Jackson, this is Mr. Neff, 
                         one of our salesmen.

                                     JACKSON
                         Please to meet you, Mr. Neff. Pleased 
                         indeed.

                                     NEFF
                         How do you do.

                                     JACKSON
                         Very fine, thank you. Never was 
                         better.

                                     KEYES
                         Mr. Jackson, how would you describe 
                         the man you saw on that observation 
                         platform?

                                     JACKSON
                         Well, I'm pretty sure he was a younger 
                         man, about ten or fifteen years 
                         younger than the man in these 
                         photographs.

                                     KEYES
                         Dietrichson was about fifty, wasn't 
                         he, Walter?

                                     NEFF
                         Fifty-one, according to the policy.

                                     JACKSON
                         The man I saw was nothing like fifty-
                         one years old. Of course, it was 
                         pretty dark on that platform and, 
                         come to think of it, he tried to 
                         keep his back towards me. But I'm 
                         positive just the same.

                                     KEYES
                         That's fine, Jackson. Now you 
                         understand this matter is strictly 
                         confidential. We may need you again 
                         down here in Los Angeles, if the 
                         case comes to court.

                                     JACKSON
                         Any time you need me, I'm at your 
                         entire disposal, gentlemen. Expenses 
                         paid, of course.

               Keyes picks up the telephone on his desk and speaks into it.

                                     KEYES
                         Get me Lubin, in the cashier's office.

               Meanwhile, Jackson crosses over to Neff and, during the 
               ensuing dialogue between him and Neff, we hear Keyes' low 
               voice on the phone in background. We do not hear what he 
               says.

                                     JACKSON
                              (To Neff)
                         Ever been in Medford, Mr. Neff?

                                     NEFF
                         Never.

                                     JACKSON
                         Wait a minute. Do you go trout 
                         fishing? Maybe I saw you up Klamath 
                         Falls way.

                                     NEFF
                         Nope. Never fish.

                                     JACKSON
                         Neff. Neff. I've got it! It's the 
                         name. There's a family of Neffs in 
                         Corvallis.

                                     NEFF
                         No relation.

                                     JACKSON
                         Let me see. This man's an automobile 
                         dealer in Corvallis. Very reputable 
                         man, too, I'm told.

               Keyes rejoins them at this point.

                                     KEYES
                         All right, Mr. Jackson. Suppose you 
                         go down to the cashier's office -- 
                         room twenty-seven on the eleventh 
                         floor. They'll take care of your 
                         expense account and your ticket for 
                         the train tonight.

                                     JACKSON
                         Tonight? Tomorrow morning would suit 
                         me better. There's a very good 
                         osteopath down here I want to see 
                         before I leave.

               Keyes has opened the door for Jackson.

                                     KEYES
                         Okay, Mr. Jackson. Just don't put 
                         her on the expense account.

               Jackson doesn't get it.

                                     JACKSON
                         Goodbye, gentlemen. A pleasure.

               He goes out.

                                     KEYES
                         There it is, Walter. It's beginning 
                         to come apart at the seams already. 
                         A murder's never perfect. It always 
                         comes apart sooner or later. And 
                         when two people are involved it's 
                         usually sooner. We know the 
                         Dietrichson dame is in it, and 
                         somebody else. Pretty soon we're 
                         going to know who that somebody else 
                         is. He'll show. He's got to show. 
                         Sometime, somewhere, they've got to 
                         meet. Their emotions are all kicked 
                         up. Whether it's love or hate doesn't 
                         matter. They can't keep away from 
                         each other. They think it's twice as 
                         safe because there are two of them. 
                         But it's not twice as safe. It's ten 
                         times twice as dangerous. They've 
                         committed a murder and that's not 
                         like taking a trolley ride together 
                         where each one can get off at a 
                         different stop. They're stuck with 
                         each other. They've got to ride all 
                         the way to the end of the line. And 
                         it's a one-way trip, and the last 
                         stop is the cemetery.

               He puts a cigar in his mouth and starts tapping his pockets 
               for matches.

                                     KEYES
                              (Continued)
                         She put in her claim and I'm going 
                         to throw it right back at her.
                              (Pats his pockets 
                              again)
                         Have you got one of those?

               Neff strikes a match for him. Keyes takes the match out of 
               his hand and lights his cigar.

                                     KEYES
                         Let her sue us if she dares. I'll be 
                         ready for her -- and that somebody 
                         else. They'll be digging their own 
                         graves.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               D-8 TELEPHONE BOOTH IN JERRY'S MARKET - DAY

               Neff is in the booth dialing a number, and as she waits he 
               looks around to make sure he is not watched.

                                     NEFF
                              (Into phone)
                         Mrs. Dietrichson?... This is Jerry's 
                         market. We just got in a shipment of 
                         that English soap you were asking 
                         about. Will you be coming by this 
                         morning?... Thank you, Mrs. 
                         Dietrichson.

               Neff hangs up.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               D-9 EXT. JERRY'S MARKET - DAY

               The LaSalle stops in front of the market. Phyllis steps out 
               and goes into the market, looking around.

               D-10 SHELVES IN THE REAR OF MARKET

               Neff is moving slowly along the shelves, outwardly calm but 
               with his nerves on edge. From beyond him Phyllis approaches. 
               She stops beside him, facing the same way, with a couple of 
               feet separating them.

                                     PHYLLIS
                         Hello, Walter.

                              (In a harsh whisper)
                         Come closer.

               Phyllis moves close to him.

                                     PHYLLIS
                         What's the matter?

                                     NEFF
                         Everything's the matter. Keyes is 
                         rejecting your claim. He's sitting 
                         back with his mouth watering, waiting 
                         for you to sue. He wants you to sue. 
                         But you're not going to.

                                     PHYLLIS
                         What's he got to stop me?

                                     NEFF
                         He's got the goods. He's figured out 
                         how it was worked. He knows it was 
                         somebody else on the train. He's dug 
                         up a witness he thinks will prove 
                         it.

                                     PHYLLIS
                         Prove it how? Listen, if he rejects 
                         that claim, I have to sue.

                                     NEFF
                         Yeah? And then you're in court and a 
                         lot of other things are going to 
                         come up. Like, for instance, about 
                         you and the first Mrs. Dietrichson.

               Phyllis looks at him sharply, sideways.

                                     PHYLLIS
                         What about me and the first Mrs. 
                         Dietrichson?

                                     NEFF
                         The way she died. And about that 
                         black hat you were trying on -- before 
                         you needed a black hat.

               A customer comes along the aisle toward them. They move apart. 
               The customer passes. Phyllis draws close again.

                                     PHYLLIS
                         Walter, Lola's been telling you some 
                         of her cockeyed stories. She's been 
                         seeing you.

                                     NEFF
                         I've been seeing her, if you want to 
                         know. So she won't yell her head off 
                         about what she knows.

                                     PHYLLIS
                         Yes, she's been putting on an act 
                         for you, crying all over your 
                         shoulder, that lying little --

                                     NEFF
                         Keep her out of it. All I'm telling 
                         you is we're not going to sue.

                                     PHYLLIS
                         Because you don't want the money any 
                         more, even if you could get it? 
                         Because she's made you feel like a 
                         heel all of sudden.

                                     NEFF
                         It isn't the money any more. It's 
                         our necks now. We're pulling out, 
                         understand.

                                     PHYLLIS
                         Because of what Keyes can do? You're 
                         not fooling me, Walter. It's because 
                         of Lola. What you did to her father. 
                         You can't take it that she might 
                         find out some day.

                                     NEFF
                         I said, leave her out of it.

                                     PHYLLIS
                         Walter, it's me I'm talking about. I 
                         don't want to be left out of it.

                                     NEFF
                         Stop saying that. It's just that it 
                         hasn't worked out the way we wanted. 
                         We can't have the money. We can't go 
                         through with it, that's all.

                                     PHYLLIS
                         We have gone through with it, Walter. 
                         The tough part is all behind us. We 
                         just have to hold on now and not go 
                         soft inside, and stick together, 
                         close, the way we started out.

               Phyllis takes his arm, forgetting where she is. He pulls 
               away.

                                     NEFF
                         Watch it, will you. Someone's coming.

               One of the market help, pushing a small hand-truck loaded 
               with packaged goods, comes along the aisle. He stops and 
               begins to restock a shelf very close to Neff and Phyllis. 
               They go off slowly in opposite directions. CAMERA PANS with 
               Neff as he walks toward another shelf, one that stands away 
               from the wall. Phyllis appears on the opposite side of the 
               shelf and stops, facing toward him. They now continue their 
               low-voiced dialogue through the piled-up merchandise.

                                     PHYLLIS
                         I loved you, Walter. And I hated 
                         him. But I wasn't going to do anything 
                         about it, not until I met you. It 
                         was you had the plan. I only wanted 
                         him dead.

                                     NEFF
                         Yeah, and I was the one that fixed 
                         him so he was dead. Is that what 
                         you're telling me?

               Phyllis takes off her dark glasses for the first time and 
               looks at him with cold, hard eyes.

                                     PHYLLIS
                         Yes. And nobody's pulling out. We 
                         went into it together, and we're 
                         coming out at the end together. It's 
                         straight down the line for both of 
                         us, remember.

               Phyllis puts the glasses on again and goes.

               Over Neff's face, as he looks after her, comes the COMMENTARY.

                                     NEFF'S VOICE
                         Yeah. I remembered all right. Just 
                         as I remembered what you had told 
                         me, Keyes, about that trolley car 
                         ride and how there was no way to get 
                         off -- until the end of the line.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               D-11 INT. NEFF'S OFFICE - (NIGHT)

               Neff is dictating into the dictaphone.

                                     NEFF
                         Yeah, I remembered it all right. 
                         Just as I remembered what you had 
                         told me, Keyes, about that trolley 
                         car ride, and how there was no way 
                         to get off until the end of the line, 
                         where the cemetery was. And I got to 
                         thinking what cemeteries are for. 
                         They're to put dead people in, I 
                         guess that was the first time I ever 
                         thought about Phyllis that way. Dead, 
                         I mean, and how things would be if 
                         she was dead. Because the way it was 
                         now she had me by the throat. She 
                         could hang me higher than a kite any 
                         day she felt like it. And there was 
                         nothing I could do, except hold my 
                         breath and watch that day come closer 
                         and closer, and maybe pray a little, 
                         if I still knew how to pray... I saw 
                         Lola three or four times that week. 
                         I guess it sounds crazy, Keyes, after 
                         what I had done, but it was only 
                         with her that I could relax and let 
                         go a little. Then one night we drove 
                         up into the hills above Hollywood 
                         Bowl...

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               D-12 HOLLYWOOD HILLS (NIGHT) (TRANSPARENCY)

               Neff and Lola are climbing over a low hill in the foreground. 
               The sky is starlit and music from the Bowl comes over the 
               scene from below (Cesar Franck D Minor Symphony). As he helps 
               her climb up, CAMERA PANS with them and shows the expanse of 
               the Bowl below, a packed audience, and the orchestra on the 
               lighted shell.

               They sit down on the grass. Neff sits near her, not too close. 
               It is very dark and they are silhouetted against the shell 
               lights. Neff puts a cigarette in his mouth and strikes a 
               match. The flame lights up Lola's face. Neff glances at her. 
               She is crying. He lights his cigarette and blows out the 
               match. A pause follows.

                                     NEFF
                         Why are you crying?

               Lola doesn't answer.

                                     NEFF
                         You won't tell me?

                                     LOLA
                              (In a choked voice)
                         Of course I will, Walter. I wouldn't 
                         tell anybody else but you. It's about 
                         Nino.

                                     NEFF
                         Zachetti? What about him?

                                     LOLA
                         They killed my father together. He 
                         and Phyllis. He helped her do it. I 
                         know he did.

                                     NEFF
                         What makes you say that?

                                     LOLA
                         I've been following him. He's at her 
                         house, night after night. It was 
                         Phyllis and him all the time. Maybe 
                         he was going with me just for a blind. 
                         And the night of the murder --

                                     NEFF
                         You promised not to talk that way 
                         any more.

                                     LOLA
                         -- he was supposed to pick me up 
                         after a lecture at U.C.L.A. -- but 
                         he never showed up. He said he was 
                         sick. Sick! He couldn't show up, 
                         because the train was leaving with 
                         my father on it.

               She begins to cry again.

                                     LOLA
                         Maybe I'm just crazy. Maybe it's all 
                         just in my mind.

                                     NEFF
                         Sure, it's all in your mind.

                                     LOLA
                         I only wish it was, Walter, because 
                         I still love him.

               Over Neff's face, as he listens to the music, comes the 
               commentary.

               D-13 LOBBY OF PACIFIC BLDG. (DAY)

                                     NEFF'S VOICE
                         Zachetti. That's funny. Phyllis and 
                         Zachetti. What was he doing up at 
                         her house? I couldn't figure that 
                         one out I tried to make sense out of 
                         it and got nowhere. But the real 
                         brain-twister came the next day. You 
                         sprang it on me, Keyes, after office 
                         hours, when you caught me down in 
                         the lobby of the building.

               About 5:00 P.M. or a little later. A stream of office 
               employees is coming out of an elevator; a second elevator 
               reaches the lobby and some more office employees come out, 
               among them Neff, wearing his hat and carrying his briefcase.

               CAMERA PRECEDES HIM as he walks toward the entrance doors. 
               He is stopped by Keyes' voice, off to one side.

                                     KEYES' VOICE
                         Oh, Walter, just a minute.

               Neff stops and looks towards the cigar counter, as he moves 
               towards him. Keyes is standing there buying cigars. He is 
               stuffing them into his pockets.

                                     NEFF
                         Hello, Keyes.

                                     KEYES
                         Hang onto your hat, Walter.

                                     NEFF
                         What for?

                                     KEYES
                         Nothing much. The Dietrichson case 
                         just busted wide open.

                                     NEFF
                         How do you mean?

                                     KEYES
                         The guy showed. That's how.

                                     NEFF
                         The somebody else?

                                     KEYES
                         Yeah. The guy that did it with her.

                                     NEFF
                         No kidding?

                                     KEYES
                         She's filed suit against us, and 
                         it's okay by me. When we get into 
                         that courtroom I'll tear them apart, 
                         both of them. Come on -- I'll buy 
                         you a martini.

                                     NEFF
                         No thanks, Keyes.

                                     KEYES
                         With two olives.

                                     NEFF
                         I've got to get a shave and a 
                         shoeshine. I've got a date.

                                     KEYES
                         Margie. I still bet she drinks from 
                         the bottle.

               He bites off the end of the cigar and puts the cigar into 
               his mouth. He starts tapping his pockets for a match, as 
               usual. Neff strikes a match for him.

                                     NEFF
                         They give you matches when they sell 
                         you cigars, Keyes. All you have to 
                         do is ask for them.

                                     KEYES
                         I don't like them. They always explode 
                         in my pockets. So long, Walter.

               Keyes goes toward the street and OUT OF SCENE. Neff moves 
               back into the lobby, CAMERA FOLLOWING HIM. As he reaches the 
               elevator, he looks back over his shoulder, to make sure Keyes 
               is gone, then steps into the empty elevator.

                                     NEFF'S VOICE
                         You sure had me worried, Keyes. I 
                         didn't know if you were playing cat-
                         and-mouse with me, whether you knew 
                         all along I was the somebody else. 
                         That's what I had to find out, and I 
                         thought I knew where to look...

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               D-14 ENTRANCE - OFFICE. 12TH FLOOR RECEPTION ROOM (DAY)

               Neff comes out of the elevator. The receptionist is just 
               tidying up her desk. She has her hat on and is preparing to 
               leave. Neff passes on through the swinging doors to the 
               twelfth floor balcony.

                                     NEFF'S VOICE
                         Upstairs, the last of the people 
                         were just leaving.

               D-15 12TH FLOOR BALCONY

               Neff enters from the reception room. A couple of belated 
               employees are leaving for the day. Neff goes toward Keyes' 
               office, looks around to make sure he is unobserved, enters.

                                     NEFF'S VOICE
                         I made sure nobody saw me go into 
                         your office.

               D-16 KEYES' OFFICE (DAY)

               Neff has just come in. He goes over to Keyes' desk and 
               searches the papers on it. He tries the desk drawers and 
               finds them locked. His eye falls on the dictaphone on the 
               stand beside the desk. A record is on it, the needle is about 
               two-thirds of the way towards the end. He lifts the needle 
               and sets it back to the beginning of the record, sets the 
               switch to playback position. He lifts the arm off the bracket 
               and starts the machine. Keyes' voice is heard coming from 
               the horn:

                                     KEYES' VOICE
                              (From Dictaphone)
                         Memo to Mr. Norton. Confidential. 
                         Dietrichson File. With regard to 
                         your proposal to put Walter Neff 
                         under surveillance, I disagree 
                         absolutely. I have investigated his 
                         movements on the night of the crime, 
                         and he is definitely placed in his 
                         apartment from 7:15 P.M. on. In 
                         addition to this, I have known Neff 
                         intimately for eleven years, and I 
                         personally vouch for him, without 
                         reservation...

               Neff stops the machine. He sits down slowly, still holding 
               the horn. He is deeply moved. After a moment, he presses the 
               switch again.

                                     KEYES' VOICE
                              (From Dictaphone)
                         ...Furthermore, no connection 
                         whatsoever has been established 
                         between Walter Neff and Mrs. Phyllis 
                         Dietrichson, whereas I am now able 
                         to report that such a connection has 
                         been established between her and 
                         another man. This man has been 
                         observed to visit the Dietrichson 
                         home on the night of July 9th, 10th, 
                         11th, 12th and 13th. We have succeeded 
                         in identifying him as one Nino 
                         Zachetti, former medical student, 
                         aged twenty-eight, residing at Lilac 
                         Court Apartments 1228½ N. La Brea 
                         Avenue. We have checked Zachetti's 
                         movements on the night of the crime 
                         and have found that they cannot be 
                         accounted for. I am preparing a more 
                         detailed report for your consideration 
                         and it is my belief that we already 
                         have sufficient evidence against 
                         Zachetti and Mrs. Dietrichson to 
                         justify police action. I strongly 
                         urge that this whole matter be turned 
                         over to the office of the District 
                         Attorney. Respectfully, Barton Keyes.

               Neff sits, staring blankly at the wall. The cylinder goes on 
               revolving, but no more voice comes -- only the whir of the 
               needle on the empty record. At last he remembers to replace 
               the horn. He hangs it back on its hook. The machine stops. 
               Neff gets up from the chair, walks slowly to the door and 
               goes out.

               D-17 12TH FLOOR, BALCONY

               Neff has just come out of Keyes' office. He walks slowly 
               back towards the reception room entrance, then stands there 
               looking out through the glass doors. All the employees have 
               now left. Neff is entirely alone. He moves as if to go out, 
               then stops rigidly as his face lights up with excitement of 
               a sudden idea. He turns quickly and walks on to his own office 
               and enters.

               D-18 NEFF'S OFFICE (DAY)

               Neff walks across to his desk, lifts the telephone and dials 
               a number. (During the ensuing telephone conversation, only 
               what he says is heard. The pauses indicate speeches at the 
               other end of the line).

                                     NEFF
                         Phyllis? Walter. I've got to see 
                         you... Tonight... Yes, it has to be 
                         tonight... How's eleven o'clock? 
                         Don't worry about Keyes. He's 
                         satisfied... Leave the door on the 
                         latch and put the lights out. No, 
                         nobody's watching the house... I 
                         told you Keyes is satisfied. It's 
                         just for the neighbors... That's 
                         what I said. Yeah. Eleven o'clock. 
                         Goodbye, baby.

               Neff hangs up and stands beside the desk with a grim 
               expression on his face, takes a handkerchief out and wipes 
               perspiration from his forehead and the palms of his hands. 
               The gesture has a symbolic quality, as if he were trying to 
               wipe away the murder. Over his face comes the commentary.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

                                     NEFF'S VOICE
                         I guess I don't have to tell you 
                         what I was going to do at eleven 
                         o'clock, Keyes. For the first time I 
                         saw a way to get clear of the whole 
                         mess I was in, and of Phyllis, too, 
                         all at the same time. Yeah, that's 
                         what I thought. But what I didn't 
                         know was that she was all set for 
                         me. That she had outsmarted me again, 
                         just like she always had...

               D-19 HALL STAIRWAY OF DIETRICHSON HOME (NIGHT)

               The lights are turned on. Phyllis is coming down the stairs. 
               She wears white lounging pajamas, and she is carrying 
               something small and heavy concealed in a scarf in her right 
               hand. She reaches the front door, opens it slightly, fixes 
               the catch so that the door can be opened from outside. She 
               switches off the porch light and the hall light. She moves 
               towards the living room, where there is still light on.

                                     NEFF'S VOICE
                         She was all set and waiting for me. 
                         It could have been something in my 
                         voice when I called her up that tipped 
                         her off. And it could have been that 
                         she had the idea already. And an 
                         idea wasn't the only thing she had 
                         waiting for me.

               D-20 LIVING ROOM

               On the long table behind the davenport, one of the lamps is 
               lit. The only other light in the room is a standing lamp 
               beside the desk. A window toward the back is open, and through 
               it comes the SOUNDS OF MUSIC, probably a neighboring radio.

               Phyllis enters and crosses to the table. She puts out the 
               lamp, then moves over to the desk and puts out the lamp there. 
               The room is filled with bright moonlight coming in at the 
               windows.

               Phyllis crosses to the chair by the fireplace (the one she 
               sat in the first time Neff came to the house). She lifts the 
               loose cushion and puts what was in the scarf behind it. As 
               she withdraws the scarf, there is a brief glint of something 
               metallic before she covers the hidden object with the cushion 
               again.

               She turns to the low table in front of the davenport and 
               takes a cigarette from the box. She takes a match and is 
               about to strike it when, just then, she hears a car coming 
               up the hill. She listens, motionless. The car stops. A car 
               door is slammed.

               Calmly, Phyllis strikes the match and lights her cigarette. 
               She drops the match casually into a tray, goes back to the 
               chair, sits down and waits, quietly smoking. There are 
               footsteps outside the house.

               Over the chair in which Phyllis is sitting, the hallway is 
               visible through the arch. The front door opens. Neff comes 
               in, he is silhouetted against the moonlight as he stands 
               there. He closes the door again.

                                     PHYLLIS
                              (In foreground)
                         In here, Walter.

               Neff comes through the arch and walks slowly towards her.

                                     NEFF
                         Hello, baby. Anybody else in the 
                         house?

                                     PHYLLIS
                         Nobody. Why?

                                     NEFF
                         What's that music?

                                     PHYLLIS
                         A radio up the street.

               Neff sits down on the arm of the davenport, close to her.

                                     NEFF
                         Just like the first time I was here. 
                         We were talking about automobile 
                         insurance. Only you were thinking 
                         about murder. And I was thinking 
                         about that anklet.

                                     PHYLLIS
                         And what are you thinking about now?

                                     NEFF
                         I'm all through thinking. This is 
                         goodbye.

                                     PHYLLIS
                         Goodbye? Where are you going?

                                     NEFF
                         It's you that's going, baby. Not me. 
                         I'm getting off the trolley car right 
                         at this corner.

                                     PHYLLIS
                         Suppose you stop being fancy. Let's 
                         have it, whatever it is.

                                     NEFF
                         I have a friend who's got a funny 
                         theory. He says when two people commit 
                         a murder they're kind of on a trolley 
                         car, and one can't get off without 
                         the other. They're stuck with each 
                         other. They have to go on riding 
                         clear to the end of the line. And 
                         the last stop is the cemetery.

                                     PHYLLIS
                         Maybe he's got something there.

                                     NEFF
                         You bet he has, Two people are going 
                         to ride to the end of the line, all 
                         right. Only I'm not going to be one 
                         of them. I've got another guy to 
                         finish my ride for me.

                                     PHYLLIS
                         So you've got it all arranged, Walter.

                                     NEFF
                         You arranged it for me. I didn't 
                         have to do a thing.

                                     PHYLLIS
                         Just who are you talking about?

                                     NEFF
                         An acquaintance of yours. A Mr. 
                         Zachetti. Come on, baby, I just got 
                         into this because I knew a little 
                         something about insurance, didn't I? 
                         I was just a sucker. I'd have been 
                         brushed-off as soon as you got your 
                         hands on the money.

                                     PHYLLIS
                         What are you talking about?

                                     NEFF
                         Save it. I'm telling this. It's been 
                         you and that Zachetti guy all along, 
                         hasn't it?

                                     PHYLLIS
                         That's not true.

                                     NEFF
                         It doesn't make any difference whether 
                         it's true or not. The point is Keyes 
                         believes Zachetti is the guy he's 
                         been looking for. He'll have him in 
                         that gas chamber before he knows 
                         what happened to him.

                                     PHYLLIS
                         And what's happening to me all this 
                         time?

                                     NEFF
                         Don't be silly. What do you expect 
                         to happen to you? You helped him do 
                         the murder, didn't you? That's what 
                         Keyes thinks. And what's good enough 
                         for Keyes is good enough for me.

                                     PHYLLIS
                         Maybe it's not good enough for me. 
                         Walter. Maybe I don't go for the 
                         idea. Maybe I'd rather talk.

                                     NEFF
                         Sometimes people are where they can't 
                         talk. Under six feet of dirt, for 
                         instance. And if it was you, they'd 
                         just charge it up to Zachetti, 
                         wouldn't they. One more item on his 
                         account. Sure they would. That's 
                         just what they're going to do. 
                         Especially since he's coming here, 
                         tonight... Oh, in about fifteen 
                         minutes from now, baby. With the 
                         cops right behind him. It's all taken 
                         care of.

                                     PHYLLIS
                         And that'd make everything lovely 
                         for you, wouldn't it?

                                     NEFF
                         Right. And it's got to be done before 
                         that suit of yours comes to trial, 
                         and Lola gets a chance to sound off, 
                         and they trip you up on the stand, 
                         and you start to fold up and drag me 
                         down with you.

                                     PHYLLIS
                         Listen, Walter. Maybe I had Zachetti 
                         here so they won't get a chance to 
                         trip me up. So we can get that money 
                         and be together.

                                     NEFF
                         That's cute. Say it again.

                                     PHYLLIS
                         He came here the first time just to 
                         ask where Lola was. I made him come 
                         back. I was working on him. He's 
                         crazy sort of guy, quick-tempered. I 
                         kept hammering into him that she was 
                         with another man, so he'd get into 
                         one of his jealous rages, and then 
                         I'd tell him where she was. And you 
                         know what he'd have done to her, 
                         don't you, Walter.

                                     NEFF
                         Yeah, and for once I believe you. 
                         Because it's just rotten enough.

                                     PHYLLIS
                         We're both rotten, Walter.

                                     NEFF
                         Only you're just a little more rotten. 
                         You're rotten clear through. You got 
                         me to take care of your husband, and 
                         then you got Zachetti to take care 
                         of Lola, and maybe take care of me 
                         too, and then somebody else would 
                         have come along to take care of 
                         Zachetti for you. That's the way you 
                         operate isn't it, baby.

                                     PHYLLIS
                         Suppose it is, Walter. Is what you've 
                         cooked up for tonight any better?

               Neff gets up from the davenport. He listens to the music for 
               a moment.

                                     NEFF
                         I don't like this music anymore. 
                         It's too close. Do you mind if I 
                         shut the window?

               Phyllis just stares at him. He goes quietly over to the window 
               and shuts it and draws the curtain. Phyllis speaks to his 
               back:

                                     PHYLLIS
                              (Her voice low and 
                              urgent)
                         Walter!

               Neff turns, something changes in his face. There is the report 
               of a gun. He stands motionless for a moment, then very slowly 
               starts towards her. CAMERA IS SHOOTING OVER HIS SHOULDER at 
               Phyllis as she stands with the gun in her hand. Neff stops 
               after he has taken a few steps.

                                     NEFF
                         What's the matter? Why don't you 
                         shoot again? Maybe if I came a little 
                         closer?

               Neff takes a few more steps towards her and stops again.

                                     NEFF
                         How's that. Do you think you can do 
                         it now?

               Phyllis is silent. She doesn't shoot. Her expression is 
               tortured. Neff goes on until he is close to her. Quietly he 
               takes the gun out of her unresisting hand.

                                     NEFF
                         Why didn't you shoot, baby?

               Phyllis puts her arms around him in complete surrender.

                                     NEFF
                         Don't tell me it's because you've 
                         been in love with me all this time.

                                     PHYLLIS
                         No. I never loved you, Walter. Not 
                         you, or anybody else. I'm rotten to 
                         the heart. I used you, just as you 
                         said. That's all you ever meant to 
                         me -- until a minute ago. I didn't 
                         think anything like that could ever 
                         happen to me.

                                     NEFF
                         I'm sorry, baby. I'm not buying.

                                     PHYLLIS
                         I'm not asking you to buy. Just hold 
                         me close.

               Neff draws her close to him. She reaches up to his face and 
               kisses him on the lips. As she comes out of the kiss there 
               is realization in her eyes that this is the final moment.

                                     NEFF
                         Goodbye, baby.

               Out of the shot the gun explodes once, twice. Phyllis quivers 
               in his arms. Her eyes fill with tears. Her head falls limp 
               against his shoulder. Slowly he lifts her and carries her to 
               the davenport. He lays her down on it carefully, almost 
               tenderly. The moonlight coming in at the French doors shines 
               on the anklet. He looks at it for the last time and slowly 
               turns away. As he does so, he puts his hand inside his coat 
               and it comes out with blood on it. Only then is it apparent 
               that Phyllis' shot actually did hit him. He looks at the 
               blood on his fingers with a dazed expression and quickly 
               goes out of the room, the way he came.

               D-21 EXT. DIETRICHSON HOME - (NIGHT)

               Neff comes out of the house. He closes the front door with 
               his right hand. His left arm hangs limp. He takes a few steps 
               down the walk, then suddenly hears somebody approaching. He 
               moves behind the palm tree near the walk.

               A man comes up the steps towards the front door -- Zachetti. 
               Just as he reaches the door, Neff calls to him.

                                     NEFF
                         Hey you. Come here a minute. I said 
                         come here, Zachetti.

               Zachetti turns and approaches him slowly.

                                     NEFF
                         The name is Neff.

                                     ZACHETTI
                         Yeah? And I still don't like it. 
                         What do you want?

                                     NEFF
                         Look, kid, I want to give you a 
                         present.

               He takes some loose change out of his pocket and holds out a 
               coin.

                                     NEFF
                         Here's a nice new nickel.

                                     ZACHETTI
                         What's the gag?

                                     NEFF
                         Suppose you go back down the hill to 
                         a drug store and make a phone call.

               Neff starts to drop the nickel into Zachetti's handkerchief 
               pocket. Zachetti knocks his hand away.

                                     ZACHETTI
                         Keep your nickel and buy yourself an 
                         ice cream cone.

                                     NEFF
                         The number is Granite 0386. Ask for 
                         Miss Dietrichson. The first name is 
                         Lola.

                                     ZACHETTI
                         Lola? She isn't worth a nickel. And 
                         if I ever talk to her, it's not going 
                         to be over any telephone.

                                     NEFF
                         Tough, aren't you? Take the nickel. 
                         Take it and call her. She wants you 
                         to.

                                     ZACHETTI
                         Yeah? She doesn't want any part of 
                         me.

                                     NEFF
                         I know who told you that, and it's 
                         not true. She's in love with you. 
                         Always has been. Don't ask me why. I 
                         couldn't even guess.

               Zachetti just stares at him. Neff moves again to put the 
               nickel into Zachetti's pocket. This time Zachetti allows him 
               to do it.

                                     NEFF
                         Now beat it. Granite 0386, I told 
                         you.

               He motions toward the street below.

                                     NEFF
                         That way.

               Zachetti goes slowly past him. Neff grabs him and pushes him 
               almost violently down the walk. Zachetti goes out of shot. 
               The sound of his steps dies away as Neff looks after him. 
               Then, far off in the distance, the SIREN OF A POLICE CAR is 
               heard.

               Neff moves off through the shrubbery toward the side of the 
               house where he parked his car.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               D-22 NEFF'S OFFICE - (NIGHT)

               The desk lamp is still lighted. Outside the windows, the 
               dawn is slowly breaking.

               Neff is still clutching the horn of the dictaphone. There 
               are eight or nine used cylinders on the desk beside him. A 
               widening stain of blood shows on the left shoulder of his 
               gray jacket. He is very weak by now, and his voice holds a 
               note of utter exhaustion.

                                     NEFF
                         It's almost four-thirty now, Keyes. 
                         It's cold. I wonder if she's still 
                         lying there alone in that house, or 
                         whether they've found her by now. I 
                         wonder a lot of things, but they 
                         don't matter any more, except I want 
                         to ask you to do me a favor. I want 
                         you to be the one to tell Lola, kind 
                         of gently, before it breaks wide 
                         open... Yes, and I'd like you to 
                         look after her and that guy Zachetti, 
                         so he doesn't get pushed around too 
                         much. Because...

               Suddenly he stops his dictation with an instinctive feeling 
               that he is not alone in the room.

               As he turns in his chair the CAMERA PULLS BACK slowly. The 
               office door is wide open. Keyes is standing a few steps inside 
               it. Behind him, on the balcony outside, stands the night 
               watchman and the colored janitor, peering curiously into the 
               room over Keyes' shoulder.

               Slowly, and without taking his eyes off Neff's face, Keyes 
               reaches back and pushes the door shut.

               Neff hangs up the dictaphone horn. He looks at Keyes with a 
               faint, tired grin and speaks very slowly.

                                     NEFF
                         Hello, Keyes.

               Keyes moves towards him a few steps and stands without 
               answering.

                                     NEFF
                         Up pretty early, aren't you? I always 
                         wondered what time you got down to 
                         work.

               Keyes, staring at him, still does not answer.

                                     NEFF
                         Or did your little man pull you out 
                         of bed?

                                     KEYES
                         The janitor did. Seems you leaked a 
                         little blood on the way in here.

                                     NEFF
                         Wouldn't be surprised.

               Neff makes a motion indicating the used cylinders standing 
               on the desk.

                                     NEFF
                         I wanted to straighten out that 
                         Dietrichson story for you.

                                     KEYES
                         So I gather.

                                     NEFF
                         How long have you been standing there?

                                     KEYES
                         Long enough.

                                     NEFF
                         Kind of a crazy story with a crazy 
                         twist to it. One you didn't quite 
                         figure out.

                                     KEYES
                         You can't figure them all, Walter.

                                     NEFF
                         That's right. You can't, can you? 
                         And now I suppose I get the big 
                         speech, the one with all the two-
                         dollar words in it. Let's have it, 
                         Keyes.

                                     KEYES
                         You're all washed up, Walter.

                                     NEFF
                         Thanks, Keyes. That was short anyway.

               They stare at each other for a long moment, then, with intense 
               effort Neff gets up on his feet and stands there swaying a 
               little. His face is covered with sweat. His shoulder is 
               bleeding. He is on the verge of collapse.

                                     KEYES
                         Walter, I'm going to call a doctor.

                                     NEFF
                              (Bitterly)
                         What for? So they can patch me up? 
                         So they can nurse me along till I'm 
                         back on my feet? So I can walk under 
                         my own power into that gas chamber 
                         up in San Quentin? Is that it, Keyes?

                                     KEYES
                         Something like that, Walter.

                                     NEFF
                         Well, I've got a different idea. 
                         Look here. Suppose you went back to 
                         bed and didn't find these cylinders 
                         till tomorrow morning, when the office 
                         opens. From then on you can play it 
                         any way you like. Would you do that 
                         much for me, Keyes?

                                     KEYES
                         Give me one good reason.

                                     NEFF
                         I need four hours to get where I'm 
                         going.

                                     KEYES
                         You're not going anywhere, Walter.

                                     NEFF
                         You bet I am. I'm going across the 
                         border.

                                     KEYES
                         You haven't got a chance.

                                     NEFF
                         Good enough to try for.

                                     KEYES
                         You'll never make the border.

                                     NEFF
                         That's what you think. Watch me.

               Neff starts to move towards the door, staggering a little, 
               holding himself upright with great effort.

                                     KEYES
                              (In a voice of stony 
                              calm)
                         You'll never even make the elevator.

               Neff has reached the door. He twists the knob and drags the 
               door open. He turns in it to look back at Keyes' implacable 
               face.

                                     NEFF
                         So long, Keyes.

               Neff goes out, leaving the door wide open. THE CAMERA FOLLOWS 
               his staggering walk along the BALCONY TOWARDS THE ELEVATOR 
               LOBBY. The sound of his breathing is so harsh and loud that 
               for a moment it dominates the scene. Finally he reaches the 
               swing doors leading into the lobby and starts to push them 
               open. At this moment he collapses. He clutches the edge of 
               the door and as it swings around with him he falls to the 
               floor. He tries to struggle up but cannot rise.

               In background comes the sound of a telephone being dialed.

                                     KEYES' VOICE
                         Hello... Send an ambulance to the 
                         Pacific Building on Olive Street... 
                         Yeah... It's a police job.

               There is the sound of the phone being replaced in its cradle. 
               Then there are footsteps growing louder along the balcony 
               and Keyes walks slowly into the shot. He kneels down beside 
               Neff.

                                     KEYES
                         How you doing, Walter?

               Neff manages a faint smile.

                                     NEFF
                         I'm fine. Only somebody moved the 
                         elevator a couple of miles away.

                                     KEYES
                         They're on the way.

                                     NEFF
                              (Slowly and with great 
                              difficulty)
                         You know why you didn't figure this 
                         one, Keyes? Let me tell you. The guy 
                         you were looking for was too close. 
                         He was right across the desk from 
                         you.

                                     KEYES
                         Closer than that, Walter.

               The eyes of the two men meet in a moment of silence.

                                     NEFF
                         I love you too.

               Neff fumbles for the handkerchief in Keyes' pocket, pulls it 
               out and clumsily wipes his face with it. The handkerchief 
               drops from his hand. He gets a loose cigarette out of his 
               pocket and puts it between his lips. Then with great 
               difficulty he gets out a match, tries to strike it, but is 
               too weak. Keyes takes the match out of his hand, strikes it 
               for him and lights his cigarette.

                                                                  FADE OUT:

                                         THE END

                

               The following pages are for an alternate ending that director 
               Billy Wilder actually shot but later decided against.

                                     KEYES
                         They're on the way.

                                     NEFF
                              (Slowly and with great 
                              difficulty)
                         You know why you didn't figure this 
                         one, Keyes? Let me tell you. The guy 
                         you were looking for was too close. 
                         He was right across the desk from 
                         you.

                                     KEYES
                         Closer than that, Walter.

               The eyes of the two men meet in a moment of silence.

                                     NEFF
                         I love you too.

               Neff fumbles for the handkerchief in Keyes' pocket, pulls it 
               out and clumsily wipes his face with it. Then, clutching the 
               handkerchief against his shoulder, he speaks to Keyes for 
               the last time.

                                     NEFF
                         At the end of that... trolley line... 
                         just as I get off... you be there... 
                         to say goodbye... will you, Keyes?

                                                                  FADE OUT:

                                   END OF SEQUENCE "D"

                                       SEQUENCE "E"

               FADE IN:

               E-1 WITNESS ROOM IN DEATH CHAMBER - SAN QUENTIN (DAY)

               Showing the witness room and approximately one-half of the 
               gas chamber. BOOM SHOT towards guard standing BACK TO CAMERA 
               at entrance door. Except for this guard the room is empty.

               Guard opens the door. Two other guards enter, followed by a 
               group of witnesses and newspaper men, each of whom removes 
               his hat as he enters the room. They form a group around the 
               outside of the gas chamber, some looking in through the glass 
               windows, some standing in the background on low platforms 
               against the wall.

               THE CAMERA SLOWLY BEGINS TO MOVE IN AND DOWN, AND CENTERS ON 
               Keyes, as he enters the room and stands behind the door. His 
               face is seen through the bars of the door, which is then 
               closed, and CAMERA MOVES TO A CLOSEUP. His eyes follow the 
               action of the closing door, then slowly look towards the gas 
               chamber.

               E-2 THE GAS CHAMBER, EMPTY

               On its windows show reflections of the spectators, including 
               the face of Keyes.

               The door to the gas chamber opens in the background, and 
               beyond that another door opens. Neff comes in between two 
               guards. He is wearing a white open-necked shirt, blue denim 
               pants, and walks barefooted on a cocoanut matting. He moves 
               into the gas chamber, looks through the windows in the 
               direction of Keyes and nods quickly, recognizing him. The 
               guards turn him around and seat him in one of the two metal 
               chairs, with his back to the witnesses. They strap his arms, 
               legs and body to the chair. The guards go out.

               E-3 THE DOOR TO THE GAS CHAMBER

               It is open. The three guards come out of the gas chamber 
               into the ante-chamber, where stand the warden, executioner, 
               two doctors, the minister and the acid man, and possibly 
               several guards.

               The executioner and one guard close the door. The guard spins 
               the big wheel which tightens it. The wheel at first turns 
               very quickly, then, as it tightens, the guard uses 
               considerable force to seal the chamber tight. The guard steps 
               out of the shot. The gas chamber is now sealed.

               E-4 THE WITNESSES AND KEYES

               They are intently watching Neff in the gas chamber.

               E-5 THE ANTE-CHAMBER

               The warden looks slowly around the room, sees that everyone 
               is in his proper place and that the stethoscope, which one 
               doctor holds, is connected with the outlet in the wall of 
               the gas chamber. Also that the man in charge of the acid is 
               ready. The warden makes a motion to the acid man. The acid 
               man releases the mixed acid into a pipe connecting with a 
               countersunk receptacle under Neff's chair. (This action is 
               only suggested). The warden looks at the clock, then turns 
               to the executioner and nods.

               E-6 THE EXECUTIONER - MED. SHOT - CAMERA SHOOTING DOWN FROM 
               HIGH ANGLE TOWARDS EXECUTIONER

               He pushes a metal lever. (This immerses the pellets of cyanide 
               in the acid under the chair.)

               E-7 INT. GAS CHAMBER - MED. SHOT

               CAMERA IS SHOOTING ABOVE Neff's head (just out of shot), 
               towards spectators standing outside the gas chamber, Keyes 
               in the center. Gas floats up into scene between CAMERA and 
               spectators. Keyes, unable to watch, looks away.

               E-8 THE FIRST DOCTOR - CLOSE SHOT

               as he listens on stethoscope connected with the gas chamber. 
               He glances at the clock above his head.

               E-9 THE SECOND DOCTOR - CLOSE SHOT

               He stands to right of the gas chamber door, taking notes on 
               a pad. He glances towards First Doctor (out of scene) and 
               looks through venetian blinds into the gas chamber. The acid 
               man stands near him.

               E-10 THE FIRST DOCTOR

               CAMERA SHOOTING FROM HIGH ANGLE TOWARDS HIM as he listens on 
               stethoscope. The doctor glances at the clock again. He takes 
               his stethoscope from his ears. He nods to the warden, This 
               indicates that the man is dead. CAMERA PANS with warden as 
               he turns to open the door connecting the ante-chamber with 
               the witness room.

               E-11 THE WITNESS ROOM - LONG SHOT FROM HIGH ON BOOM DOWN ON 
               WITNESSES GROUPED AROUND GAS CHAMBER

               The door connecting with the ante-chamber opens. A guard 
               comes through.

                                     GUARD
                         That's all, gentlemen, Vacate the 
                         chamber, please.

               The guard withdraws and closes the door by which he entered. 
               The witnesses slowly start to file out. A guard has opened 
               the outer door. The witnesses put their hats on as they pass 
               through. A few go close to the windows of the gas chamber to 
               look in at the dead man before they leave.

               All the witnesses have now left, except Keyes, who stands, 
               shocked and tragic, beyond the door. The guard goes to him 
               and touches his arm, indicating to him that he must leave. 
               Keyes glances for the last time towards the gas chamber and 
               slowly moves to go out.

               E-12 CORRIDOR OUTSIDE THE DEATH CHAMBER

               CAMERA SHOOTING IN THROUGH THE OPEN DOOR AT KEYES, who is 
               just turning to leave. Keyes comes slowly out into the dark, 
               narrow corridor. His hat is on his head now, his overcoat is 
               pulled around him loosely. He walks like an old man. He takes 
               eight or ten steps, then mechanically reaches a cigar out of 
               his vest pocket and puts it in his mouth. His hands, in the 
               now familiar gesture, begin to pat his pockets for matches.

               Suddenly he stops, with a look of horror on his face. He 
               stands rigid, pressing a hand against his heart. He takes 
               the cigar out of his mouth and goes slowly on towards the 
               door, CAMERA PANNING with him. When he has almost reached 
               the door, the guard stationed there throws it wide, and a 
               blaze of sunlight comes in from the prison yard outside.

               Keyes slowly walks out into the sunshine. stiffly, his head 
               bent, a forlorn and lonely man.

                                                                  FADE OUT:

          1 INT. CAR ENGINE - NIGHT. 1
                         
           We're close on a maze of metal rods, tubes, and wires. It's only
           as we pull out that we realize it's the engine of a car. Over
           the image we hear a voice talking on a phone.
                         
           DRIVER O/S
           ...hundred thousand streets in this city,
           you don't need to know the route. You give
           me a time and place, I give you a five
           minute window. Those five minutes I'm
           yours. Whatever goes down I'm yours. Minute
           either side you're on your own...
                         
           As the engine ignites and roars to life we DISSOLVE TO:
                         
          2 INT. LOW RENT APARTMENT/ KOREATOWN/ L.A. - NIGHT. 2
                         
           A map of downtown L.A. spread out on a bed, dozens of different
           routes marked in pencil. The voice continues -
                         
           DRIVER O/S
           ...One last thing. You won't be able to
           reach me at this number again...
                         
           DRIVER hangs up the phone. He folds his map of LA and slips it
           in his duffel bag. A few clothes and other essentials are neatly
           packed inside. He zips the bag shut and takes one last look at a
           cheap TV set. On screen, a movie is playing. On a radio, the LA
           Clippers are taking a pounding from the New York Knicks.
                         
          3 INT. UNDERGROUND PARKING LOT/ APARTMENT/ KOREATOWN - NIGHT. 3
                         
           Driver strides through a dimly lit car park, carrying his duffel
           bag. A YOUNG COUPLE emerge from their car after a late night
           out. Driver lowers his eyes, avoiding their gaze as he makes his
           way towards a sleek 1970's Chevelle
                         
          4 INT/EXT. DRIVER'S CAR/ ALVARADO - NIGHT. 4
                         
           The Clippers-Knicks game plays on the car radio now. Driver is
           only half listening, focused on the road. We see his face in the
           passing neon lights. Feline good looks. Impassive blue eyes.
           Something almost melancholy in his unwavering gaze. He drives
           carefully, letting other cars overtake.
                         
          5 EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING/ ECHO PARK - NIGHT. 5
                         
           Driver glides into the parking lot of another low-rent apartment
           block.

          6 INT. UNDERGROUND CAR PARK/ APARTMENT/ ECHO PARK - NIGHT. 6
                         
           Clutching his duffel bag Driver heads towards the car park
           elevator. Hurrying out in the opposite direction he sees a
           pretty GIRL in her 20's wearing a waitress outfit. Their eyes
           meet briefly, before Driver walks on.
                         
          7 INT. APARTMENT/ ECHO PARK - NIGHT. 7
                         
           Driver heads down the hallway and unlocks the door to his new
           apartment. It's not all that different from his last one. Clean,
           sparse, and anonymous. He doesn't even bother to walk in. He
           tosses his duffel bag inside and locks the door again.
                         
          8 INT/EXT. DRIVER'S CAR/ SILVERLAKE BOULEVARD - NIGHT 8
                         
           Driver's back on the road, the basketball game still playing on
           the radio. He drives past a row of brightly lit Mexican food
           shacks on Silver Lake Boulevard and turns into a run down garage
           lit up with a neon sign - Shannon's Picture Car Warehouse -
           vintage cars.
                         
          9 INT. SHANNON'S GARAGE/ SILVERLAKE BOULEVARD - NIGHT. 9
                         
           SHANNON, the owner of the garage, has a distinctive limp. Driver
           follows him past rows of vintage cars.
                         
                          SHANNON
           ...Plain Jane cheap like you asked for but
           with a hundred and sixty horsepower inside.
           You get any sleep?
                         
                          DRIVER
           Not this week.
                         
           As Shannon grins we feel the familiarity between them.
                         
                          SHANNON
           I can offer you some Halcyon.
                         
                          DRIVER
           Won't work.
                         
           They head past more cars -- Fords, Dodges, Buicks -- until they
           arrive at a plain looking Impala.
                         
                          SHANNON
           There she is. Silver Impala. Most popular
           car in the state of California...
                         
           Driver casts his eyes over the unimpressive vehicle then holds
           out his hand for the keys.

          10 INT/EXT. SILVER IMPALA/ TOY DISTRICT/ DOWNTOWN L.A. - NIGHT. 10
                         
           The basketball game is approaching the end of the third quarter.
           Driver's behind the wheel of the Impala now, cruising past rows
           of dingy toy stores on 3rd Street. He glances at his watch. It's
           9:50. He checks his mirror then turns into a side street.
                         
          11 INT/EXT. IMPALA/ ELECTRONICS SUPERSTORE/ DOWNTOWN - NIGHT. 11
                         
           A vast electronics superstore dominates the deserted street.
           Under the pale yellow glow of the street lamps, Driver sees
           signs advertising a `huge blow out weekend sale'. He pulls over,
           making sure he has a good view of the entrance. On the radio,
           the basketball commentator is getting more excited.
                         
                          BASKETBALL COMMENTARY
           ...This is some comeback from the Clippers!
           Only a few minutes ago they looked dead and
           buried!...
                         
           Driver reaches under the seat and pulls out a small handheld
           scanner. He switches it on, tuning it to the right frequency.
           Crackling police dispatches are interspersed with the basketball
           commentary now.
                         
                          POLICE SCANNER
           ...9 Adam 81, what is your current

                          BASKETBALL COMMENTARY
           ...Another unbelievable three pointer from
           Davis and the Clippers are within five!...
                         
           Out of the corner of his eye Driver sees two MEN approach. He
           doesn't react, expecting them. They cut through the fence with
           bolt cutters and approach the main building. Driver watches them
           pull on their masks, then one of them takes out a shotgun and
           blasts the lock to the front door. Instantly the alarm shrills.
           The only thing Driver does is to turn on his stop watch.
                         
                          BASKETBALL COMMENTARY
           ...Time out Knicks...
                         
           The stop watching keeps ticking away, the siren blaring, the
           commentary continuing, the police scanner crackling.
                         
           The storefront is hidden in shadow, impossible to tell what's
           going on inside. Driver looks at his stop watch. Almost three
           minutes. One of the masked men emerges now, carrying a duffel
           bag. He hurries over and gets in the back of Driver's car
           without a word. There's no sign of the other robber.

           The commentary continues, so does the crackling on the police
           scanner. Four minutes. Still no sign of the second armed robber.
           His companion in the back starts to look nervous, wondering
           what's happened to his partner.
                         
           Driver doesn't betray a hint of nerves. Four and half minutes on
           his stop watch. Thirty seconds more and he's on his way.
                         
           Suddenly the second robber appears from the shadows, running as
           fast as he can to the getaway car. He jumps into the back seat a
           few seconds short of five minutes and Driver screeches off.
                         
          12 INT/ EXT. SILVER IMPALA/ STREETS/ DOWNTOWN - NIGHT. 12
                         
           Driver thunders over the 1st Street bridge towards Boyle
           Heights, then eases his foot off the gas, slowing to a steady
           speed. In the back seat the two armed robbers rip off their
           masks, looking pumped up with adrenalin. Driver studies them in
           his rear view mirror, then swerves right on Mission Street as
           his police scanner crackles to life.

           Driver swings sharply into 4th Street now, crossing the L.A.
           River again, heading back in the same direction he came.

           Up ahead, the lights of Downtown L.A. glitter against the night
           sky. Hovering between the neon green glow of the skyscrapers
           Driver sees the red and white glint of a police helicopter. He
           switches off his headlights, turning left on Santa Fe Avenue.

           The armed robbers watch in tense silence as Driver weaves in and
           out of the industrial alleyways with his lights switched off.
           It's as if he's trying to find his way out of the maze or
           probing to see if there's anyone out there.

           The armed robbers look relieved when suddenly a police car
           glides past at the end of the alleyway, its lights also off.

           It's like catching a glimpse of a passing shark's fin. Driver
           taps the brakes gently, his car sliding to a stop. He stays
           there a moment, then eases the Impala forward, turning in the
           same direction as the black-and-white.
                         
          14 INT/EXT. IMPALA/ LA RIVER INDUSTRIAL AREA/ DOWNTOWN - NIGHT. 14
                         
           It's a high-risk strategy but Driver follows the black-and-white
           at a distance, hidden in the darkness, knowing other squad cars
           won't be checking the same route. The police car makes its way
           through the dimly lit industrial zone, unaware it's being
           shadowed. Driver turns his car radio up a whisper.
                         
                          BASKETBALL COMMENTARY

           Clippers have the lead. 71 to 69. Seven to

           Centre...
                         
           Driver turns the sound back down. Up ahead, the police car
           swings left, disappearing from view. Driver slows down too,
           anticipating the next obstacle. He doesn't have long to wait. In
           the distance he suddenly sees the piercing beam of a police
           chopper's search-lights, sweeping the area one more time.
                         
           Driver floors the gas, speeding straight towards the approaching
           helicopter. The armed robbers are too stunned to protest. They
           just sit there, watching the sweeping searchlights getting
           closer and closer.
                         
           Then suddenly it becomes clear what Driver's doing. Up ahead,
           there's a small underpass below the 7th Street bridge. Driver
           slides the car under the safety of the bridge just before the
           chopper's searchlights spot them.
                         
          15 INT/EXT. IMPALA/ UNDERPASS/ LA RIVER INDUSTRIAL AREA - NIGHT.15
                         
           The roar of the helicopter thunders overhead. The underpass is
           crammed with dirty mattresses and shopping carts. Sleeping HOBOS
           can be seen under dirty blankets. Driver waits for the echo of
           the helicopter to fade, then moves forward again.
                         
          16 INT/EXT. IMPALA/ OLYMPIC BOULEVARD/ DOWNTOWN - NIGHT. 16
                         
           Gloomy yellow street-lamps shine down on the industrial zone.
           Rows of delivery trucks are parked outside the meat-packing
           factories. Driver cruises cautiously down the deserted street.
           The crackling of the police scanner and the droning of the
           basketball commentary add to the tension. Finally up ahead he
           sees car-lights streaming back and forth on Broadway.

           The armed robbers lie flat on the back seat, paying Driver more
           respect now.
                         
          17 INT/EXT. IMPALA/ BROADWAY/ DOWNTOWN - NIGHT. 17
                         
           There's a steady flow of traffic on Broadway. Driver falls in
           behind the other cars. On the radio, the basketball game is
           still playing.

           The passing head-lamps light up Driver's face. There's not a
           trace of emotion in his eyes -- even when he spots a patrol car
           approaching in the opposite direction.

           The two cars pass each other slowly. Driver sees the cops in the
           Black-and-White peering at the Impala as they head past. He
           turns down the basketball game and focuses on the scanner.

           In the back seat, the armed robbers wait nervously for the
           police dispatch to respond.

           As soon as he hears this Driver swerves sharply into the next
           street.

           Driver bursts out onto Pico now. A squad car headed in the
           opposite direction slows down as it sees him but is caught up in
           the flow of traffic, unable to turn round and give chase.

           Driver threads his way through the vehicles in front of him, so
           smooth and effortless it's hard to tell how fast he's going. He
           glances up as he hears the dull rumble of a police chopper
           overhead. The helicopter is almost directly above him, swinging
           its search-beam back and forth to get a lock on his position.
                         
           Driver pushes the car as fast as it will go, but there's no way
           of outrunning the chopper. Blue light floods the asphalt around
           him as he guns down Figueroa.

           The terraced parking lot looms up ahead. A sign above the
           barrier says `Season Ticket Holders Only'. Driver punches in a
           ticket and roars into the parking lot.

           The Impala screeches from one level to the next. With a game
           going on, the parking lot is almost full. Finally Driver pulls
           into a free parking space.

           Driver glances in his side mirror. Behind him, dozens of FANS
           are already streaming out into the parking lot before the game
           is over, hoping to avoid the inevitable traffic.

           The jubilant commentary continues, but Driver isn't listening
           anymore. The game has served its purpose. More fans flood into
           the parking lot. Dozens of cars pull out of their places.

           Driver glances at the armed robbers and nods. It's time. They
           climb out of the car, merging in with the crowd. Driver watches
           them disappear, then slips on a Clippers cap, climbs out of the
           Impala himself and heads towards another car.

           Outside the parking lot, the police are waiting, stopping
           anything that looks like an Impala, shining their flashlights
           into the windows. Wearing his Clippers cap and a Clippers
           sticker on his new car, Driver calmly drives past them, making
           his getaway.

           Driver's face is fixed ahead, sunglasses hiding his eyes. As we
           PULL OUT we see to our surprise that he's wearing a policeman's
           uniform. It's only as we pull out further that we see several
           other `POLICE OFFICERS' sitting in the same fold up chairs,
           reading car magazines and scripts as they're powdered by MAKE-UP
           GIRLS, and realize we're on a movie set.
                         
           Driver glances up from his script and sees another STUNTMAN
           being fitted with an SFX mask. The stuntman now looks identical
           to the STAR of the movie who stands nearby.

           cue, bearing down on him.

           Driver slows to forty, like he's supposed to, but the black
           Charger keeps coming at speed.
                         
           Driver's eyes stay fixed on his rear view mirror, judging the
           other car's speed and angle of approach to perfection.
                         
           The Charger slams into the back of Driver's car at sixty miles
           an hour, hitting him just above the left rear wheel.
                         
           Driver's reactions are quick as lightning, counter-steering as
           his Black-and-White goes careening off the road. He keeps the
           car upright long enough to slow it down before it finally flips
           end over end.
                         
           Up ahead, the Charger skids to a showy stop.
                         
           2ND UNIT DIRECTOR O/S
           ...And CUT!...
                         
           Some clapping and cheering breaks out, but most the crew
           couldn't care less, returning to their cell-phones and shot
           lists. Only Shannon seems interested in Driver, limping over and
           helping him out of his battered Black-and-White.
                         
                          SHANNON
           Nice work, officer...
                         
           Driver spits out some fake candyglass from the shattered
           windscreen.
                         
          27 INT. NINO'S PIZZERIA/ WESTWOOD - DAY. 27
                         
           A New York style pizza-by-the-slice restaurant. A WAITER takes a
           delivery of Chinese food at the door and carries it over to a
           table where Shannon is sitting with an old friend, BERNIE ROSE.
                         
                          WAITER
           Here you go, Mr. Rose.
           (Taking out the white boxes)
           Egg rolls, chicken chow mein, five flavor
           shrimp and Peking duck.
                         
                          BERNIE ROSE
           Did they remember the chop sticks?
                         
                          WAITER
           Doesn't look like it, sir. Let me run and
           get the guy.
                         
           From the way the waiter hurries off we get a sense of Bernie's
           power and authority. He turns back to Shannon, resuming their
           conversation.

                          BERNIE ROSE
           ...You run a perfectly good business. Why
           would you want to change now?
                         
                          SHANNON
           You know how much my business made last
           year? Thirty Grand. Takes me six months to
           build a car and a couple of seconds for
           these jerks to write it off on a stunt that
           doesn't even make it into the movie.
                         
           Bernie shakes his head but clearly has a soft spot for Shannon.
                         
                          BERNIE ROSE
           How much do you need?
                         
                          SHANNON
           Let me talk you through it first.
                         
                          BERNIE ROSE
           That sounds like a lot.
                         
                          SHANNON
           Doesn't have to be. The big money teams
           burn through three, four million a year but
           that's `cause they're using half a dozen
           test drivers and a stable of cars.
                         
                          BERNIE ROSE
           I don't know anything about car racing but
           I assume there's a reason for that?
                         
                          SHANNON
           Sure, but it's not the only way. All I need
           is a hard-used stock car. We start off with
           the small-town action then work our way up.
           There's close to two thousand events out
           there and once we make the Show we're
           talking millions.
                         
                          BERNIE ROSE
           `Millions'?
                         
                          SHANNON
           There's a fortune to be made. Sponsorship.
           TV deals. We'll even name the team after
           you.
                         
           Bernie looks at his friend in mild exasperation then turns away
           as the waiter returns with a handful of chop sticks.
                         
                          BERNIE ROSE
           Thank you, Ron. You sure you don't want any
           of this?

           Bernie waits for the waiter to leave then continues.
                         
                          BERNIE ROSE
           You still haven't given me a number?
                         
           Shannon hesitates but only for a second.
                         
                          SHANNON
           Four hundred and thirty thousand dollars.
                         
           Bernie Rose can't help grinning at his nerve.
                         
                          SHANNON
           Look, I wouldn't come to you unless I was
           sure about this.
                         
                          BERNIE ROSE
           Come on, Shannon. How can you be sure? What
           have you got these big money teams don't
           have?

           I got a driver.
                         
                          BERNIE ROSE
           And they got half a dozen Drivers you told
           me.
                         
                          SHANNON
           Not like this one.
                         
           He stares at his friend with quiet conviction.
                         
                          SHANNON
           I been working with this guy a long time -
           I've never seen anything like it. I had the
           money I'd back him myself...
                         
           Bernie Rose considers him quietly.
                         
                          BERNIE ROSE
           But you don't have the money.

           Everything I own is in metal. I had to sell
           my Bullit car the other day just to pay the
           gas bill. I'm telling you, Bernie, put this

           Shannon's about to reply when they're interrupted by a big bull
           of a man with a gruff voice.

           Shannon smiles, intimidated by Nino, giving up his seat
           respectfully. Nino doesn't even acknowledge him.
                         
                          BERNIE ROSE

           Take a hike. I need to talk to my partner.
                         
                          BERNIE ROSE

           Driver stands in the elevator as it climbs slowly. It reaches
           the ground floor then the doors slide open. Driver finds himself
           face to face with the pretty girl he saw the other night. She
           looks a little startled to see him, then recovers

           stares out quietly. Irene takes a glance at him, feeling awkward
           in the silence. She looks relieved as the elevator doors finally
           open. Driver steps aside to let her out first.

           only a few feet apart. She seems more aware of his presence than
           he is of hers. She reaches the door to her apartment first.

           Bright sunlight. In the distance we see a trail of dust moving
           across the flatland. Everything is silent, then slowly the hum
           of an engine rises as the stock car turns towards us. It
           shimmers in the heat waves, the noise of its engine getting
           louder as it picks up speed.
                         
           Shannon stands with his friend Bernie Rose at the edge of the
           makeshift track, staring at the glittering car with its colorful

           Even in the cramped space of the roll cage there's something
           effortless about the way Driver controls the car. His eyes are
           fixed in concentration, his body tensing only slightly as he
           lifts his foot off the gas and turns the wheel.

           The glinting vehicle is lost in a cloud of dust, then reappears
           again, moving even faster now. The STOCK CAR'S OWNER, a bearded
           hot-rodder with a t-shirt that says, "Drive it like you stole
           it", joins Shannon with a confident smile.

           Bernie Rose pays no attention to their banter, his eyes fixed
           thoughtfully on the stock car as it finally slows to a stop.
                         
          33 EXT. RACE CAR/ SAUGUS SPEEDWAY - DAY. 33
                         
           Driver climbs out of the car. As he looks up he sees Shannon
           limping over with the stock car's owner, a couple of MECHANICS,
           and Bernie Rose.
                         
                          SHANNON
           Looks a little long in the tooth to me.
           Think we should take her home?...
                         
           Driver shrugs. Shannon grins, turning to Bernie now.
                         
                          SHANNON
           Bernie, this is the driver I been telling
           you about...
                         
           One look at Bernie Rose and Driver senses the power and
           authority behind his deceptively gentle eyes.
                         
                          SHANNON
           Bernie's thinking of investing in our race
           team...
                         
           The old mobster holds out his hand, meeting Driver's gaze.
                         
                          DRIVER
           My hands are a little dirty.
                         
                          BERNIE ROSE
           Don't worry. So are mine...

           He gives Driver a big grin and a warm handshake, sizing him up.
           Driver smiles politely, gazing back at him. The stock car's
           owner interrupts the moment between them, holding a stopwatch.
                         
           STOCK CAR OWNER
           Couldn't see much wrong with that. You beat
           the fastest lap by more than half a second.
                         
                          DRIVER
           You might wanna take a look at the
           suspension before we go again.
           (Turning back to Bernie)
           Nice to meet you...
                         
           Bernie's still studying him.
                         
                          BERNIE ROSE
           You too...
                         
           Their eyes stay on each other, then Driver follows the stock car
           owner and his mechanics back to the car. Bernie Rose stares
           after him quietly, thinking to himself. Shannon can feel he's
           getting interested.
                         
                          SHANNON
           You gonna give me the four?
                         
                          BERNIE ROSE
           I'll give you three for seventy percent...
                         
          34 INT. SUPERMARKET/ ECHO PARK - DAY. 34
                         
           Tinny supermarket music plays in the background. Driver walks
           past the vast selection of instant coffee brands, bemused by the
           choice. Suddenly he notices something out of the corner of his
           eye. At the far end of the aisle his pretty neighbor, Irene, is
           browsing through the confectionery section. Standing next to her
           is a young boy of six or seven, (BENICIO). He grabs a multi-pack
           of snickers and puts it in Irene's shopping basket. Irene calmly
           picks it out, replaces it on the shelf, and takes a single
           snicker bar for him instead. As Driver watches them, the boy
           turns around and notices him. Driver heads down another aisle
           before Irene sees him too, keeping to himself to himself.
                         
          35 EXT. CAR PARK/ SUPERMARKET - DAY. 35
                         
           Driver heads out of the supermarket with a small bag of
           groceries when he spots Irene and Benicio again in the car park.
           Irene sits in a battered Oldsmobile, trying to start the engine.
           She tries several times then gets out in frustration, opening
           the hood and peering at the engine she has no idea how to fix.
           Benicio peers in too, trying to be helpful.

           Driver hesitates, all his instincts telling him to continue to
           his car and drive away, but as he feels Irene's increasing
           frustration he can't help himself, finally heading over to help.
                         
           Irene looks over and sees him coming, surprised at first, then
           smiling. We watch from a distance as they talk now.
                         
          35a INT. ELEVATOR/ APARTMENT BLOCK/ ECHO PARK - DAY. 35a
                         
           Driver, Irene and Benicio stand in silence in the elevator,
           Driver clutching some of Irene's grocery bags.
                         
          36 INT. IRENE'S APARTMENT/ ECHO PARK - DAY. 36
                         
           Driver carries Irene's grocery bags into the kitchen for her.
                         
                          DRIVER
           Where do you want me to put them?
                         
                          IRENE
           Just over there. Thanks...
                         
           Driver places the bags on the kitchen counter.
                         
                          IRENE
           Would you like something to drink?
                         
                          DRIVER
           I'm okay.
                         
                          IRENE
           A glass of water?
                         
                          DRIVER
           Sure...
                         
           She pours him a glass of water and hands it to him.
                         
                          IRENE
           Excuse me a second...
                         
           She walks out of the room, leaving Driver alone with Benicio.
           The little boy stares at him fixedly.
                         
          36a INT. BATHROOM/ IRENE'S APARTMENT - DAY. 36a
                         
           Irene closes the bathroom door behind her, looking at herself in
           the mirror, feeling a little uncertain.

           Benicio's still staring at Driver. Feeling a little awkward,
           Driver takes a long piece of string from his pocket, tugs it
           gently, then holds up two pieces of string.

           Benicio keeps staring at him, puzzled by the magic trick. Irene
           walks back into the room, smiling.
                         
                          IRENE
           You just move to LA?
                         
                          DRIVER
           No, I been here a while.
                         
                          IRENE
           And before that?
                         
                          DRIVER
           Here and there...
                         
                          IRENE
           (A gentle smile)
           Too many questions, huh?...
                         
           Driver smiles back awkwardly, not sure how else to respond.
           Irene switches on the TV for Benicio, sitting him down on the
           couch.
                         
           Driver has a sip of water, glancing around the room. He notices
           a few photographs on a side table. Most of them are of Benicio
           and Irene, but one of them shows the little boy standing next to
           a strikingly handsome Latino man.
                         
           Irene turns around and sees him looking at the picture.
                         
                          IRENE
           That's Benicio's father.
                         
           Driver takes in the significance of this, then looks back at
           her.
                         
                          DRIVER

           He's in jail.

           Isn't that dangerous?

           Passing traffic roars by on the busy street. Irene and Benicio
           are walking home from the bus stop, chatting happily. They look
           like they've just come back from the beach, Irene carrying a
           basket full of towels, Benicio clutching a dusty soccer ball.
                         
           Driver watches them from the window of his apartment, blowing

           The reflection of passing neon rolls down the Camaro's
           windscreen. Driver's cruising down Hollywood Boulevard, shut off
           from the world outside, listening to `Purple Rain'. The HOOKERS
           and HIPSTERS have taken over the streets while up above
           airbrushed movie stars stare down from their lofty billboards.

           It's early morning and Driver's been driving all night, unable
           to sleep. He heads across the parking lot towards a garishly lit
           mini-mall. Up ahead a small group of GANGBANGERS are hanging out
           with intent. They see him coming and look over intimidatingly.
           Driver's only reaction is to bunch his car keys in his hand, the
           longest key sliding between his second and third fingers like a
           weapon. The gangbangers don't see it but the unflinching look in
           his eyes unnerves them and they look away, letting him pass.

           own, working his way through a plate of bacon and eggs.

           and a wrestler's physique. The redneck slides into the seat
           opposite him.
                         
                          BEARDED REDNECK
           You're Shannon's buddy, right? We met last
           year. You drove me and my brother back from
           Palm Springs...

           Driver stares into the redneck's coked-up eyes, then looks back
           down at his food.
                         
                          BEARDED REDNECK
           Next run we hired another wheelman - I
           spent six months in jail, my brother got
           himself killed...
           (He grins through yellowing teeth)
           He wasn't much, mind you, just family...
                         
           Driver doesn't seem to hear him.
                         
                          BEARDED REDNECK
           Thing is -
                         
                          DRIVER
           I'm not interested...
                         
           Driver looks up quietly, fixing him with his icy gaze. The
           Redneck's smile slowly fades. He considers his response for a
           moment, then decides against it, standing up.
                         
                          BEARDED REDNECK
           Well, it's good to see you again...
                         
           Driver carries on eating as if the man didn't exist.
                         
          42 EXT. FORECOURT/ SHANNON'S GARAGE - DAY. 42
                         
           The loud stutter of an unhealthy engine. Shannon sits in the
           second hand race car he bought in Montecito, revving the engine.
                         
                          SHANNON
           Sounds like a goddamn M-16...
                         
           Driver smiles, popping the hood. As Shannon limps out of the
           vehicle he sees a battered Oldsmobile drive into the forecourt.
           He takes one look at the owner, then runs his hand through his
           white hair, breaking into a friendly smile.
                         
                          SHANNON
           Gorgeous day just got even nicer. How can I
           help you, ma'am?
                         
           WOMAN'S VOICE O/S

           I can imagine. That thing must be older
           than I am...
                         
           Driver turns around in surprise now, recognizing Irene's voice.

           Hi...
                         
           A mischievous smile lights up Shannon's face as he watches them.
                         
                          SHANNON

           Driver ignores the sly look in the old man's eyes.
                         
                          SHANNON
           So what seems to be the problem, ma'am?
                         
                          IRENE
           Either it doesn't start or it stalls.
                         
                          SHANNON
           Well, why don't we park her over there and
           take a look...
                         
           Driver is still watching Irene quietly.
                         
                          IRENE
           I can come back later if you're busy...

           He's busy, I'm not...
                         
           Shannon gives Driver another sly look as he takes her car keys.

           The Oldsmobile's engine looks like it hasn't been serviced in
           years. Shannon is bent over the hood.
                         
                          SHANNON
           ...Just my opinion, but I think you should
           consider buying a new car...

           That would be great...
                         
           She glances round and sees Benicio standing in the forecourt
           with Driver, watching him work on his own car now.

           Driver's so busy tuning the engine he hardly notices the boy.
           His lack of interest finally gets a rise out of Benicio.
                         
                          BENICIO
           That thing doesn't work.

           Benicio watches him sullenly, more intrigued than he lets on.
                         
                          BENICIO
           Drive it.

           Okay. Get in the car...
                         
           Benicio considers a moment, then turns and calls out to Irene.
                         
                          BENICIO
           Mama, can I go in the car?!

           We been together about five years now. He
           showed up out of the blue one day, no

           I offered him half the wages I normally pay
           and he didn't even blink. Been exploiting

           The car roars along the drainage canals. In the passenger seat
           Benicio looks tense but exhilarated. The car glides past a
           landscape of abandoned shopping carts, garbage bags, and
           shredded tires, picking up speed all the time.

           Driver's parked the car now in an area of the drainage canal
           which looks like an oasis. He leans against the vehicle, soft
           rock playing on his radio as he watches Benicio climb a tree.

           Benicio is asleep in the back of Driver's car now. Driver's
           giving him and Irene a ride back to their apartment. Irene looks
           at Driver, waiting for him to say something, but he keeps his
           eyes fixed on the road.

           on his bed. Irene takes off her son's clothes and puts on his
           pyjamas, careful not to wake him. Driver slips out of the room,
           uncomfortable with the intimate moment between mother and son.

           Their eyes stay on each other, the attraction palpable. Driver
           finally breaks the tension, making a tentative move towards the
           door. Irene opens it for him, looking up into his eyes. Driver
           knows he could kiss her, wants to, but something inside holds
           him back. Instead he just offers his help.

           Benicio sits in a dentist's chair, looking nervous. Irene sits
           beside him, mimicking his expression, trying to make him relax.

           Irene emerges with Benicio from the dentists. The little boy is
           clutching his mouth, making a show of being in pain. Irene
           teases him gently as they walk. Driver waits for them in his
           car, watching them quietly.

           Soft rock plays on the car radio. Irene sits in the passenger
           seat with a smile. Driver looks at her curiously as he drives,
           no idea why she's grinning. Benicio suddenly leans forward and
           changes the radio to a different station -- hard rock blaring
           out. Driver lets it go for a moment, then changes it back.
           Benicio responds, until it becomes a game, Irene laughing now.

           garage -- fixing cars, taking out some fruit he's left to ripen
           in his tool box for lunch, working on more engines and frames.
           At the end of the day Driver and Shannon examine the stock car.

                          DRIVER
           I can't make Friday.
                         
                          SHANNON
           Yeah? Why's that?
                         
                          DRIVER
           I told Irene I'd drive her to Burbank.
                         
                          SHANNON
           Irene, huh?

           You're seeing quite a lot of the young
           lady.
                         
                          DRIVER
           You're taking a long time to fix her car...

           On the TV, a Japanese cartoon is playing, a masked hero
           confronting the villains, the screen flickering from color to
           black and white. Driver and Benicio sit on the couch, watching
           the cartoon. From their relaxed body language it's clear some
           time has passed and they know each other a little better.
                         
                          DRIVER
           What's happening now?
                         
                          BENICIO
           He's telling him if he doesn't leave the
           earth alone he'll fight him.
                         
           Irene calls out from her bedroom.
                         
           IRENE O/S
           I'm almost ready...
                         
           Driver looks back at the screen. Werewolves appear now,
           surrounding the hero.
                         
                          DRIVER
           Looks like he's in trouble.
                         
                          BENICIO
           He's okay.
                         
           Just as the fight begins the color on the TV screen flickers.

           I'm gonna show you another trick...
                         
           Benicio watches curiously as Driver gets off the couch and
           kneels beside the TV.
                         
                          DRIVER
           This is pretty complicated. You watching?
                         
           Benicio nods. Driver suddenly gives the TV set a hard smack and
           the interference stops.
                         
                          DRIVER
           Think you can remember that?...
                         
           Benicio grins. Driver smiles back then looks away as he hears
           the phone ring. Irene walks out of her bedroom, dressed in her
           waitress's uniform, and answers it.
                         
                          IRENE
           Hello?...Yes?...Yes, this is she...
                         
           Driver sees the look of surprise on Irene's face as she listens
           to the voice on the other end. The doorbell suddenly rings.
           Irene catches Driver's eye and asks him to open it. He heads
           over, checks the spy-hole, then opens the door. A YOUNG WOMAN
           who's sitting for Benicio walks in, looking at Driver curiously.
                         
           YOUNG WOMAN (IRENE'S FRIEND)
           Hi...

           Hi Cindy...
                         
           Irene's friend heads past Driver and scolds Benicio
           affectionately.
                         
                          IRENE'S FRIEND

           It's not the TV. It's a DVD...
                         
           Driver looks back at Irene now. She puts down the phone, forcing
           a smile but still looking distracted.

           the window at the glittering fountain in Echo Park.

           The park looks pretty at night...
                         
           She looks at Driver, watching him quietly, then looks away
           again.
                         
                          DRIVER
           You okay?...
                         
           Irene takes a long time to answer, still staring out of the
           window.
                         
                          IRENE
           That was my husband's lawyer on the phone.
           He's getting an early release...
                         
           She tries to sound casual. Driver takes the news quietly, even
           though it hits him like a sledgehammer.
                         
                          DRIVER
           That's great...
                         
                          IRENE
           I'm happy for Benicio...
                         
           Driver knows she's trying to explain herself but doesn't say
           anything, driving in silence.
                         
           Up ahead the traffic lights turn red and the car slows to a
           stop.
                         
           Inside, the silence is unbearable. Irene pauses, then looks at
           Driver. He's even more handsome in the shadowy half-light,
           something achingly lonely and melancholy about his stillness.
                         
           She hesitates, then moves her hand towards his, brushing the
           back of his hand, then slipping her fingers between his.
                         
           The gesture is tiny but charged with emotion. They both stare
           out in silence, fingers clasped, then Irene gently withdraws her
           hand, as if nothing's happened.
                         
           Outside the lights change to green.

           Irene's husband, STANDARD, has been released from jail and his
           FRIENDS and FAMILY are here to celebrate. Holding Benicio in his
           arms he makes a thank you speech to his guests.
                         
                          STANDARD
           ...I'm touched and grateful that you're all
           here today -- even though I know it's
           probably for the food not me...
                         
           His self-deprecating humor gets a chorus of laughter and
           agreement from the guests. Irene is standing next to her friend
           Cindy, looking a little uncomfortable.
                         
                          STANDARD

           He raises his glass to her.

           feeling even more uncomfortable.

           It's nighttime and the party's getting louder. Standard's on the
           phone to someone, trying to hear them over the music.

           He heads into the bedroom to take the call. The voice on the
           other end is accented and unfriendly.

           him in the bedroom, switching off his phone, and heads over.

           the corridor to have a cigarette when she sees Driver across the
           hallway, locking the door to his own apartment. She hesitates,
           then calls out.

           Suddenly she turns around as she hears her apartment door open.
           Standard stands there with Benicio, holding a bag of trash. He

           great mother.
                         
           Standard rests his hand gently on Benicio's head, still staring
           at Driver.

           looks uncomfortable.
                         
                          IRENE

           good to meet you...
                         
           He slips his arm around his son now and continues down the
           corridor, brushing past Driver on his way to empty the trash.
           Driver looks at Irene, then heads off in the same direction as
           Standard and Benicio to take the elevator. The two men stand
           there in charged silence, one emptying the trash, the other
           waiting for the elevator, only Benicio oblivious to the tension.

           Cheese restaurant. We still sense the distance between Standard
           and Irene, but Benicio seems completely unaware of it, talking
           excitedly as he eats his pizza. Standard reaches out and takes
           Irene's hand gently as he listens to his son.

           A noise of hammering and drills. The corporate signage has been
           scraped off the race car and the seats ripped out. Bernie Rose
           has bought his partner Nino to the garage to take a look at his
           investment.
                         
                          NINO
           ...We paid three hundred fucking grand for
           this?
                         
                          BERNIE ROSE
           I paid for it. Out of my own pocket.
           Anyway, that's just the shell. You start
           with the shell, then you build the frame,
           then the motor.
           (Pointing to an engine nearby)
           I paid three hundred for that. The money
           goes on the inside not the outside.
                         
                          NINO
           Fuck that. If I'm gonna blow three hundred
           I wanna make sure everyone can see it. Go
           waste your money on something else...
                         
           Shannon smiles nervously, worried Nino's going to sabotage his
           deal with Bernie.
                         
                          NINO
           (Pointing to a Thunderbird)
           ...How about that fucking pussy mobile over
           there.
                         
                          BERNIE ROSE
           You buy it. Shannon sell him the car...
                         
           At the far end of the garage Driver hears them laughing, too
           busy working on his car to pay any attention. Shannon opens the
           door of the Thunderbird and invites Nino to take a seat.
                         
                          SHANNON

           He sits heavily in the car and starts prodding and pressing all
           the control buttons as if he wants to break them.
                         
                          NINO

                          NINO
           How about this little clit? I don't know
           whether to fuck it or drive it. Fuck it,
           I'll drive it...
                         
           Bernie Rose shakes his head at his partner's foul language then
           looks away, observing Driver quietly.
                         
           Driver applies a blow torch to his car, so absorbed in his work
           he doesn't hear Bernie Rose approach.
                         
           BERNIE ROSE O/S
           How you doing?...
                         
           Driver hears him and turns off the blow torch, standing up
           respectfully. Bernie Rose gives him a friendly smile.
                         
                          BERNIE ROSE
           So, when's our first race?
                         
                          DRIVER

           You gonna be ready?
                         
           There's something gently challenging in his gaze.
                         
                          DRIVER

           Driver smiles but doesn't respond. Bernie Rose finds him as hard
           to talk to as everyone else. Across the garage, Nino sits in the
           T-Bird with Shannon, still fucking with him. Bernie watches
           them.

           I did some producing back in the 80's.
           Interesting pictures. Kind of European.
           Shannon arranged the cars for us and did
           all the stunts. I knew he was overcharging
           me but I loved having him around. His next
           business venture he tried the same thing
           with some of Nino's friends they broke his
           spine. He never had much luck...
                         
           He's about to continue when they're interrupted by a familiar
           voice.
                         
           STANDARD O/S
           Hey!...
                         
           Driver turns around and sees Irene's husband, Standard, heading
           towards him with a confident smile.

           Bernie Rose barely raises his voice but it's full of quiet
           menace and authority. Standard pauses, stung, but instinctively
           senses this is someone you don't mess with.
                         
                          STANDARD
           I'll wait outside...
                         
           Bernie Rose watches him leave with a look of contempt, then
           turns back to Driver with a smile, resuming their conversation.
                         
                          BERNIE ROSE
           The reason I'm telling you this is because
           he's got a lot invested in you. So do I...
                         
           Their eyes stay on each other with just a hint of tension.
                         
                          BERNIE ROSE
           Anything you need just let me know...
                         
           Driver nods. Bernie Rose studies him a moment, then finally
           walks away.

           with Bernie Rose and Nino, calling out.
                         
                          SHANNON
           Hey, kid! Come say goodbye, the money
           people are leaving!...
                         
           Driver and Standard stare at each other a moment longer then
           Driver breaks off.
                         
                          DRIVER
           Excuse me.
                         
                          STANDARD
           See you around...
                         
           Driver walks off, leaving Standard alone with his thoughts.
           Shannon watches Standard curiously as Driver approaches.
                         
                          SHANNON
           Who was that?
                         
                          DRIVER
           Irene's husband.
                         
                          SHANNON
                          (GRINNING)
           What did I tell you about married women?
                         
           Nino can't resist another dig at Shannon.
                         
                          NINO
           What the fuck do you know about married
           women?
                         
                          BERNIE ROSE
           Can you for once say something without the
           word fuck in it?
                         
           As they continue their banter, Driver glances at Standard. He's
           walking back to his car, dialling someone on his cell phone.

           Passing traffic blurs past. Through the windows of a Mexican
           restaurant we see Irene at work, serving tables in her
           waitress's uniform.

           Driver's parked across the street, watching her from his car. He
           hesitates, conflicted, then finally gets out of the car.
                         
          69 INT. MEXICAN RESTAURANT/ BROADWAY/ DOWNTOWN L.A. - NIGHT. 69
                         
           Irene walks out of the kitchen with a tray of food, then stops
           as she sees Driver sitting at a booth. She looks surprised to
           see him, but pleased, serving her table first then heading over.
                         
                          IRENE
           Hi...
                         
                          DRIVER
           Hi...
                         
           Their eyes stay on each other, oblivious to the noise.
                         
                          IRENE
           We haven't seen you around in a while. You
           must have been pretty busy?...
                         
                          DRIVER
           You look pretty busy yourself...
                         
           She smiles, glancing at the tables she's supposed to serve.
                         
                          IRENE
           What can I get you?
                         
                          DRIVER
           I already ate. I just wanted to see how you
           were?
                         
           His concern touches her and makes her uncomfortable at the same
           time.
                         
                          IRENE
           We're okay. Standard thinks he may have
           found a job so I can give up my night
           shift...
                         
           Driver stares back at her with his intense gaze.
                         
                          IRENE
           Benicio misses you...
                         
           From the way she says it she could almost be talking about
           herself.
                         
                          IRENE

           His gentle gaze is finally too much for her. She grins, excusing
           herself.
                         
                          IRENE
           I better serve some food...
                         
           It's only when she has her back turned that we see how hard this
           is for her. Driver watches her walk away, lost in thought.
                         
          70 INT. KITCHEN/ MEXICAN RESTAURANT - NIGHT. 70
                         
           Irene piles some plates of tacos on her tray, bracing herself to
           go back out and face Driver -- but when she finally walks out
           again he's no longer there.
                         
          71 INT/ EXT. DRIVER'S CAR/ APARTMENT BLOCK/ ECHO PARK - NIGHT. 71
                         
           Driver leans out of his car window and inserts a key to open the
           gates of the underground car park.
                         
          72 INT/ EXT. DRIVER'S CAR/ UNDERGROUND CAR PARK - NIGHT. 72
                         
           As Driver descends into the darkness of the car park, he sees a
           group of SHADOWY FIGURES walking in the opposite direction,
           heading up the ramp, one of them being pushed in a wheelchair.
           Their leader, a large, balding man, (COOK), glances in Driver's
           direction then looks away.
                         
           Driver cruises past the mysterious group and winds his way
           further down the car park. Suddenly he notices something else in
           the shadows. A figure lies sprawled against one of the pillars.
           A smaller figure kneels a few feet away. Driver stops his car
           now, climbing out to see what's happened.
                         
           The prone figure groans in pain. As Driver approaches he
           realizes it's Standard. His face is covered in blood and he
           clutches his ribs. The smaller figure is Benicio. He stares at
           his father helplessly, then looks up at Driver in tears. Driver
           kneels beside Standard, checking nothing's broken.
                         
                          DRIVER
           Can you move?

           He's right here...
                         
           Driver glances at Benicio. He looks terrified. Standard raises
           his head painfully and looks at his son.

           Standard is bent over the sink, splashing water on his face. As
           he turns off the tap he notices how neatly Driver's laid out his
           toothbrush, shaving cream, and razor. He finally turns around
           and looks at Driver.

           over, then stops as he notices something in Benicio's hand. The
           little boy is clutching it as if he's afraid to let go.

           with his girlfriend, BLANCHE, a stunning blonde with short
           cropped hair.
                         
                          COOK
           I've got you to do this fucking job for me,
           why do I need to pay someone else?
                         
           Standard sits next to Driver, holding his ground even though
           he's clearly intimidated by the Albanian.
                         
                          STANDARD
           I'll pay him out of what's left of my
           share. I can't do something like this on my
           own.

           You got Blanche...
                         
           He grins, looking at Driver now. Blanche doesn't even seem to
           hear them, hung-over from the previous night.
                         
                          COOK
           You look like you're hard to work with?
                         
                          DRIVER
           Not if we understand each other.
                         
                          COOK
           What's to understand? It's my score. Either
           you sign on or you don't.
                         
           Driver stares at him quietly, finding it hard to conceal his
           contempt.
                         
                          DRIVER
           I drive. That's all I do.
                         
           Blanche gets up from the table before Cook can respond.
                         
                          COOK
           Where are you going?
                         
                          BLANCHE
           They've forgotten my Coke.
                         
                          COOK
           They'll bring it. Sit down.
           (His eyes still fixed on Driver)
           Standard, why don't you hire a fucking taxi
           cab?
                         
                          STANDARD
           He didn't mean it like that, man...
                         
           Standard looks worried, trying to diffuse the tension.
                         
                          COOK
           So, what does he mean?
                         
           Driver looks him calmly in the eye.
                         
                          DRIVER
           You tell me where we start, where we're
           headed, where we'll be going afterwards. I
           don't take part, I don't carry weapons, I
           drive...
                         
           Standard seems surprised by Driver's professional patter. So
           does Cook. Even Blanche looks interested for once.

           Standard hesitates, but has no choice. As he leaves to fetch
           Blanche her drink, Cook starts to write something down on the
           palm of his hand.
                         
                          COOK
           Okay, here's the deal. This much for
           Blanche, this much for that asshole minus
           what he owes me, and this much for you...
                         
           He holds up the palm of his hand to Driver, the words Fuck Off
           written in marker pen.
                         
                          COOK
           You still interested?
                         
           Driver looks at him, all his instincts telling him to walk away,
           but he stays where he is, thinking of Irene and Benicio.
                         
                          COOK
           Good. Anything else?...
                         
           Driver stares back at him with his clear blue eyes.
                         
                          DRIVER
           We do this job he's paid his debt. You
           leave him and his family alone...
                         
           Cook looks surprised at first, then laughs at his nerve.

           The midday sun beats down on a maze of cars. Driver strolls past
           rows of glittering vehicles until he spots an old model Mustang.

           Driver sits at the dinner table with Standard, Irene and Benicio
           now. Standard's in high spirits, beaming at his wife.
                         
                          STANDARD
           ...I was such a jerk the first time we met.
           We're at this party and I see the most
           beautiful girl I ever laid eyes on and I
           walk over and say, `Hello Miss, my name's
           Standard Guzman'. She takes one look at me
           and asks, `Where's the deluxe version?'...
                          (HE LAUGHS)

           Irene smiles awkwardly, glancing at Driver. Benicio grins, eager
           to please his dad.
                         
                          STANDARD
           You don't get it either do you, Benicio?
           Hope you didn't inherit your Papa's brains.
                         
           He ruffles his son's hair then pours himself another shot of
           tequila. Irene notices he's drinking, turning to Driver.
                         
                          IRENE

           Thanks...
                         
           Their eyes stay on each as she serves him. Standard sees the
           look between them but his only reaction is to drain his glass
           and tuck into his food.
                         
                          STANDARD
           Now this is what I call a deluxe chicken.
           Irene and I are gonna open a restaurant
           together once I raise the money. That's why
           she's working in that Mexican joint. Figure
           out how it's done. She's got more ambition
           than anyone I know, more smarts too...

           The pawn shop is nothing much to look at from the outside,
           another anonymous LA store front. Driver's parked the car a
           hundred yards from the entrance, his police scanner crackling.
           Standard sits beside him in the passenger seat, looking tense.

           Standard considers a moment, then shakes his head.
                         
                          STANDARD
           I gotta do this for them...
                         
           He forces a smile, slips on his sunglasses, then finally opens
           the door.
                         
                          DRIVER
           You got five minutes...
                         
                          STANDARD
                          (GRINNING)
           I'll see you in four...
                         
           Driver watches him cross the street with a strong sense of
           foreboding. Standard enters the pawn shop. Driver starts his
           stopwatch now, listening to the seconds tick away.
                         
           He casts his eyes around the street, observing the smallest
           details -- the number plates of other vehicles; the windows of
           overlooking buildings.
                         
           The white hot sun blazes down, reflecting on the pawn shop
           windows, hiding everything inside.
                         
           The police scanner crackles but picks up no activity. Driver
           listens to his stop watch, in his own world. He starts the
           engine and sets off, cruising slowly past the pawn shop, heading
           for the corner where he told Standard he'd be waiting.
                         
           He pulls over by the curb when suddenly he notices something.
           Parked a hundred yards down the road he sees another vehicle
           glinting in the sunlight. To the ordinary eye it's no different
           from the other cars parked nearby, but to Driver it stands out.
           For one, it's a Chrysler. Secondly, it has reinforced bumpers
           and racing tires.
                         
           Driver's stopwatch shows four minutes now. He looks away from
           the Chrysler, gazing at the doors of the pawn shop, expecting
           Standard and Blanche to burst out at any moment.
                         
           But there's no sign of them.
                         
           The seconds tick away. Five minutes. Driver hesitates, all his
           instincts telling him to drive off, but he stays where he is,
           thinking of Irene.
                         
           Suddenly he sees Standard and Blanche emerge from the pawn shop,
           Standard clutching a big black gym bag in his hand.

           He smiles at Driver as he approaches when suddenly he hears the
           crack of gunshots behind him. Driver sees the look of panic on
           his face as he spins around.
                         
           A GUY IN A SUIT strides out of the pawn shop. Crouching low in
           an expert firing position he squeezes off several shots. The
           force of the bullets sends Standard flying.
                         
           Driver sees him hit the sidewalk, arterial blood pumping from
           his neck. Blanche screams, grabbing the gym bag and leaping into
           the back seat of the car. Driver hesitates, takes one last look
           at Standard's lifeless body, then hits the gas as more gunshots
           crack behind him.
                         
           As Driver's car roars down the street, the Chrysler suddenly
           comes to life, pulling out of its parking place.
                         
          82 INT/ EXT. CAR/ STREET/ TARZANA/ LA - DAY. 82
                         
           Driver glances in his rear-view mirror and sees the Chrysler on
           his tail. It doesn't seem to be trying to close the gap, just
           following at a discreet distance. In the back seat, Blanche zips
           open the gym bag, then stares in shock.
                         
                          BLANCHE
           ...Christ, there wasn't supposed to be this
           much money!...
                         
           There are literally stacks of hundred dollar bills crammed
           inside the gym bag. Driver catches her reaction in the mirror,
           but his attention is focussed on the Chrysler. Up ahead, at an
           intersection, the lights turn red. Driver thinks about running
           them, but decides against it, braking sharply. The Chrysler
           draws up beside him, its windows glinting in the sunlight.
                         
                          BLANCHE
           Move for Chrissakes!...
                         
           Driver ignores her, still watching the Chrysler out of the
           corner of his eye. The lights change to green but Driver doesn't
           move. Nor does the Chrysler. Behind them, other cars start
           honking their horns. Suddenly Driver roars off, swerving left at
           speed.
                         
           The Chrysler reacts, screeching off in pursuit.
                         
           Driver floors the gas. On speed and power his vehicle may be no
           match for the Chrysler, but in traffic the odds are even. He
           weaves his way past the slower cars, putting obstacles between
           himself and the Chrysler. The pursuing car matches him move for
           move, staying on his tail.
                         
           In the back seat, Blanche looks terrified, buckling herself in.

           Driver swerves left then suddenly makes a hard right onto a
           deserted canyon road. The mustang somehow manages to make
           the same turn. It gets close enough to "pit" Driver, its nose
           pressing against the rear corner of Driver's vehicle. 
                         
           Driver's almost run off the road, but manages to save it and
           regains control of his car.
                         
           The Mustang pulls out wide to build momentum and smash into
           him. As it moves in to deliver the knockout blow, Driver
           pulls the Emergency Brake and spins 180 degrees, causing the
           Mustang to miss and lose control for a brief moment.
                         
           Now the two cars are nose to nose, barrelling down the road,
           Driver heading in reverse as fast as he can, the Mustang
           closing fast.
                         
           It rams Driver's front bumper. BAM! The two cars separated
           for an instant.
                         
           The Mustang guns it, ready to smash into Driver again...
                         
           Driver clocks an upcoming three way intersection dotted with
           construction equipment. In a last ditch attempt to evade his
           pursuer he throws a reverse 180, then incredibly keeps going,
           spinning 270 degrees.
                         
           The Mustang tries to make the same turn, but this time the
           maneuver is beyond his ability. Driver's suckered him into a
           corner he can't control. 
                         
           The Mustang crashes into the construction equipment in a
           sickening crunch of metal on metal.
                         
           Driver guns the motor and speeds away.

           The black gym bag lies open on a double bed, full to the brim
           with stacks of cash. Blanche sits on the bed, looking pale.
                         
                          DRIVER

           She glances at the bag, staring at how much more money there is.
           Driver switches on the cheap TV set with the remote, flicking
           through the news channels. There's no mention of the robbery
           yet. He zips up the bag and heads out.
                         
                          DRIVER
           Stay here. Don't answer the door...

           room. Blanche lies on the bed, looking more relaxed. Driver
           picks up the remote and flicks through the channels until he
           finally finds a breaking news story on the robbery. There is a
           police mug-shot of Standard on screen.

           As she disappears inside Driver notices something on the bed
           where she's just been lying. It's her cell phone. Still flipped
           open as if she's called someone recently.
                         
           Driver reaches for the cell phone when he notices the silhouette
           of a MAN crossing the curtains. Someone's outside. The door
           handle of the motel room starts to turn, slowly -- then suddenly
           there's the roar of a shotgun from the bathroom.
                         
           Driver reacts in an instant, rushing towards the bathroom door.
           He has to barge it open, something obstructing his way.
                         
          87 INT. BATHROOM/ MOTEL ROOM - DAY. 87
                         
           Driver almost trips over Blanche's sprawled body as he bursts
           through. One quick glance and he knows she's dead - half her
           head blown off. Another quick glance and he sees her killer, a
           big burly HITMAN, trying to climb through the same bathroom
           window where he just shot her.
                         
           Driver moves like lightning, grabbing the man's arms before he
           can get off another shot and pulling him through the window. The
           hitman lands heavily in a sea of broken glass, cutting his
           forehead open, blinded momentarily by the blood in his eyes.
                         
           Driver takes his opportunity and slams the man's face back into
           the glass strewn floor, stunning him for a few more seconds as
           they struggle. Crawling away, he grabs the towel rack and pulls
           the metal bar off the wall. Using it as a spear he impales the
           hitman and grabs his shotgun.
                         
          88 INT. MOTEL ROOM - DAY. 88
                         
           In the bedroom, the 2nd HITMAN finally kicks the door open.
           Driver bursts through the bathroom door at the same time --
           firing the 1st shooter's shotgun. The force of the blast picks
           up the 2nd hitman and flings him against the wall like a rag
           doll.
                         
           The startling explosion of violence is over just as suddenly as
           it began. Driver slumps to the floor in exhaustion, his hand and
           his arm ripped open by the broken glass. There's blood splatter
           all over the wall. Neon lights from outside flashing on the dead
           man's face. But no panicked footsteps or sirens yet.
                         
           Driver crawls over to the dead hitman and rifles through his
           pockets. All he finds are a set of car keys.

           Shannon stands in his office, listening silently on the phone,
           looking like he's been punched in the gut.

           An underworld doctor, "DOC", a shabbily dressed old man who
           looks well past his prime takes out a small bottle of scotch
           along with his surgical tools, preparing for Driver's arrival.
           Shannon watches him uncertainly then heads downstairs as he
           hears a noise in the garage.

           Shannon arrives downstairs to see Driver walking unsteadily
           towards him in the gloom. Shannon can't help glancing at his
           hands, expecting him to be carrying the bag with the money, but
           there's no sign of it.

           quietly, concerned for him but also curious about the money.

           An elegant apartment full of framed photographs of beautiful
           grandchildren and movie posters from Hollywood's golden age.
           Bernie is in his silk pyjamas, looking like he's just woken up.

           Shannon looks tense but tries to hide it. From next door they
           can hear the sound of raised voices. Bernie Rose grabs the TV
           remote and turns up the volume to drown out his neighbors.

           Sunlight pours through a doorway. Driver heads down some stairs,
           passing some half naked STRIPPERS at the bar. There's a handful
           of CLIENTS watching a pole dance, but otherwise the place is
           empty. Driver turns down a long corridor. A couple of STRIPPERS
           emerge from their changing room, surprised to see him, but he
           puts them at ease with a friendly smile.

           waits, then suddenly kicks the door open, right in Cook's face.
                         
           Before Cook can recover, Driver storms into the office, smashing
           him across the shoulder with the hammer. Cook collapses in a
           heap. Driver's about to hit him again, when he sees that Cook's
           left hand is broken and there are cuts and bruises on his face.
           Someone's clearly given him a beating since the robbery.

           you fronting for?
                         
                          COOK
           Fuck you -
                         
           Driver smashes the hammer into Cook's right hand now, breaking
           it too. Cook screams. Some of the strippers have gathered at the
           door but Driver couldn't care less.
                         
                          DRIVER
           Whose money am I holding?
                         
                          COOK
           Don't worry. They'll come get it. You don't
           know who you're fucking with -
                         
           Driver smashes the hammer into the metal plates supporting
           Cook's left hand. He screams like a stuck pig.
                         
                          DRIVER
           Who's money am I holding?
                         
                          COOK
           (Barely able to get the words out)
           Fuck you...
                         
           The strippers look stunned and riveted at the same time. Driver
           bends over Cook and rifles through his pockets. Finally he finds
           what he's looking for. Cook's cell phone. He scrolls down the
           call log and finds the same number appearing again and again.

           The kitchen is busy, CHEFS taking out hot pizzas from the oven
           and slicing them up in takeaway boxes. In the background we hear
           the phone ringing.

           An impeccably dressed MAN IN A TAN SUIT answers the phone.
                         
                          TAN SUIT
           Hello?...I'm afraid we're closed. Could you

           Driver leans against his car, talking on Cook's cell phone.
                         
                          DRIVER
           I could, but your boss won't be happy when
           he finds out you've kept him waiting...
                         
           Tan Suit looks curious now.
                         
                          TAN SUIT
           Can I ask what this is about?
                         
                          DRIVER
           I have something that belongs to him.
                         
                          TAN SUIT
           And that would be?
                         
                          DRIVER
           A million dollars...
                         
           There's a pause on the other line now.

           Tan Suit walks into the dining area. A large bull of a man sits
           on his own in the empty restaurant with his back to us. It's
           only when he hears Tan Suit approach and turns around that we
           realize it's Nino, Bernie's partner.

           me?...
                         
           The voice is unmistakable. Driver stares quietly.
                         
                          DRIVER
           Seems that way...

                          DRIVER
           I'm not selling. I give you a time and

                          DRIVER
           Just that. Out of it. You put a muzzle on
           Cook, forget your zombies at the Motel,
           forget we ever had this conversation...
                         
           Nino's thinking to himself, looking more concerned than he
           sounds.
                         
                          NINO

           Just you...
                         
           Nino begins to relax now, still calculating.
                         
                          NINO
           You're not very good at this, are you?...

           This isn't what I do. I'll call again with

           room, waiting for his orders.
                         
          104 INT. LIVING ROOM/ IRENE'S APARTMENT/ ECHO PARK - NIGHT. 104
                         
           Irene is sitting on the couch next to Benicio, talking to him
           gently as he watches TV.
                         
                          IRENE
           ...I'll be back before you go to bed. How's
           that sound?...
                         
           The little boy nods, watching his Japanese cartoon. Irene's
           friend, Cindy, is also there, gazing at them both in sympathy.
           Irene looks up at her.
                         
                          IRENE
           Are you going to be okay?
                         
                          CINDY
           We'll be fine...
                         
           Irene gets up to leave when the buzzer rings. She walks over and
           opens the door then stops in surprise. Driver stands there.
                         
                          DRIVER
           You got a minute?...
                         
           She looks at him in a daze.
                         
                          IRENE
           Where have you been?...
                         
           He stares back at her in silence.
                         
                          IRENE
           I tried to reach you. Standard's been -
                         
                          DRIVER
           I know...
                         
           His eyes stay on her, as if he's trying to tell her something
           more. She looks confused, staring back at him curiously when a
           small voice interrupts.
                         
           BENICIO O/S
           Hey...

           Irene begins to see the guilt in his eyes and slowly it hits
           her. She stares in disbelief, reeling.
                         
                          DRIVER
           I'm sorry about your father...
                         
           Benicio nods. Driver keeps staring at the boy but can't find any
           more words of comfort. Irene watches him, still stunned. He
           looks back at her.
                         
                          IRENE
           I can't talk now. I have to go.
                         
                          DRIVER
           Can I give you a ride?
                         
           She stares at him in dismay, close to tears.
                         
                          IRENE
           The car's working fine.
                         
                          DRIVER
           Then let me walk you down...
                         
           She wants to say no but can't.

                          IRENE
           (Almost a whisper)
           Why?...
                         
           Driver misunderstands, thinking she's talking about Standard.
                         
                          DRIVER
           He was into one of the prison gangs for a
           lot of money. He was trying to protect you.
                         
                          IRENE
           Great job...
                         
           She walks faster now, striding towards the elevator. Driver
           follows her.
                         
                          DRIVER
           I still have the money. Whatever you need -
                         
           She turns around and slaps him hard.

           frustration.
                         
                          IRENE
           Just tell me one thing. How did he talk you

                          DRIVER
           He didn't talk me into anything. I've been
           doing this my whole life. It's what I do...
                         
           She stares at him in deep disappointment.

           Stupid me...
                         
           She turns away when the elevator bell rings. The doors open,
           revealing TAN SUIT. Neither Driver or Irene recognizes him but
           we do. He smiles, pretending to look confused.
                         
                          TAN SUIT

           So are we...
                         
           She steps into the elevator. Driver follows her in.
                         
                          TAN SUIT

           Driver and Irene ride down in silence, their eyes fixed on each
           other. Tan Suit watches them quietly, considering a move, but
           Driver glances at him and he smiles, biding his time. The lights
           on the panel descend. The elevator bell finally rings as they
           reach the lower level. Tan Suit hesitates, but Driver waits for
           him to go out first. He nods goodnight and heads off into the
           darkness of the parking lot. Driver follows Irene, the two of
           them heading in the opposite direction.

           hidden in shadow. Driver walks alongside Irene in silence. In
           the distance Tan Suit's footsteps slowly fade.

                          DRIVER
           I'm leaving. I want you to come with me...
                         
           Irene can't believe what she's hearing.
                         
                          IRENE
           What are you talking about?
                         
                          DRIVER
           You and Benicio...
                         
           She's almost too stunned to speak, walking even faster now.
                         
                          IRENE
           You're crazy. I don't even know you -
                         
                          DRIVER
           You will. Once I straighten out this thing
           I'm getting out for good. We'll go some
           place. Anywhere you want.
                         
           She shakes her head, fighting her feelings for him.
                         
                          IRENE
           It doesn't work like that.
                         
                          DRIVER
           Why not?...
                         
           She stops and looks at him.
                         
                          IRENE
           Because people like you never get out. And
           I don't want my son to grow up like that...
                         
           She holds his gaze with regret. Driver's about to respond when
           suddenly he catches a fleeting movement out of the corner of his
           eye.
                         
           A beat -- then he suddenly lunges -- grabbing Irene and pulling
           her to the ground. In the same instant Tan Suit appears out of
           the darkness, opening fire with his automatic.
                         
           Bullets spark as they hit the concrete floor and the other
           parked vehicles. Driver drags Irene behind a car now, covering
           her with his body as Tan Suit fires another burst.
                         
           More sparks light up the darkness, the bullets penetrating the
           car with ease, narrowly missing Driver and Irene.
                         
           Driver moves again, dragging the terrified Irene behind him. Tan
           Suit loses sight of them in the darkness, striding past rows of
           parked cars.

           Driver turns to Irene as they take cover behind a pillar. She
           looks terrified -- not just of Tan Suit but of him. It's as if
           all her worst fears have been confirmed.
                         
           Driver stares back at her, then hears Tan Suit's footsteps
           approaching.
                         
           He holds her gaze apologetically, then gets to his feet and
           runs, trying to draw Tan Suit's fire.
                         
           Tan Suit hears him and opens up again, more bullets lighting up
           the darkness. Driver keeps moving. Tan Suit strides after him,
           reloading, when suddenly his gun jams.
                         
           Crouching behind another vehicle, Driver sees this and takes his
           chance, darting out after his pursuer. Tan Suit sees him coming
           and runs, the hunter becoming the hunted now.
                         
           Still lying on the ground, Irene listens to their echoing
           footsteps.
                         
           Driver runs after Tan Suit through the darkness, gaining all the
           time. Tan Suit looks desperate now, tiring. He turns to face his
           pursuer but Driver's on him in a flash, hurling him against a
           car.
                         
           Tan Suit slams into the car, losing his balance. Driver grabs
           him, swinging him around, smashing him into another car.
                         
           Irene's watching from the shadows, stunned by the violence. She
           picks herself up and runs towards the elevator.
                         
           Driver keeps slamming Tan Suit against the car, beating the
           resistance out of him. As his body begins to slump, Driver grabs
           him by the throat and rams his head into a car window.
                         
           The glass splinters with blood, the force of the blow shattering
           Tan Suit's skull.
                         
           Driver looks around for Irene now and sees her standing in the
           elevator, framed against the light.
                         
           She stares back at him, but makes no attempt to step out.
                         
           Driver stands there, his hands covered in Tan Suit's blood. The
           elevator doors finally close, hiding Irene from view.

           Shannon gets out of his car. Driver is waiting for him by his
           own car, silhouetted against the streetlight. Shannon stares at
           him a moment, then notices the blood stains on his shirt.

                          DRIVER
           Nino's guys came after me. How did they
           know about Irene?
                         
           Shannon takes a moment to reply, looking dazed.
                         
                          SHANNON
           I called Bernie...I asked if he could help.
           Him and Nino are like brothers. I told him
           you weren't interested in the money, that
           you only did it for the girl...
           (From the heart)
           I wanted to make sure once you returned the
           money that was the end of it...
                         
           Driver doesn't seem to hear him.
                         
                          SHANNON
           Let me talk to Bernie again. They probably
           didn't listen to him -
                         
                          DRIVER
           It's too late...
                         
           Shannon says nothing now, knowing he's right.
                         
                          DRIVER
           They're gonna come after you to find me.
           You have to leave...
                         
           Shannon takes this in slowly.
                         
                          SHANNON
           What are you gonna do?...
                         
           Driver doesn't answer, but from his silence Shannon can guess.
                         
                          SHANNON
           How the fuck did this happen? We're
           supposed be in Charlotte or Daytona
           drinking champagne out of trophies and
           getting laid by pit lizards...
                         
           He stares at Driver with quiet regret.

           Bernie Rose looks quietly furious.
                         
                          BERNIE ROSE
           ...I already gave you my advice. You should
           have taken your money and left this guy
           alone.
                         
           Nino and Cook sit opposite him, both of Cook's hands broken now.
                         
                          NINO
           It's not that simple, Bernie.
                         
                          BERNIE ROSE
           Not now that it's bounced up in your face.
                         
                          COOK
           Mr. Paolozzi, I owe you this guy. Just give
           me the okay and I'll -

           You like taking orders, go shut the blinds.
                         
           He looks at Cook's broken hands.
                         
                          BERNIE ROSE
           Sun's in my eyes...
                         
           Nino doesn't look at Cook, a clear indication he should do as
           he's told. Cook stands up, humiliated, and walks over to the
           windows. Bernie Rose waits for Nino to explain.
                         
                          NINO
           ...The money belonged to a half assed
           wiseguy from Philly. I had a tip-off he was
           keeping a million in a pawn shop and was
           gonna invest it here in LA, try to run a
           rival operation. I wanted to teach him a
           lesson...
                         
           The lights in the restaurant gradually fade as Cook shuts the
           blinds.

           Cook sits back down at the table, having closed the blinds. Nino
           looks almost embarrassed for once.
                         
                          NINO
           This was off to the side, Bernie. I didn't

                          BERNIE ROSE
           Well, now you fucked up I am involved.

           they pinch my cheek, treat me like a
           fuckin' kid. They're the reason we left New
           York in the first place. Decrepit old men

           He calls Nino by his childhood name now, emphasizing the fact
           that they're both outsiders in this organization. For the first
           time Nino's tough guy act slips and he looks anxious.

           people who can tie me to the robbery.
                         
                          BERNIE ROSE
           What about this prick?
                         
           He doesn't even bother to look at Cook.
                         
                          COOK
           Mr. Paolozzi -
                         
                          NINO
           Shut up...
                         
           The two friends stare at each other as if Cook didn't exist.
                         
                          BERNIE ROSE
           Are you asking my permission?
                         
                          NINO
           I'm asking for your help. I shoulda' come
           to you first, Bernie. I know that. We're a
           team.
                         
           He stares at Bernie apologetically, appealing to their
           friendship.
                         
                          NINO
           I'll pay you back the three hundred you
           spent on the race car.
                         
                          BERNIE ROSE
           It's not about the money...
                         
           He stares out quietly, torn.

           Pass the salt...
                         
           Cook hesitates, thinking Bernie's fucking with him for having
           two broken hands. He stares back dumbly and it's the final
           straw. Bernie suddenly grabs a stainless steel fork and rams it
           in his eye. As Cook screams, Bernie takes a knife and buries it
           in his neck. He twists the knife deeper for good measure, then
           with one powerful sweep of his arm clears Cook off the table.
                         
           Cook's not dead yet, just writhing on the floor, choking on his
           own blood. Bernie Rose keeps his eyes fixed on Nino.
                         
                          BERNIE ROSE
           Your turn to clean up after me...

           The CREW are setting up for their first shot of the day. In the
           background we see a DIRECTOR blocking out an action scene.
           Driver walks past without even a glance, heading towards the
           make-up trailer. He opens the door and walks in, looking around
           the trailer until he finds what he's looking for -- the SFX mask
           he saw previously on the film set.

           Shannon limps down the steps from his office with a suitcase in
           his hand. He heads into the main garage then suddenly stops.
           Bernie Rose stands beside the stock car, waiting for him.
                         
                          BERNIE ROSE

           Door's always open to you...
                         
           Bernie Rose heads towards him with his hands in his coat
           pockets.
                         
                          BERNIE ROSE

                          SHANNON
           You break in like this I figure it's bad
           news.
                         
                          BERNIE ROSE
           It's bad luck. Two thousand heists in this
           city a year, he had to pick the wrong one.
                         
                          SHANNON
           He tried to put it right.
                         
                          BERNIE ROSE
           Picked the wrong guy for that too. My
           partner's a belligerent asshole with his
           back against the wall...
                         
           He stops, facing Shannon.
                         
                          BERNIE ROSE
           Right now so am I. I don't take care of
           this I'm in big trouble...
                         
           He stares at his old friend.
                         
                          BERNIE ROSE
           Any idea where he is?
                         
                          SHANNON
           Probably across the border by now. Mexico.
           Belize. That's where I'd go...
                         
           Bernie Rose smiles, not believing a word.
                         
                          BERNIE ROSE
           He just walked out on you after everything
           you've done for him, took all the money?
                         
                          SHANNON
           That's gratitude, I guess.
                         
           Bernie Rose can't help grinning, fond of Shannon despite
           everything.
                         
                          BERNIE ROSE
           I ever tell you how long Izzy and I been
           friends? Since we were six. Only Jews in a
           neighborhood of wops. Long as I can
           remember he was getting me into trouble and
           I was getting him out of scrapes...
                         
           He looks almost apologetic.

                          BERNIE ROSE
           What's this fucking kid to you anyway?
                         
           Shannon shrugs, no idea himself.
                         
                          BERNIE ROSE
           I leave here without finding out where he
           is, there'll be others coming after me. I
           guarantee they'll be too stupid to figure
           out you won't talk and drag this out
           unnecessarily...

           Bernie Rose holds his gaze, then looks away, admiring the shiny
           stock car.
                         
                          BERNIE ROSE
           You know, it's too bad, I was getting
           excited about our race team, having my name
           all over the car. I think we could have
           made something of this business...
                         
                          SHANNON
           Nah, I'd have fucked it up too...
                         
           Shannon smiles, reconciled with himself. Bernie Rose grins, and
           extends his hand. They shake hands firmly, like old friends,
           when suddenly Shannon recoils, as if he's been stung.
                         
           We see now that his shirt sleeve is covered in blood, his vein
           cut all the way from his elbow to his wrist. He looks dazed,
           paralysed with shock.
                         
           Bernie Rose holds a razor knife in his hand, the blade wet with
           Shannon's blood. He takes Shannon gently by the arm and sits him
           down against the boot of the stock car.
                         
                          BERNIE ROSE
           You won't feel a thing. Close your eyes and
           you'll fall asleep...
                         
           Shannon stares out numbly, the life ebbing out of him. Bernie
           Rose watches him quietly, wiping his bloody razor with a
           handkerchief.

           Bernie Rose replaces the razor knife in a small lacquered box
           full of other knives. From next door he can hear his neighbors
           arguing again. He stands there a moment, deflated, then suddenly
           storms towards his front door.

           A loud knocking. Bernie Rose's neighbor opens his door.

           There's something threatening in the old mobster's eyes now. The
           husband moves to close the door but Bernie jams it open with his
           elbow, shoves him aside, then looks over at the wife.

           on his throat.

           You're lucky to have her, lucky she's put

           Sunlight glints on the parked vehicles by the curb. Driver slows
           down as he approaches the sign for Shannon's Custom Kings,
           glancing out of the window to see if anyone's staking out the
           garage. Satisfied there's no-one there, he drives through.

           Driver pulls open the garage door and sees the rows of vintage
           cars shimmering in the shafts of sunlight. As he heads past the
           vehicles he suddenly spots a figure slumped against the stock
           car. Shannon's eyes have been closed, his head resting gently
           against the trunk of the car.
                         
           Driver kneels down and lifts him up in his arms, holding him for
           a second, then lays him down on the floor. He turns back and
           opens the car boot now, revealing the black gym bag full of
           money.

           curious image for a moment, then reveal a beautifully dressed
           WOMAN polishing his shoes. And now we see more of Nino's MEN,
           also smartly dressed and accompanied by GORGEOUS WOMEN, getting
           ready for an event. Nino's talking to his wife on the phone.
                         
                          NINO
           Alright honey, I'll pick you up in an hour.
                         
          116 EXT. NINO'S PIZZERIA - SUNSET. 116
                         
           Two big Lincoln Towncars are parked outside. Across the road we
           recognize Driver's car. He opens the trunk. When he closes it
           again we see that he's wearing the eerily convincing SFX mask.
           He crosses the road, entering the pizzeria.

          117 INT. NINO'S PIZZERIA - SUNSET. 117
                         
           Several of Nino's men look up as Driver enters but none of them
           recognize him.
                         
                          NINO'S GUY
           We're closed...
                         
           Driver stares past them at Nino in the kitchen, surrounded by
           more of his men. We feel his mind calculating then he walks out
           again.
                         
          118 EXT. NINO'S PIZZERIA - NIGHT. 118
                         
           Nino emerges with his bodyguards now, heading towards one of the
           white Lincolns.
                         
                          NINO
           (To one of his men)
           I'm going to pick up my wife. I'll meet you
           there...
                         
           Across the road Driver climbs into his car, still wearing the
           mask. He starts his car, setting off after Nino's Lincoln.
                         
          119 INT. DRIVER'S CAR/ NINO'S PIZZERIA/ WESTWOOD - NIGHT. 119
                         
           Driver drifts in behind a couple of other cars, keeping them
           between himself and the Lincoln.
                         
          120 EXT. STREETS - NIGHT. 120
                         
           The sunlight is fading fast. The neon cityscape has come to life
           and the streets are a sea of glittering lights.
                         
          121 INT. NINO'S CAR/ STREETS - NIGHT. 121
                         
           The CHAUFFEUR checks his mirror as he turns into another street,
           seeing only the anonymous glare of headlights behind him.
                         
          122 INT. DRIVER'S CAR/ STREETS - NIGHT. 122
                         
           Driver slows down and lets another car turn in front of him,
           keeping it between himself and Nino's car.
                         
          123 EXT. STREETS - NIGHT. 123
                         
           The streets are less crowded in this residential area. As the
           car in front of Driver pulls into its front drive, Driver takes
           the next turning, making sure the Lincoln doesn't spot him.
                          76
                          9/24/10
                         
                         
                         
                         
          124 INT. DRIVER'S CAR/ PARALLEL STREET - NIGHT. 124
                         
           Driver cruises along another residential street. At every
           intersection we glimpse the Lincoln heading in the same
           direction down a parallel street.
                         
          125 EXT. SAN VINCENTE BOULEVARD/ BRENTWOOD - NIGHT. 125
                         
           The Lincoln turns back into traffic on San Vincente.
                         
          126 INT. NINO'S CAR/ SAN VINCENTE BOULEVARD - NIGHT. 126
                         
           Nino's talking on a cell phone in the back seat.
                         
                          NINO
           ...Sure, Carlo, I'll send him your
           regards...
                         
          127 INT. DRIVER'S CAR/ SAN VINCENTE BOULEVARD - NIGHT. 127
                         
           Driver merges in with the traffic, weaving between the cars in
           front of him until he has Nino's Lincoln back in his sights.
                         
          128 EXT. AERIAL VIEW/ SAN VINCENTE BOULEVARD - NIGHT. 128
                         
           The sun has almost set, the red backlights of the cars blinking
           in the fading light.
                         
          129 INT. NINO'S CAR/ SAN VINCENTE/ 7TH STREET - NIGHT. 129
                         
           Nino's car turns into 7th Street.
                         
          130 INT. DRIVER'S CAR/ SAN VINCENTE/ 7TH STREET - NIGHT. 130
                         
           This time there are no other vehicles turning into the same
           street. Driver has no choice, settling in behind the Lincoln.
                         
          131 INT. NINO'S CAR/ 7TH STREET/ PACIFIC PALISADES - NIGHT. 131
                         
           The chauffeur glances in his rear-view mirror and spots Driver's
           car for the first time. For now he doesn't give it much thought.
           In the back seat Nino finally says goodbye on the phone.
                         
                          NINO
           ...Nice talking to you too...
           (As he hangs up)
           Asshole...
                         
          132 EXT. ENTRADA DRIVE/ PACIFIC PALISADES - NIGHT. 132
                         
           Both cars head into Entrada Drive.
                          77
                          9/24/10
                         
                         
                         
                         
          133 INT. NINO'S CAR/ ENTRADA DRIVE/ PACIFIC PALISADES - NIGHT. 133
                         
           The chauffeur checks his mirror again and notices Driver's car
           still on his tail. Just as a precaution he slows down, seeing if
           the pursuing car will overtake.
                         
          134 INT. DRIVER'S CAR/ ENTRADA DRIVE - NIGHT. 134
                         
           Driver has to decide in an instant whether to take up the
           invitation. He overtakes the Lincoln, speeding ahead.
                         
          135 INT. NINO'S CAR/ ENTRADA DRIVE/ PACIFIC PALISADES - NIGHT. 135
                         
           Nino's chauffeur sees Driver's car disappear up ahead, relaxing
           now.
                         
          136 INT. DRIVER'S CAR/ WEST CHANNEL ROAD/ PCH - NIGHT. 136
                         
           Driver puts his foot on the gas, taking sharp turns on small
           side streets, driving fast around the block until he's back on
           the Lincoln's tail, keeping a safe distance now.
                         
          137 INT. NINO'S CAR/ W.CHANNEL RD./ PCH - NIGHT. 137
                         
           Nino's chauffeur turns right into the Pacific Coast Highway.
                         
          138 INT. DRIVER'S CAR/ PACIFIC COAST HIGHWAY - NIGHT. 138
                         
           Driver follows the Lincoln at a distance, keeping the winding
           corners of the PCH between himself and his prey.
                         
          139 EXT. AERIAL VIEW/ PACIFIC COAST HIGHWAY - NIGHT. 139
                         
           From above we see Driver's car gliding along the open highway,
           the rising hills on one side, the churning ocean on the other,
           no vehicles in sight.
                         
          140 INT. NINO'S CAR/ PACIFIC COAST HIGHWAY - NIGHT. 140
                         
           In the back seat Nino dials another number on his cell-phone.
                         
                          NINO
           ...Bernie, it's me...
                         
          141 EXT. AERIAL VIEW/ PACIFIC COAST HIGHWAY - NIGHT. 141
                         
           The headlights of Driver's car sweep ahead of it on the open
           road. From above it looks like a shark closing in on its prey.
                         
          142 INT. BERNIE ROSE'S APARTMENT/ LA - NIGHT. 142
                         
           Bernie Rose stands by the window, listening to the phone in
           silence.
                          78
                          9/24/10
                         
                         
                         
                         
          143 INT. NINO'S CAR/ PACIFIC COAST HIGHWAY - NIGHT. 143
                         
           Nino sounds apologetic.
                         
                          NINO
           ...Look, about that thing today...I'm
           sorry. I know how much you liked the guy...
                         
           In his rear view mirror the chauffeur sees the headlights of the
           car behind getting closer.
                         
          144 INT. DRIVER'S CAR/ PACIFIC COAST HIGHWAY - NIGHT. 144
                         
           Driver stares ahead, his eyes fixed on the Lincoln's backlights.
                         
          145 INT. BERNIE ROSE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT. 145
                         
           Bernie Rose doesn't speak, looking weary.
                         
           NINO O/S
           Bernie?...
                         
                          BERNIE ROSE
           Yeah?...
                         
           NINO O/S
           You're the only fucking person in the world
           I trust. I love you, man...
                         
           Bernie shakes his head, the same old apologies.
                         
          146 INT. NINO'S CAR/ PACIFIC COAST HIGHWAY - NIGHT. 146
                         
           In the front seat Nino's chauffeur checks his mirror curiously.
                         
                          NINO
           When this is over I'll make it up to you, I
           swear...
                         
           The lights of the car behind have vanished.
                         
          147 EXT. AERIAL VIEW/ PACIFIC COAST HIGHWAY - NIGHT. 147
                         
           Even from above we can't see Driver's car with its lights off -
           no idea how close it is to Nino's car.
                         
          148 INT. BERNIE ROSE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT. 148
                         
           Even though he's still angry, Bernie can't help forgiving his
           childhood friend.
                         
                          BERNIE ROSE
           How many times I heard that before...
                          79
                          9/24/10
                         
                         
                         
                         
          149 INT. NINO'S CAR/ PACIFIC COAST HIGHWAY - NIGHT. 149
                         
           Nino grins.
                         
                          NINO
           I lost count -
                         
           Suddenly blazing headlights explode to life behind him.
                         
          150 INT. DRIVER'S CAR/ PACIFIC COAST HIGHWAY - NIGHT. 150
                         
           Driver rams the Lincoln at over a hundred miles an hour, hitting
           it just above the left rear wheel.
                         
          151 EXT. PACIFIC COAST HIGHWAY - NIGHT. 151
                         
           The impact is momentous. The huge Continental is lifted up in
           the air and spun round at the same time. It slams back into the
           tarmac then flips end over end for a hundred yards.
                         
          152 INT. BERNIE ROSE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT. 152
                         
           Bernie Rose is left holding the phone as the line goes dead.
                         
          153 INT. DRIVER'S CAR/ PACIFIC COAST HIGHWAY - NIGHT. 153
                         
           The collision has barely knocked Driver off course. His car
           skids to a stop near the overturned wreck.
                         
          154 INT. NINO'S CAR/ PACIFIC COAST HIGHWAY - NIGHT. 154
                         
           Among the carnage, we see Nino, bloodied but still alive. He
           unbuckles his seat belt and crawls out of the twisted wreck.
                         
          155 EXT. PACIFIC COAST HIGHWAY - NIGHT. 155
                         
           Driver gets out of his car, calmly walking over to the
           pulverized Lincoln. He sees Nino stumbling off towards the beach
           but doesn't hurry after him yet. He checks to make sure the
           other passengers are dead, then heads on.
                         
          156 EXT. BEACH/ OCEAN/ PACIFIC COAST HIGHWAY - NIGHT. 156
                         
           Nino stumbles through the sand, running for his life now. He
           looks behind him and sees Driver calmly pursuing him. He keeps
           running, but he's badly injured, slowing all the time. Fear
           clouds reason and he staggers towards the crashing waves.
                         
           Driver slows down as he watches the gangster wade into the
           ocean, a pathetic last attempt to evade him. The crashing waves
           and the undertow are an impenetrable wall. Every time Nino tries
           to wade out further, the ocean drags him back.

                         156 CONTINUED: 156
                         
           Driver stares at his trapped prey. Nino's attempts become more
           and more feeble as the ocean exhausts him and snuffs out any
           hope of escape. Finally he retreats back into the shallow water,
           barely able to keep his footing. He turns around and faces
           Driver, the crashing waves still smashing into his back.
                         
           They stay like that for a moment. Gazing at each other. Driver
           silhouetted against the white sand. Nino trapped in the ocean.
           Then Driver wades out into the water. Nino has no fight left in
           him, staring at the masked man. Driver stares back at him then
           grabs him by the throat, forcing his head under the water. Nino
           splutters as Driver lets him up again.
                         
                          NINO
           It was Bernie...Bernie Rose killed your
           friend not me...
                         
           Driver shoves his face back under the water, keeping it there
           until Nino's body finally stops thrashing.
                         
          157 INT. BERNIE ROSE'S APARTMENT/ BEL AIR - NIGHT. 157
                         
           A phone shrills. Bernie Rose answers it.
                         
                          BERNIE ROSE
           Nino?
                         
           DRIVER'S VOICE ON THE PHONE
           He's dead.
                         
           Bernie Rose stares out in silence. Whatever he thinks of Nino, a
           part of him has died. We feel the regret in his eyes but there's
           no trace of emotion in his voice.
                         
                          BERNIE ROSE
           Looks like me, you and your girlfriend are
           the only pieces left on the board...

           Driver is no longer wearing a mask, framed against the ocean. He
           catches the veiled threat in Bernie's words but doesn't respond.

           A large Chinese restaurant. We follow Driver through the crowd.
           He sees Bernie Rose sitting at a table on his own, pouring
           himself a glass of wine. The mobster's dressed for the occasion,
           wearing a jacket and tie. He smiles at Driver as he sits down.
                         
                          BERNIE ROSE
           Care for a glass?...
                         
           Driver doesn't smile, gazing back at him across the table.
           Bernie Rose doesn't seem to care.
                         
                          BERNIE ROSE
           I can recommend the duck. Hell, I can
           recommend everything -- Walnut prawns,
           shredded beef, Velvet chicken -- but the
           duck's to die for...
                         
           He delivers the last line with a pointed smile, then turns away,
           calling over a WAITRESS.
                         
                          BERNIE ROSE
           The duck, please. For two.

           No, thanks...
                         
           He waits for the waitress to leave, then turns back to Driver.
                         
                          BERNIE ROSE
           You've been on a roll. Cut yourself quite a

                          BERNIE ROSE
           We usually don't. But it comes down on our
           heads regardless. Look at Shannon...
                         
           Driver holds his gaze, the tension palpable, laughter and
           conversation drifting over from the other tables.
                         
                          BERNIE ROSE
           Anyway it's water under the bridge now.
           Question is where does that leave us?
                         
                          DRIVER
           That's up to you.
                         
                          BERNIE ROSE
           You bring the cash?
                         
           Driver nods. Bernie Rose studies him quietly.
                         
                          BERNIE ROSE
           Tell me something, how does someone with no
           interest in money get mixed up in a heist?
           (Off his silence)
           Shannon told me it was because of the girl?
                         
           Driver hesitates, betraying a hint of concern. Bernie sees it
           and smiles.
                         
                          BERNIE ROSE
           Don't worry. Nobody else knows about her.
           Just me...
                          (A BEAT)
           You still see her?...

           She's not interested.
                         
                          BERNIE ROSE
           She's got her head screwed on right. I got
           two ex-wives, three kids, four
           grandchildren. Not one of them speaks to me
           now...
                         
           He smiles again, looking into Driver's eyes with just a hint of
           sympathy.
                         
                          BERNIE ROSE
           This is what I'll do for you. You give me
           the money, nobody knows she exists. But
           it's a different matter with you.

           Driver's car is parked at the back of the parking lot, half
           hidden by a fenced area for garbage. Driver pops the trunk,
           taking out the black gym bag with the cash. Bernie Rose doesn't
           even look at it, still admiring the car.

           Driver reaches out to give him the bag, when suddenly Bernie's
           hand snakes out of his pocket, twisting a switch-blade into
           Driver's gut. He pulls it out, ready to stab again, but this
           time Driver catches his wrist, slowly forcing the knife up to
           his throat.
                         
           Their eyes are fixed on each other for a moment, with something
           like regret, then the blade pierces Bernie Rose's neck, sinking
           deeper and deeper. Driver holds the old man in his arms as he
           dies. They stay like that, locked in a fatal embrace, then
           Driver lowers Bernie Rose gently to the ground, out of sight.
                         
           Blood seeping through his shirt, Driver picks up the gym bag and
           puts it back in the trunk, slamming the door shut.

           Driver climbs out of his car, wearing a jacket over his blood-
           soaked shirt. He walks to the back of the car, kneels down, and
           hides the keys behind the left rear wheel, drops of blood
           dripping on the tarmac beneath him. He gets up again, then sets
           off through the maze of parked vehicles, dialling a number on
           his cell-phone.

           There's a bag in the trunk with some money.
           Keys are under the left rear wheel...
                         
                          IRENE
           What do you want me to do with it?...
                         
           Driver walks with difficulty, finding it hard to breathe.
                         
                          DRIVER
           It's yours. It's safe to keep it...
                         
           All around him the Chevys, Dodges, and Fords glitter in the
           sunlight.
                         
                          IRENE
           I told you, I don't need your money...
                         
           Blood seeps through Driver's shirt, dripping on the tarmac.
                         
           Irene hears his labored breathing now, looking concerned.

           Are you okay?...
                         
           Driver's skin looks deathly pale, his eyes a haunting shade of
           blue. He keeps walking through the maze of cars, casting his
           eyes from one vehicle to the next, looking for the perfect ride.
                         
                          DRIVER
           Just out of breath...
                         
           Finally he spots a beautiful white Camaro up ahead.
                         
                          DRIVER
           How're you doing?...
                         
           For the first time we see the Echo Park fountain sparkling in
           the background.
                         
                          IRENE
           Fine. I'm in the park with Benicio...
                         
           Irene can no longer hold back her tears, heartbroken.
                         
           Driver stops in front of the white Camaro, unsteady on his feet.
                         
                          DRIVER
           I gotta go Irene...
                         
           He pauses.
                         
                          DRIVER
           Meeting you was the best thing that ever
           happened to me...
                         
           Irene smiles sadly.
                         
                          IRENE
           It was nice to meet you too...
                         
          165 EXT. LARGE PARKING LOT/ LA - DAY. 165
                         
           From above we see the maze of vehicles stretching out forever --
           Chevys, Chryslers, Fords -- the history of America on wheels.
           Driver switches off his cell-phone reluctantly then heads
           towards the Camaro.

           Driver climbs into the front seat of the Camaro, catching his
           breath. He sits there a moment, sheltering from the world
           outside, then pulls out a pocket knife, opening the blades until
           he finds the screwdriver. He starts with the left side of the
           steering column, then gets to work on the section below the turn
           signal.

           His face shows the strain, but his fingers are as steady as
           ever. A master at work. Finally he breaks into the ignition
           device, leaning back in the seat to take a rest.

           Driver's face is completely still now. So are his eyes. He looks
           almost at peace. There's a long pause, then slowly he leans
           forward and turns on the ignition. As the engine comes to life,
           we CUT TO BLACK.

          EXT. LAUGHTER, COLORADO - DAY

          Half a dozen abandoned shacks and a boarded up gas station
          make up the central hub of Laughter, Colorado. She'd be a
          ghost town âcept the ghosts considered her a shithole ages
          ago and baled. The buck ten for leaded sign gives us an idea
          how long ago this place went dry.
          Suddenly an old Chevy RIPS around the corner, wheels sending
          PLUMES of dust skyward.

          INT. OLD CHEVY - DAY

          Three grimy looking fuckers are stuffed into the cab.
          FUCKING DRIVER looks as though he may piss himself. FUCKING
          MIDDLE twists around, glares through the back glass and
          FUCKING PASSENGER white-knuckles a tire iron.

                         FUCKING DRIVER
          Goddamned old man!

                         FUCKING PASSENGER
          I thought he was dead! She said he
          was dead!

                         FUCKING MIDDLE
          I don't see him. Just go. I think
          we lost him.

          EXT. LAUGHTER - MAIN STREET - DAY

          They race through the dusty derelict little town, peeling for
          the main road in the distance when they round a corner --
          --to face a â70 PLYMOUTH ROADRUNNER, beat to shit, engine
          screaming. SPEEDING head on. This ain't chicken because
          these three Fuckers don't even have time to react before:

                         MILTON
          âThe Old Manâ, shock of white hair, drives the Roadrunner,
          locks the tires and spins the wheel.
          The Roadrunner fishtails, slides sideways AT THEM!
          The truck's gonna ram the driver's side. At least it would

                         BUT:
          MILTON AIMS A SHOTGUN through the driver's side window.
          Fearless. Pissed off. He FIRES!

                         

                         

                         

                         

          2.
          The shot BLOOMS right at us! Then SLOWS TO NEAR FROZEN -
          Hanging in mid-air - suspended, like we could touch it:
          TITLE CARD appears--

                         "DRIVE ANGRY"
          --then the shot BURSTS through the title! SHATTERING the
          words right at us!

                         ANOTHER ANGLE
          ...EXPLODING into the hood of the Chevy! The hood RIPS up,
          SLAMS the windshield.
          Truck CAREENS out of control!
          Milton GUNS the Roadrunner away from truck...but...
          KRAACK - The Truck nails the Roadrunner's rear quarter panel.
          Roadrunner and truck go into a spin. A tornado of dust
          SWIRLS around the two vehicles.
          The Roadrunner SPLINTERS into a boarded store front!
          The Truck HITS a ditch and UPENDS. Flips. SLAMS into the
          dirt on its roof, wheels SPINNING.

                         ANOTHER ANGLE
          Smoke HISSES from the totalled Roadrunner. Door creeks open.
          Milton emerges slow and sure. He crosses toward the Chevy.
          Fucking Passenger rises from behind the truck and rushes
          Milton, tire iron held high over his head!
          Milton spins and KUH-FOOM!
          --blows Fucking Passenger's hand clean off! Passenger
          screams as Milton snatches the iron out of the air and --

          KER-ACK!
          -- slams it across his face! Passenger drops. Hard.
          Milton stoops, removes Passenger's wallet, digs the cash out.

          OVER MILTON'S SHOULDER
          Fucking Driver scrambles from behind the wheel, springs to
          his feet and runs.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          3.
          Milton spins, BLOWS his knee apart from 20 paces. Driver
          SCREAMS and face-firsts the cracked pavement.

                         ANOTHER ANGLE
          As Fucking Middle drags himself from the passenger side. He
          got the worst of it. Looks like his face went through the
          windshield. He looks up --
          -- into the barrel of Milton's shotgun. A beat.

                         FUCKING MIDDLE
          I'll never tell you where they've
          taken her...NEVER.

                         MILTON
          I know.
          The EXPLOSION vaporizes what's left of his face.

          ON FUCKING DRIVER
          As he tries to stand but his lower leg dangles from a piece
          of cartilage. He falls, WRITHES on the ground. He looks up
          at Milton standing over him.

                         FUCKING DRIVER
          You...you took my leg you fuck!
          Milton presses the shotgun barrel into the man's good knee.

                         FUCKING DRIVER
          Wait. Wait!

                         MILTON
          Where is she?

                         FUCKING DRIVER
          I...I don't...
          Suddenly Fucking Passenger, flattened by the tire iron, sits
          up, dazed. Sees Milton. Spots the iron. Goes for it.
          Milton spins and KAFOOM!
          Blows Fucking Passenger to hell.

                         FUCKING DRIVER
          Stillwater! Stillwater Marsh! I
          don't know where exactly. They
          call it Wolf Deer Run, that's all I
          know. I swear!

                         

                         

                         

                         

          4.
          Milton digs Driver's cell phone out...stares at it for a
          moment, drops it, finds wallet, takes cash.

                         FUCKING DRIVER
          But you're too late. You gotta
          know that. Next full moon she's
          dead. Nothing you can do. She's
          dead and hell will walk the earth--

          WHAM!
          Milton shoves the barrel of his shotgun into the man's mouth,
          breaking a couple teeth in the process.
          Milton hisses, his throat dry, like a man who hasn't quenched
          his thirst in a decade.

                         MILTON
          You tell him I'm coming. You got
          that? I'm coming to get her back.
          You tell him. Tell him I'm gonna
          kill every last one of you fuckers.
          Milton turns on his heels. Walks into the dust and doesn't
          look back.

          EXT. FAT LOU'S ROADSIDE DINER - DAY

          Black smoke billows from the BBQ of this shithole diner.
          It's the only building as far as the eye can see. The lot
          dotted with vehicles past their prime. A muscle bound â67
          GTO stands out.

          INT. FAT LOU'S ROADSIDE DINER - DAY

          Covered in a thick layer of cooking grease, this is one of
          those diners where white trash goes to die. Half a dozen
          PATRONS sit at bar and booth as a young American Indian
          couple, MARY and DALE, enter with their children 2, 4 and 7.
          Two waitresses, PIPER (25) and NORMAJEAN (57) stand at the
          kitchen pick-up window. Through which we can see the
          joint's owner, FAT LOU, dripping sweat into a pile of
          scrambled eggs. Fat Lou is fat. Holy fuck fat.

                         PIPER
          So I tell him, I says, âFrank,
          that's it. No more free milk. You
          gonna have to buy the cow you son
          of a bitch.â

                         

                         

                         

                         

          5.

                         NORMAJEAN
          But you're not fat, Piper

                         PIPER
          Wha? No, NormaJean, âbuy the cow.â
          Marry me? He's got to marry me.
          I'm sayin I cut him off.

                         NORMAJEAN
          You cut him off?

                         PIPER
          Not just yes but hell yes! No
          tits, no ass. And I told him if I
          see that big ol' dick of his
          anywhere near my face I'm gonna
          bite it in half.
          Normajean giggles with embarrassment.

                         NORMAJEAN
          You said that? How long's it been?
          Piper frowns.

                         PIPER
          Well, it's only been two days but
          that's like a decade in horny
          fucker years.

                         NORMAJEAN
          So he bought you a diamond?

                         PIPER
          A diamond? God no. If Frank had
          money for a diamond I would have
          jacked his sorry ass ages ago and
          put this shithole life in the rear
          view. But he did get down on his
          knees and ask me to be his bride.

                         NORMAJEAN
          No way.

                         PIPER
          Yes way!
          NormaJean grabs Piper in a great big hug.

                         NORMAJEAN
          Oh! Piper!

                         

                         

                         

                         

          6.

                         PIPER

          I KNOW!

          FF-FF-FFUMP!
          Something yellow peppers them both. The girls look up as --
          Fat Lou SLAMS two plates of food into the window.

                         PIPER
          Did...did you just throw scrambled
          eggs at us?

                         FAT LOU
          I don't pay you bitches to stand
          around. Now get the fuck back to work!
          Piper snatches one of the plates.
          She delivers it to a Patron sitting at the bar, then turns
          toward the newly arrived customers.
          The American Indian couple scans a menu...
          ...and Milton (the old guy from our opening) scans her...he
          quickly looks down at an unfolded map of Colorado as --
          NormaJean steps up to Milton.

                         NORMAJEAN
          Hello beautiful, coffee?

                         MILTON
          That'd be great. Tell me,
          Stillwater Marsh around here?

                         NORMAJEAN
          (shrugs) Stillwater...doesn't ring
          a bell. I'll get that coffee.
          But Milton makes eye contact with Mary, the Indian mother.
          She quickly looks away. She knows something...
          Milton opens his mouth to speak as--
          --Piper approaches the American Indian couple.

                         PIPER
          Hi guys, I'm Piper. Can I bring
          you something to drink?

                         MOTHER MARY
          We'll take this.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          7.
          Mary points to the menu, Piper leans in, reads.

                         PIPER
          âShe's a Brickhouseâ breakfast.
          Ten monster flapjacks for 4.99.

                         MOTHER MARY
          And five waters.

                         PIPER
          Five waters. And what can I get for...
          Father averts his eyes. He's embarrassed.

                         MOTHER MARY
          That's it. Just the pancakes. If
          that's okay?
          Piper stares at them as if for the first time. Shit...
          they're hungry. And broke.

                         PIPER
          Oh. Of course. Coming right up.
          Piper shoots Milton a look as she crosses to the kitchen.
          Milton rises slightly. He's clearly trying to get Mary's
          attention. She's ignoring him.
          Piper calls through the window to Fat Lou.

                         PIPER
          One brickhouse.
          She turns and stops suddenly. Stares at a pile of muffins
          kept fresh within a glass cake stand.

                         ANOTHER ANGLE
          Mary can no longer avoid Milton's stare.

                         MILTON
          Stillwater Marsh? You know it?
          Dale, the father, keeps his back to Milton as he speaks.

                         DALE
          No. We don't.

                         MILTON
          It's important.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          8.

                         MOTHER MARY
          You're in the wrong state.

                         DALE
          Mary!

                         MILTON
          And what state Should I be in?
          Dale turns, glares at Milton.

                         DALE
          Nevada. Catch the 50 and cut across.
          It's a two day drive from here.

                         MILTON
          And Wolf Deer Run?

                         DALE
          Never heard of it.
          The 7 year old LITTLE GIRL'S eyes brighten.

                         LITTLE GIRL
          Yes you have daddy. Wolf Deer Run,
          that's where The Smiling Man takes
          the wicked children to see the
          Mother of all things.
          Mary SHUSHES her Little Girl and pulls her close.

                         MILTON
          Mother of all things, that sounds
          very interesting.

                         LITTLE GIRL
          Oh it is! The Mother of all things
          bleeds black tears unto those who

                         CUT HER--
          Mother places her hand over her daughter's mouth.

                         MOTHER MARY
          It's nothing. Just a story parents
          tell to their children. Like the
          boogey-man or the tooth-fairy.
          A plate filled with muffins thumps down before them. Piper
          leans in with three kiddie cups.

                         PIPER
          And three milks.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          9.

                         MOTHER MARY
          But we didn't order--

                         PIPER
          (whispers) --On the house.
          She winks and moves away...eyeing the kitchen window. She
          doesn't notice...

                         MILTON
          staring at her again. An impressed smirk on his face.
          Suddenly NormaJean steps in front of him.

                         NORMAJEAN
          So, aren't you gonna ask what time
          my shift ends? Full moon tonight.
          I'm always a little ârandy' during
          full moon.

                         MILTON
          Full moon's three days off.

                         NORMAJEAN
          (she touches his hand)
          You sure âbout that, sweetie?

                         MILTON
          Pretty sure. (looks outside) Hell
          of a ride out there. Yours?

                         NORMAJEAN
          The GTO? I wish.

                         MILTON
          (glances at Piper)
          Hers?

                         NORMAJEAN
          Sure but if you're lookin' for a
          ride...

                         MILTON
          And would you be gentle?

                         NORMAJEAN
          Life's too short for that, sweetie.

          INT. FAT LOU'S ROADSIDE DINER - KITCHEN - DAY

          Piper enters with two dirty plates, scrapes them and drops
          them into a soapy sink. She turns right into --

                         

                         

                         

                         

          10.

                         FAT LOU
          He glares down at her.

                         PIPER
          Jesus Lou, back the fuck off.

                         FAT LOU
          âOn the houseâ? On the fucking
          house?

                         PIPER
          Oh relax. We gotta toss them
          muffins out today anyway.
          She sidesteps him, exits the kitchen.

          INT. HIGHWAY 50 - FAT LOU'S ROADSIDE DINER - DAY

          As Piper crosses toward the bar, Lou grabs her from behind,
          spins her around.

                         PIPER
          Get your hand off of me!
          His fat fingers tighten around her shoulder.

                         FAT LOU
          You get over there and you charge
          them for those muff...
          Piper strikes. Like a snake. Her hand reaches beneath the
          fat of his belly and vice grips his balls. Hell, we even
          hear the CRUNCH.
          Fat Lou GASPS and doubles over allowing Piper to SLAM her
          forehead into the bridge of his nose!

          KER-RACK!

                         PIPER
          I told you, you fat fuck son of a
          bitch, never to touch me again!
          His nose seeps blood.

                         FAT LOU
          Let...go...of...my...
          She SLAPS him across the face with her free hand.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          11.

                         PIPER
          Shut up.
          She takes a step backwards, but keeps her hand clamped to his
          nuts. He has no choice but follow.
          She pulls him up to the American Indian family.

                         PIPER
          Tell'em.

                         FAT LOU
          Wha...what?
          We see it in her face. She squeezes. Lou's eyes go
          wide...flutter...he's about to pass out.

                         PIPER
          Tell them...the muffins...are on
          the house.

                         FAT LOU
          On. The. House.
          She lets go. Lou drops to his knees, then timbers to the
          floor as Piper turns to the family.
          The children are huddled, terrified against their parents.

                         PIPER
          I'm sorry your kids had to see
          that. Put some honey butter on
          those bran muffins and they taste
          an awful lot better.
          Piper turns and crosses toward the door.
          NormaJean is pale as she watches her go.
          Piper brushes past Milton's booth. His cup is there but
          Milton is gone.

          EXT. FAT LOU'S ROADSIDE DINER - DAY

          We're close on a car door as it SLAMS.
          CLOSE ON GLASS PACK EXHAUST PIPES as the car RUMBLES with
          life. An âI brake for pussyâ bumper sticker stands out.
          THE BACK GLASS vibrates as MUSIC blares from within.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          12.

          INT. GTO - DAY

          Piper's French manicured hand wraps the floor-mounted gear
          shift like a cock and SLAMS it into drive.

          EXT. HIGHWAY 70 - DAY

          With Piper behind the wheel the GTO tears onto the highway...
          ...and blows passed Milton, as he walks west, duffle bag
          thrown over his shoulder.

          INT. GTO - DAY

          Piper SINGS. She's empowered. Then...

          KA-THUNK.
          She grips the wheel.
          The RPMS drop.

          EXT. HIGHWAY 70 - DAY

          The GTO pulls off the road...white smoke HISSES from beneath
          the hood.
          CLOSE ON ENGINE as the hood POPS.
          Piper waves a hand in front of her face as the smoke devours
          her. She COUGHS. Stares. It's clear she don't know jack
          shit about engines.
          FOOTSTEPS. Piper slips the keys between her fingers. Ready.
          Milton appears through the smoke.

                         MILTON
          Car trouble?
          Piper stares. It's the way he said it. Too knowing.
          Milton glances at the engine.

                         MILTON
          Oh, that's not so bad. I can fix
          that for you if you like.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          13.

                         PIPER
          I would. Thank you.

                         MILTON
          If you give me a lift.

                         PIPER
          I'm only going as far as Blackfoot
          Falls. The truckstop there.

                         MILTON
          And I'd be much obliged.
          Milton leans in, flicks something then rises and THUMPS the
          hood shut with a smile.

                         MILTON
          Shall we?

          INT. GTO - DAY

          Piper behind the wheel focuses on the road. Milton sits in
          the passenger seat, hugs his duffle bag, glances at Piper.
          Suddenly Piper turns on him.

                         PIPER
          Get it straight old man. I ain't
          sleeping with you.
          Milton chuckles.

                         MILTON
          Darlin, my days of bedding a gal ten
          minutes after I meet her are over.

                         PIPER
          Yeah. Well, that's good to hear.

                         MILTON

                         (TO HIMSELF)
          For now, anyway.

          EXT. HIGHWAY 70 - LAURA'S TRUCK STOP MOTEL - DAY

          Several big rigs are parked near the truck stop. A few
          derelict vehicles outside the adjacent run down old motel.
          Piper's GTO pulls in and parks near the road.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          14.
          Piper climbs out. Milton rises stiffly and crosses toward
          her as he tosses the duffle over his shoulder. He offers his
          hand, gives her a smile.

                         MILTON
          âPreciate the ride, ma'am.
          Milton crosses toward an old Superman style phone booth.

          EXT. LAURA'S MOTEL - DAY

          Piper inserts her key, glances back at Milton.
          He's in the booth now, his back to her.
          Piper turns the key and opens the door.

          INT. LAURA'S MOTEL - ROOM 9 - DAY

          First thing we see is MONA'S naked ass and back. Long red
          hair, she is riding a naked FRANK. Neither realizes Piper
          has opened the door.

                         MONA
          Oh Frank, you know how long I've
          wanted to feel you inside me?

                         FRANK
          Faster.

                         MONA
          Oh, you want it faster?
          Mona thrusts her pelvic the tiniest bit faster.
          Suddenly Piper's hand clinches a handful of red hair and
          yanks! Mona SCREAMS in pain, Frank YELPS in fear as Piper
          drags Mona backwards off the bed.

          EXT. LAURA'S MOTEL - DAY

          Piper drags Mona, KICKING and SCREAMING, into the lot, then
          drops her and whirls toward the room--
          -- where Frank struggles, desperate to find his pants.

                         MONA
          What's the matter with you?! You
          psycho bitch from...

                         

                         

                         

                         

          15.
          Piper spins on Mona, points a finger in warning.

                         PIPER
          Don't.
          It shuts Mona up.
          Piper storms back toward the room.

                         HER POV
          Frank hops with one leg in his jeans. He sees her coming.
          Although he's a big fella, he looks scared.
          Suddenly Mona steps in front of Piper and SLAPS her across
          the face!

                         MONA
          Fuck you, Piper, we're in lo--

          WHAM!
          Piper clocks Mona!
          Mona stands there...dazed. Swaying. Confused.

                         PIPER
          What was that? I didn't catch that
          last word.

                         MONA
          Oh...I...I said...we're in lo--

          WHAM!
          This time Mona stumbles backwards and CRASHES into a metal
          chair on the motel porch.
          Piper brushes passed her.

          INT. LAURA'S MOTEL - ROOM 9 - DAY

          Piper stuffs a gym bag with clothes.

                         FRANK
          Now baby, just hold on.

                         PIPER
          I'm warning you, Frank. Don't come
          near me.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          16.

                         FRANK
          Look, sooner you accept this is
          your fault, the better.
          Piper stops, turns, stares.

                         FRANK
          Baby, I can't just turn it off.
          Now you know that. I gotta have
          it. At least once a day. It's in
          the wiring. You did this. You
          made me cheat on you. You're lucky
          I'm not more pissed about it.
          Piper stares for a moment. It's like she's been sucker
          punched. Then she zips her bag and crosses to the door.

                         FRANK
          Piper! Now cut it out. Enough
          with the drama!

          INT. HIGHWAY 70 - LAURA'S MOTEL - PHONE BOOTH - DAY

          Milton watches Piper's room. It's clear the phone to his ear
          is a fake out.
          Suddenly a look crosses his face. He jerks around.

                         HIS POV

          THE GAS STATION ACROSS HIGHWAY 70
          ...the garage. A grimy looking GREASE MONKEY is staring at
          Milton, cell phone to his ear. He sees Milton see him,
          quickly backs into the shadows.

          FRANK (O.S.)
          Piper!

          EXT. LAURA'S TRUCK STOP MOTEL - DAY

          Piper exits, glances at Mona, sprawled out unconscious in the
          metal chair, an ASIAN MAN in a Hawaiian shirt SNAPS pictures
          of her.
          Piper snatches the camera and flings it against the wall
          where it SHATTERS.

                         ASIAN MAN
          Hey?!

                         

                         

                         

                         

          17.

                         PIPER
          Pervert.
          Piper stomps across the lot as Frank exits, calls to her.

                         FRANK
          Baby, Please. Now hold on. Can we
          talk about this?
          Piper keeps walking. Never looks back.

                         FRANK
          Piper, stop this! You got nowhere
          to go and you know it.

                         PIPER
          I'll go to San Francisco and stay
          with my cousin.

                         FRANK
          (Realization) Whoa. You ain't
          taking my car.
          Piper pulls out the keys, twirls them on her finger.

                         FRANK
          I said, you ain't taking my car, bitch.
          Frank grabs her by the shoulder. Piper spins and --

          WHAM!
          -- punches him in the face. Caught off guard, Frank
          stumbles, nearly goes down.

                         PIPER
          Your car?! Who's been making the
          payments you out of work, skanky
          Mona fucking piece of shit?!
          She drops the gym bag and launches into him. A blur of FISTS
          and CLAWS. The tears flow. Heartbreak, anger, humiliation.
          Frank stumble backwards. Tries to block the blows. WHAM!

                         FRANK
          Stop...

          WHAM!

                         FRANK
          ...hitting me!

                         

                         

                         

                         

          18.
          She swings but this time Frank lashes out.

          KUH-RACK!
          He punches her in the face. Hard. She drops to her hands
          and knees. When she looks up, her teeth are caked in blood.

                         FRANK
          You're insane, you know that? Look
          what you made me do!
          She staggers to her feet, sways before him.

                         FRANK
          Come on, I'll get you some ice--
          She SPITS blood in his face and SWINGS!
          He blocks the blow and BACKHANDS her with the force of
          thunder. She spins and SLAMS into the ground. Doubtful
          she'll get up this time, then --

                         QUIET LAUGHTER
          Frank stares as Piper rolls over.

                         PIPER
          Frank. Sweetie. I'm gonna tell
          everybody what I caught you doing
          with my pink dildo.
          Her laughter becomes a hysterical fit.

                         FRANK
          That's it.
          He drops on top of her, his fingers curl into a fist.

                         FRANK
          You don't wanna fuck me? Fine.
          When I'm done nobody's gonna wanna
          fuck you. Ever.

                         PIPER
          Go to hell.
          Frank raises his fist into the air. Then...

          MILTON (O.S.)
          Hey.
          Frank looks up as a boot catches him under the chin, lifting
          him off Piper.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          19.
          Piper stares through blurry eyes as Milton drops on top of
          Frank, pounding him with his fists.

          FADE TO BLACK.

          FADE UP ON:

          EXT. COLORADO PLAINS - DUSK

          The sun is a glow to the west. The horizon dances and
          shimmers. Then...is that...yes. Someone is out there.
          Walking toward us. As if they appeared within the heat.

                         ANOTHER ANGLE
          We start close to the ground. Dress shoes. Suit pants.

          PULL BACK TO REVEAL
          The ACCOUNTANT. Least he sure as shit looks like an
          accountant in blue suit and purple power tie. Not especially
          large. Nice looking face. Something trustworthy about him.
          Friendly even.
          He loosens his tie, slips his jacket off and tosses it over
          his shoulder. There's a bounce in his step.

          INT. FAT LOU'S ROADSIDE DINER - DUSK

          NormaJean looks up as the Accountant enters.

                         NORMAJEAN
          Have a seat sweetie. Mary there
          will be right with you.
          Indian Mother Mary turns. Piper's replacement. She stops in
          her tracks. Stares at the Accountant.
          He winks at her.
          A shiver runs through Mother Mary. She backs away then
          rushes from the diner.

                         NORMAJEAN
          Mary?!
          Fat Lou leans from the Kitchen window.

                         FAT LOU
          Where's she going?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          20.
          The Accountant turns to Lou. Stares. Then --

                         ACCOUNTANT
          You. Fat fuck. Come here.
          Lou stares.

                         FAT LOU
          What did you call me?
          The Accountant smiles.
          Fat Lou vanishes from the window then BURSTS from the kitchen.

                         FAT LOU
          I said, what did you call--

                         ACCOUNTANT
          --I called you âfat fuck' and we had
          better leave it at that unless you'd
          prefer I call you âdead fat fuck.'

                         FAT LOU
          Wha-what?

                         ACCOUNTANT
          I'm looking for someone. An old
          man. White hair. Five-eleven.
          The Accountant smells the air, embraces it.

                         ACCOUNTANT
          He was here earlier. Traveling
          light. Likely on foot.

                         FAT LOU
          Who are you?

                         ACCOUNTANT
          I'm the Accountant.

                         FAT LOU
          That's supposed to mean something
          to me?

                         ACCOUNTANT
          It will if I add you to the books.
          And if you don't tell me what I
          want to know...
          NormaJean opens her mouth to speak. Shuts it.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          21.
          The Accountant turns to her, quickly. So quickly she takes a
          step back.

                         ACCOUNTANT
          You had something to say?

                         NORMAJEAN
          He was here. Earlier.

                         ACCOUNTANT
          Yes. We've established that.

                         NORMAJEAN
          Terrible tipper.

                         ACCOUNTANT
          I'm sure he was. Where did he go?
          She points.

                         NORMAJEAN
          That way. West. On foot.

          EXT. HIGHWAY 70 - NIGHT

          The GTO THUNDERS past.

          INT. GTO - NIGHT

          Piper is curled up in a fetal position in the big back seat.
          She sits up slowly. Her eyes are blackened. But clearly
          Milton has cleaned her up. She props herself on an elbow,
          looks at the jacket covering her.
          Milton is driving. He gazes out the window...up to the sky.
          Piper looks.
          The MOON hangs a few days from full.
          Piper slides over the seat, drags Milton's jacket with her,
          then slips into it, wrapping herself as if cold.

                         MILTON
          Want me to roll the window up?

                         PIPER
          You didn't kill him did you?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          22.

                         MILTON
          No but he'll likely piss blood for
          a day or two.

                         PIPER
          Thanks for that.

                         MILTON
          Hungry?
          He gestures through the windshield as they pass a âWelcome to
          Utahâ sign. Beyond, there are lights ahead.

                         PIPER
          Utah?

                         MILTON
          You mentioned San Francisco.

                         PIPER
          Appreciate what you done for me
          back there but I ain't takin you
          all the way to--

                         MILTON
          --My business is in Nevada. Can
          you get me that far?

                         PIPER
          What business?

                         MILTON
          I'm looking for someone. You
          hungry or not?
          Piper considers for a moment, then--

                         PIPER
          Yeah. I could eat.

                         MILTON
          Name's Milton. You're Piper,
          right?

                         PIPER
          You try to kill me and dump me in
          the desert I'll cut your nuts off.

                         MILTON
          Fair enough.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          23.

          INT. BULL BY THE BALLS BAR AND GRILL - NIGHT

          Pool tables, old pin ball machines and an odd mix of BIKERS,
          COWBOYS and the SLUTS who love them.
          Piper and Milton slide into a booth. Piper eyes a Latino
          BUSBOY, nice biceps, jeans too tight.
          ROY, a greasy fella in his fifties approaches, big happy
          looking fucker, owns the joint.

                         GREASY FELLA
          Greetings folks, welcome to the
          Bull by the Balls...
          He stops. Smile fades. Stares at Milton, mouth agape.

                         MILTON
          Roy.

                         ROY
          Milton?
          Roy doesn't even try to hide his dislike of Milton.

                         ROY
          Thought you were dead.

                         MILTON
          You hoped I was dead. Not the same.

                         ROY
          You planning on staying?
          Milton eyes a door marked âMotel Guestsâ.

                         MILTON
          Got a problem with that?

                         ROY
          Your money's good as any Iâspect.
          But be gone by dawn.
          With Roy turns his back on them and walks away.

                         PIPER
          What was that all about?

                         MILTON
          Back in another life I used to
          drive a truck through these parts.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          24.

                         PIPER
          And you'd spend the night here?

                         MILTON
          I'd spend the night here fucking
          his wife.
          Suddenly Milton twists around, stares toward the bar.

                         PIPER
          What's wrong?

                         MILTON
          I...nothing I guess.
          A large breasted waitress, fuckin' hot for a woman in her
          fifties, approaches with chips and salsa. Eyes Milton.

                         CANDY
          Well, hello. I'm Candy. Start you
          off with some drinks?

                         MILTON
          Beer.

                         PIPER
          Same.
          Candy plops two pens and index cards on the table.

                         CANDY
          And I'll need to see your IDs.
          Piper pulls her license absently and slides it over, begins
          filling out the card.

                         MILTON
          What is this?

                         PIPER
          Guess it's been awhile since you
          drove that truck through here.

                         CANDY
          You want a drink? You gotta be a
          member. Dry county.

                         MILTON
          You're kidding.

                         CANDY
          Welcome to Utah, Mr...

                         

                         

                         

                         

          25.
          She takes his license.

                         MILTON
          Call me Milton.

                         CANDY
          This license isn't just expired.
          It's an antique.

                         MILTON
          Fine, then bring me a milk.
          She tosses his card on the table.

                         CANDY
          For you, gorgeous, we'll break the
          rules. Shhhh, don't tell nobody.
          Milton watches her go. Drinking her up.

                         PIPER
          You gonna tap that?

                         MILTON
          Tap what?

                         PIPER
          Jeez, Milton, how long's it been?
          Sounds like you used to stick it in
          anything with a crack.

                         MILTON
          Yeah. Well. I've been distracted.

                         PIPER
          Suit yourself. But nobody reaches
          the end and says, âWish I hadn't
          fucked so much.â
          Milton's gaze returns to Candy. Even a man as driven as he
          needs a reboot sometimes. Candy catches his look, smiles.
          Piper slides from the booth.

                         MILTON
          Where are you...?

                         PIPER
          I'm gonna do my nails, take a hot
          bath and sleep in a warm bed.

                         MILTON
          What about your beer?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          26.

                         PIPER
          You drink it. See you at dawn.
          But she walks right passed the âMotel Guestsâ door and
          approaches the Busboy, who's already eyeing her.
          As she does, our focus settles on a shadowy area at the back
          of the bar. JONAH KING steps into the light. Ruggedly good
          looking. He wears a necklace with something bulky hidden
          beneath his shirt. There's an old scar under his left eye
          but a scar on this guy simply adds to his fuckabilty factor.
          He glances at Milton then --

                         JONAH KING
          It's Roy isn't it?
          Roy spins from the bar, smiles a friendly smile.

                         ROY
          Sure is. Get you a drink friend?

                         JONAH KING
          Fantastic place you have here. You
          don't happen to rent it out for
          parties do you?

                         ROY
          We sure do. You planing a party?
          Again Jonah glances at Milton.

                         JONAH KING
          Oh yes. Tonight, in fact.

          INT. LAURA'S MOTEL - ROOM 9 - NIGHT

          The Television chatters away with local nightly news. Frank
          ignores it, paces on the phone. As he does, we see Jonah
          King's face on the TV. The same guy from the bar. Archive
          footage of him preaching, warm, friendly.

                          FRANK
          I gotta go.
          Frank clicks his phone shut, jerks the door open to find --
          The Accountant smiling at him.

                         ACCOUNTANT
          There was an old man, yes?

                         FRANK
          Wha?
          The Accountant sniffs the air.

                         ACCOUNTANT
          White hair. Angry with attitude.

                         FRANK
          Sumbitch kicked me in the face.
          Who are you?

                         ACCOUNTANT
          I'm the Accountant.

                         FRANK
          The wha? I called the cops, not a
          bean-counter?

                         ACCOUNTANT
          The old man? Where did he go?

                         FRANK
          Fuck should I know where he went?
          I woke up and all three were gone.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          28.

                         ACCOUNTANT
          All three?

                         FRANK
          The bitch, the old man and my car!

                         ACCOUNTANT
          What kind of car?

                         FRANK
          You know what, fuck you. You ain't
          no cop. I'm done talking.
          Frank starts to close the door but the Accountant grabs his
          wrist, twists him around and shoves him into the room!
          Frank doesn't stumble forward. He flies. Lifted off the
          ground his toes drag the floor, Frank SLAMS into the opposite
          wall and bounces into the dresser.

                         FRANK
          You son of a --
          Frank staggers to his feet. Dazed. Mouth bleeding. He
          wipes blood onto the back of his hand.

                         FRANK
          You...you made me bleed.
          Frank pulls a baseball bat from behind the dresser.

                         FRANK
          You leave me no choice but to beat
          you with this Louisville Slugger.
          Frank takes a step, swings at the Accountant.
          The Accountant dodges.
          Bat SMASHES down on the TV. SPARKS & GLASS fly.
          The Accountant STOMPS on the bat, SNAPS it in two.
          SLOMO: The short end rips from Frank's hands, knocks him
          backwards. The piece spins in the air - for a second, hangs
          there until...
          The Accountant snatches it, letting his follow-through gather
          momentum.
          Frank can only watch as the Accountant -

          HURLS THE JAGGED TIP OF THE BAT RIGHT AT HIM --

                         

                         

                         

                         

          29.
          The tip STRIKES Frank in the shoulder with such force, it
          impales him up to the knob. Drives him backwards where it
          embeds into the wall!
          The Accountant grabs the broken barrel end of the bat, tosses
          it from hand to hand with a loud SLAP of flesh on wood.

                         ACCOUNTANT
          What kind of car?

                         FRANK
          (dazed) I...what?

                         ACCOUNTANT
          Your car. What kind is it?
          Frank stares down at the bat protruding from his shoulder.

                         FRANK
          Wha...what did you do?
          The Accountant reaches out and twists the bat. Frank SCREAMS
          out in pain.

                         ACCOUNTANT
          Answer the question.

                         FRANK
          A â67 GTO! Arrgg!
          The Accountant turns and walks toward the door. Stops to eye
          a framed photo of Piper and Frank on the dresser.

                         FRANK
          Hey! Just hold on!
          The Accountant pivots and flings the barrel of the bat.

          FRANK'S POV
          It's coming right at his face. Frank tries to dodge...twists
          his head...no good.
          The other end of the broken bat RAMS through his face, PINS
          his head to the wall. The words Louisville Slugger just
          visible where Frank's face should be.

          EXT. LAURA'S MOTEL - NIGHT

          The Accountant exits as two STATE TROOPERS approach, their
          vehicle parked behind them.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          30.

                         TROOPER #1
          Frank Raimi?

                         TROOPER #2
          You called about a stolen car?
          The Accountant gestures over his shoulder.

                         ACCOUNTANT
          In there.
          Trooper #1 moves toward the opened door. The Accountant
          steps in front of Trooper #2.

                         ACCOUNTANT
          I'm looking for someone. Five-
          eleven. White hair. Driving a â67
          GTO. He's traveling with her.
          He hands Trooper #2 the framed photo.

                         TROOPER #2
          Excuse me?
          The Accountant pulls a shiny, ancient coin, worn from being
          worried over the years, from his pocket. He tosses it, the
          coin catching the light, glinting madly. Trooper #2 stares at
          it. Can't seem to take his eyes off it.
          Trooper #1's eyes widen as he stares into Frank's room.

                         TROOPER #1
          Jesus.
          He pulls his gun. Points it at the Accountant.

                         TROOPER #1
          Keep your hands where I can see them!

                         ACCOUNTANT
          Troopers, this is your lucky day.
          Trooper #2 is watching the hypnotic glinting coin.
          ANGLE - High looking down on the trio as the coin spins right
          in front of us - we glimpse the ancient face in the worn
          silver - Roman maybe?

                         TROOPER #1
          Show us your hands, asshole.
          (to his partner)
          What's the matter with you?! Draw
          your weapon!

                         

                         

                         

                         

          31.
          Trooper #2 slowly reaches for his gun until...
          The Accountant snatches the coin from the sky, thrusts it at
          the two cops.

                         ACCOUNTANT
          Here. Look at this.
          They don't see a coin. But a badge. Letters F.B.I. on it.

                         TROOPER #1
          You're... you're a Fed?

                         ACCOUNTANT
          In pursuit of a white haired man. John
          Milton. He's travelling with the girl
          in this picture.
          Trooper #1 fixes his eyes on the photo of Piper & Frank in
          his partner's hand. Lowers his weapon.

                         TROOPER #1
          But, that guy, in the room. He's -

                         ACCOUNTANT
          --Dead. Yes. I'd say it's
          unfortunate, but I'd be lying.
          World won't miss him. Look,
          troopers. I need your help with my
          pursuit of this fugitive. If we,
          we three, can apprehend him...you
          are ambitious, correct.

                         TROOPER #2
          I guess...

                         TROOPER #1
          Yes, we are...

                         ACCOUNTANT
          Wasn't actually a question. I can
          tell you are. Success will mean
          promotion. Pay raise. I guarantee
          it. Now we are going to hunt this
          Milton, we are going to find the
          GTO he's driving and when we find
          him, you will shoot to kill. You
          understand? Shoot. To. Kill.
          The Accountant's voice is velvet. Hypnotic. Seductive.
          Purposeful. Promising glory with a hint of damnation.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          32.

                         TROOPER #1
          That's against protocol...

                         ACCOUNTANT
          This man is highly dangerous. He
          has killed and will kill again. He
          must be taken down on sight. The
          time it takes you to follow your
          protocols is the time it takes him
          to end your life.
          The Accountant crosses to the cruiser's back door, the coin
          disappearing back into his pocket.

                         ACCOUNTANT
          Shall we?

          INT. BULL BY THE BALLS MOTEL - NIGHT

          We're staring into two motel rooms. We're cheating...the
          wall that divides the rooms...divides the screen. The beds
          in each room butted up against the dividing wall.
          On one side we see Piper, on her back. Still clothed. At
          her feet, on his knees and completely naked, the Busboy.
          He's painting her toenails.
          On the other side we see Milton, on his back. Candy riding
          him like a fucking big-tittied stallion. Candy is a SCREAMER.
          The Busboy looks up, timidly. Then...

                         BUSBOY
          Uh, are we gonna do it?

                         PIPER
          Well, I don't know, baby. Depends
          on how well you do those nails.
          Now pay attention. You might need
          to redo that one.
          He hunches over and gets back to work. As Piper ties her
          hair up with a pink bandanna. Candy's SEX SCREAMS are
          starting to annoy the fuck out of her.
          She twists around with frustration and POUNDS the wall.

                         PIPER
          Shut the fuck up in there!
          Milton twist and POUNDS the wall right back.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          33.

                         MILTON
          You shut the fuck up!
          That's it!
          Piper swings her legs off of the bed. Busboy wasn't prepared
          and topples backwards to the floor.

                         PIPER
          (giggles) Oh! Sorry, I didn't
          mean...
          She stops. Stares.
          Movement. Someone stepped quickly away from the window.

          INT. BULL BY THE BALLS BAR AND GRILL - NIGHT

          Piper BURSTS into the room ready to kick ass and take names.
          But...the place is...empty. Food still on the plates. Beer
          in the mugs. The TV over the bar is still on.
          We see footage of a Nevada Amber Alert. âBaby Tabitha still
          missingâ A photo of a baby in pink onesie. Then appearing
          beside it...the photo of Jonah King.

                         TV NEWS
          ...issued an all points bulletin for
          Jonah King's immediate detention in
          connection with the murder of a young
          married couple in Loveland, Colorado.
          Their infant girl is believed to have
          been abducted by this religious sect.
          A nation-wide Amber Alert is now in
          full effect.
          Piper stares at the TV for a moment, then scans the bar.
          What the fuck?
          She eyes the EXIT sign where an assortment of athletic
          equipment hangs from the wall.

          EXT. BULL BY THE BALLS BAR - BACKLOT - NIGHT

          Piper exits with a hockey stick.
          A few cars are left in the lot. A black Chevy van with flames
          stands out, parked in front of a barn/storage building.
          Piper crosses to a window in the bar/motel.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          34.

                         THROUGH WINDOW
          Busboy sits on Piper's bed. Still naked. He holds her nail
          polish to his nose. Sniffs. Jerks his head back.

                         PIPER
          Imbecile.

                         A NOISE
          Piper spins, grips the hockey stick.
          No one. The cars are empty. The barn looks undistur...
          A light GLOWS within the barn, bleeding through the wood
          slats. Then...
          CRREEEEEEEK...barn door slowly swings open.
          ...revealing THREE SILHOUETTES backlit by a hanging lamp.
          One holds a shovel. The other heaves an ax over his
          shoulder. The third holds a shotgun.
          The side door on the flamed van slides open. TWO SILHOUETTES
          step out. Baseball bat and machete.

                         FOOTSTEPS
          Piper spins as THREE DARK FIGURES appear around the side of
          the bar/motel. Sledge hammer, iron pipe, sickle.
          Surrounded. All seven begin walking toward her.
          Piper rushes back inside.

          INT. BULL BY THE BALLS BAR - NIGHT

          Still empty. Piper turns toward the door marked âMotel
          Guestsâ then hesitates.
          Instead she dives under a booth table...as...
          The back door opens.

          PIPER'S POV
          LEGS. Three sets. Beat up sneakers. Work boots. Cowboy
          boots with a duct tape patch.
          A door opens. Piper sucks in breath. More legs appear.

                         ANOTHER ANGLE

                         

                         

                         

                         

          35.
          Shadows approach the desk counter near the âMotel Guestsâ
          door. There's an open guest book on the counter top.

          CLOSE ON GUEST BOOK
          As a weathered hand comes into view. A finger traces down to
          the last two entries.
          Piper Lee RM 111
          John Milton RM 112

          INT. BULL BY THE BALLS MOTEL - MILTON'S ROOM - NIGHT

          Candy's still on top. She is, as we say in the fuck
          industry, âcloseâ.

                         CANDY
          Close'm'close'm'close'm'close.
          Suddenly Milton's head jerks toward the door.
          His hand shoots beneath his pillow as--
          The door BURSTS OPEN!
          MAN WITH AN IRON PIPE held high rushes into the room.
          Milton comes up with a 357 hand cannon!

          KAFOOM!
          IRON PIPE is BLOWN backwards into MAN WITH MACHETE!
          Milton thrusts upright, suddenly Candy finds herself beneath
          him as --
          Machete HEAVES Iron Pipe to the side and rushes toward Milton
          as -- KAFOOM! He's blown off his feet!

          KER-SMASH!
          The window shatters as a MAN WITH BASEBALL BAT dives, hits,
          rolls and comes up swinging!
          Milton snakes an arm beneath Candy and rolls from the bed
          with her! As they fall--
          The bat SLAMS onto the mattress just missing them as --

          KA-BOOM!

                         

                         

                         

                         

          36.
          Milton turns Baseball Bat's head into a canoe!
          Milton on bottom again as they crash to the floor, still
          intertwined.

          FWOOM!
          The door adjoining Milton and Piper's room EXPLODES open at
          his feet!
          MAN WITH AXE and MAN WITH SHOTGUN enter!
          Milton, presses Candy's face into his chest, twisting his
          body to shield her as his 357 THUNDERS twice!
          Shotgun's eye vaporizes in a mist! He drops to his knees.
          Man with Axe clutches his throat...blood gushing...turns and
          flees back into the adjoining room as --

          KUH-FWAM!
          The bathroom door flies open!

          MILTON'S POV
          Staring under the bed, Cowboy boots with duct tape patch
          appears.
          Chamber opens. Shells drop to dirty carpet. Milton rolls
          Candy over, still connected. Fumbles in his bag on the floor.
          COWBOY with SLEDGE HAMMER freezes at the carnage. Can't see
          Milton. Because he's hidden by the bed.

          COWBOY WITH SLEDGE
          Old Man. You know you can't stop
          what's comin' That little girl's
          as good as dead.
          TWO BULLETS slide into the 357. Chamber SNICKS shut.
          Milton aims under the bed. FIRES!
          Half the man's foot is blown to hell! He hops then crashes
          to the floor!
          He and Milton make eye contact beneath the bed...a nanosecond
          before Sledge Hammer's forehead implodes.

                         A NOISE
          Milton rolls Candy beneath him again and raises his head just
          in time to see--

                         

                         

                         

                         

          37.
          MAN WITH SICKLE enter!
          He stares at his dead comrades in rage then glares at Milton.
          The glare becomes fear.
          Milton's already aiming the 357, then --

          CLICK. CLICK-CLICK-CLICK
          Sickle smiles, raises the bladed weapon and--

          KUR-RUNCH!
          The top of his head SPATTERS BLOOD as a hockey stick crashes
          down from above and behind.
          Sickle drops to the floor revealing Piper, white knuckling
          the hockey stick...her face pale.

                         MILTON
          Thanks. Apparently I shot my wad.
          Milton stares down into Candy's face.
          Her whole body QUAKES...CONVULSES. She sucks in breath and
          opens her eyes.

                         CANDY
          Jesus Christ. You're the best fuck
          I've ever had.
          Piper crosses to the adjoining room.

                         CANDY
          Hello? Do you mind?! We're...
          Candy sits up and suddenly takes in her surroundings. She
          SCREAMS, wraps herself in a sheet and flees from the room.

          PIPER'S POV INTO HER ROOM
          Man with Axe is lying face down in his own blood. Dead. But
          it's Busboy who draws Piper's attention. Lying beneath blood
          drenched white sheets. He never saw it coming.

                         PIPER
          Aw, hell.
          Milton, in pants, pulls his shirt on, rolls Man with
          Shotgun's face with his boot. Reloads the 357.

                         MILTON
          I definitely got their attention.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          38.

                         PIPER
          What. The fuck? You know these people?
          Milton flings his duffle over his shoulder.

                         MILTON
          Come on. There are probably more.

          EXT. BULL BY THE BALLS BAR - FRONT - NIGHT

          Jonah King slips from the bar and rushes toward a parked
          Sedan. He POPS the trunk and grabs a gym bag. As he crosses
          toward the Driver's side door...
          The gym bag starts to CRY.

                         JONAH KING
          Shhhh. Don't cry little precious.
          FF-FFUMP! Two doors shut.
          Jonah King turns, freezes.
          Our two State Troopers stand near their parked cruiser,
          staring from Jonah to the CRYING gym bag.
          For a cop, this is that one in a life time event. A career
          maker. News. Media. Leno. Then--
          The cruiser's back door opens. The Accountant steps out. He
          ignores Jonah King and the crying gym bag.

                         ACCOUNTANT
          Troopers. Remember why we're here.
          He walks by them towards the front door of the bar.
          Both Troopers turn and move around the side of building.
          Jonah King...stares...stunned, he absentmindedly scratches at
          the old scar on his face then leaps into the Sedan with the
          gym bag, engine ROARS to life.

          EXT. BULL BY THE BALLS BAR - BACK LOT - NIGHT

          Milton and Piper exit into the back lot.

                         PIPER
          Milton, I'm serious! I want some
          answers!

                         

                         

                         

                         

          39.
          They turn as the SPEEDING Sedan tears onto the highway. As
          it disappears behind the barn it reveals --
          --Man With Shovel. He FLINGS the barn doors open, stares at
          Milton and Piper for a moment then vanishes within.

                         MILTON
          Yeah, we both want some answers.
          Milton moves toward the barn as--
          The State Troopers walk around the bar.
          Everyone freezes.
          The Troopers stare from Piper to Milton, then back to Piper.
          Recognition.

                         MILTON
          Aw fuck.
          Milton grabs Piper, places himself between she and the
          Troopers as they go for their guns.

                         MILTON
          Come on!
          Milton pulls the 357 and opens fire!
          The Troopers, emboldened and fearless, stand their ground and
          shoot back!

          FFFUMP!
          Milton staggers, clutches his side. A crimson spot spreads
          across his belly. Piper tries to catch him as he stumbles,
          falls to one knee, his duffle tumbles to the ground, clothes
          spilling from within.

                         PIPER
          No!
          The Troopers keep FIRING!
          Piper stares down at Milton's open duffle. There's a gun
          lying within the spilled clothes. An ancient six shooter.
          We get just a glimpse, but we can tell this isn't just any
          old gun. There's detailed inscriptions scrawled into the
          metal. The steel of it is thick, tarnished and somehow angry.
          She reaches for it.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          40.

                         MILTON
          No! Not that one.
          He shoves the 357 toward her. Piper snatches it without
          hesitation, rises and --

          KUPOW!
          Trooper #1's chest EXPLODES. The force spins him...still
          firing...he SHOOTS Trooper #2 in the ear!
          Both men crash to the ground. Dead.

          KAFOOM!
          The barn doors explode outward as a big Dodge truck powers
          toward the highway, Man with Shovel behind the wheel.
          Piper turns to find Milton struggling toward the GTO.

                         PIPER
          What are you doing?!

                         MILTON
          Have to stop him...

                         PIPER
          Milton! Those cops weren't trying
          to arrest us!

                         MILTON
          No. They weren't. Get in.
          Milton climbs behind the GTO's wheel.

                         PIPER
          I'll drive.

                         MILTON
          You gotta patch me up. I'll drive.
          Piper fumes but climbs into the passengers seat.

          INT. GTO - NIGHT

          The car RUMBLES to life!

                         PIPER
          They were trying to kill us!

                         MILTON
          Yes.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          41.

                         PIPER
          They were trying to kill you.

                         MILTON
          Yes.
          Milton floors it! As the GTO fishtails toward the highway--

                         THROUGH WINDSHIELD
          The Accountant steps from the back door of the bar.
          Hunter and Hunted glare.

                         MILTON
          Christ.
          Piper's attention is still on the dead cops.

                         PIPER
          Christ is right! They start
          shooting with no warning?! What
          are you, a murderer? You escape
          from prison or something?
          The GTO tears onto the highway!

          IN REARVIEW MIRROR
          The Accountant just stands there...fading into the darkness.

                         PIPER
          Well?! Which is it?!

                         MILTON
          Both.
          Piper raises the gun, points it at Milton.

                         PIPER
          What have you gotten me into? I
          should...I should...Jesus, I just
          killed a cop! I'm going to prison.
          Give me one good reason I shouldn't
          shoot you in the face.

                         MILTON
          Because I'm driving.

                         PIPER
          You know what I mean!

                         

                         

                         

                         

          42.
          Milton gestures through the windshield, toward the distant
          brake lights ahead.

                         MILTON
          They took my grand-baby. Took my
          grand-baby and killed my...
          He breaks off. Looks away.

                         THROUGH WINDSHIELD
          We see the lighted Amber Alert sign come into view and
          quickly blur passed.
          Piper stares at Milton.

                         PIPER
          The little girl on the news? The
          baby girl they're looking for?
          Milton nods.

                         PIPER
          But the news said the baby's
          parents were...
          Piper stops.
          Milton's eyes glisten. He speaks in a whisper.

                         MILTON
          Sons of bitches killed my daughter.
          Piper stares. Milton steadies himself.

                         MILTON
          So Yeah. I busted out. And I'm
          gonna get my grand-baby back. I'm
          gonna get her back and I'm gonna
          kill every last one of the fuckers.

                         (A BEAT)
          You want out, I'll understand.
          Piper considers, then --

          KUH-FWAM!
          They both slam into their seats as the GTO is rear-ended.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          43.

          EXT. GTO - NIGHT

          It's the Trooper's cruiser. The Accountant, face blank, sits
          behind the wheel.

          INT. GTO - NIGHT

          Milton fights with the wheel as the muscle car fishtails. He
          mashes the accelerator pulling out of the spin!

                         MILTON
          In the back seat. Now.

                         PIPER
          What? Why?

                         MILTON
          Now!
          Piper scrambles into the back seat as Milton watches the
          cruiser pull up along side him.

                         MILTON
          Shotgun. It's already loaded.
          Piper digs the shotgun from the duffle and heaves it into the
          front seat.

                         MILTON
          Have the other one ready. Not the
          357. The OLD one.

          THROUGH PASSENGER WINDOW
          The cruiser pulls up and matches the GTO's speed. After a
          beat the Accountant turns and smiles at Milton.
          Milton smiles back, lifts the shotgun, shoves the barrel
          through the passenger window.

          BOOOM!

          EXT. HIGHWAY 70 - DRY GORGE BRIDGE - NIGHT

          The cruiser's driver's side window explodes.

          INT. GTO - NIGHT


          MILTON'S POV

                         

                         

                         

                         

          44.
          The Accountant brushes shattered glass from his shoulder.
          When he looks back at Milton its with a face of arrogance. A
          cat toying with a three-legged mouse. He pulls the cruiser
          next to Milton. Matches the GTO's speed. Shouts across.

                         ACCOUNTANT
          It's over, Milton. Stop the car.

                         MILTON
          I can't do that.

                         ACCOUNTANT
          Really? What makes you think you
          have a choice?

                         MILTON
          I got something I gotta do first.

                         ACCOUNTANT
          Then you should have done it a long
          time ago.

                         MILTON
          I didn't have to do it a long time ago!

                         ACCOUNTANT
          Milton, I will kill that nice woman
          in the backseat to get to you.

                         MILTON
          I won't let you do that.

                         ACCOUNTANT
          Again. What makes you think you
          have a choice?

                         MILTON

                         (TO PIPER)
          Now.
          Piper hands Milton the ancient Six Shooter. Milton snatches
          it, points it across the gap between cars, pulls back the
          hammer with a thunderous...KUH-THUNK.

                         MILTON
          This does.
          The Accountant's eyes widen.

          SSHHU-BOOOM!

                         

                         

                         

                         

          45.
          It's as if God tripped, fell and the entire earth shook as a
          result!
          The recoil nearly rips Milton's arm off.
          We travel with the slug, fire trailing it, as it SLOMOs
          toward the Accountant...his eyes continuing to widen...the
          muscles in his face contracting.

          INT. CRUISER - NIGHT

          The Accountant cuts the wheel. Hard.
          He wracks his head around as the slug just kisses his cheek.

          EXT. HIGHWAY 70 - DRY GORGE BRIDGE - NIGHT

          The Cruiser SLAMS into the guard rail! The back-end rockets
          forward as the cruiser goes into a spin.
          The GTO fishtails away.

          INT. GTO - NIGHT

          Milton fights with the wheel as --

          IN REARVIEW MIRROR
          The Cruiser bucks up and over the guard rail.

          EXT. HIGHWAY 70 - DRY GORGE BRIDGE - NIGHT

          The Cruiser, spins like a top, helicopters out over the
          nothingness and plummets to the dry valley below.

          KER-FRUNCH!
          And flattens sending out a dusty shockwave in all directions.

          INT. GTO - NIGHT

          Milton manages to stop the GTO before it slams into the rail.
          The GTO BUCKS and STALLS.
          He breathes a sigh, then turns and stares in the direction
          they'd been going.
          He can just make out the fleeing Cultist's tail lights.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          46.
          The back door opens. Piper leaps out.

                         MILTON
          Piper! Wait!
          Milton watches the taillights vanish over a distant ridge.
          He starts the engine...then hesitates...

          THROUGH BACK WINDOW
          Piper approaches the destroyed guard rail.

          EXT. HIGHWAY 70 - DRY GORGE BRIDGE - NIGHT

          Piper stares into the valley below.

                         HER POV
          We can just make out the flattened Cruiser in the light of
          the three quarter moon. No fireball. No smoke. No sign of
          movement. Just flattened metal.

                         PIPER
          He's not one of the ones who took
          your granddaughter, is he?

          MOVE TO REVEAL
          Milton stands behind her. Shakes his head.

                         MILTON
          Someone else.

                         PIPER
          Is there anyone not trying to kill you?
          Milton stares up the road. Piper considers, then --

                         PIPER
          Come on. I'll help you. But
          we're dealing with that first?
          She points to his blood soaked shirt.

          EXT. HIGHWAY 70 - NIGHT

          The GTO THUNDERS beneath a starry sky.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          47.

          INT. GTO - NIGHT


          CLOSE ON SPEEDOMETER
          The needle hovers at 95 mph.

          PULL BACK TO REVEAL
          Piper behind the wheel. Milton, shirtless, his stomach
          wrapped in homemade bandages, grabs his shotgun, reloads.

                         MILTON
          My daughter got mixed up with the son
          of a bitch right out of college.

                         PIPER
          She knew him? She knew Jonah King,
          the man they think killed...
          She stops herself.

                         MILTON
          She knew him. The world was in a
          fuckin tailspin and King was
          preaching quiet revolution.
          He places the shotgun on the dash, grabs the 357.

                         MILTON
          It was four months before she
          realized âquiet' meant hiding in
          the basement, cutting the heads off
          chickens.

                         PIPER
          Jonah King was into voodoo?
          Milton reloads the 357, slowly, methodically.

                         MILTON
          Voodoo, the occult, not much he
          wasn't into. When she told him she
          was leaving, he helped her pack.
          Gassed up her car. Cooked her a
          hot meal. Then while she slept he
          broke her leg in three places with
          a tire iron.

                         PIPER
          Jesus.
          She twists her pink bandanna nervously in her hands.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          48.

                         MILTON
          She learned her lessen. Was a good
          little follower for eighteen
          months. That's when they met with
          some witch doctor bullshit artist
          in Chinatown. It was Chinese New
          Year so the place was wall to wall
          slants. She saw her chance,
          stabbed Jonah in the face with a
          souvenir corkscrew and vanished
          into the crowd.

                         PIPER
          Milton. Your daughter was in a
          cult for two years and you didn't
          know? Why didn't you help her?
          Milton grabs the ancient six shooter. It's got real weight.
          His blood-stained fingers run down the scrolled steel. The
          gun almost seems alive. Pops the chamber.

                         MILTON
          I didn't find out about any of this
          until...until I got locked up.
          Only two bullets left. He SNAPS the gun shut.
          Shoves it into his duffle.

                         PIPER
          Not gonna reload?

                         MILTON
          Only had three bullets to begin...

                         PIPER
          Milton.

                         THROUGH WINDSHIELD
          Lights ahead. Several. And road flares. There's been an
          accident.
          Milton eases the shotgun into his lap.

          EXT. HIGHWAY 70 - CRASH SITE - DAWN

          Several vehicles and an RV block the road. The PASSENGERS
          scramble back and forth. There's a jack-knifed flatbed, a
          crumpled Station Wagon and the Cultist's Dodge truck is
          overturned on the shoulder.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          49.

          INT. GTO - DAWN


                         PIPER
          That's his truck.

                         MILTON
          Stay put. I won't be long.

          EXT. HIGHWAY 70 - CRASH SITE - DAWN

          Milton climbs from the GTO and crosses toward the overturned
          Dodge. He lets the shotgun dangle at his side, keeping it
          hidden behind him.
          TATTOOED GUY and SKANKY GAL stand near the RV with MAN IN
          LEATHER JACKET. BUSINESS WOMAN paces on her cell phone.
          Milton glances at MAN WITH WIG sitting in the driver's seat
          of his station wagon, his face in his hands. LADY IN
          LEOPARDSKIN HOTPANTS kneels beside him. In the passenger
          seat, BURLY DUDE's on his phone. Watching Milton.
          There's a couple near the overturned Dodge. TRUCK DRIVING
          WOMAN gazes into the upsidedown cab. THIN OLD MAN rises and
          nods as Milton approaches.

          THIN OLD MAN
          I think he's gonna be okay.

                         MILTON
          Is that right?
          In a swift move, Milton RATCHETS a shell into the chamber,
          drops to one knee, aims into the cab.

          MILTON'S POV
          The cab is empty.
          Somewhere near, we hear a MUFFLED BABY'S CRY.

          CLOSE ON MILTON'S FACE
          Realization. Shit. But it's too late.
          A snub-nosed .38 appears at his temple.

          THIN OLD MAN
          I wouldn't.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          50.

          PIPER (O.S.)
          Milton!
          Milton rises slowly and takes in the situation.
          Tattooed Guy comes up fast behind the GTO. We get a good
          look at him. It's Man with Shovel. Piper's getting out,
          doesn't see Tattooed Guy until he's grabbed her. Presses the
          pistol in her ribs.

                         PIPER
          Hey! Let me go, fucker!
          She goes to fight but Man in Leather Jacket approaches her
          with an axe. Burly Dude is with him.

                         MILTON
          Don't Piper! (to Thin Old Man)
          Let her go. She's a pain in the
          ass you don't want.
          Milton still hasn't let go of his shotgun.

          THIN OLD MAN
          Drop it. Or we'll gut her.
          To emphasize the point, Truck Driving Woman pulls a Rambo
          Knife from her purse and smiles a missing toothed smile.
          Milton drops the shotgun as --
          --Man With Wig steps from his car with a scoped hunting
          rifle. Lady in Leopardskin rises revealing a baseball bat
          with nails and spikes protruding from the end.
          Skanky Gal and Business Woman open the RV's door.
          Jonah King steps from within then smiles down at Milton. He
          cradles a baby in his arms.

                         JONAH KING
          Milton, isn't it? Why are you here?
          Why are you making such a fuss?

                         MILTON
          Isn't that obvious, you sick fuck?
          I'm here for her.
          Milton gestures toward the baby.

                         JONAH KING
          What's obvious is that you clearly
          abandoned your daughter.

                         (MORE)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          51.
          JONAH KING (cont'd)
          Crushed her so completely that she
          told everyone you were dead. No,
          Milton, I cannot in good faith hand
          over this child to you.

                         MILTON
          But sacrificing her under the full
          fuckin moon, that's okay?

                         JONAH KING
          Okay? Milton, your granddaughter is
          unbelievably blessed. Look around.
          The world's on fire. Companies own
          our governments and the people
          suffer. Daily. And will continue to
          suffer until change comes. And
          change will come. Thanks to your
          granddaughter, Milton. She will open
          the door to a new world order.

                         MILTON
          Your BS don't work on me. You
          killed my daughter but I won't let
          you kill my grandbaby.

                         JONAH KING
          Your daughter's death was an
          accident.

                         MILTON
          No shithead, it wasn't. I saw the
          whole damn thing. I saw who you
          are when no one's lookin'. And I
          saw what that night cost ya.
          Jonah's armor cracks a little as Milton faces the others.

                         JONAH KING
          Milton, you're embarrassing your--

                         MILTON
          (to the crowd)
          --What was it three or four days
          before he showed after killin my
          little girl? You jerkoffs didn't
          notice he was walking a little stiff?
          Milton glances at Skanky Gal and Business Woman.

                         MILTON
          When's the last time he shared a
          bed with either of you? Before
          that night, right?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          52.
          The girls shoot a nervous glance at Jonah.

                         MILTON
          You forced my daughter onto her
          knees, you sonofabitch. And she made
          you pay for it.
          Jonah stares at Milton in shock. How does he know?

                         MILTON
          But don't take my word for it. Ask
          him. Leather Jacket was there.
          Jonah made him swear not to tell.
          Jonah lifts a .38 auto from within the baby's blanket and
          shoots Leather Jacket in the forehead.
          Piper SCREAMS. The Baby starts CRYING.
          Jonah shoves the baby into Skanky Gal's arms then swings the
          gun toward Milton.

                         JONAH KING
          Put the blonde in the RV.
          Tattooed Guy shoves Piper toward the RV as Skanky and
          Business woman climb in with the baby.
          Jonah aims the gun at Milton's face.

                         MILTON
          I'm only gonna make this offer
          once. Give me my granddaughter and
          I'll let you liv--

          KAPOW!
          He shoots Milton in the left eye! Milton's head snaps, he
          falls to the ground on his back.

                         PIPER
          No!!!
          Tattooed Guy shoves Piper into the RV.

          INT. RV - DAWN

          Skanky tries to calm the crying baby. Tattoo shoves Piper
          onto the travel couch then hands the gun to Business Woman.

                         BUSINESS WOMAN
          Please. Try something.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          53.
          Jonah climbs into the RV, closes the door.

                         JONAH KING
          Let's go.

                         PIPER
          You killed him! You bastard you --

          WHACK!
          Piper's head rocks back as Business Woman pistol whips her.

                         BUSINESS WOMAN
          Next time I shoot that mouth right
          off your face.
          Jonah gazes out the window as the RV pulls away, Piper's SOBS
          rising behind him.

          JONAH'S POV
          Milton's body lays there. Unmoving. His one eye staring
          skyward. Void of life as the RV pulls away, leaving the
          cluster of cars, the wreck and body of Milton behind.

          EXT. HIGHWAY 70 - CRASH SITE - DAWN

          Man With Wig pops the back of the Station wagon. Truck
          Driving Woman and Thin Old Man lean in, snatch two shovels.
          Burly Dude drags Leather Jacket's body next to Milton's as
          the others join him.
          They gaze down at Milton, his one eye open and unseeing. A
          single tear runs from it. The other, pools blood where the
          bullet entered.

          MILTON'S GOOD EYE TWITCHES.
          Everyone stares. Did they just see that right?

          THE 357 COMES UP IN MILTON'S HAND - FIRES!
          The bullet RIPS BURLY'S SCALP WIDE. He stumbles back.
          The others recoil.
          Burly ROARS, blood streaming from his head wound - charges
          Milton with the ax.
          MILTON unleashes rapid fire lead from the 357!

                         

                         

                         

                         

          54.
          Burly's blown back! The others scatter as Milton staggers to
          his feet! He grabs the shotgun, leans on it for support.

                         ON GTO
          AS Milton stumbles to the open passenger door.

                         ANOTHER ANGLE
          MAN WITH WIG comes from the back of the Station Wagon with
          the scoped hunting rifle. Aims.
          BLAM - His shot rips into the GTO, blows the side mirror off.
          Milton FIRES back with the shotgun - forcing Man with Wig
          back behind the wagon.

          INT. GTO - DAWN

          Milton falls heavily across the front seats. Ties Piper's
          bandanna around his head, covers his now gaping eye.

          EXT. HIGHWAY 70 - CRASH SITE

          Man with Wig hasn't had enough yet. He aims the rifle.
          Moves into the road. Can't see Milton in the car, but that
          doesn't matter. He knows he's there.

          BLAM.

          INT. GTO - DAWN

          The windshield SHATTERS. Glass splinters down on Milton. He
          reaches for the keys.

          EXT. HIGHWAY 70 - CRASH SITE - DAWN

          The Cultists jump at the sound of the GTO's GLASS PACKS!
          Dust rips skyward as the GTO barrels toward them!
          They scramble, clawing at one another to get out of the way.
          All except Man With Wig. He's playin' hero, lines Milton in
          his sights. But what he sees shakes him to his core.

          POV THRU SCOPE
          MILTON, face bloody and twisted with rage.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          55.
          Man with Wig screams, falls, tries to roll out of the way.

          FU-FUMP!
          The wheels pound over both of his legs, SHATTERING them!

          INT. GTO - DRIVING - DAY

          Milton flips open the 357 as he FISHTAILS the GTO back onto
          the highway. He dangles the 357 out the window.

          EXT. GTO - DAY

          Empty shells DANCE onto the blacktop, several SKITTER down
          onto the cracked Earth and OS.
          ANGLE - moving fast, the GTO's wheels consume the frame.

                         MATCHING TO:
          A bicycle tire SKIDS to a stop before us. Then a second.

          PULL BACK TO REVEAL

          EXT. VALLEY FLOOR - DAY

          Two TEENAGERS sit on beat-to-shit mountain bikes, staring.

                         THEIR POV
          The cratered cruiser lies on its crushed roof, both doors
          shut. No windows visible.
          TEEN #1 lights a chillum pipe, inhales. Holds it, passes the
          pipe, then speaks as only a pothead can.

                         TEEN #1
          Think anyone's in there?

                         TEEN #2
          (inhales, holds, passes)
          I guess. Doors is still closed.

                         TEEN #1
          (inhales, holds)
          Bet it's sick. Wanna look?

          KWU-FOOM!
          The driver's side door launches right at us!

                         

                         

                         

                         

          56.
          ...nails Teen #2 in the chest, knocking him ten feet
          backwards where he skids on his back.

                         TEEN #1
          Jesus!
          The Accountant rolls from the cruiser, stands, brushes
          himself off as he strides forward.

                         ACCOUNTANT
          Carpenter and despite what you've
          heard, prefers short hair.
          Teen #2 sits up suddenly, coughing.

                         TEEN #2
          You...you nearly killed me!

                         ACCOUNTANT
          Not even close. I won't see you
          again until...
          He tilts his head, as if reading a sign too far away.

                         ACCOUNTANT
          ...until you're seventy-three.
          He glances at Teen #1, then --

                         ACCOUNTANT
          You, I'll see in three months.
          And with that the Accountant turns and strides away.

          EXT. HIGHWAY 70 - MOVING - DAY

          The RV RUMBLES past, running faster than an RV should.

          INT. RV - DAY

          Jonah glances through the back window. Double takes.

                         HIS POV
          A rapidly growing black blotch on the road. In seconds that
          blotch reveals itself as the GTO ripping up the highway,
          gaining fast. The baby SCREAMS in the background. When
          Jonah speaks...it is with wonder.

                         JONAH KING
          Look at this. He's still coming.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          57.

                         TATTOO
          Who's still coming?

                         JONAH KING
          The old man. He's alive.

          TATTOO AND PIPER
          What?
          Piper tries to stand. Business Woman backhands her!

                         BUSINESS WOMAM
          Stay down! That's impossible!

                         TATTOO
          You shot him in the face! He can't--

                         JONAH KING
          Don't you see? We stand at the
          crossroads! Did you think we would
          just idly change the world? The
          forces of evil challenge us! This is
          wonderful! We show ourselves to be
          worthy. I'm so very proud of each
          one of you.
          Tattoo and Business Woman beam.
          Skanky pulls her tit out, shoves it in the baby's face. The
          kid goes quiet as --
          The back glass SHATTERS.
          Everyone ducks!

          EXT. GTO - DAY

          Milton leans out the driver's side with the shotgun in his
          left hand, his one good eye squinting as --

          KAFOOM!
          He fires at the RV!
          He RATCHETS another shell into the chamber, takes aim
          then...hesitates...

                         IN REARVIEW
          The front end of a fast approaching vehicle!

          WHAM!

                         

                         

                         

                         

          58.
          Milton's head snaps back as a 90 Corvette slams into the back
          of the GTO.

          EXT. 90 CORVETTE - DAY

          Lady in Leopardskin behind the wheel, her eyes insane.
          Behind the Corvette we see a â92 Lincoln, Thin Old Man
          driving. Truck Driving Woman in a â95 Viper.

          INT. GTO - DAY

          Milton struggles to pull the shotgun back inside...struggles
          to keep the big GTO on the road.
          Distracted by the newcomers...we see what Milton does not.

                         THROUGH WINDSHIELD
          The RV pulls off the road to the left.
          Milton looks up just as he passes the turn off.

                         MILTON
          Shit!
          He SLAMS on his brakes.

          INT. 90 CORVETTE - DAY

          Leopardskin's eyes go wide. Survival kicks in. She jerks
          the wheel.

          EXT. HIGHWAY 70 - THE CHASE - DAY

          The Corvette slams into the side of the Viper!
          The Lincoln cuts hard right.
          All three cars shoot pass the GTO.
          Milton cuts the wheel left and floors it!

          INT. RV - DAY

          Piper watches as the bucking RV forces Jonah and Business
          Woman to turn their backs on her.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          59.
          Piper leaps from the couch, rushes up behind and shoves them
          toward the shattered back window!
          Jonah snatches a cabinet, drops his gun!
          It slides beneath the foldout bed.
          But Business Woman hits the giant opening and flips up and
          out of the RV!

          INT. GTO - DAY

          Milton looks up as Business Woman SLAMS into the ground and
          TUMBLES just out of his path. She sits up...dazed. Alive.
          Milton swerves...just enough...to...

          KAFWAM!
          What doesn't explode from the force KUH-THUMPS as the GTO
          bucks over her body.
          Milton grits through the pain. A bloody angry smile.

          INT. RV - DAY

          Jonah stares out the back glass in shock.

                         PIPER
          Oops.

                         JONAH KING
          I am patient and forgiving, but
          that was wrong of you.
          He turns to her.

                         JONAH KING
          I'm going to kill you now. And
          then I'm going to rape your corpse.
          So that in the afterlife you might
          consider your sin this day.
          Piper CRACKS her knuckles.

                         PIPER
          Great. Between now and then.
          I'm'a fuck you up.
          He takes a step and swings a punch.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          60.
          But she leaps at his face, closing the gap too quickly. Her
          French Manicure digs in. Jonah screams. They both go down!
          The baby WAILS.
          Skanky crawls into the cramped sleeper-bunk above the driver.
          Pulls the baby with her, tucks back into the corner, away
          from the battle in the RV's cabin.

          INT. GTO - DAY

          Milton is gaining when --

          BOOM!
          The back glass SHATTERS.

          EXT. DIRT PATH - DAY

          Truck Driving Woman gains on Milton in her Viper. She's
          being blanketed in dust. BOOM! She fires a .44 Magnum.

          INT. GTO - DAY

          The radio and dash explode!

                         MILTON
          Son of a bitch.
          Milton snatches the 357, points it out the back glass and
          opens fire.

          BOOM!
          Milton's POV
          A white dot spider webs the Viper's windshield left.

          BOOM!
          Windshield middle!

          BOOM!
          The windshield suddenly turns red from the inside as a dot
          appears in front of the driver.
          The Viper jerks right drifts off of the dirt path!

                         FOOM

                         

                         

                         

                         

          61.
          The Lincoln bursts through the dust cloud behind it. Thin
          Old Man leans from the driver's window, FIRES.
          Slugs PEPPER the GTO.
          Milton spins in his seat.

                         THROUGH WINDSHIELD
          The RV has pulled ahead and vanishes over a hilltop.
          Milton FLOORS it!

          INT. RV - DAY

          Piper on top, Jonah's face looks like he ran into a barbed
          wire fence! He howls in pain and manages to slip a hand
          around her throat!
          Piper feels it. His fingers tighten. He shoves her away
          from him...she can no longer dig into his face.
          Her arms flail. Reaching for anything. Grasping.
          Her face turns red. Eyes bulge. Fuck.
          She claws his shirt open.
          And there...hanging around his neck is a small corkscrew.
          Chinese in design.
          She snatches it and --

          SHUNK!
          Stabs it into Jonah's shoulder, twists it deeper in.
          He SCREAMS. Releasing her!

          EXT. DIRT PATH - HILL TOP - DAY

          Quiet.

          FOOM!
          GTO rockets over the hill top, clears the ground ten feet!
          The moment the GTO touches down, Milton BRAKES!
          Milton JOLTS the car into reverse! Tires SCREAM in protest!

                         

                         

                         

                         

          62.
          The GTO jerks backwards...climbing toward the top of the hill
          in reverse when Milton SNAPS the wheel.
          The GTO 180s, comes to rest just on this side of the hilltop.
          Milton casually leans out of the driver's side window with
          the shotgun in hand. He points it skyward as--

          FOOM!
          The Lincoln ROCKETS over the hilltop...and passes directly
          over the top of Milton.
          Milton's one good eye zeroes in on the massive gas tank
          beneath the back of the car.
          Milton squeezes the trigger.
          The back end of the Lincoln EXPLODES as --
          --The Corvette rockets over the hilltop!

          INT. CORVETTE - DAY

          Lady in Leopardskin's face drops.

                         THROUGH WINDSHIELD
          The Lincoln fireball SLAMS into the ground before her!
          Lady in Leopardskin shields her face as --

          EXT. DIRT PATH - HILL TOP - DAY


          KER-FWAM!
          She slams into the burning vehicle and spins out of control!

          INT. GTO - DAY

          Milton kicks the car into drive, jerks a 180 and speeds off
          toward the RV.

          INT. RV - DAY

          Jonah sits up...he pulls at the corkscrew and screams. It
          won't budge.
          He glares at Piper.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          63.
          She scans for a weapon. Nothing. She snatches an umbrella
          from a coat rack. It'll have to do...
          There's a machete hanging beneath it.
          She drops the umbrella grabs the machete. Smiles at Jonah.

                         PIPER
          Give me the baby and I'll make the
          pain go away.
          Suddenly everyone SLAMS into the side of the RV!

          Piper clings to the old stove. She watches in horror as --
          Jonah's gun slides from beneath the foldaway bed. It slides
          right up to him.
          He snatches it.
          Piper leaps through the door.

          EXT. RV - DAY

          Piper SLAMS into the side of the RV. She tries desperately

          Jonah leans through the door. Gun in hand.

                         JONAH KING
          Goodbye, child.

          MILTON (O.S.)

          Jonah looks up. Milton is driving beside them, shotgun in

          KUH-FWAM!
          But before Milton can get his shot off --
          The Corvette SLAMS into the back of the GTO!
          Milton fires! Blowing a hole in the side of the RV a foot to
          the right of Jonah's head!
          Jonah leaps back inside the RV.
          Piper clings on for dear life but she's slipping.

          INT. GTO - DAY

          Milton jerks the wheel.

          INT. CORVETTE - DAY

          Lady in Leopardskin slows as Milton's GTO goes into a spin.
          There's a smile on her face. She thinks he's lost control!
          Until the GTO does a 180. Milton now driving in reverse.
          His shotgun pointing through the remnants of windshield...
          ...directly at Lady in Leopardskin.

          BOOM!
          Her head goes buh-bye.

          EXT. HIGHWAY 70 - CHASE FINAL - DAY

          The Corvette swerves off of the road, jumps a ditch and flips
          thirty or forty times.

          EXT. RV - DAY

          Piper slips. Slips again. It's over. She knows it. Damn.
          She falls.

          FUMP.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          65.
          And lands on the hood of the GTO.

          EXT. GTO - DAY

          She looks up, through the GTO's windshield into Milton's
          battered face. He stretches his hand out to her. Piper
          snags it before slipping off into oblivion.

                         MILTON
          Got ya.
          Piper nods, crawls toward the windshield, Milton tries to
          pull her in as --

          KUH-THUNK....CRUNCHCHCHCH...
          A horrible sound of grinding metal roars from beneath the
          GTO's hood.

          EXT. HIGHWAY 70 - CHASE FINAL - DAY

          The GTO pulls to the side of the road.
          Milton leaps out and stares.
          He can just make out Jonah standing in the back window...
          holding his granddaughter.
          Piper eases from the hood.
          She stares at her bandanna, at the blood on his face.

                         PIPER
          Jesus, Milton. How?
          She pulls him close...looks at the back of his head.

                         MILTON
          It's still in there. The bullet. I
          can feel it.

                         PIPER
          But how...how are you still alive?
          He stares back toward the RV. Just a dot on the horizon now.

                         MILTON
          Ain't got time to die.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          66.

                         PIPER
          I tried, Milton. I tried to get
          her back.

                         MILTON
          I know, baby. I know. Jonah only
          had about twenty followers. We
          hurt him good today.

                         PIPER
          Fuckin devil worshipers freak me
          out. They mess with powers that
          should be left alone. Turns my
          shit white.

                         MILTON
          Powers. It's all bullshit.

                         PIPER
          No, Milton. It's real. Ghosts,
          UFOs, bigfoot, that's the bullshit.
          The Devil and demons? Once those
          doors are opened you're fucked.
          Milton rolls his one good eye.
          Piper turns back to the GTO. Smoke hissing from the engine.

                         PIPER
          What do we do now?

                         MILTON
          I used to know a guy lived out this
          way. You got one of them portable
          phones?

                         PIPER
          Portable phones? You mean a cell
          phone? Yeah, in my bag.

          EXT. HIGHWAY 70 - CRASH SITE - DAY


          WE ARE CLOSE ON THE CRACKED EARTH
          As a hand slams into view, fingers with dirt crusted nails
          curl...dig into the ground.

          PULL BACK TO REVEAL
          Man With Wig crawls toward us. He's pale. Eyes dim.

          PULL BACK FURTHER TO REVEAL

                         

                         

                         

                         

          67.
          His busted, mangled legs have left a slug trail of blood and
          fluid stretching back to the highway.
          Left hand hits the ground, right hand digs into the dirt. He
          drags himself forward a few inches.

                         HIS POV
          He's crawling toward the Station Wagon.
          Someone...somewhere...is HUMMING
          Wig turns, squints.

          A SILHOUETTE APPROACHES
          Back lit by the early day sun. There's a bounce in his step.
          Wig holds his hand out to the savior as--
          The Accountant's smiling face becomes clear.

                         ACCOUNTANT
          Scorcher today, huh?
          He takes a big long swing from an oversized water bottle.

          MAN WITH WIG
          Help me...

                         ACCOUNTANT
          Christ on a cracker. My apologies.
          The Accountant grabs the man by the collar and drags him into
          the shade of the Station Wagon where he flips him around into
          a sitting position.
          Wig's shirt falls open revealing a pentagram tattooed above
          his left breast.

                         ACCOUNTANT
          What's that supposed to mean?

          MAN WITH WIG
          It's a symbol of our pact with Lord
          Satan.

                         ACCOUNTANT
          Pact huh? That's cute. Funny he's
          never mentioned you.
          Wig stares down at his mangled legs. The Accountant notices.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          68.

                         ACCOUNTANT
          Yeah, those are fucked. Here, have
          some water.
          Wig takes the offered water as Accountant kneels before him.

                         ACCOUNTANT
          Milton's work I take it?

          MAN WITH WIG
          Ran me over with his...how do
          you...? Who are you?

                         ACCOUNTANT
          I'm the Accountant. I'm curious.
          And I never get curious. What do
          you people want with Milton?

          MAN WITH WIG
          You're the who?
          The Accountant smiles, places his hand around Wig's clearly
          shattered femur and squeezes.
          Wig's body convulses! He SCREAMS.

                         ACCOUNTANT
          Does it matter? Milton. Why is he
          important to you?

          MAN WITH WIG
          He isn't! He's the one chasing us!

                         ACCOUNTANT
          Why?
          Wig stares...searches for an answer.
          The Accountant snatches a mangled ankle and twists. Wig's
          body stiffens and he SCREAMS.

          MAN WITH WIG
          Because! Because of what we did.
          Because of who we took.

                         ACCOUNTANT
          Color me curious. What DID you do
          and who DID you take?

          EXT. HIGHWAY 70 - DEAD GTO - DAY


                         CLOSE ON

                         

                         

                         

                         

          69.
          The blood stained pink bandanna. The wind pushes it gently
          down the black asphalt.

          PULL BACK TO REVEAL
          Milton sits on the GTO's hood. Piper stands between his legs
          cleaning his wound.

                         PIPER
          Lemme know if I hurt you.

                         MILTON
          Do what you gotta do. You get used
          to the pain.
          Piper pulls a black bandanna from her pack, there are white
          skulls on it. She folds it, ties it around Milton's head.

                         PIPER
          There. That's better.
          When she moves aside we see she's lined up a skull over his
          missing eye.

          A VEHICLE APPROACHES.
          Milton slides from the hood, steps protectively in front of
          Piper as a banged up wrecker pulls toward them, pulls to the
          side of the road.

          POV FROM APPROACHING VEHICLE
          From this angle it looks as though an innocent old man and
          his granddaughter are having car trouble.

          POV FROM BEHIND THE GTO
          From this angle we can see Milton concealing the shotgun
          behind him. Piper stands close, her hand on the handle of
          the 357 protruding from his waistband.

                         ON WRECKER
          As the DRIVER steps out...stands half hidden by the door as

                         WE --

          MOVE TO REVEAL
          Like Piper, the Driver has his right hand tucked behind his
          back, wrapped around the handle of a .44 Magnum.

          DRIVER (O.S.)
          Thought you were dead.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          70.
          Now we get a good look at him. His name's WEBSTER. An old
          black man, as tough as Milton is angry.

                         PIPER
          Why does everyone keep saying that?

                         WEBSTER
          Because he IS dead. Sure as shit
          supposed to be anyway.
          Webster and Milton eye one another for a long beat then --

                         WEBSTER
          I carried your coffin, old man. I
          was there the day we put your ass
          in the ground.
          Piper stares at Milton. Milton stares at Webster.

                         MILTON
          Webster, you gonna yank that .44 or
          just keep stroking it?

                         WEBSTER
          That depends. How's this possible?

                         MILTON
          You heard about my daughter?

                         WEBSTER

                         (SOFTENS SLIGHTLY)
          I did.

                         MILTON
          Then you know why I'm back.

                         PIPER
          Back? Back from where? What. The
          Fuck. Are you two talking about?!

                         WEBSTER
          It true they took the little one?
          Milton nods.
          Webster considers for a long beat, then releases the .44.

                         WEBSTER
          Put her in neutral. I'll pull the
          truck around.
          But Piper can't tear her eyes away from Milton.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          71.

          EXT. BULL BY THE BALLS BAR AND GRILL - DAY

          Police tape, half a dozen state and county cruisers. Three
          meat wagons and a news van. Humans buzz the scene like
          insects. The two dead State Troopers lie where they fell.
          Undisturbed. ROOKIE stands out. Young, county uniform, wide
          eyed. Very busy at having no idea what he should be doing.
          He scans the ground. His eyes go even wider.

                         ROOKIE
          Sarge! Sarge look at this!
          Rookie squats to the ground as SARGE, leather skin,
          approaches, stares, frowns.

                         SARGE
          Yeah?

                         ROOKIE
          Cigarette butt.

                         SARGE
          I see that.

                         ROOKIE
          Sarge! It's less than twenty feet
          from the victims!

                         SARGE
          And less than three feet from the
          ash bin.
          Sarge points to an ash bin filled with sand. Over a hundred
          cigarette butts salute the sky.

                         SARGE
          Pay attention, Rookie.
          But Rookie's attention has quickly OCD'd elsewhere.

                         ROOKIE
          Hey!

                         HIS POV
          CAP, an American Indian man walks the crime scene. Jeans,
          cowboy boots, a âDumbledore Dies On Page 596â sweatshirt.
          His dress may look out of place but his face and attitude are
          all business.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          72.

                         ROOKIE
          You! You can't be here!
          Rookie rushes forward.

                         SARGE
          Rookie!

                         ROOKIE
          Sarge, this joker can't just stomp
          around the crime scene.
          Sarge catches up, nods with respect to Cap.

                         SARGE
          Captain. Sorry about that.
          Cap looks up then stares at Rookie's feet.

                         CAP
          One of yours?

                         SARGE
          Yessir, I won't let it happen
          again.

                         CAP
          Get him out of here.

                         SARGE
          Cap, he's green, that's all.

                         CAP
          He's standing on evidence.
          Rookie leaps back revealing two shell casings.
          Cap kneels, stares.

                         CAP

          357.
          Suddenly a Unformed Officer leans from within the bar.

                         UNIFORMED OFFICER
          Cap! We got a live one.

          INT. BULL BY THE BALLS BAR AND GRILL - DAY

          Several officers motion Cap behind the bar toward an open
          cabinet. Cap crosses to the cabinet and kneels.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          73.
          Candy hides within. Naked, hugs her knees. Shivers.

                         CAP

                         (TO MEN)
          Get me a blanket. And get a medic
          in here.
          He turns to Candy, offers a comforting smile.

                         CAP
          You're gonna be okay now. I won't
          let anything happen to you.

                         CANDY
          He...he killed them. He killed all
          of them.

                         CAP
          Who did?

                         CANDY
          No. You don't understand, we was
          fuckin'. He killed them while we was
          fuckin'. That's never happened to me
          before, has it happened to you?
          Cap turns to Sarge who is standing near.

                         CAP
          Let's get a shrink in here too.

          EXT. WEBSTER'S WRECKER - DUSK - EST.

          A giant barn surrounded by an army of muscle car's laid to
          rest on cement blocks.

          INT. WEBSTER'S GIANT BARN - DUSK

          Engines dangle from assorted winches. Auto tools hang from
          the walls. Stacks of tires, a pile of carburetors.
          Webster throws a lever.
          The wrecker winch lowers the GTO.
          Piper crosses to the front, pops the hood. Webster joins
          her, stares at the engine. Frowns.

                         WEBSTER
          Engine's shot to hell.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          74.

                         PIPER
          Can you fix it?
          He leans close, hands caress the engine, searching.
          Somewhere near a fire CRACKLES. Piper turns.

                         HER POV
          Milton stands just through the barn doors, stokes a fire
          within a 50 gallon drum. Flames rising.

                         PIPER
          I don't...how is this possible?

                         WEBSTER
          He loved his daughter.

                         PIPER
          Lots of daddy's love their
          daughters, doesn't explain
          shattering reality.

                         WEBSTER
          That one loved his little girl
          enough to make her hate him.
          (off her stare)
          Like Timmy yellin' at Lassie to go
          home?
          Piper looks even more confused.

                         WEBSTER
          You never watched...forget it.
          Milton was a bad husband but he was
          a good father. Used to say it was
          the only thing he was ever good at.
          Then we went and got mixed up with
          the wrong crowd. Power and money
          and once you're in there ain't no
          gettin' out. So to keep her safe
          he vanished the year before she
          went off to college.

                         PIPER
          Obviously you got out.
          Webster glances at Milton for a moment.

                         WEBSTER
          The bastards we were workin' for, they
          were gonna kill us when the job was
          done.

          75.

                         WEBSTER (CONT'D)
          So the day before, Milton paid'em a
          little visit. He went alone you see.
          I didn't know. I would'a gone with him
          but I didn't know.
          Webster goes very quiet.

                         WEBSTER
          Being a daddy wasn't the only thing
          Milton was good at. Sumbitch was
          good at being a friend.

          EXT. WEBSTER'S GIANT BARN - DUSK

          The sun's setting to the West. Milton stands dangerously
          close to the fire. Stares at the dancing flames.

          WEBSTER (O.S.)
          That fire makin you homesick?
          Piper and Webster approach with a six pack.

                         WEBSTER
          Cold beer?
          Milton gazes up at the moon. It isn't full but it's close.
          The fire CRACKLES, POPS. He stares at it.

                         MILTON
          You know the pain and suffering
          ain't the worse part, right?
          That's what they tell ya, what they
          want you to believe. But it's all
          a big fuckin lie. Nosir, worst
          part's the goddamn video feed.
          Webster and Piper exchange a glance.

                         MILTON
          It ain't about the fire and brimstone.
          Ain't about your suffering. It's
          about the suffering of them you love.
          Cuz you see it. You see it all. In
          full goddamn detail. And there ain't
          nothin you can do about it.
          Milton chunks a 2x4 into the fire. Sparks SWIRL into the air.

                         MILTON
          Fuckin son-in-law. He looked like
          one of them tree-huggin piece of
          shits. Wore sandals. What kind of
          man wears fuckin sandals?

          76.

                         MILTON (CONT'D)

                         (A BEAT)
          But I saw how he died. Fought like
          a fuckin banshee.
          Milton goes quiet.

                         MILTON
          He loved that daughter of mine.
          Loved that little baby too. He
          kept fightin long after he should'a
          been dead. But some people's
          better at killin than others. Just
          how they're wired.
          Milton's finding it harder to speak.

                         MILTON
          Then them sons of bitches turned on
          my...nosir, physical pain is nothin
          compared to watching your baby
          girl...watchin those fuckers...I'm
          gonna kill'em. I'm gonna kill'em
          all. And...and then I'll be done.
          Milton finally goes silent.
          Piper makes a noise. Involuntary. Tears stream down her
          cheeks. She's trying not to sob.
          Webster looks steely. Determined.

                         WEBSTER
          Milton, I can't fix that car. But
          I can get you were you need to be.

          INT. WEBSTER'S GIANT BARN - NIGHT

          A huge sliding barn door opens into a giant stall revealing a
          1969 Chevrolet Nova 396 L-78 and a 1969 Chevrolet Camaro.
          Milton and Piper stare. Webster smiles.

                         WEBSTER
          Milt, if memory serves you were
          always partial to the Nova, yes?

          EXT. WEBSTER'S GIANT BARN - DISTANT RIDGE - NIGHT

          We're staring down over the barn from a distant ridge as we
          hear the GLASS-PACKED RUMBLE of the Nova's engine.

          MOVE TO REVEAL

                         

                         

                         

                         

          77.
          JONAH standing on the ridge top, cell phone to his ear.

                         JONAH KING
          Yeah, about that fella who killed
          all them people at the Bull by the
          Balls last night. The fella who
          killed two of your cops. I know
          where you can find him.

          EXT. WEBSTER'S GIANT BARN - DAWN

          The sun rises to the east burning off the Utah dew.

          INT. WEBSTER'S GIANT BARN - CAR STALL - DAWN

          Milton crosses to the 69 Nova. Stops. Stares.

                         HIS POV
          Piper is curled up beneath a quilt in the front seat.

                         MILTON
          What are you doing?
          Piper pops awake, sits up. Already angry.

                         PIPER
          Fuck are you doing?!
          Milton stares.

                         PIPER
          Think you were gonna sneak off by
          yourself?! Go it alone?!

                         MILTON
          Uh, no. I need your help. If
          you're still willing.
          Piper stares for a moment.

                         PIPER
          Oh.
          A beat.

                         PIPER
          Well if I'd known that I would have
          slept in a bed!

                         

                         

                         

                         

          78.

          EXT. WEBSTER'S GIANT BARN - DAWN

          Milton opens the big barn doors as Piper drives the Nova out
          into the sun light.
          Webster approaches with a shotgun and a box of shells.

                         WEBSTER
          Mapquest says it's an eight hour
          drive and we got twelve until
          midnight so we should be fine. And
          get this, âThe Mother of all
          thingsâ? âBleeds black tears unto
          those who cut herâ? Take a guess
          what's really bleeding like a stuck
          pig from the marsh?

                         MILTON
          Black tears of oil?

                         WEBSTER
          Damn right.

                         MILTON
          Webster, I need you to stay here.

                         WEBSTER
          Wha? No. You went alone last time.

                         MILTON
          I'm not going alone this time.
          Piper's coming with me.

                         WEBSTER
          You take that little girl over me?

                         MILTON
          Give me the fuckin shells. And the gun.
          Milton snatches both and hands them to Piper. He then
          quickly places an arm around Webster's shoulders and walks
          him out of earshot.
          Piper places the gun and shells in the backseat then stares
          at the two men.
          They glance back at her several times. Then Webster nods.
          Milton returns, slides into the passenger seat.

                         MILTON
          Let's go.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          79.
          Piper stares out the window as Webster slips quietly into the
          barn. He does so reluctantly.

                         PIPER
          He's not coming?

                         MILTON
          He's too old. He'll just slow us
          down. Get himself killed.

                         PIPER
          That's what you told him?

                         MILTON
          That's what Timmy told Lassie isn't it?

                         PIPER
          Who the fuck is this Timmy and
          Lassie you two keep talking about?!

                         MILTON
          This ain't gonna be easy, Piper. I
          need you. That's no lie. But are
          you sure about this?

                         PIPER
          Just drive the damn car.

          EXT. HIGHWAY 50 - BORDER - DAY

          We see a âWelcome to Nevadaâ sign as --
          The Nova THUNDERS past.

          INT. 69 NOVA - DAY

          Milton behind the wheel, Piper has her bare feet on the
          windshield as she loads shotgun shells into the slits on a
          hunting vest.

                         PIPER
          I never knew him. Momma said he
          was a drifter.

                         MILTON
          I ain't your daddy.

                         PIPER
          Fuck you if you are.
          Milton notices something in the rear view.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          80.

                         MILTON
          Shit.
          Piper sits up, stares.

          THROUGH BACK GLASS
          There's a State Trooper's car way back there. Fuck. There
          are two. No lights yet but they are coming up fast.

                         PIPER
          What do we do?

                         MILTON
          Nothing yet. Not until...
          The lights come on.

                         PIPER
          Oh shit. They know.

                         MILTON
          We can't stop.
          Milton mashes the peddle to the floor.

                         PIPER
          Milton, this will never work.

                         MILTON
          It'll work.

                         PIPER
          No. It won't. Nobody gets away
          anymore. In fifteen minutes there
          will be choppers, we'll be all over
          the news...
          She breaks off. Her mouth drops.

                         THROUGH WINDSHIELD
          As the NOVA tops a ridge, in the distance we see a police
          barricade. Several State Trooper Cruisers line the roadway
          in front of a bridge crossing a dry ravine. Cruisers line
          the side of the road.

          EXT. HIGHWAY 50 - DRY RAVINE BRIDGE - DAY

          Twenty cruisers. Thirty TROOPERS are set up behind their
          vehicles, shotguns and assault rifles in hand.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          81.
          Cap, the American Indian Police Captain, stands in front, a
          radio to his mouth.

                         CAP
          Just keep driving him to us. We'll
          do the rest. And make sure you
          peel off before the fireworks.
          He lowers the handset, addresses the men.

                         CAP
          Gentlemen, these two killed two of
          our own. I know you'd like them to
          pay. Therefore, when I tell you to
          aim for the tires, what I mean is
          aim for their heads. Are we clear?
          The men nod with steely determination.

                         CAP
          Very good. Please aim for the tires.

          INT. 69 NOVA - DAY

          The barricade is approaching stupidly fast. For the first
          time on this adventure, Milton looks...concerned.

                         PIPER
          Just don't stop.

                         MILTON
          Too many of them.

                         PIPER
          Just keep driving.

                         MILTON
          I'm...I'm sorry I got you into--

                         PIPER
          --They took your granddaughter,
          Milton, and now these badge-wearing
          fuckers are trying to stop you.
          You crawled out of the Goddamn
          abyss...and a few fat-assed county
          Mounties are giving you pause?
          Your grand-baby needs you.
          Milton nods. Turns back to the road.

                         PIPER
          You know what happens to her if
          they stop us.

          You lose the last connection you
          will ever have to this world. You
          gotta drive.
          A scowl crosses his face.

                         PIPER
          No. You don't just drive. Drive
          angry! Drive with the motherfuckin'
          rage that'll take us through that
          motherfuckin' roadblock!

          Sarge from earlier approaches Cap.

          He ain't stopping.

                         CAP
          Good. Makes our job easier.
          Suddenly a noise catches them off guard. They turn behind
          them. Their eyes widen.

                         THEIR POV
          A Mack Truck RUMBLES over the bridge approaching from behind
          them. It's pulling 80mph at least.

          Well...this is unexpected.

          Piper shoves the shotgun in his hand. He quickly shoves it
          out the window and --

                         

                         

                         

                         

          84.

          EXT. 69 NOVA - DAY

          QUICKFIRES three blasts!

          EXT. MACK TRUCK - TRAILER HITCH - DAY

          The hydraulics line BURSTS! Hydraulic fluid bleeds like a
          stuck jugular!
          The metal brackets holding the trailer in place...RELEASE!

          EXT. MACK TRUCK - DAY

          Truck and Flatbed separate!
          The back of the flatbed catches on a cruiser. The front
          flips around.

          INT. 69 NOVA - DAY


                         THROUGH WINDSHIELD
          We can just make out the Accountant's face. He's smiling.

          EXT. 69 NOVA - DAY

          The Nova rips through the opening between truck and trailer!
          And then blazes past the scattered and overturned cruisers
          and tears onto the bridge!

          EXT. HIGHWAY 50 - DRY RAVINE BRIDGE - DAY

          Cap staggers into the road, FIRING at the Nova!

                         CAP
          Hurry! After them!
          Those men still near, scramble toward the working vehicles as

          SCRRREEEECH.
          The Mack skids to a stop behind them, now parallel across the
          blacktop. Driver's side angled back at the bridge.
          Every gun in the area spins as the driver's side door opens.
          The Accountant steps out, big smile on his face.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          85.

          CLOSE ON SARGE AND CAP

                         SARGE
          You want us to shoot out his tires?

                         ON ACCOUNTANT
          As he smiles and flips his coin high into the air.
          The surrounding Troopers stare.
          The Accountant catches it. Holds it high between thumb and
          forefinger for all to see.

          POV FROM TROOPERS
          He's holding an FBI badge in the air.

                         CAP
          No Goddamn way. No ever-loving way
          in God's good heaven are you a...
          The Accountant steps down, thrusting his âbadge' into Cap's
          face stopping him cold.

                         ACCOUNTANT
          Need you boys to stand down. Captain,
          you know what this badge means, right?
          Not a single gun lowers. All trained at The Accountant.
          Itching to blow him out of his expensive shoes.

                         ACCOUNTANT
          Federal Bureau of get the fuck
          outta my way. You boys have
          blundered into an on-going Federal
          case. Now, lower your...
          He stops, turns...sniffs the air.
          His focus settles on a YOUNG FACED TROOPER.

                         ACCOUNTANT
          You.
          ANGLE - Looking down on The Accountant surrounded by armed
          angry troopers. He steps from the truck, nudges Cap aside
          like he wasn't there. Cap can't believe it.
          Shot continues, moving down, closer and closer until the
          Accountant is face to face with a Young Faced Trooper.
          The kid keeps his gun aimed, nervous, excited and confused.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          86.
          Suddenly the Accountant moves fast. He bats the gun aside,
          snatches the kid's uniform shirt and pulls it open, popping
          two buttons.

                         YOUNG-FACED TROOPER
          Hey, Hey!!! Cap!
          And there...above the kid's left breast...a pentagram tattoo.

                         ACCOUNTANT
          It seems you're serving two masters.
          The kid says nothing stares. Every cop's gun is sighted on
          the Accountant. He doesn't seem to notice.

                         ACCOUNTANT
          Take out your phone and call him.
          Call Jonah King. Tell him the old
          man is dead.
          The kid stares until...

                         CAP
          Go ahead, Trooper. Do as the agent
          says. Rest of you. Stand down. Now!
          Guns lower. The kid removes his cell phone and dials.

          EXT. HIGHWAY 50 - NEVADA - DAY

          We tear West down the highway as we catch up to the Nova and
          dive down...toward the back glass until --

          INT. 69 NOVA - DAY

          Piper stares through the back window.

                         PIPER
          I don't think...why aren't they
          following us?
          Milton slips into his hunting vest. A scowl on his face.

                         MILTON
          They're likely scared of you.

                         PIPER
          Now what?

                         MILTON
          Now we drive.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          87.
          We pull back...

          EXT. HIGHWAY 50 - NEVADA - DAY

          ...out of the back glass as the Nova speeds up.
          Faster...faster. The sun suddenly time lapses across the
          sky. The landscape blurs. Only the Nova and the moving sun
          remain...until the sun dips into the Western horizon and
          vanishes...replaced by one hell of a bright full moon.

          EXT. SOMEWHERE IN NEVADA - NIGHT

          Suddenly our view veers off the highway and rips toward a
          rocky outcropping in the distance.
          We slow and drop toward the ground until we're mere inches
          above the cracked earth...we come to a stop.

                         FOOM
          A BOOT slams into view.

          PULL BACK TO REVEAL

          EXT. STILWATER MARSH - NEVADA - NIGHT

          Milton climbs from the Nova. In the distance we can hear
          DRUMS. BONGOS. There's CHANTING. And LAUGHTER.
          Piper rises and gazes at him over the roof. She's scared.
          Milton shoves the 357 into his back waistband, slides the
          ancient revolver into a leather hip-holster then he leans in
          and grabs his shotgun.

                         MILTON
          Stay here.
          Piper nods.
          Milton moves toward the jagged rocks in the distance but soon
          we can make out the flicking light of fire ahead as Milton
          moves toward a cliff's edge.

          EXT. STILWATER MARSH - CLIFF'S EDGE - NIGHT

          Milton lowers to the ground and crawls to the edge.

                         MILTON'S POV

                         

                         

                         

                         

          88.
          A twenty foot drop off to the ravine floor below. The ravine
          is filled with giant oil derricks, like metallic T-Rex's,
          rising and falling to the SHRIEK of oiled metal.
          And in the center of this Jurassic gathering, a CROWD of
          people dance and sway around a giant bonfire. It is
          celebration, ritual and orgy rolled into one.
          Brawny cultists erect a makeshift stone altar. On the
          opposite side of the Oil-Rig ravine - the battered RV sits
          like a mobile command post.

          CLOSE ON MILTON'S FACE
          He was expecting less than twenty followers. There are forty
          down there. Fuck.

          EXT. STILWATER MARSH - NEVADA - NIGHT

          Milton walks slowly back toward the Nova. His head lowered
          in deep thought. How does one man and a kid take on forty?
          Suddenly a look of alarm crosses his face!
          He jerks the ancient revolver and aims it ahead.

                         HIS POV
          Piper sits on the hood of the Nova next to the Accountant.

                         MILTON
          Get away from her.

                         ACCOUNTANT
          I think not.

                         MILTON
          I shoot you with this, you know
          what it means. No heaven. No
          hell. You cease to exist.

                         ACCOUNTANT
          All the more reason to keep Ms.
          Piper in close proximity. You are
          old, Milton. You might miss again.

                         MILTON
          You can't stop me.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          89.

                         ACCOUNTANT
          Stop you? Milton, you wouldn't be
          here without me, you ungrateful
          shit. That roadblock back there,
          that would have stopped you. So I
          want you to drop that iron God-
          Killer and say thank you.
          Milton stares.
          The Accountant, moves. Quickly. With a crisp flick,
          suddenly there's a blade at Piper's throat. She GASPS.

                         ACCOUNTANT
          I said, drop it and thank you.
          Milton puts up his hand, flings the revolver into the
          darkness behind him.

                         MILTON
          Don't hurt her. Th-Thank you.

                         ACCOUNTANT
          That's better.
          He lowers the blade, but keeps Piper close.

                         ACCOUNTANT
          You're not the first to get out and
          I doubt you'll be the last but I
          gotta know, HOW did you get out
          with the God-Killer?

                         MILTON

                         (CHUCKLES)
          I just walked in and took it.

                         ACCOUNTANT
          You did not.

                         MILTON
          I'm an old washed up lifer. Never
          occurred to'em that I was up to no good.

                         ACCOUNTANT
          Wouldn't wanna be you when he finds
          out.

                         MILTON
          What's he gonna do? Not let me
          back in? Now, I gotta know. Why?
          Why help me?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          90.

                         PIPER
          I know why. It's because of those
          crazy fucks out there isn't it?
          They figured something out didn't
          they? Somehow they know how to
          summon a piece of hell to earth.
          The Accountant laughs.

                         ACCOUNTANT
          That's cute. You haven't told her?

                         MILTON
          She don't listen.

                         ACCOUNTANT
          Young Ms. Piper, let you in on a
          little secret. The Dark Lord?
          Satan? Beelzebub? Lucifer? Simply
          the warden of a very large prison.
          Quiet man, actually. Thoughtful.
          Well read. I happen to know the
          idea of sacrificing children in his
          honor annoys him greatly.

                         MILTON
          Then why? Why help me?

                         ACCOUNTANT
          Simple. Like the warden, we all
          have jobs to do. Getting you here
          makes my job easier. You get what
          you want, I get what I want.

                         MILTON
          Then help me, now. There are forty of
          them down there. You and I could--

                         ACCOUNTANT
          --No.

                         MILTON

                         BUT--

                         ACCOUNTANT
          --No. You want to save her then go
          do it. If you win, I win. If they
          take you down, I win.
          He hugs Piper closer.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          91.

                         ACCOUNTANT
          You like butter on your popcorn?
          It's sure to be a grand show.
          Piper doesn't know what to say.
          The Accountant glances back at Milton.

                         ACCOUNTANT
          You're still here? Milton, the clock
          is ticking. Midnight approaches.

                         MILTON
          Then get off my fuckin car.

          EXT. OIL RIG RAVINE - NIGHT

          The RV door flings open revealing Jonah King. He walks with
          arrogance through the orgy around him, his followers turn to
          him with reverence. His name is WHISPERED like a secret.
          He approaches the make-shift stone altar where Skanky Gal
          holds the baby within a bundle of blankets.
          HIGH ABOVE: the moon is full and ripe.

                         JONAH KING
          It's almost time.
          Skanky Gal nods. But there is hesitation in her eyes. She's
          grown attached to the baby.
          Jonah takes the baby, places her on the stone altar.

                         JONAH KING
          My brothers and sisters, we have come
          so far. To this place where the
          dying earth bleeds its corrupt soul
          at our feet. From its death, it shall
          be reborn. As we will be. We who
          have survived the slings. The
          arrows. The revulsion of those too
          weak to believe. We have been cast
          out. And hunted. But no more.
          Followers gather, move in unison, dance, writhe, fuck.
          Tattoo approaches with an old rusty knife. It was probably
          elegant once. Now it is worthless. He hands it to Jonah.
          The Followers GASP in holy awe.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          92.

                         JONAH KING
          (raising the knife)
          With this sacrifice, no more will
          we be shunned. They say the meek
          will inherit. They LIE. We are
          not meek. We are chosen. The
          hounds of perdition will howl at
          our command. For now we...
          A HOWLING noise.
          No. An engine. Distant but thunderous.
          Heads turn. The sound echoes throughout the ravine then --

          FOOOM!
          The NOVA ROCKETS from the cliff's edge!
          It plummets straight at the cultists!
          They scatter! But three are not so lucky, they vanish as the
          giant Chevy turns them to PULP!
          Jonah's jaw drops. This can't fuckin' be.
          Skanky Gal, grabs the baby and flees toward one of the giant
          oil derricks!

          INT. 69 NOVA - NIGHT

          Milton wears a mask of rage as he rips the Nova into a 180,
          his 357 aimed out the window.

          KABOOM! BOOM! KUHFWOOM!
          He's shooting Cultists in a barrel.
          But the Nova is the better weapon. He FLOORS it, then LOCKS
          the brakes, fishtailing.

          EXT. 69 NOVA - NIGHT

          The Nova's ass-end veers like a dragon's tail SMACKING
          cultists aside with BONE-SHATTERING brutality.

          EXT. OIL RIG RAVINE - NIGHT

          Jonah grabs a shotgun from behind the altar, opens FIRE.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          93.

                         JONAH KING
          Kill him! KILL HIM!
          Followers produce an assortment of firepower and RIDDLE the
          Nova with lead!
          Milton sights Jonah, ready to blow him to fuck, catches the
          reverend while he cocks the pump.
          JONAH can see Milton's got him.
          MILTON grits and pulls the 357's trigger: Click. Click.

          BLAM!
          Jonah fires a fresh round - barely missing as--
          Milton GUNS the engine - SMASHES two followers head on. They
          fly up the hood, SMASH the glass - but shield him from
          another frontal assault. Their bodies RIDDLED with lead.
          The Cultists circle him to get a better shot.
          A Magnum is thrust into the driver's side window - right in
          Milton's face.
          He leans back just as the gun is FIRED. Milton yanks the
          wheel, reverses the Nova - wrenches the Magnum from the
          fucker's hand. The Cultist hangs on. Claws at Milton.
          Milton twirls the Magnum, gunslinger style. Jams the barrel
          into the Cultist's face and FIRES.
          Milton runs down any that get in his way.

          EXT. STILWATER MARSH - CLIFF'S EDGE - NIGHT

          The Accountant stands above the battle, Piper at his side.
          He can hear her heartbeat.

                         ACCOUNTANT
          You want to help him.

                         PIPER
          Yes.

                         ACCOUNTANT
          He chose you, you know that. Fast
          car, spunky attitude. He put your
          life at risk and you still want to
          help him?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          94.

                         PIPER
          Yes.

                         ACCOUNTANT
          Then go.
          She rushes toward a goat path leading down to the valley
          below. Suddenly something catches her eye.

          CLOSE ON GROUND
          The Ancient Revolver.
          Without the slightest pause, Piper snatches it, spins and
          aims it right at...
          The Accountant's smiling face.

                         ACCOUNTANT
          Hold on tight. It has quite a kick.

                         PIPER
          If I kill you, you can't take him.

                         ACCOUNTANT
          Someone else will come...someone
          else always comes.
          Piper considers, the SOUNDS of battle rising from below.

                         ACCOUNTANT
          Piper, he didn't steal that gun to
          kill me. He stole it to slow me down.
          He's getting what he wanted. Now, go
          to him. Before it's too late.
          Piper turns and scrambles down the goat path.

          INT. 69 NOVA - NIGHT

          Milton is ROARING in anger as the NOVA is PEPPERED with
          bullets and shotgun blasts. GLASS, SPARKS and CHAOS rain
          down on him. Steam and oil SPEW from the engine.

          EXT. 69 NOVA - NIGHT

          Ducking in the seat, unable to see, Milton fights to keep

                         CONTROL UNTIL:
          Jonah BLASTS the front driver's side tire, SHREDDING it -

                         

                         

                         

                         

          95.
          The NOVA pitches hard to the left, PIN-WHEELING right into an
          oil derrick.
          The SCREAM of metal on metal rips through the ravine. The
          Nova SCREECHES to a halt, tires SPIN, smoke spews, gas drips
          from the wreck.
          Jonah and the half a dozen remaining Cultists zero in around
          the Nova, guns trained on the driver's door.
          Jonah nods to Tattoo who approaches close to the ground,
          reaches out slowly and YANKS the door open.

          KA-FOOM!
          Tattoo is blown backwards by a shotgun blast!

                         JONAH KING
          Kill him!
          Jonah and his men open FIRE!

          INT. 69 NOVA - NIGHT

          Milton SCREAMS as the Nova's cab turns into a warzone. He
          clambers deep inside the wreck. Praying they don't ignite
          the leaking fuel. Then the firing stops.

          EXT. 69 NOVA - NIGHT

          Jonah and his men draw closer and closer.

                         THEIR POV
          Soon they'll have a direct shot right into the Nova's open
          driver's side door.

          PIPER (O.S.)

          HEY!
          The men spin to find Piper standing behind them, ancient
          revolver aimed into their group. She pulls the trigger.

          KAFOOM!
          Jesus wept. The KICKBACK blows Piper off her feet, the gun
          jerked from her hands.
          She lands on her back. Hard. The wind KNOCKED out of her.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          96.
          The GOD SLUG slams into a cultist's stomach. It EXPLODES
          through him, and into the BATTERED RV BEHIND:

          KABLAAAAM!
          The RV goes nuclear - blows shrapnel and cultists helter
          skelter across the ravine, shredding the remaining five.
          JONAH is spattered with his men's blood, dives behind the
          wreck of the Nova.

                         JONAH KING
          Well...this has all gone to shit.
          He steadies himself, grips the shotgun and shoves it into the
          Nova's open driver's side door.

                         HIS POV
          Empty. The passenger door is open. Milton is gone.
          Jonah spins in all directions. Expecting a trick. But
          nothing. He rushes around the Nova to find...
          Milton crawling. Bleeding.

          MILTON'S POV
          Skanky Gal cowers twenty yards away beneath an oil derrick.
          The baby wrapped in pink blankets in her arms.
          Jonah walks up oozing arrogance. He knows he's won.
          He places the barrel of the shotgun to Milton's chin.

                         JONAH KING
          You lose.

                         (LOOKS UP)
          Get over here!
          Skanky continues to cower. Doesn't budge.

                         JONAH KING
          I said get over here! I want him
          to watch me kill the kid!
          Skanky doesn't move.

                         JONAH KING

                         (TO MILTON)
          Stupid bitch. Fine. Then just
          know I promise to kill her slowly.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          97.
          Jonah raises the barrel to Milton's forehead then...
          Someone near CLEARS HIS THROAT.
          Jonah turns, stares.
          The Accountant leans against the Nova's hulk. He winks.
          At Jonah's feet, Milton scrambles forward and we realize he
          wasn't crawling toward his grand-baby.
          He was crawling toward the ancient revolver.
          He snatches it, rolls onto his back as--
          Jonah swings his gun toward Milton --

          KAFOOM!
          The burning God Slug HITS JONAH IN THE FACE!
          Jonah's head is obliterated. The force yanks his headless
          body into the air, spins it sky-wards in a plume of flame.
          The Accountant moves away, watching as --
          The burning corpse slaps onto the leaking wreck of the Nova.

          THE GAS IGNITES
          FLAMES ERUPT with THUNDER clear to the heavens - the Nova
          ROARS one final time, living up to it's name in a furious
          ball of fire that consumes whatever's left of Jonah King.

                         ANOTHER ANGLE
          Piper SUCKS in air. Sits up. Fire lighting her face.

                         PIPER
          Milton?!
          He lies on his back several yards away.
          Piper rushes up, falls beside him.
          He's alive, mouth filled with blood. She takes his hand.

                         ANOTHER ANGLE
          Skanky Gal looks up to find...
          ...the Accountant standing over her. He holds out his arms.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          98.
          She hands him the baby.

                         ACCOUNTANT
          I'm curious. Would you have let
          him do it?
          She opens her mouth to speak, says nothing...

                         ACCOUNTANT
          That's what I thought.
          He turns and walks away from her.

                         ACCOUNTANT
          See you. Soon.
          Skanky bolts. Races off into the darkness.

          ON MILTON AND PIPER

                         PIPER
          Milton...no...
          Milton struggles. His head lolls back and forth. Eyes flick
          around. Searching.

                         MILTON
          Where...where is she?

                         ACCOUNTANT
          She's here.
          The Accountant hands the baby to Milton.
          Milton stares at the tiny face. The big bright eyes.
          Innocent. Beautiful in every miraculous way.
          He places her in Piper's arms.

                         MILTON
          Keep her safe.

                         PIPER
          I will. Anyone tries to hurt her
          and I'll kill'em.

                         MILTON
          I know. That's why I chose you.

          A HORN BLARES.
          They all turn toward the high cliff.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          99.

                         THEIR POV
          WEBSTER climbs from the 69 Camaro.

                         MILTON
          Webster will look after you both.
          As long as he can. And he'll keep
          trying long after he can't.

                         PIPER
          Milton. This can't...you can't
          just give up. There's gotta be
          something we can do to...

                         MILTON
          Beat the devil? Nah. Never gonna
          happen. I'm askin more than I have
          a right to. I know it. But love
          her for me, Piper. Love her and
          make her yours. I don't have any
          right to ask for your promise...

                         PIPER

                         (WITHOUT HESITATION)
          I promise. Milton. I promise.
          Milton coughs.

                         MILTON
          Thank you.
          And like that. The life fades from his eyes.
          Piper holds the baby close, SOBS.
          She looks up at the Accountant. But he is gone.

          EXT. STILWATER MARSH - NEVADA - DAWN

          The sun glows to the east as --
          --Piper cradles the baby as she climbs the goat path where
          Webster is waiting. He rushes to her, places an arm around
          her. Leads her toward the Camaro as --

          EXT. OIL RIG RAVINE - DAWN


          CLOSE ON MILTON
          He twitches.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          100.
          His one good eye opens. It rolls around then settles on
          something above.

                         MILTON
          How was that?

          MOVE TO REVEAL
          The Accountant stands over him.

                         ACCOUNTANT
          I've seen better. Guess she
          doesn't know you can beat him, slow
          him, shoot him, even stop him...

                         MILTON
          ...But you can't kill a dead man.
          Milton sits up slowly. Bones CREAK. He holds his hand out.
          The Accountant takes it. Pulls him to his feet.
          They turn and walk toward the rising sun.
          They walk until they are just silhouettes against a bright
          yellow glow...then...
          ...they fade into the shimmering heat...
          ...and they are gone.

          FADE TO BLACK.

1   EXT. A STREET NEAR BRICK LANE - EVENING                       1

    It's 5.30pm in late December and rain is pouring. The
    scant Christmas decorations are hanging limp in the rain.
    A young Turk (EKREM) runs through the rain with a Turkish
    newspaper held over his head. He ducks into a traditional
    barber's shop called Ozim's.

2   INT. OZIM'S BARBER SHOP - EVENING                             2

    The shutters are drawn. OZIM (a plump middle-aged Turk)
    is cutting the hair of the last customer of the day (SOYKA).
    Soyka is a Chechen, well-groomed, wearing a sharp suit
    beneath the barber's gown.

    During the conversation we glimpse distinctive eagle- and
    star-shaped tattoos on Soyka's arms and hands.

    Ozim and Soyka are chatting as Ekrem enters.   Soyka speaks
    with a Russian accent.

                           OZIM
              Guvenilmez... daginik... bloody
              kids, you know... he says - `but
              Amca it's Christmas?... Christmas!
              We're Islam!

                          SOYKA
              Oi, how much are you taking off?

                          OZIM
              Christmas! So I said to him...
              alisverise cimac. The kid's
              sixteen...

    Ozim brushes some hair off the customer's shoulder and
    Ozim finally acknowledges Ekrem, who is shivering and wet
    near to the door. Ekrem turns the `Open' sign to `Closed'.

                          OZIM (CONT'D)
              They don't want to work do they.
              Shicma....

                          EKREM
                  (hesitantly
                   interrupting)
              Uncle Ozim.......

    We see for the first time that Ekrem is shaking with fear
    as well as cold.

                                OZIM
                 This is him.     The kid I'm talking
                 about.

    Ekrem approaches, stiffened by terror.       Soyka nods at Ekrem
    in the mirror.

                             SOYKA
                 He looks OK to me... how you doin'
                 Ekrem?

    Soyka offers Ekrem a hand to shake and Ekrem stares at it
    as if it were enchanted...

                             OZIM
                 He looks OK, yeah, but he won't do
                 one lousy thing for me. Here,
                 look... Ekrem, take this...

    Ozim takes an open razor from behind a line of hair-tonic
    bottles and hands it to Ekrem, who now looks mortally
    terrified.

                             EKREM
                 Ozim... memnum etmek.

                             OZIM
                 We had a deal now he's backing
                 out.

                             SOYKA
                     (laughing)
                 Hey Ozim, leave the kid alone.
                 It's obviously a psychological
                 thing...

                             OZIM
                 Take it Ekrem.

                             SOYKA
                 Ozim, it's OK. I don't want a shave.

                             OZIM
                 This is the kid who walks around
                 like Al Capone. Take the fucking
                 ustura and finish this Rushca.

                             SOYKA
                     (startled)
                 What?

    Soyka rises up from the seat, casting off his barber's
    gown. Ozim yells `kabuka! And Ekrem snarls, flicks open
    the razor and drags it across Soyka's throat. Soyka's scream
    bubbles in the blood.

3   EXT. KILBURN HIGH ROAD - NIGHT                                 3

    We dissolve to a Christmas decoration flashing on and off
    in the rain, high on a lamp post in Kilburn High Road. We
    pan down the lamp post to the High Road where revelers are
    hurrying through the rain. We see a young girl (TATIANA)
    hurrying across the street, wrapped in a dressing gown
    with a man's overcoat thrown over the top of it. Her hair
    is soaked as she approaches an all night chemist's shop.
    She is barefoot.

4   INT. CHEMIST'S SHOP - NIGHT                                    4

    The CHEMIST is delivering advice in Gujurati to a CUSTOMER.
    Tatiana wipes rain from her face and the Chemist and the
    customer react to her ragged appearance.

                          TATIANA
                  (Russian accent)
              Please... I have...

                          CHEMIST
              For methadone I need to see paper
              prescription.

    The customer looks at Tatiana's feet and reacts. We see
    blood trickling down her legs. Tatiana looks down, then
    faints onto the floor.

5   INT. TRAFALGAR HOSPITAL. OPERATING WARD - NIGHT                5

    We see Tatiana unconscious on a wheeled trolley bursting
    through double doors into the operating ward of Trafalgar
    hospital. The trolley is accompanied by TWO NURSES, a
    JUNIOR DOCTOR and a midwife, (ANNA KHITROVA). The two
    PARAMEDICS who brought her are following behind the trolley.

                          ANNA
              Did you get a name?

                             PARAMEDIC
              No.

6   INT. TRAFALGAR HOSPITAL. OPERATING THEATER - NIGHT                6

    A tiny brown handbag is being shaken empty by a nurse.
    Tatiana is being prepared for an emergency Caesarean. The
    theater is full of people in scrubs, including an
    anesthetist. Monitors and drips are being attached at double
    speed.

    We notice that her arms are already dotted with festering
    needle marks.

    A nurse searches through the contents of the handbag and
    we can hear frantic activity from the operating table....

                             NURSE 1
                 Her stats are very poor, very poor.
                 Baby's very distressed.

    Anna approaches the nurse, who is rummaging through the
    contents of the bag. We see a business card from a
    restaurant called `The Trans-Siberian', a St. Christopher
    necklace and a tiny battered diary. Anna grabs the diary.

                             JUNIOR DOCTOR
                 Shoulder distocia, I think.   Stuck
                 on the pubic bone.

    Cut to Anna at Tatiana's head.    Anna strokes her face and
    speaks softly.

                             ANNA
                 Darling... darling, can you hear
                 me?

                             NURSE
                 Baby's heart beat sixty... fifty-

                             JUNIOR DOCTOR
                 Anna, I'm trying to rotate the
                 shoulder medially... shit...

    THE JUNIOR DOCTOR is breathing hard with a look of utter
    panic as he attempts to free the baby.

    The doors burst open and a more senior doctor in his mid
    thirties (DOCTOR AZIZ) enters at a gallop. As he enters...

                 I'm not getting a pulse.

    Heartbeats. Doctor Aziz joins the junior doctor, who looks
    out of his depth.

                             AZIZ
                 Speak to me...

    Before the junior doctor can speak Anna speaks directly to
    Aziz.

                              ANNA
                     (softly)
                 We need to get the baby out now.

    Aziz knows he can take Anna's word...

                             AZIZ
                 OK, let's go.

    All hell is let loose. As the Caesarean process begins at
    frantic speed, we slowly zoom in on Tatiana's unconscious
    face and hear her voice in V.O... a young girl's voice
    speaking with an Russian accent. The crosstalk between
    nurses and doctors becomes more and more frantic.

                             TATIANA (V.O.)
                 My name is Tatiana. My father
                 died in the mines in my village,
                 so he was already buried when he
                 died. We were all buried there.
                 Buried under the soil of Russia.
                 That is why I left to find a better
                 life.

    We hear... a baby cry. Anna's face appears in our framed
    shot of Tatiana's face. She gently kisses Tatiana's cheek.

                             ANNA
                     (whispers)
                 You had a girl.

    A sheet is pulled over Tatiana's face. A nurse weighs the
    screaming baby. Anna wipes her brow with the back of her
    bloody wrist.

    The Junior doctor and a nurse check watches and speak almost
    in unison...

7   EXT. TRAFALGAR HOSPITAL. LABOR WARD - MORNING                 7

    Anna leaves the labor ward, putting on her crash helmet.
    She emerges out into the crisp, sunny morning. Aziz hurries
    to catch her up and hands her a wrapped gift.

                            AZIZ
                Merry Christmas, Anna.

                            ANNA
                Oh, don't be ridiculous.

    He grins.

                            AZIZ
                And you have to open it in front
                of me.

    Aziz smiles as Anna unwraps a pair of leather motorcycling
    gloves. She looks up at him, expressionless.

                            AZIZ (CONT'D)
                At least pretend.

    Anna considers the gloves.

                In the whole entire history of my

                special.

                              AZIZ
                Thank you.

    Aziz plants a kiss on his two fingers and presses his
    fingers against Anna's cheek through the open visor of the
    helmet.

8   EXT. LONDON STREET - DAY                                         8

    Anna rides her big vintage URAL motorcycle through deserted
    morning streets. As she rides, we hear Tatiana in V.O.

                             TATIANA (V.O.)
                 I am so excited this morning.
                 Yesterday a friend came back to
                 our village and he told us all
                 about the places on the map that I
                 look at... Paris, Amsterdam, London.
                 He's been there for real...

9   INT. HELEN'S HOUSE. ANNA'S BEDROOM - DAY                         9

    After the bright airiness of the bike ride, we are suddenly
    in Anna's bedroom where the curtains are drawn. Anna is
    lying awake on the bed, wearing a dressing gown.

                             TATIANA (V.O.)
                 ...he said the future of everything
                 was already happening in all those
                 places.

    There is a gentle knock at the door, which opens before
    Anna can respond. It is ANNA'S MOTHER (HELEN) with a cup
    of tea.

                             HELEN
                 Did you sleep?

                 A bit.

                             HELEN
                 There's no point us tiptoeing around
                 if you're not even sleeping.

    Helen puts the tea on the dressing table, then turns to
    leave without a smile.

                                  ANNA
                 Mum?       Are you OK?

10   INT.   HELEN'S HOUSE. KITCHEN - DAY                             10

     Anna is pouring two glasses of sherry. Helen is peeling
     potatoes. Anna peers at Helen... and sees tears. They
     share a moment of stifled emotion. Helen wipes her eyes
     with her sleeve.

                              HELEN
                  It's the chicken.
                      (pause)
                  The smell of chicken roasting
                  reminds me of him.

                              ANNA
                  You should have done beef, then.

     They look at each other and giggle. They both have potato
     peelers in their wet hands, sleeves rolled up, two practical
     unsentimental women being almost consumed by the same wave
     of emotion.

                              HELEN
                  It wouldn't be Christmas without
                  tears in the gravy, would it.

     We hear a gruff Russian voice calling out from the living
     room (UNCLE STEPAN).

                                STEPAN (V.O.)
                      (angry)
                  Anna! Anna!    Where did you get
                  this?

     Anna and Helen roll their eyes.

                              HELEN
                      (whispering)
                  It's your own fault for giving him
                  something to play with.

                              ANNA
                      (irritated)
                  Well, I can't read Russian, can I?

     Anna drops her peeler and hurries into the living room.

     The living room table is laid for dinner. Uncle Stepan is
     early seventies, Russian. He is reading the tiny diary
     that Anna found in Tatiana's bag. Anna breezes in.

                              ANNA
                  I told you, Uncle Stepan, I found
                  it in the handbag of a girl who
                  died in my ward.

                              STEPAN
                  Do you always rob the bodies of
                  the dead?

                       anger)
                  Of course, we all do it. It's one
                  of the perks of working in a
                  hospital.

     Stepan grumbles, accustomed to this teasing.

     Helen enters carrying a bowl of walnuts and brazil nuts
     which she places on the table.

     Pause.   Stepan looks pointedly at Helen.

                              STEPAN
                  Did you know that your daughter
                  robs the bodies of the dead?

                  Stepan, is there an address?

     Stepan lays the diary aside, obstinate and prim.

                              STEPAN
                  You have an uncle who doesn't steal
                  things from the dead. Not even
                  their secrets.

                              HELEN
                  Oh, don't go all momentous on us,
                  Stepan.
                      (she straightens
                       the table cloth)
                  Lift your elbows.

                              STEPAN
                  You should put this in her coffin,
                  Anna. Bury her secrets with her
                  bodies.

                               ANNA
                  Body.   Singular.

     Stepan leaves in a huff. Anna picks up the diary and begins
     to study it. She sees the `Trans-Siberian' business card
     between the pages.

                              ANNA (CONT'D)
                  How long will dinner be?

     Helen looks at Anna, suspecting an attempt to escape.

12   EXT. LONDON STREETS - DAY                                       12

     Driving music as we see Anna riding her motorbike through
     deserted morning streets again. We should begin to sense
     that this is a kind of release for her. We hear Tatiana
     in V.O.

                              TATIANA (V.O.)
                  When I was little, London was like
                  a place in the Bible. I wasn't
                  even sure if it was real. My friend
                  has told me there is a place in
                  London where they pay girls to
                  sing.

     Anna arrives outside the `Trans-Siberian' restaurant. It
     has a Russian-themed frontage in blue and gold, expensively
     and recently finished.

                  He said if I sang in this restaurant
                  I would make more money in a week
                  than my father made in a year.

     As Anna pulls up we hear a dog begin to bark.

13   EXT. TRANS-SIBERIAN RESTAURANT. SIDE ENTRANCE - DAY               13

     The side door opens to reveal a hard-looking, handsome
     Russian man (NIKOLAI), who stops to groom his hair back
     from his face and put on a pair of sunglasses as he emerges
     into daylight. He steps into a small courtyard, where a
     fierce Doberman dog is barking and snarling on the end of
     a chain.

     Nikolai is followed by KIRILL, who is a little younger,
     slim and pretty but hard-looking too. Kirill is dressed in
     a crumpled T-shirt and jeans and looks like he had a heavy
     night. Nikolai ignores the dog as he walks by but Kirill
     yells at it and teases it with a whoop and few Russian
     curses. Nikolai unbolts the gate to the street.

                              KIRILL
                  So you pick up Ozim and his bitch
                  of a wife and you bring them back
                  here.

     He glances back at the restaurant and speaks softly.

                              KIRILL (CONT'D)
                  Then I'll think of an excuse and
                  we can get away.

                              NIKOLAI
                  I'll think of an excuse. Your
                  excuses are like fucking fairy
                  tales.

     Kirill grins and Nikolai flicks the fob of his car keys.
     The lights on an expensive black Mercedes glow in response.
     Kirill notices Anna locking up her bike at the front of
     the restaurant.

                              KIRILL
                  Who the fuck's that?

     They both see Anna removing her crash helmet and shaking
     out her hair. She walks towards the front door.

                              NIKOLAI
                      (in Russian)
                  Maybe somebody sent your dad a
                  hooker for Christmas.

                              KIRILL
                      (grinning)
                  You're so... fucking unbelievably
                  disrespectful.

     Kirill sees that Nikolai is studying Anna and his grin
     fades. We sense jealousy.

                              KIRILL (CONT'D)
                  Hey, you've got work to do.   Go...

     Kirill grabs Nikolai's face to distract him, gives him a
     playful slap, but there is somehow more to it than
     playfulness. Nikolai gets into his car.

     Kirill glares at Anna as she approaches the front of the
     restaurant.

14   EXT. TRANS-SIBERIAN RESTAURANT - DAY                              14

     As Nikolai drives away, Anna rings the doorbell beside the
     front door. There is no reply. She is about to ring again
     when the door opens. We see SEMYON, a Russian man in his
     late sixties. He is wiping his hands on a tea towel,
     dressed in a spotlessly white apron. He has the sparkling
     piercing eyes of a falcon.

                              SEMYON
                  We are closed.

                                ANNA
                  I know.

     She fumbles in her bag.

                              ANNA (CONT'D)
                  Sorry... I'm a midwife.

     Anna produces her hospital ID and shows it to Semyon.

                  Then unless one of my daughters is
                  keeping something from me, you
                  have the wrong address.

                              ANNA
                  I'd like to speak to the Manager.

     Semyon studies the name on the ID.

                              SEMYON
                  Khitrova?

                  My dad was Russian.

     Semyon seems suddenly delighted.

                              SEMYON
                  And his name?

                              ANNA
                  Ivan.

                              SEMYON
                  So, you are Anna Ivanovna.

15   INT. TRANS-SIBERIAN RESTAURANT - DAY                           15

     The tables are set for a huge party. Kirill is now on
     step ladders, fixing some Christmas decorations. Other
     relatives are getting the place ready. Semyon hurries
     through the restaurant, leading Anna by the hand.

                               SEMYON
                  We must hurry. I must stir. Stir,
                  stir or the gravy dies in my hands.
                  Today it is family. Here is my
                  son, Kirill.
                      (he hisses at Kirill)
                  Kirill! The berries are too low,
                  too low. And Roman, more glasses
                  for red!
                      (he claps his hands)
                  Come on!

     Kirill follows Anna's progress through the restaurant with
     a glare.

     leads to the kitchen. Semyon stops when he reaches them
     and puts his hands on his hips.

                           SEMYON (CONT'D)
               My angels. You should be
               practising. You must make the
               wood cry. Like this, like this...

     Semyon grabs a violin and plays a three-second burst of
     sad Russian violin music.

                              SEMYON (CONT'D)
               You see...

     Semyon hurries on into the kitchen.    Anna smiles, delighted
     at the eccentric old man.

16   INT. TRANS-SIBERIAN RESTAURANT. KITCHEN - DAY                   16

     Inside the kitchen there is an inferno of activity, steam,
     smoke. Family members, some dressed in their party outfits,
     others in chefs' uniforms, are standing over steaming pots,
     laughing, arguing. Children play and yell. You can almost
     smell Christmas. Anna enters, dazzled by it all,
     overwhelmed by the contrast to her own lifeless Christmas
     kitchen. Semyon calls out to everyone.

                           SEMYON
               Come, come, hurry, hurry.    They
               will be here any moment.
                   (to Anna)
               Ok, show me this card.

     Anna reaches into her pocket and produces the `Trans-
     Siberian' business card she found in Tatiana's bag. Semyon
     angles his head to look as he stirs.

                           SEMYON (CONT'D)
               It is the old card. From before
               the renovations. But even so, if
               she had worked here I would remember
               the name. Perhaps she ate here
               once. Try this.

     Semyon offers Anna a spoonful of his gravy.    She sips it.

                           ANNA
               God, that's amazing. My dad made
               gravy just like that.

     Semyon shrugs and smiles, his eyes twinkling, then goes
     back to stirring. He speaks as if unconcerned.

                              SEMYON
                  So did you get a chance to talk to
                  this girl before she died?

     Nikolai's black Mercedes pulls up outside the restaurant
     and parks a few inches from Anna's motorbike. The rear
     windows are sun shaded so we only see Nikolai in the
     driver's seat.   He gets out of the car and opens the rear
     door of the car for an elegantly dressed Turkish lady in
     her fifties. Nikolai goes to the other rear door. The
     portly figure of Ozim the barber emerges. As Ozim gets out
     he gives Nikolai a fifty-pound note.

18   INT. TRANS-SIBERIAN RESTAURANT. KITCHEN - DAY                   18

     Two of the little girl violinists are fighting, pulling
     each other's hair. The third is sobbing, sitting on the
     floor. A young woman in a party dress is carrying a huge
     silver bowl of sauce across the kitchen.

     Anna looks delighted at the noise and energy of the place.
     Finally Semyon emerges from a cloud of steam with a scrap
     of paper.

                              SEMYON
                  This is an agency that hires casual
                  kitchen staff. Maybe you will
                  have more luck there. But I think
                  they will be closed until New Year.

     As Anna takes the address, Kirill puts his head around
     the door and yells through the noise.

                              KIRILL
                  Papa, Ozim is here.

     Semyon is alarmed and claps his hand in urgent fashion.

                  tell him I am coming.

     Semyon takes a pot from the heat, suddenly flustered.

                              SEMYON (CONT'D)
                  Anna, I'm so sorry I couldn't help.
                  It is sad.

                  That's OK. I'll probably find out
                  more when I get her diary
                  translated.

                               SEMYON
                  Her diary?

     There is the tiniest of changes in Semyon's manner.        He
     lays his heavy pot down.

                              ANNA
                  I found her diary in her bag.

     A pause. Semyon disappears into a billow of steam to put
     a pan onto the heat then re-emerges.

                              SEMYON
                  Why did you not tell me you found
                  a diary?

     He peers at her for a moment, his eyes hardening a little.

                              SEMYON (CONT'D)
                  OK, Anna, this is how it will be.
                  You will bring the diary here and
                  I will translate it for you. Then
                  if we get the names of any relatives
                  I will call them myself. I am
                  something of a... community leader
                  for the Russians here in this
                  unfriendly city. What do you say?

     Semyon hoists a passing child into his arms.

               Then it is settled. But for now,

     Kirill and Ozim are talking confidentially in a mix of
     Russian and Turkish whispers at a table. Ozim's wife is
     at a table alone, well out of their earshot, smoking a
     cigarette and peeling glazed figs. As Anna walks by, Ozim
     and Kirill stop talking. The scene has a much darker mood
     to the bustling scene in the kitchen, but for now Anna
     feels no unease. As she passes, Kirill surveys her with a
     deadly smile and a professional eye.

     Anna emerges into the daylight. As she does she sees that
     four expensive-looking cars have already parked and various
     ostentatiously dressed Russian and Turkish couples with
     their children are emerging from their cars. The women are
     all wearing furs, even the little girls. The men wear
     leather or dark suits. They greet each other exuberantly
     as they emerge from their cars. Anna suddenly feels
     slightly uneasy. As she approaches her motorbike she sees
     Nikolai leaning against the bonnet of his car, smoking,
     still wearing shades. His bumper is almost touching Anna's
     bike.

                                 ANNA
                  Thank you.

                              NIKOLAI
                  A Ural. You don't see them anymore.

                              ANNA
                  It was my dad's.

                              NIKOLAI
                  How much do you want for it?

     Anna has already taken a dislike to this man. He is
     arrogant and looks potentially violent. His shades, suit
     and tattoos say it all.

                              ANNA
                      (irritated)
                  It has sentimental value.

     Nikolai rolls the concept around in his mind and considers.

                  `Sentimental value'.   I've heard
                  of that.

     Anna puts her helmet on.

               You're not staying for the party?

                              ANNA
               No.

                           NIKOLAI
               Nor me. Chauffeurs don't get
               invited. You want to go for a
               drink instead?

     Anna mounts her bike.

                           ANNA
               It's Christmas. Everything's
               closed.

     Nikolai smiles.

                           NIKOLAI
               Sometimes if things are closed you
               just open them up, you know?

     Anna now feels intimidated and luckily the bike fires first
     time. She rides away. Nikolai watches her go and then
     stubs his cigarette.

21   INT. HELEN'S HOUSE. DINING ROOM - NIGHT                        21

     Sudden silence... perhaps the ticking of a clock. This is
     Anna's Christmas dinner, a total contrast to the chaos of
     the restaurant. Stepan is attempting to carve the chicken.

                           STEPAN
               Anna, how come is it that your
               boyfriend isn't here to carve?

     Stepan takes a large sip of vodka.

                           ANNA
               I don't live with Oliver any more,
               Uncle Stepan. I'm living back
               here for a bit.

                            HELEN
                   (softly)
               For as long as you want.

                           STEPAN
               I knew he would run away from you.

                              ANNA
                  He didn't run away. You make me
                  sound like a burning building.

                              STEPAN
                  Black men always run away.

                               HELEN
                  Oh Stepan!

                               STEPAN
                  What?   I am allowed to be honest?

                              HELEN
                  He was a doctor, Stepan.

                              ANNA
                  What the hell has that got to do
                  with it?

     A pause.     Stepan sips his vodka.

                              STEPAN
                  It is not natural to mix race and
                  race. That is why your baby died
                  inside you.

     Anna slams her napkin onto the table.

                               HELEN
                  Stepan, shut up!
                      (Anna gets to her
                       feet)
                  Please Anna.

     Helen takes Anna's hand but she turns and leaves. Helen
     stands to follow her, but first she whips Stepan's vodka
     away from him.

                              HELEN (CONT'D)
                  You're just how he was. Stupid
                  bloody drunken Russians.

22   EXT. HELEN'S HOUSE. GARDEN - NIGHT                              22

     The garden is just outside the kitchen.

     Anna is lighting a cigarette. Helen steps outside and
     reacts to the cigarette. She is about to admonish Anna
     for smoking, but Anna speaks first.

     A pause.     Anna blows smoke, clearly upset.

                              HELEN
                  Anna, you know what he's like.

                               ANNA
                  I don't give a damn about Stepan.
                  Who has that poor baby got in the
                  whole world?

     Helen reacts.

                              HELEN
                  I knew this would happen.

                                ANNA
                  Good. Fine.     So you know
                  everything.

                              HELEN
                  Anna, she isn't your responsibility.

                              ANNA
                  The baby is my responsibility until
                  I hand her over to the mother.
                  The mother is dead.

                               HELEN
                  Then it's up to the proper
                  authorities.

     Anna smiles as if in agreement.

                              ANNA
                  The proper authorities will all be
                  skiing until after New Year.

     Anna coughs a little then stubs her cigarette.        Helen takes
     the butt as if it were poisonous.

                              HELEN
                  It's part of the grieving.

                              ANNA
                  What grieving?

     Helen touches her hand.      An inadequate gesture.

                In the last year you've lost your
                father and you lost a baby.

      Anna is irritated but doesn't put words to her feelings.

                Come in and have your dinner.

      Anna and Helen look into each other's eyes for a moment
      before Helen heads for the kitchen, carrying the cigarette

22A   INT. TRAFALGAR HOSPITAL. S.C.B.U. CHRISTINE'S PRIVATE ROOM -22A
      NIGHT

      In a private room in the Special Care Baby Unit, Anna
      approaches Tatiana's baby's plastic crib. The baby is
      tightly bundled up, sound asleep. Through the windows of
      the room, we see the darkened, quiet ward outside - another
      world.

      Anna stands over the baby, her face full of emotion. There
      we see pain, loss, shame, emptiness, isolation. Tears begin
      to roll from her eyes, and then she is sobbing soundlessly.

23    INT. TRANS-SIBERIAN RESTAURANT - NIGHT                        23

      The Trans-Siberian restaurant is smoky with cigarettes and
      cigars. The party is in full swing with two dozen guests
      and family. One of the golden-haired children is playing
      violin badly. The language is Russian, English and Turkish
      mixed. Kirill is bringing a huge baked carp to the table.
      His mobile phone rings and he wipes his hands on a towel
      to answer it.

      When he hears the voice, Kirill glances at his father and
      moves quickly out of earshot. Semyon notices but hides
      his concern. As Kirill walks, a child tugs his leg and
      holds up a soft toy, asking a question in Russian.

                            KIRILL
                    (to child)
                He's called Goofy... Goofy yeah.

                  Good.

     Kirill glances over at Semyon, who is apparently lost
     amongst a sea of children, but we see from the corner of
     his eye he is watching Kirill.

               Yeah. Merry Christmas.

     Kirill cuts the call and nods to Ozim, who stubs his cigar.
     Semyon notices their silent communication, then turns to
     one of the violin-playing angels, smiles, and kisses her
     on both cheeks.

     shop. Nikolai jumps out and opens the door for Ozim.

     The three men walk to the door beside the barber shop.
     Ozim takes a bunch of keys out and prepares to open the
     door to the upstairs. He stops.

                           OZIM
               The driver stays down here.

     Kirill smiles and shakes his head.

               You really think I do this kind of
               thing?

27   INT. OZIM'S BARBER SHOP. UPSTAIRS ROOMS - NIGHT                 27

     The rooms above Ozim's shop have been converted into a
     drinking club. Ozim leads Nikolai and Kirill through the
     debris of the night before. As they walk through, Ekrem
     suddenly leaps out of the darkness with a yell. Kirill
     and Nikolai both react with instinctive aggression.

                           OZIM
               Hey, hey, hey Ekrem, sakim, durgun,
               durgun.

                           EKREM
               I got tickets, Ozim. It's with
               Chelsea. They said there was no
               tickets but I got tickets for the
               Chelsea game.

                             OZIM
               OK, OK, OK.    You go and watch a
               DVD, yeah?

     Ekrem nods and hugs Ozim. We realize he is slightly
     deranged. Finally he lets Ozim go and leaves. Kirill
     watches him go.

                           KIRILL
               He knows to say he hasn't seen us,

     Ozim finds the key to the kitchen.

                           OZIM
               He don't know anything.    He's

     Ozim opens the kitchen door.

     Inside the kitchen there are carcasses of lambs hanging
     from meat hooks. There are knives and skewers around the
     place. Ozim stops and locks the kitchen door behind them.

29   INT. OZIM'S BARBER SHOP. KITCHEN - NIGHT                        29

     The freezer door opens and Ozim gestures towards a large
     package bound up in black bin liners which are dusted with
     frost. Kirill nods to Nikolai who grabs the package and
     hauls it out onto the kitchen floor. Kirill tears a hole
     in the bin liner and we see the frost-dusted face of Soyka.

                  There was a time when he was like
                  a brother to me.

     He puts his hand on his heart with mock solemnity.

                  Now he looks like a fucking ice

                               KIRILL
                  Respect?   This is respect.

     Kirill reaches into his pocket and produces an envelope
     which he hands to Ozim. As Ozim opens the envelope and
     begins to count the huge wad of cash, Kirill turns to
     Nikolai.

                              KIRILL (CONT'D)
                  OK, Nikolai, he's all yours. And

     Nikolai squeezes the body inside the bags.       It is rock
     hard.

                  Have you got a hair dryer?

30   INT. OZIM'S BARBER SHOP. KITCHEN - NIGHT                            30

     We cut close to an ancient-looking hair dryer from the
     shop downstairs being trained onto a human hand with a
     large eagle tattoo. We pull wide to reveal the full,
     gruesome scene.

     Nikolai has the body of Soyka laid out on a surface, his
     head still bound up in a bin bag, his lower portions bound
     up similarly. Nikolai is de-frosting Soyka's left hand
     with the hair dryer, concentrating on his ring finger which
     has a gold ring on it. The parts of Soyka's shirt and
     jacket which are visible are crusted with frozen blood.
     Nikolai is wearing rubber gloves.

     As he dries, Nikolai takes a sip of coffee. Ozim is
     watching this scene with horror. Kirill has his arms
     folded, mightily impressed.

     Finally the hand is thawed enough for Nikolai to remove
     the gold ring. He studies an inscription and then offers
     it to Ozim. Ozim shakes his head as if the thing were a
     contagion. Nikolai shrugs and pockets it. He then turns
     the hair dryer back on and blows some hot air onto the
     crisply bloody chest of Soyka. He tugs at the frozen lapel
     of the jacket and blows air into the inside pocket. Within
     a few moments he is able to remove Soyka's glistening,
     thawing wallet which is caked in frozen blood. He opens
     it (we glimpse a photo of a wife and children) and blows
     hot air onto the money inside.

     He tugs a wad of frozen bank notes from the wallet, all
     stuck together by drops of frozen blood. He offers this
     money to Ozim as well but Ozim shakes his head vigorously.
     Kirill hoots with laughter. Ozim is now staring at Nikolai
     as if he were a devil from hell.

     Nikolai grabs a plastic bag and puts the money inside it,
     then pockets the frozen wad. He tosses the rest of the
     frozen wallet to Ozim, who instinctively catches it.

                              NIKOLAI
                  You'd better burn that.

     Ozim, reacting to the cold of the wallet and to the horror
     of it, drops the thing on the floor. Nikolai looks at
     Ozim as if he were a complete amateur.

                              NIKOLAI (CONT'D)
                  Did you finish cutting his hair?

     Ozim can't answer.

                              NIKOLAI (CONT'D)
                  I just thought you might want six-
                  fifty out of his pockets.

     Kirill laughs.    Nikolai takes a deep breath to prepare
     himself.

                           NIKOLAI (CONT'D)
               OK, now I'm going to do his teeth
               and cut off his fingers.
                   (to Ozim)
               You might want to leave the room.

     Ozim thinks, decides, leaves fast.   A pause.

                           NIKOLAI (CONT'D)
               You too, Kirill.

     Kirill smiles and pats Nikolai on the cheek.

     Kirill leaves. Nikolai is left alone. His hand shakes a
     little as he picks up his cup of coffee.

31   EXT. NINE ELMS. ABANDONED DOCK - MORNING                         31

     Nikolai pulls up beside a rusting crane on the abandoned
     dock in a dry-cleaner's van. Kirill watches as Nikolai
     grabs the semi-thawed body, now bagged and tied, lifts it
     onto his shoulder, and smartly approaches the dockside.

                           KIRILL
               Aren't you going to weight him
               down or something?

     Nikolai drops the body into the water with a splash.

                            NIKOLAI
               If you want to dump a body, this
               is the place. The currents keep
               it under the surface until past
               the barrier.

     Nikolai and Kirill watch as the body is swallowed by a
     fast ocean-bound current.

32   EXT. LONDON STREET - NIGHT                                       32

     Anna pulls up at some lights on her motorbike.

                           TATIANA (V.O.)
               My friend said he would get me to
               Amsterdam and from there we could

33   INT. TRANS-SIBERIAN RESTAURANT - NIGHT                         33

     Semyon sits alone at the dinner table in the restaurant
     where before there was family and uproar. Outside it's
     dark and raining. He is reading a Russian crime novel. A
     half-empty bottle of vodka sits on the table.

     Tatiana's voice-over continues as we cut inside the
     restaurant.

                              TATIANA (V.O.)
                  My friend says his uncle owns the
                  restaurant where you can sing. He
                  is sure this man will take care of
                  me.

     There is a knock at the door and Semyon looks up sharply.
     His eyes glisten. He puts his novel aside.

34   INT./EXT. TRANS-SIBERIAN RESTAURANT. DOOR - NIGHT              34

     Semyon is unlocking the door and discovering, in the drizzle
     and half light, that it is Anna.

                              SEMYON
                  Ah. My dear! I wasn't expecting
                  you so early.

                              ANNA
                  Is it OK?

35   INT. TRANS-SIBERIAN RESTAURANT - NIGHT                         35

     Semyon and Anna are sitting down at the candlelit table.
     Anna fumbles in her bag and produces a sheaf of photocopied
     sheets. She has photocopied the pages of the diary and
     they are laid out in segments on each page.

                              ANNA
                  I copied the whole thing.

     Semyon takes the pages and looks troubled.

                              SEMYON
                  Where is the original?

                  I'm going to keep it. Maybe give
                  it to Tatiana's daughter someday.

     Semyon looks thwarted but hides it well. He studies the
     photocopied sheets for a while then looks up and smiles.

                              SEMYON
                  I will need my spectacles and a
                  clear head. Today I broke my rules
                  and drank vodka. Tomorrow I will
                  translate it.

     He folds the papers carefully.

                              SEMYON (CONT'D)
                  Then I will bring what I have done
                  to your home. Where do you live,
                  Anna?

     There is nothing in Semyon's smile to cause alarm but Anna
     perhaps remembers Nikolai. Finally...

                                ANNA
                  Not far.    I can drop by and pick
                  it up.

                              SEMYON
                  Then maybe I can drive you home.

                                ANNA
                  I'm fine.    I'm on my motorbike.

     Semyon stares at her for a moment.

                              SEMYON
                  So what will happen to the poor
                  child?

                              ANNA
                  After Christmas, they'll do a
                  missing persons report.

                  The police.

     Semyon doesn't blink. At that moment a little girl of
     seven (MARIA) emerges from the darkness, carrying a soft
     toy.

                              MARIA
               Grandpa.

                           SEMYON
               Hey, hey, Maria, go back to bed.

                           MARIA
               I'm too sad. Next Christmas isn't
               for another hundreds and hundreds
               of days.

     Semyon takes her onto his knee. As he does, we see, for
     the first time, an eagle tattoo on his wrist.

                           SEMYON
               But you have had so many presents.

     The girl wafts Semyon's cigar smoke.

                           MARIA
               You shouldn't smoke, Grandpa.

                              SEMYON
               I know.

     Semyon cuddles Maria and stubs his cigar.

     Anna smiles at the warm family scene, perhaps remembering
     her own father.

36   EXT. TRANS-SIBERIAN RESTAURANT - NIGHT                        36

     Nikolai gets out of the Mercedes and helps an extremely
     pissed Kirill out of the car into the rain. Kirill is so
     drunk he slips through Nikolai's hands and lands in the
     gutter.

                           KIRILL
               We're partners now, man, you know?

     Nikolai manages to lift him to his feet again. As they
     head towards the restaurant, Anna emerges. Nikolai looks
     up, curious, as Semyon kisses her on both cheeks in the
     doorway. As she turns Kirill stumbles forwards and collapses
     in front of her. Nikolai looks up at Anna, his face
     splashed with rain.

                             NIKOLAI (CONT'D)
                  What? You never seen anybody pissed
                  before?

     Semyon looks down at the drunken Kirill and slams the door
     of the restaurant. Nikolai sighs, then turns to Kirill
     and starts to go through his pockets.

                              NIKOLAI (CONT'D)
                  Come on, Kirill. Where are your
                  keys?

     Anna walks around the two of them, watching the undignified
     struggle as Nikolai finds Kirill's keys. Nikolai smiles
     at her.

                              NIKOLAI (CONT'D)
                  Who are you, anyway?

     Anna hurries away into the rain. Nikolai finds Kirill's
     keys and drags him toward the door of the restaurant.

37   INT. TRANS-SIBERIAN RESTAURANT - NIGHT                          37

     Nikolai heaves Kirill into a chair. Semyon is back at his
     novel and watches as Kirill attempts to get to his feet
     and then stumbles to the floor. He slumps down, now
     totally unconscious, breathing deeply. Nikolai smiles.

                              NIKOLAI
                  We went to a Kurdish place. They
                  don't even celebrate Christmas.

     Semyon steps up to where Kirill is lying and stands over
     him for a moment. Then he kicks him hard in the guts with
     all his might. Nikolai is shocked, and grabs Semyon's
     arm. A hand laid upon him is like deadly poison. Kirill
     grunts and moans.

                  I think he's had enough.

     Nikolai steps in between Semyon and Kirill. Semyon is
     shocked that anyone should face him like this.

                  ...someone to stop him killing

                  Well, you got more than a driver.

     Nikolai reaches into his pocket for a business card and
     offers it to Semyon. As Semyon looks at the card in the
     candle light, he also sees the TATTOO OF AN EAGLE on
     Nikolai's hand.

     It is obvious that the tattoo means more than the card to
     Semyon, and he reacts.

     Nikolai hurries   out to his car in the rain. He hears an
     engine splutter   and spots Anna still trying to kick-start
     her motorbike.    He approaches. She's already soaked.
     Nikolai watches   her try to start the bike and fail.

                Water?    What makes you think that?

     Anna tries to start the bike again.    Nothing.

                            NIKOLAI
                The postmen used these. In my
                village. When I was a boy. Russian
                copy of BMW flat twin.

     Anna tries one more time to start the bike and growls with
     fury. Nikolai gently takes her shoulders and after a brief
     resistance Anna climbs off the bike. Nikolai sits astride
     it. He kicks it. It fails to start. Anna folds her arms.

     He tries again.     And again.   He climbs off.

                Get a bus.

     Anna curses under her breath. Nikolai isn't sure what to
     make of her. She begins to chain the bike's rear wheel.

                            NIKOLAI (CONT'D)
                You got far to go?

     Anna tucks her crash helmet under her arm and prepares to
     set off walking.

                            ANNA
                Just across the park.

                            NIKOLAI
                I'm a driver. I even do limousines.
                Look...

     Nikolai opens the rear car door.

                            NIKOLAI (CONT'D)
                If Semyon found out I let one of
                his guests walk home in the rain,
                he'd fire me. And I can take care
                of your bike. So...

     Nikolai holds open the rear car door.       Rain pours.

39   EXT. LONDON STREET - NIGHT                                       39

     Nikolai is driving Anna through the rain-swept streets.
     The wipers beat time as they drive in silence. As Nikolai
     holds the steering wheel, Anna sees the intricate detail
     of the eagle tattoo on the back of his right hand.

                            NIKOLAI
                So you're a midwife. Jesus.

     Anna smiles politely.

                            NIKOLAI (CONT'D)
                What's it like?

                            ANNA
                You get used to it.

     A pause.   Nikolai seems vaguely horrified at a memory.

                            NIKOLAI
                I didn't faint, but it was close.

     Nikolai half shrugs.      Pause.

                              ANNA (CONT'D)
                  What, you don't know?

                              NIKOLAI
                  Yeah, I know, I know, it's just...
                  it makes me upset, you know?
                  Thinking about it. This time of
                  year. They're back in Yekaterinburg.
                  In the forests. Near the mountains.

     A long pause.

                               ANNA
                  Left here.

     Nikolai turns.

                              ANNA (CONT'D)
                  So Semyon employs you?

                              NIKOLAI
                  I'm... sort of freelance.

                              ANNA
                  You said he'd fire you.

     Nikolai doesn't answer.      Anna decides she can be bold.

                              ANNA (CONT'D)
                  Did you ever meet a girl called
                  Tatiana?

                              NIKOLAI
                  I meet lots of girls called Tatiana.

                              ANNA
                  She was pregnant.

                              NIKOLAI
                  In that case, no, I never heard of
                  her.

     Anna doesn't care for the smile on Nikolai's face.

                              ANNA
                  She died last night on my shift.

                           NIKOLAI
               I thought you did birth.

                            ANNA
               Sometimes birth and death go
               together.
                   (pause)
               She had needle punctures all over
               both arms. Dehydration, emaciation.
               Early presentation of syphilis.
               Probably a prostitute. At the age
               of fourteen.

                           NIKOLAI
                   (quickly, without a
                    pause)
               You know what? I hate the rain.
               This time of year. You ever been
               to Russia at Christmas? Man, snow
               that covers your whole house.

     Nikolai glances at Anna in the rear-view mirror.

                           NIKOLAI (CONT'D)
               Oh yeah. And the ice. Whole lakes
               covered in ice. You don't want to
               walk across them, though. Ice
               gets thin where you least expect
               it.

                           ANNA
               You think Semyon's son knew her?

                           NIKOLAI
               Like I said, I'm a driver. I go
               left, I go right, I go straight
               ahead. That's it.

     Anna nods, her curiosity and suspicions aroused.     Nikolai
     glances at her.

                              NIKOLAI (CONT'D)
               What?

                           ANNA
               Just here is great.

     Nikolai pulls over and Anna opens her door to escape.

                           ANNA (CONT'D)
               How much do I owe you?

39A   EXT. HELEN'S HOUSE - NIGHT                                    39A

      Nikolai watches her hurry to her front door and let herself
      in.

40    EXT. THE BANKS OF THE THAMES - NEXT MORNING                   40

      Somewhere within sight of the Thames barrier.

      A dozen policemen and forensic investigators are milling
      round on a shale beach, the icy waters of the Thames lapping
      at their feet.

40A   INT. FORENSIC TENT - MORNING                                  40A

      A large tent has been erected over the body of Soyka. Inside
      the tent two senior police officers await the arrival of a
      third man, a specialist from the Russian desk (YURI), who
      is not dressed for the weather. He has obviously been
      dragged out of bed. He is led to the side of the body.
      One of the officers pulls up the dead man's hand and shows
      him the eagle tattoo.

                            OFFICER
                We think he might be Russian Mafia.

      Yuri studies the tattoo, then borrows a torch. He crouches
      to push up the wet trouser leg on the corpse's right leg.
      When the knee is exposed in torch light we see a small
      star tattooed on the knee cap.

                            YURI
                He is actually a Chechen. He is
                also a member of the vory v zakone.
                The stars on the knees mean he
                would never kneel before anyone.

      Yuri opens the dead man's shirt and we see a tattoo of an
      eight-pointed star on his chest.

                            YURI (CONT'D)
                In Russian prisons, your life story
                is written on your body in tattoos.
                You don't exist without tattoos.
                    (pause)
                He was a captain.

      He then checks out the fingers in the torchlight and we
      glimpse that the finger tips have been sawn off.

      Yuri straightens and grabs a paper towel to wipe his hands.

                            OFFICER
                There was something else. It was...
                inside the body. Chest cavity.

      The officer holds up a small zip-lock bag which has a
      handwritten note sealed inside it. The handwriting is just
      visible through the wet cellophane.

40B   EXT. THE BANKS OF THE THAMES - MORNING                          40B

      Yuri steps outside the forensic tent. He opens the bag and
      takes out the note. He unfolds it to read, then smiles to
      himself.

41    INT. HELEN'S HOUSE. ANNA'S BEDROOM - MORNING                    41

      Anna is drying her hair, looking at herself in the mirror.
      She turns off the dryer. There is a knock on the door.

                               HELEN
                Anna?

      Helen enters looking anxious.    We see Stepan hovering in
      the background.

                             HELEN (CONT'D)
                Stepan, come here. Tell her what
                you told me.

      Stepan stands primly in the doorway, strangely defiant.

                            ANNA
                What?
                    (pause)
                Stepan, what? I'm late for work.

      He shakes his head angrily. Finally from behind his back
      he produces Tatiana's diary.

                            ANNA (CONT'D)
                Who gave you that?

                            HELEN
                It was on the dresser.

                Mum, you can't go through my things.

                And he said he wouldn't do it so
                I've found somebody else.

     Stepan explodes.

                            STEPAN
                No Anna! You don't go to someone
                else with this! You don't go to
                anyone! Nasilovanie, it means rape.
                Iglah, it means needle.
                Prostitutcia, perhaps you can guess.

     Stepan hands the diary to Anna and then turns.

                I go to wash my hands.

     He disappears. Anna and Helen are left in awkward silence.
     Anna buries the diary in her dressing table drawer. Helen
     looks at her with anxiety.

                            HELEN
                Anna, Stepan said this girl ended
                up in the hands of the vory v
                zakone. Do you know what that
                means?

                Just because I'm back in this room
                doesn't mean I'm twelve again.

                            HELEN
                You never listened to me even then!

                Look, if I don't find a relative
                in the next few days they'll put
                Christine out for fostering. Once
                she's in the system, she'll never
                get out again.

     A pause.

                            HELEN
                Who named her Christine?

                Your father used to say the vory

                Momma, this is London.

42   INT. SUBURBAN HOUSE. NEGLECTED SITTING ROOM - DAY                42

     We are in HARLESDEN, NORTH LONDON.

     A large portable stereo is playing rock music.

     The curtains are drawn against daylight. The living room
     is decorated in seventies suburban style, but with the
     wall paper peeling and the paint work fading. Kitsch
     paintings still decorate the walls.

     Six young East-European girls are sitting on a broken-down
     sofa and on hard-backed chairs, wearing short skirts. Their
     eyes are sunken and their faces vacant of expression, but
     they are painted with so much make-up they almost look
     like tiny, sad clowns.

     They sit in silence as the music blares out. After a few
     moments a young Albanian man enters and claps his hands.

                              ALBANIAN
                  OK, boss is here. Boss, boss.
                  You make him happy...

     All the girls apart from one immediately get to their feet
     and begin to dance to the music, their bodies moving
     awkwardly and painfully. The Albanian approaches the one
     girl who refused to stand and yanks her to her feet.

     He slaps her hard and hisses at her in Albanian. She tries
     to sit down again but he pulls her up and slaps her again.
     Finally he shoves her into the middle of the room and she
     begins to dance, sobbing as she does.

                              ALBANIAN (CONT'D)
                  No fucking crying. It's a party!

43   EXT. SUBURBAN HOUSE - DAY                                        43

     Kirill and Nikolai are climbing out of Nikolai's Mercedes.
     Kirill is in full flow as they walk towards the house.
     The rock music is audible outside the house.

                              KIRILL
                  So he said to me, `who is this
                  driver guy?' I laughed so hard.

     Kirill knocks on the door hard.

                              KIRILL (CONT'D)
                  And I said you were the safest guy
                  I'd met. Solid.

     A pause.

                              NIKOLAI
                  And what did he say?

                              KIRILL
                  You know my dad. He didn't say
                  nothing. But his eyes looked
                  impressed.

     The door opens and the Albanian opens his arms in welcome.

                                ALBANIAN
                  Kirill!

                              KIRILL
                  Get out of the fucking way, you
                  black gypsy baboon.

     Kirill pushes his way inside and Nikolai follows.

44   INT. SUBURBAN HOUSE. SITTING ROOM - DAY                              44

     Kirill and Nikolai are swigging whisky from the bottle and
     dancing with the girls. Some of the girls are drinking,
     too, and managing to laugh. Kirill is dancing maniacally
     and swinging his girl around faster and faster until she
     falls over.

     Nikolai swigs his drink and notices the girl who refused
     to stand up. She is standing in the corner, sobbing.
     Nikolai doesn't care to look at her for more than a second
     and he goes back to dancing.

     After a moment Kirill dances his way over to Nikolai and
     yells above the music.

                              KIRILL
                  OK, which one you going to fuck!?

                              NIKOLAI
                      (laughing)
                  What's it to you?

                                  KIRILL
                  Serious.      Pick one.

                              NIKOLAI
                  I'm just enjoying myself, man...

     Kirill suddenly stops dancing and stares at Nikolai.          He
     yells again over the music.

                              KIRILL
                  You hear me? You're going to fuck
                  one of these girls.

                              NIKOLAI
                  OK, OK, Jesus...

                              KIRILL
                  You're going to fuck one of these
                  girls right now. That's an order.

                                   NIKOLAI
                  What?       What's the matter with you?

     Kirill suddenly goes to the stereo system and yanks the
     plug from the wall. Silence. The girls look terrified.
     The only sound is the sobbing of the girl who won't dance.

     Kirill is glaring at Nikolai.

                              KIRILL
                  Come on Nikolai. Who are you going
                  to fuck?

     A pause.

                              KIRILL (CONT'D)
                  I'm recommending you to my dad. I
                  want to make sure you're not a
                  fucking queer.

     Kirill looks suddenly wild.          He swigs his whisky.   A long
     pause.

                              NIKOLAI
                  You've drunk enough Kirill.

                                 KIRILL
                  Enough?

     Kirill hurls his whisky bottle against the wall.            The girls
     all flinch.

                              KIRILL (CONT'D)
                  You fucking Siberian ox don't tell
                  a vor what is enough.

     A pause.   Nikolai studies Kirill's anger.

                              KIRILL (CONT'D)
                  I've brought you to my dad's best
                  stable. He uses this place himself.
                  They're all clean. Now I'm going
                  to watch you fuck one of these
                  girls to prove to me that you ain't
                  queer.

     A pause.

                              KIRILL (CONT'D)
                  So which one is it going to be?

     Silence. Nikolai looks around the room.           Finally... Nikolai
     turns to the girl who is sobbing.

                                 NIKOLAI
                  Her.

     Kirill smiles.

45   INT. SUBURBAN HOUSE. BEDROOM - DAY                             45

     Nikolai is fucking the girl, who is now silent.   She is on
     all fours, registering no emotion.

     Kirill is leaning against the wall, drinking wine from the
     bottle, watching Nikolai with burning eyes, his lust and
     drunken jealousy mixing together. Nikolai grits his teeth
     and comes inside the girl. Kirill whoops and whistles and
     begins to applaud.

     The girl is still silent, expressionless.

                              KIRILL
               You did OK!     You did OK.

                              NIKOLAI
               Yeah?

     Nikolai glares at Kirill.

                            NIKOLAI (CONT'D)
               Well if my examination is over,
               get the fuck out of here while I
               get dressed.

     Kirill grins and offers the girl an elaborate bow before
     leaving. Finally alone, Nikolai gently helps the girl to
     lie down. She is numb. He covers her up with a blanket
     then begins to pull on his clothes. The girl is staring up
     at the ceiling.

     After a few moments she begins to sing a Russian folk song
     softly under her breath. Nikolai speaks to her softly in
     Russian.

                           NIKOLAI (CONT'D)
                   (in Russian)
               What's your last name?

     A pause. Finally the girl stops singing but is silent.
     Nikolai is insistent.

                           NIKOLAI (CONT'D)
                   (in Russian)

     She sees some urgency there...

     linger. He heads for the door then stops and turns.

46   INT. TRAFALGAR HOSPITAL. S.C.B.U. CHRISTINE'S PRIVATE ROOM -46
     NIGHT

     In the half-lit private room, Anna is dancing with Christine
     in her arms. She is singing a lullaby softly to her. The
     door is open to the rest of the ward and all the other
     babies are silent.

     Finally she lays a sleeping Christine back in her crib.
     She sits down on the bed where the mother should be. She
     curses herself silently and gets to her feet, determined
     to pull herself together.

     As she starts to leave the private room to enter the ward,
     she is suddenly confronted by Semyon.

     He is standing in the shadows, a Bavarian trilby in his
     hands. Anna gasps with shock. Semyon speaks softly...

                                 SEMYON

                You're not allowed in here.

                Please Anna, let me speak.

     Semyon looks to be almost in tears.     He speaks softly.

                            SEMYON (CONT'D)
                I translated the diary...

     A baby begins to cry and is comforted somewhere across the
     ward.

                            SEMYON (CONT'D)
                I was shocked to discover... that
                my son Kirill is mentioned many
                times.

     Semyon appears to be fighting tears.

                            SEMYON (CONT'D)
                I have known for some years that
                he has strayed from the path I set
                out for him. His mother died when
                he was very young.

     A pause.   Anna almost begins to buy his sorrow...

                            ANNA
                What does it say about him?

     Semyon looks up, his eyes filled with tears.

                            SEMYON
                Many bad things.

     A pause.

                But Anna please. Let me deal with
                him. If the diary should find its
                way to the police...

     Semyon wipes his eyes.

                            SEMYON (CONT'D)
                Some of the things my son did are
                illegal. Anna, he is a good boy.

                             ANNA
                 I don't care about him.   I care
                 about the baby.

                              SEMYON
                 Of course.   Of course. And that is
                 the baby?

     Semyon glances over Anna's shoulder into the corner where
     Christine is sleeping. Anna freezes and doesn't reply.
     Semyon takes her hand.

                             SEMYON (CONT'D)
                 Anna, I have made some inquiries
                 and I have found out an address
                 for Tatiana's family in Russia.
                 That's where the baby belongs, no?

     Anna reacts but Semyon's face suddenly hardens...

                             SEMYON (CONT'D)
                 So... perhaps we can do a deal.

     He stares into her eyes.

                             SEMYON (CONT'D)
                 Do you understand me, Anna?

     At that moment a nurse walks by and hesitates when she
     sees Semyon.

                              NURSE
                 Anna?

                              ANNA
                 It's OK.   He's just leaving.

     Semyon puts his hat onto his head.

                             SEMYON
                 You know where I am, Anna Ivanovna.

     He turns.

                             SEMYON (CONT'D)
                 And I know where you are.

     Semyon disappears into the shadows of the ward.     As Anna
     reacts we hear Tatiana in V.O.

     Stepan is sitting at the kitchen table, translating
     Tatiana's diary aloud, as Helen transcribes it onto a note
     pad. Stepan's translation breaks up with emotion but he
     tries to remain detached. Helen also tries hard to
     concentrate on her task but wipes away a tear as she writes.
     Tatiana's V.O. slowly blends into Stepan's voice...

                           STEPAN
               ...like potato sacks. Kirill came
               down after me and he hit me until
               I was bleeding. Then he tried to
               rape me but he couldn't do it...
               He just got madder and madder and
               kept hitting me. In the end his
               father came down. It was the father
               who raped me. He shouted at his
               son...'if you don't break a horse,
               it will never be tame, Kirill'.

     They hear a key in the door and prepare for Anna's arrival.
     When she enters she feels the tense silence. After a
     moment, Helen tries to be bright...

                           HELEN
               Hello dear. How was your night?

     Anna sees the tears in both their eyes.   She sees the diary
     and the transcription and sits down.

                           HELEN (CONT'D)
               Stepan's arthritis is playing up.
               I'm taking dictation.

     Helen gets to her feet.

                           HELEN (CONT'D)
               Would you like some tea or
               something?

                             ANNA
               No.

     Anna gently pushes Helen back into her seat.

                              ANNA
                  He came to see me.

     Silence.

                              ANNA (CONT'D)
                  The man from the restaurant.    He
                  came to the hospital.

     Stepan leaps to his feet.

                              STEPAN
                  I told you this would happen!    I
                  told you!

                              HELEN
                  Sit down Stepan.

                              STEPAN
                  The devil is loose now.

     Everyone begins to talk at once...

                              ANNA
                  I know it's my fault...

                              HELEN
                  It's no one's fault...

                  They are in this room now.   They
                  are cancer...

                              HELEN
                  We should just sit down calmly and
                  think...

                              STEPAN
                  I have a friend from Ukraine who
                  owns a gun....

                              HELEN

                Don't talk about guns...

     Anna suddenly stands up.

                            ANNA
                Shut up both of you!!!

     Silence.   Everyone catches their breath.

                            ANNA (CONT'D)
                OK... now... what would dad have
                done?

     A pause.

                            STEPAN
                We all know what he would have
                done.

     Stepan heads for the kitchen cupboard and produces a bottle
     of vodka. Rather than admonish him, Anna and Helen both
     nod agreement. Stepan pours three large vodkas. Stepan
     knocks his down. Anna and Helen take sips.

                            HELEN
                And then he would have been
                practical.

                             STEPAN
                He would ask if there were bullets
                for the gun.

                            HELEN
                No! This isn't our world.     We're
                just... ordinary people.

                            STEPAN
                I dealt with the vory v zakone
                when I worked for the KGB.

                            ANNA
                You never worked for the fucking
                KGB!

                            HELEN (CONT'D)
                What did this man want?

                            ANNA
                The diary. In return he'll give
                us an address for Tatiana's family.
                For Christine's family.

     A pause.   They all look to each other.

                            HELEN
                And that's all he wants?

     Stepan is utterly astounded.

                            STEPAN
                You cannot do deals with these
                people!

                            HELEN
                This isn't a deal.      It's an exchange
                of information.

                            STEPAN
                Have you forgotten already what I
                just read to you?

                            HELEN
                We must be practical.

                            ANNA
                Stepan, I think he was threatening
                to harm Christine.

                            HELEN
                Then it's settled.

                               STEPAN

     Stepan stares at them both for a long time.   Finally he
     gets to his feet and points to the diary.

                           STEPAN
               She was an ordinary person.

     He leaves. Anna and Helen hold hands, genuinely close now
     for the first time in a long time.

48   EXT. TRANS-SIBERIAN RESTAURANT - NEXT DAY                       48

     Nikolai pulls up in his car. He checks his look in the
     rear view mirror and puts on his sunglasses. As he gets
     out of the car he notices that Anna's motorbike is still
     there. He approaches it, strokes the bodywork. Suddenly,
     someone grabs him from behind. It's Kirill.

                           KIRILL
               Hey, come on, Nikolai, I've got a
               Christmas present for you.

49   EXT. TRANS-SIBERIAN RESTAURANT. BACK DELIVERY AREA - DAY        49

     A white van is parked with its rear doors open, ready for
     unloading. Kirill shows Nikolai that the van is loaded
     with unmarked white boxes.

                              KIRILL
               Open one.

     Nikolai opens one of the boxes and produces a bottle of
     vintage champagne.

                           KIRILL (CONT'D)
               From France. Old as fuck. Old is
               good with wine. Sixty quid a bottle
               anywhere. Except I got them for
               ten quid a case.

                              NIKOLAI
               From where?

                           KIRILL
               `From where?' From where you don't
               ask. Give it here...

     Kirill snatches the bottle and begins to uncork it.

                              KIRILL (CONT'D)
                  If my dad says OK, I can start
                  telling you about the serious stuff.
                  Import, export. This booze is just
                  for gifts to Papa's friends. The
                  real import stuff is from Kabul,
                  you understand?

     He pops the cork and swigs the frothing champagne.

                              NIKOLAI
                  Import-export sounds good.

     Kirill laughs.

                              KIRILL
                  You bet it's fucking good...

     Nikolai hands the bottle back. As he does, one of the van
     doors is kicked closed revealing Semyon, suddenly upon
     them.

                              KIRILL (CONT'D)
                  Jesus Christ, Papa... You scared
                  me....

     Semyon grabs the bottle of champagne and smashes it on the
     floor. Kirill recoils in terror. Nikolai straightens,
     faces up.

                              KIRILL (CONT'D)
                  What's wrong? We're just sampling
                  it!

     Semyon is so furious he still can't speak. He grabs Kirill
     and slams him against the wall. Finally he hisses in his
     face.

                              SEMYON
                  Your friend Soyka is dead.

                              KIRILL
                  Yeah? So what? What's that got
                  to do with me?

                              SEMYON
                  Don't lie to me!!

     Semyon slams Kirill against the wall once more.

     Semyon slams Kirill hard against the wall again.       Suddenly
     Nikolai steps forward.

                           NIKOLAI
               Your dad is right, Kirill.       There's
               no point lying to him.

     A pause. Semyon and Kirill are frozen for a moment.
     Nikolai calmly lights a cigarette.

                           NIKOLAI (CONT'D)
               Ozim's nephew slit Soyka's throat.
               Kirill paid him to do it.

     There is stunned silence.       Semyon loosens his grip on
     Kirill.

                           KIRILL
                   (in Russian)
               Shut your fucking mouth!

                   (in Russian)
               Your dad always knows the truth
               anyway.

     Nikolai and Semyon survey each other.

                           NIKOLAI (CONT'D)
               But it's OK boss. You don't have

                   (incredulous)
               I don't have to worry?

                           NIKOLAI
               I disposed of the body myself. The
               police won't find a thing.

     Semyon has now lost all interest in Kirill and is
     concentrating on Nikolai. He laughs with incredulity.

               On my own doorstep? A fellow

                           NIKOLAI
               The vory code says you don't talk
               to anybody about your captain.
               Kirill is my captain.

     Semyon circles Nikolai.

                           NIKOLAI (CONT'D)
               When I found out what had happened,
               I did what I had to do to clean
               the situation up.

     Kirill is about to speak but before he can, Nikolai speaks
     for him.

                           NIKOLAI (CONT'D)
               It was a matter of honor. Soyka
               was spreading lies about Kirill.
               About your family.
                   (in Russian)
               Kirill did the right thing.

     Semyon hisses with fury and grabs Nikolai.

                           SEMYON
               I decide what is right and what is
               wrong. You do not kill a vor for
               no reason.

     Nikolai shrugs Semyon off, holding his ground.

                           NIKOLAI
               You know as well as I do Soyka was
               talking to the police.

     A pause. Semyon is shocked at the depth of Nikolai's
     knowledge. He peers at him.

                           SEMYON
               For a driver, you are well informed.

                           NIKOLAI
               I've got connections with the
               Chechens who export cars. Soyka
               was speaking to the Russian desk.

     A pause.

                            NIKOLAI (CONT'D)
                    (in Russian)
                Kirill did a good thing for all
                our people. Our people will know
                that.

     In Semyon's silence Kirill finally gathers courage...

                            KIRILL
                Papa, I swear to you, I was going
                to...

                              SEMYON
                Shut up!

     Kirill is hurt that Semyon seems only to be interested in
     Nikolai. After studying Nikolai for a while...

                            SEMYON (CONT'D)
                If you are so well informed, you
                will know Soyka has brothers.

                            NIKOLAI
                    (with a smile)
                That's OK. Kirill has got me.

     Semyon shows the first flicker of admiration. He then
     looks at Kirill with utter contempt, making the comparison
     with Nikolai obvious.

                            SEMYON
                Get these boxes out of sight.

     Semyon leaves them. Kirill is angry, straightening his
     clothes. Finally he yells....

                            KIRILL
                You heard him, patsan!   Get these
                boxes out of sight.

50   INT. BURGER RESTAURANT - DAY                                   50

     It is Saturday morning and the place is full of families.
     Christmas decorations are beginning to look ragged.

     Anna and Helen are sitting at a table, terrified but trying
     hard to stay calm. Stepan arrives with a tray of coffees
     and a burger. He sits, and Anna and Helen glance uneasily
     at each other. Stepan begins to eat noisily.

                              ANNA
                  How the hell can you eat?

                                STEPAN
                  I'm hungry.

     There is a tension that builds until Nikolai's Mercedes
     suddenly looms into view, filling the street window of the
     burger bar. Nikolai gets out of his car, all shades and
     sharp suit.

                              ANNA
                  That's their driver.

     Stepan very deliberately slides his hand into his inside
     pocket.

                              HELEN
                      (hissing)
                  Tell me you haven't done anything
                  ridiculous...

     Stepan removes his hand, empty, his bravado crushed.

     Nikolai enters the restaurant and spots Anna. He comes
     and sits at the table beside Stepan, opposite Anna. It's
     a tight squeeze. Anna and Helen are stiff with terror.
     Nikolai smiles.

                              NIKOLAI
                  Meet in a public place with lots
                  of people around. Very wise.

     He smiles at Helen.

                              NIKOLAI (CONT'D)
                  And I see you brought along a body
                  guard. Also very wise.

     Stepan is shaking with emotion and hisses something in
     Russian.

               When I was in the KGB, we knew how
               to deal with scum like you.

     Nikolai smiles.

               Shush, Stepan. Anna?

     Nikolai is amused by the three of them. Anna produces
     Tatiana's diary and hands it to Nikolai. Nikolai studies
     it and nods. He gets to his feet...

                           ANNA
                   (shaking)
               Now you give me the address.

                           NIKOLAI
               What address?

                           ANNA
               Tatiana's family.

                           NIKOLAI
               I don't know what you're talking
               about.

     Nikolai calmly heads for the door.      Stepan hisses.

                                STEPAN
               I told you!       I knew they would do
               this....

     Anna gets to her feet.

                                HELEN
               Anna!      No!   Come back here!

     Anna races out of the restaurant in pursuit of Nikolai.

51   EXT. BURGER RESTAURANT - DAY                                     51

     Nikolai has emerged into the busy suburban street and is
     about to get in to his car. Anna flies at him, yelling.

                  She was fourteen! Read the diary!
                  She was fourteen when he raped
                  her!

     Nikolai casually hits the key fob of his car.

                              ANNA (CONT'D)
                  You murdered her! You bastards
                  murdered her!

     Passers-by stare at Anna. Helen and Stepan have come out
     of the restaurant to restrain her. Nikolai stops and judges
     the fury on Anna's face. He speaks calmly.

                              NIKOLAI
                  Anger is very dangerous. It makes
                  people do stupid things. Forget
                  any of this ever happened. You're
                  in the wrong place, Anna Ivanovna.

     He gestures at the burger restaurant.

                              NIKOLAI (CONT'D)
                  You belong in there. With nice
                  people. Stay away from people
                  like me.

     Anna and Nikolai are staring at each other, suddenly a
     strange connection between them.

     Then Stepan steps forward and spits in Nikolai's face,
     delivering a Russian curse as he does so. Nikolai almost
     reacts out of instinct but stops himself.

     Nikolai wipes his face and peers into Anna's eyes.       Finally
     he gets into his car and drives away.

52   INT. TRANS-SIBERIAN RESTAURANT - NIGHT                             52

     Nikolai is alone, sitting at a candlelit table, reading
     Tatiana's diary. We hear Tatiana in voice-over...

                              TATIANA (V.O.)
                  I am not sure I can carry on another
                  day. The windows won't open so I
                  can't throw myself out. They inject
                  me every day with heroin.

                  Sometimes I think this is all a
                  hallucination...

     He sees Semyon approaching from the kitchen and closes the
     diary. Semyon grabs a bottle of vodka from the bar on his
     way to sit opposite Nikolai. Nikolai pushes the diary
     across the table. Semyon pours two drinks.

                              SEMYON
                  It is good to have someone who I
                  can trust to do simple tasks.

     A pause as Semyon glances at a few pages of diary.

                              SEMYON (CONT'D)
                  In this business, sometimes the
                  biggest danger comes from the most
                  stupid things. You can't afford
                  to be careless in any area.

     Nikolai senses a change of attitude towards him. As if
     Semyon were beginning to accept him into the fold. Semyon
     raises a toast.

                               SEMYON (CONT'D)
                  Nasdrovia.

                               NIKOLAI
                  Nasdrovia.

     After a moment.

                              SEMYON
                  So what was the lie that Soyka was
                  spreading about my son?

     Nikolai looks anxious.

                              NIKOLAI
                      (in Russian)
                  It was nothing important.

                              SEMYON
                  Kirill had him killed for nothing
                  important?

     Semyon pours two more vodkas.

                              NIKOLAI
                  I don't want to repeat it.

     Nikolai doesn't respond. It is obvious that Semyon half
     knows already. He shrugs...

                              SEMYON (CONT'D)
                You play   with the Prince to do

                you must   be open with me. Thieves-

                What was Soyka saying about the
                Prince?

     He stares into Nikolai's eyes.    Finally, Nikolai stammers...

                            NIKOLAI
                That he is a drunk.    And that he
                is also... a queer.

     Semyon swigs his vodka and Nikolai swigs his. Semyon pours
     two more. Semyon has to stare out of the window to hide
     his emotion.

                             SEMYON
                    (softly, in Russian)
                My only son.

     They both knock their drinks back. Semyon looks suddenly
     angry as he peers out of the window.

                            SEMYON (CONT'D)
                You know it never snows in this
                City. And it's never hot. London
                is a city of whores and queers.
                My son...

     Semyon shrugs, fighting deeper emotion...

                FSB.   They are called FSB now.

                            SEMYON
                Whatever they call them they are
                worse even than the KGB were. Maybe
                the KGB and the vory v zakone were
                partners in a marriage. We had
                rules, they had rules.

     He swigs some more vodka.

                            SEMYON (CONT'D)
                Now in Moscow, the thieves don't
                wear tattoos and the police don't
                wear uniforms. You never know who
                they are...

     Semyon seems to be taking the vodka less well than Nikolai.
     He pours some more.

                You've heard about these new
                policemen?

     Nikolai doesn't blink.

                They get under you, over you, behind
                you, inside you. They are the
                ones you least expect.

     Semyon peers at Nikolai and Nikolai doesn't respond.
     Mention of the new breed of FSB agent causes an almost
     imperceptible tension in Nikolai.

     Is Semyon too drunk to notice? There is a strange game
     going on here. For now, nothing is revealed.

     Semyon knocks back his vodka and Nikolai does the same.
     Semyon picks up the diary and holds it into the flame of
     the candle. It begins to burn and he drops it into the
     ashtray. The flames flicker for a while.

                              NIKOLAI
                  I thought I'd bring it back before
                  it got stolen. Lot of villains
                  around. Sorry about the chain.

     Anna is about to walk quickly away...

                              NIKOLAI (CONT'D)
                  I got that address you wanted.

     Anna turns and sees Nikolai is offering a scrap of paper.

                              NIKOLAI (CONT'D)
                  A little village outside St.
                  Petersburg. I know it. Not much
                  of a place for a kid to grow up
                  in. Especially not a girl.

     She hesitates.       Nikolai approaches and gives her the
     address.

                              NIKOLAI (CONT'D)
                  If you want my opinion, the kid
                  would be better off in London.
                  Maybe with you. Why not? Tatiana's
                  family don't sound like the kind
                  of people who'd want another mouth
                  to feed.

     A pause.

                              ANNA
                  You read the diary?

     Nikolai looks all around.        Anna studies him, unsure.

                              ANNA (CONT'D)
                  So how can you keep doing what
                  you're doing?

                                NIKOLAI
                  I told you.    I'm just a driver.

     Anna sees some softness in his expression.        Their eyes
     lock.

                              ANNA
                  You look the other way.

                I'm a camera. The pictures stay
                in my head.

     Anna sees pain in his eyes.     She peers at the address.

                            ANNA
                Why did you bring me this?

                            NIKOLAI
                I don't know. I was passing.

     After a long moment Anna turns away.

                            NIKOLAI (CONT'D)
                Oh, and... your uncle.

     Nikolai smiles.

                            NIKOLAI (CONT'D)
                Is it true he was in the KGB?

                            ANNA
                I don't know.

                            NIKOLAI
                Well, he's a brave old man.    That's
                for sure.

     A pause.

                            NIKOLAI (CONT'D)
                Does he live with you?

     Anna is about to answer but stops herself. Nikolai peers
     at her and finally shrugs then turns to walk away. He
     gestures at the bike.

                              NIKOLAI (CONT'D)
                I fixed it.    It should be OK now.

     Anna watches him walk away into the street.

54   EXT. CHELSEA FOOTBALL GROUND. SIDE STREETS - NIGHT.               54

     Crowds of football supporters are streaming away from the
     football stadium, where the floodlights are still casting
     their glow. There are Arsenal and Chelsea supporters on
     opposite sides of the street and there is some mildly
     vicious yelling between the two groups. Police are visibly
     keeping order.

     Among the crowd we see Ekrem. He seems slightly drunk on
     top of his normal craziness. He has an Arsenal scarf around
     his neck and is looking for trouble, jeering at the Chelsea
     supporters across the street.

                             EKREM
                  Hey! Hey Kabuka Chelsea! Fuck
                  you!! Yeah you! Aliverisme!!
                  Fucker!

     A policeman steps up to Ekrem and gives him a shove and he
     stumbles a little. As he gets to his feet we notice TWO
     CHECHEN MEN who are trailing Ekrem, ducking their heads
     away from the line of policemen.

55   EXT. CEMETERY - NIGHT                                           55

     Ekrem is now isolated from the crowds, swigging from a can
     of lager. He is chanting `Arsenal, Arsenal' to himself as
     he walks. He stops to take a piss on someone's grave.

     In the background the two Chechens are coming closer. As
     Ekrem zips his flies, the Chechens are upon him. One of
     them grabs his Arsenal scarf and begins to strangle him.

     Ekrem chokes for a while and the Chechen loosens the knot.
     The second Chechen pulls out an open razor. Ekrem struggles
     to escape...

                              CHECHEN
                  For my brother...

     The Chechen cuts Ekrem's throat then drops him onto the
     grave stone.

56   INT. TRANS-SIBERIAN RESTAURANT - NIGHT                          56

     The place has two dozen customers and there is a Russian
     band playing `Dark Eyes'. At a particular table an old
     Russian lady is having her birthday celebrated by an adoring
     family and lots of very ancient friends.

     There is a huge round of applause as Semyon emerges from
     the kitchen with a cake decorated with sparklers.

57   INT. TRANS-SIBERIAN RESTAURANT. KITCHEN - NIGHT                 57

     Semyon returns to smoke and steam and yelling. As he
     prepares to take a drink one of the young dishwashers
     approaches.

     Semyon grabs a bottle of vodka.

58   EXT. TRANS-SIBERIAN RESTAURANT. KITCHEN REAR - NIGHT            58

     Semyon emerges into the wine crates and beer bottles in
     the yard at the back of the restaurant where the Doberman
     is straining at the leash, snarling and barking. An already
     anxious Ozim is cowering in the shadows, held at bay by
     the dog.

     The moment Semyon steps out the dog stops barking. Ozim
     relaxes a little and steps forward. Semyon pets the dog.

                              SEMYON
                  So what did they say?

     Semyon takes a swig of vodka.    Ozim looks severely nervous.

                              OZIM
                  They were going to kill me.   Those
                  Chechens are savages.

     Ozim is reliving the ordeal.

                              OZIM (CONT'D)
                  I pointed out that I am a Muslim
                  too and it is a sin for a Muslim
                  to kill a Muslim.

                              SEMYON
                      (irritated)
                  What did they say about my son?

                              OZIM
                  They said they would spare me only
                  if I delivered Kirill to them.

                              SEMYON
                  You are being very honest.

                              OZIM
                  I fear you more than I fear them.

     Semyon suddenly breaks the neck of the bottle and holds
     the jagged edge to Ozim's throat. The dog snarls at
     Semyon's feet.

                  No. They have just arrived from

                  Then tell them you will deliver

                  Tell them to give you two days.

59   INT. HELEN'S HOUSE. ANNA'S BEDROOM - NIGHT                        59

     Anna is reading the translation of the diary by lamplight.
     Tatiana's voice over continues.

                              TATIANA (V.O.)
                  I know now for sure that I am
                  pregnant. It hasn't begun to show
                  yet. After I was raped they made
                  me take pills but I guess it was
                  too late. I am condemned to give
                  birth to a new life. But first I
                  will try to find a way to end my
                  own life and spare this child the
                  pain.

     Anna looks up from the pages and thinks.

60   EXT. HOUSING ESTATE - NIGHT                                    60

     A large public housing estate is being swept by rain.
     Christmas lights glow in the windows of the dilapidated
     tower blocks. Stepan is walking against the wind, carrying
     a bag of shopping. He holds onto his Russian hat to stop
     it blowing away. Kids splash in the puddles.

     Stepan arrives at the front garden of his small, ground-
     floor council flat. As he fumbles for his keys in the cold
     we see that Nikolai is watching him from the driver's seat
     of his Mercedes. Once Stepan has disappeared into his
     flat, Nikolai gets out of the car and approaches Stepan's
     flat.

61   INT. HELEN'S HOUSE. KITCHEN - NIGHT                            61

     Helen is preparing food for a small family dinner. Anna
     enters with her cellphone in her hand. She mooches for
     food to hide her agenda. Finally...

     Rain is falling.

     Anna is standing in the falling rain, staring over at the
     trans-Siberian restaurant. The restaurant is busy, with
     the noise of revelers swelling every time the door is
     opened.

     Anna seems to be exiled from where she should really be -

     Inside a restaurant like this, with its danger and vibrancy.

     Suddenly she is illuminated by headlights. She turns and
     sees that Nikolai is pulling up in his Mercedes. Kirill is
     in the passenger seat. Nikolai gets out of the car and
     stops when he sees Anna. Anna is like a fox caught in
     headlights.

                              NIKOLAI
                  What are you doing here?

                  I don't know. I was passing.

     Kirill studies the gaze between Nikolai and Anna and senses
     the connection.

                              KIRILL
                  If you're passing, you pass. You
                  keep going, bitch. Nikolai, come
                  on...

     Kirill grabs Nikolai's arm, and after peering at Anna for
     a moment, he turns to go with Kirill. Anna gathers her
     courage.

                              ANNA
                  Family is important to you people

                  What the hell is she talking about?

     Music swells from the restaurant.

                  Tell Semyon the baby I delivered
                  on Christmas Eve is his daughter.

     Kirill and Nikolai stop. A swell of laughter from the
     restaurant. Anna is about to continue but Nikolai steps
     forward and places two fingers on Anna's lips to stop her
     from saying anymore. Anna tears his hands from her mouth.

     At the same time Kirill yells in Russian.

                              KIRILL
                      (in Russian)
                  What did she say?!

     Anna is terrified but angry too.    She yells.

                  When he raped her she was a virgin.
                  Then they gave her pills. Semyon
                  has to be the father!

     Kirill suddenly goes for her over the bonnet of the car....

                           NIKOLAI
                   (in Russian))
               She's a civilian!

     Kirill pushes Anna up against the car, but she fights him.

                           ANNA
               She was fourteen!      She was a child!

     Kirill slaps Anna hard.     Nikolai grabs Kirill and pulls
     him away.

                           KIRILL
               You don't use my father's name!
               You don't say that filth about
               him...

     He goes for Anna again, and this time Nikolai shoves Kirill
     to the wet ground. He looks up at Nikolai and slowly gets
     to his feet. He wipes his hands then stares into Nikolai's
     eyes.

                           KIRILL (CONT'D)
               Don't even look at her any more.

     Headlights from a passing car sweep the scene....

                           KIRILL (CONT'D)
               That's an order.

     Nikolai peers at Anna for a moment.     Anna's voice is defiant
     but cracking with fear.

                           ANNA
               Tell him what I said.

     Nikolai has taken what Anna said on board.        He speaks
     softly...

                           NIKOLAI
               There is nothing to tell.      Slaves
               give birth to slaves...

     Kirill yells....

                           KIRILL
               Come on Nikolai!!

     He turns to Anna...

               cock inside it! Understand? Maybe
               that's what you want!

     He offers the lights of the restaurant to her as a vicious
     invitation.

                           KIRILL (CONT'D)
               You want to come in?! Maybe we
               all get to fuck you....

     Anna stares back. Nikolai peers at her for a moment before
     grabbing Kirill and pulling him away towards the restaurant.

64   INT. TRANS-SIBERIAN RESTAURANT. KITCHEN - NIGHT                 64

     The place is winding up. Chefs and waiters are cleaning
     surfaces and dishes. The only still point is Semyon, who
     is cutting and wrapping the birthday cake in small parcels
     of golden paper. He works intensely and delicately at the
     back of the kitchen. Nikolai and Kirill enter. Kirill
     swigs a half-drunk glass of wine.

                           KIRILL
               That girl you fucked in front of
               me... you remember her? The
               Ukrainian bitch?

                              NIKOLAI
               No.

                           KIRILL
               So they kick down the door. These
               are ordinary fucking police. They
               ask for her by name and they take
               her away. Some fucking punter must
               have given them her name. What
               gives the police the right to take
               our women, huh?

     Semyon shoots Kirill a hard look: he's talking too much
     and too loudly. Kirill ignores the look.

                           KIRILL (CONT'D)
               Hey Papa, I never seen so many old
               people in one place. Whose party
               is it out there? The angel of
               death?

                  She is one hundred years old.

     Semyon works on for a moment then glances at Kirill.

                              SEMYON (CONT'D)
                  Kirill, go down into the cellar
                  and bring up some brandy. Twelve
                  bottles.

     Kirill turns to leave.

                              KIRILL
                  Come on, Nikolai, help me.

                              SEMYON
                  No. He stays here.   I want to
                  talk business.

     A confused pause.     Kirill looks from Nikolai to his father.

                              KIRILL
                  What business?

     A pause as Kirill suddenly senses his exclusion.

                              KIRILL (CONT'D)
                  Papa, what business? His business
                  is my business.

     Semyon stares at Kirill and Kirill knows the look.

                              SEMYON
                  Go to the cellar Kirill.   And take
                  your time.

     Kirill hesitates. He is angry as hell but too scared of
     his father's gaze to say anything. Finally he turns fast
     and departs, slamming his open hand against the door as he
     goes.

     Semyon waits a moment before returning to the business of
     cutting the cake. Finally...

                              SEMYON (CONT'D)
                  Did you deal with the old man?

     Nikolai nods.

     A pause.     Semyon looks up and fixes Nikolai with a stare.

     A long moment. The thing Nikolai has been working for has
     finally happened. There seems to be little joy.

                           NIKOLAI
                   (in Russian)
               Thank you. Papa.

     Semyon returns to his work.    Nikolai hesitates.

                           NIKOLAI (CONT'D)
               What shall I tell Kirill?

     Semyon continues with the cake, unconcerned.

                           SEMYON
               Tell him I changed my mind about
               the brandy.

65   INT. TRANS-SIBERIAN RESTAURANT. CELLAR - NIGHT                65

     The cellar is half lit, the arched walls lined with crates
     of wine. Flour, grease and potatoes are stored here. As
     Nikolai walks down the steps into the gloom, he hears Kirill
     singing a Russian folk song to himself as he drags a case
     of brandy across the cellar floor.

     Kirill has already opened a bottle of brandy and takes a
     long swig as Nikolai joins him. He grins as he gestures
     at the brandy...

                           KIRILL
               My dad swapped a little Georgian
               girl for this stuff.

     Nikolai sits down on a crate, rests his head against the
     wall. Kirill joins him and swigs some more.

                           KIRILL (CONT'D)
               Hey, don't feel bad. What happened
               up there is just how he is. He
               plays people against each other.
               That's all. I realize more and
               more what he's like. Here, drink
               to the Georgian girl...

     Kirill offers the bottle to Nikolai but he refuses.

                  What?   I drink alone now.

     Nikolai decides to bite the bullet, get this news over
     with.

                              NIKOLAI
                  He offered me stars. I accepted
                  them.

     A long pause. This is what Kirill wanted, but now it feels
     like a stab in the back. Finally Kirill swallows a huge
     swig of brandy then turns awkwardly to hug Nikolai. He
     squeezes him hard for a long time then shoves him away.

                               KIRILL
                      (lying))
                  You think I didn't know already?
                  He told me before. It was my fucking
                  idea. He said there are a lot of
                  things I have to teach you.

     Nikolai nods.    Kirill gets to his feet....

                              KIRILL (CONT'D)
                  Some stuff will take a long time.

                              KIRILL (CONT'D)
                  You think I don't know stuff you

                  I know, Kirill.

     Kirill is about to fly into a rage but Nikolai gets to his
     feet.

                  Where the fuck are you going?

               Your dad don't need the bottles
               any more.

     As Nikolai departs Kirill calls after him.

                           KIRILL
               Hey! We're still partners, right?
               Thunder and lightning!

     Nikolai climbs the steps. Kirill is left to swig his brandy
     and stare into the darkness. He wipes his eyes angrily
     with his sleeve.

66   EXT. TRANS-SIBERIAN RESTAURANT. TWO DAYS LATER - NIGHT         66

     Sweet Russian choral music covers the next four scenes.

     The street outside the restaurant is now flooding with
     rain. A Daimler and a Bentley are already parked. A large
     SUV pulls up and a hard-looking Russian man in his sixties
     (VALERY) is ushered from the car by bodyguards in suits
     and shades.

     He is greeted by a darker-looking man in his fifties (THE
     GYPSY) who has a fur coat around his shoulders. Semyon is
     waiting on the doorstep, dressed in a fine dark suit.

67   INT. TRANS-SIBERIAN RESTAURANT - NIGHT                         67

     The curtains are drawn against the rainy light. The Gypsy,
     Valery, Semyon and TWO OTHER RUSSIAN MEN are sitting in a
     line behind a restaurant table, like a judging panel.

     After a moment Nikolai enters, dressed in suit and tie for
     the biggest interview of his life.

     The vory behind the table greet him.

     Then Nikolai takes off his jacket and removes his tie. He
     then takes off his shirt, to reveal that his upper body is
     decorated with elaborate tattoos (details to follow).

     He carefully places his shirt over the chair then sits
     down. The panel of the vory study his body, the Gypsy
     pushing a candle across the table to better illuminate the
     detail of the tattoos. Only after the men have studied
     the tattoos does the interview begin.

     The following dialogue should not be translated, and can
     be cut around to suggest a long and grueling interview.

                              VALERY
                  We can see that you were in prison
                  in Siberia. And that you were a
                  thief.

                              NIKOLAI
                  My father was a government worker.
                  He fixed the cars of officials. I
                  began by selling the spare parts
                  when I was fifteen.

                              VALERY
                  You have no forced tattoos?

                                 NIKOLAI
                  None.

                              GYPSY
                  You were not co-operative?

                              NIKOLAI
                  I spent two years in the punishment
                  block.

                              VALERY
                  You went through the Crosses in
                  St. Petersburg?

                              NIKOLAI
                  I was in solitary confinement
                  fifteen times. I was called 'The
                  Stump' because they couldn't shift
                  me.

                              VALERY
                  Your father was a bitch and a weak
                  fucker for working with the
                  Government, that's right isn't it?

     Nikolai flickers a little.

                              NIKOLAI
                  That's right. My father means
                  nothing to me. My Mother....

                              GYPSY
                  You have no mother.      She was a
                  whore anyway.

               Yes. I have no mother and no

               the vory v zakone code which I
               have always followed.

                           VALERY
               That is why there is an empty place
               above your heart. Where the stars
               will go. And why there is an empty
               place on your knees.

                           NIKOLAI
               I am dead already. I died when I
               was fifteen. Now I live in the

                           GYPSY
               You have never worked for the

                           NIKOLAI
               I have lived off Albanians and
               Georgians. I steal from them within
               the law.

     The questions and answers are delivered with great
     solemnity, making the ceremony feel almost religious.
     Candles burn, the men all sip water.

     Semyon is silent throughout but listens attentively.
     Towards the end of the interview there is the ghost of a
     smile on the Gypsy's face and this pleases Semyon.

68   EXT. TRANS-SIBERIAN RESTAURANT. REAR ENTRANCE - NIGHT         68

     A wizened old Russian man (THE TATTOOIST) arrives at the
     kitchen door, carrying a battered leather case. The kitchen
     door is opened as he arrives and Semyon greets him.

69   INT. TRANS-SIBERIAN RESTAURANT - NIGHT                        69

     The choral music continues as we see the old man opening
     his case and pulling out tattooing equipment.

     Nikolai is sitting in a banquette at the back, wearing
     only his underpants. We circle Nikolai as the tattooist
     begins to work on his knees, preparing Nikolai's knee caps
     for the tattoos.

     The needle bites at Nikolai's skin as the old tattooist
     wipes away the blood.

     Then we see the needle working on the empty spaces above
     Nikolai's heart, tattooing the star symbol.

     Nikolai now has a star tattoo on each knee and two eight-
     pointed stars on his chest. He is now a member of the vory
     v zakone.

70   INT. HELEN'S HOUSE. ANNA'S BEDROOM - MORNING                   70

     Anna is lying awake, her curtains drawn against the
     daylight. Helen knocks and enters with a cup of tea, just
     as in the opening scenes. Anna sits up.

                              HELEN
                      (almost accusing)
                  Have you slept at all?

     Anna doesn't answer.    Helen looks anxious as she peeks out
     of the curtains.

                              HELEN (CONT'D)
                  I tried to get hold of Stepan for
                  you.

     A pause.

                              HELEN (CONT'D)
                  He's usually either at home or at
                  his sisters. But she hasn't heard
                  from him at all.

     Helen is trying to hide her anxiety but Anna sees it.

                              HELEN (CONT'D)
                  He did spit in that horrible man's
                  face.

                              ANNA
                  I don't think the driver would do
                  anything to Stepan.

     Helen knows Anna well, senses some flicker of attraction.

                              HELEN
                  How do you know what he would do?

     A pause.

                              HELEN (CONT'D)
                  You haven't spoken to him since,
                  have you?

     Anna doesn't answer and Helen's anger sparks... She leaves
     and slams the door.

71   EXT. TURKISH BATHS - DAY                                        71

     We are in St. Pancras, North London.

     More rain. Ozim is waiting nervously, blowing into his
     hands against the cold. The Turkish bath building is a
     Victorian red-brick edifice.

     Nikolai pulls up in his Mercedes.

72   INT. TURKISH BATHS. CHANGING ROOM - DAY                         72

     Ozim and Nikolai are undressing. The place is deserted
     apart from an OLD TURKISH BATH-HOUSE ATTENDANT who is
     distributing towels. Ozim is unbuttoning his shirt.

                              OZIM
                  Semyon recommends these places for
                  business meetings because you can
                  see what tattoos a man has.

     Nikolai is pulling off his shirt and Ozim reacts to the
     sight of the fresh eight-pointed star tattoos. Ozim
     chuckles.

                              OZIM (CONT'D)
                  Come on. We have a lot to get
                  through. Let's cook.

     Ozim disappears into a steam room, naked. Nikolai watches
     him go, a private agenda bubbling beneath the surface.

74   INT. TURKISH BATHS. STEAM ROOM - DAY                           74

     Ozim and Nikolai sit side by side, sweating.    There is no
     one else in the steam room.

                           OZIM
               Our lines to Kabul get broken every
               two or three weeks.

                             NIKOLAI
               How come?

                           OZIM
               The Americans. Fucking NATO.
                   (pause)
               Valery Nabokov imports flowers and
               television sets into this country.
               The television sets are one in
               ten. That means one in ten have
               cargo inside them.

                           NIKOLAI
               Where do they dock?

     Ozim grins.

                           OZIM
               I will tell you when I return from
               the bathroom.

     Ozim chuckles as he leaves in a swirl of steam. Nikolai
     leans back against the cold wall, his tattoo almost the
     only visible thing through the steam.

75   INT. TURKISH BATHS. CHANGING ROOM - DAY                        75

     Ozim is dressing frantically, his face suddenly betraying
     his real anxiety. He checks his watch as he puts it back
     on his wrist.

     After a moment the two Chechen brothers who killed Ekrem
     enter the changing room. They swagger up to Ozim.

     He gulps down his fear.

                              OZIM
                  Kirill is in there.

     Ozim slaps his chest to denote the place where they will
     see the vor tattoo. They head towards the steam room as
     Ozim grabs his shoes and hurries towards the exit.

76   INT. TURKISH BATHS. STEAM ROOM - DAY                         76

     Nikolai is sweating hard, staring at the ceiling. The
     steam room door opens but the steam is now so thick he
     can't see who has entered.

                              NIKOLAI
                  Ozim?

     He sees a shape... a clothed body. He realizes immediately.
     Suddenly one of the brothers is upon him and has him in a
     head lock. He strokes the tattoo on Nikolai's chest as if
     this were confirmation of who this is. He grunts an
     instruction and his brother emerges through the steam with
     an open razor.

     Nikolai is naked, alone.

     Suddenly he kicks the razor guy in the balls and uses a
     martial arts chop to free himself from the other brother.
     In the steam there are boots and bare feet and knees and
     fingers flying. Nikolai manages to gouge the eye of one
     brother and throw another against the wall. He obviously
     has serious combat training but the brothers are strong
     and angry.

     Suddenly Nikolai is slashed across the arm by the razor
     and blood oozes into the steam and hot water. All the men
     are slipping and falling on the blood and hot water.
     Another slash of the razor cuts his thigh open. All the
     men are now covered in blood and Nikolai, with a final
     surge of strength, manages to cripple one brother with a
     blow to the throat, and the other with an elbow to the
     temple.

     As the Chechens slump to the floor, Nikolai fumbles in the
     bloody water for the razor, finds it, kneels, and slashes
     their throats. He lurches to his feet, drops the razor,
     and staggers out of the steam room.

78   INT. TRAFALGAR HOSPITAL. A AND E DEPARTMENT. CANTEEN - DAY      78

     Aziz and a group of a dozen doctors and nurses are eating
     lunch, some in party hats, some drinking red wine out of
     paper cups. Aziz seems anxious, distracted. Anna enters in
     a hurry, locates Aziz and joins him.

                            ANNA
                I'm so late. Sorry.

     She looks around the 'party' with horror...

                Oh God...

                            AZIZ
                It's fine, although I think I've
                had enough.

     He smiles and downs his glass of wine in one go.

                            ANNA
                Paul, on my way here I made a
                decision.

                            AZIZ
                    (mock horror)
                You can't possibly dump me. We're
                not even going out.

                            ANNA
                Take my hand.

     Aziz, confused, takes her hand.

                            ANNA (CONT'D)
                Feel my pulse.

     Aziz feels Anna's pulse.      Anna takes a deep breath.

                            ANNA (CONT'D)
                I'm going to apply to adopt

                  Yes, I can.

79   INT. TRAFALGAR HOSPITAL. A AND E DEPARTMENT - DAY                79

     Nikolai is being hurried down the corridor, his face covered
     with an oxygen mask. He is covered with a surgical gown
     which is covered in blood. His arm flops out from under
     the covers as the paramedics rush him into the hospital.

     Anna is walking in the opposite direction. Then, as
     Nikolai's trolley passes, Anna sees Nikolai's arm, flopping
     from under the covers. She sees the eagle tattoo on the
     back of his hand. Anna freezes.

80   INT. TRAFALGAR HOSPITAL. WARD. NIKOLAI'S ROOM - DAY              80

     Nikolai is conscious in bed, attached to a single drip.
     His wounds have been stitched up.

     A doctor and two nurses are settling Nikolai's vital signs,
     moving around him, checking his temperature. Finally they
     clear the bed and through the glass of the room we see
     Anna, standing outside, staring in at Nikolai.

81   INT. TRAFALGAR HOSPITAL. WARD. NIKOLAI'S ROOM - NIGHT            81

     Nikolai is peering through half-opened eyes. The last
     nurse is checking his vital signs. Then Anna enters. The
     nurse stops work...

                                NURSE
                  Anna?

                              ANNA
                  Is it OK to talk to him for a
                  minute?

     The nurse hesitates...

                              NURSE
                  He's still in trauma.   Do you know
                  him?

     Anna glances at Nikolai who is rousing himself.

                  Yes.

     The nurse is reluctant but sees Anna's fierce stare and
     finally leaves. After she has gone Nikolai stirs, focuses
     on her face.

                              NIKOLAI
                  I thought you did birth.

     Nikolai smiles, but Anna is trying hard to even out her
     fear and anger.

                                 ANNA
                  My uncle....

     Nikolai tries to sit up and registers pain.

                              ANNA (CONT'D)
                  ...the one who spat in your face...
                  He's disappeared.

     A pause. Nikolai gasps in pain as he raises himself up.
     Anna sees the wounds on his arms and glimpses the tattoos
     on his chest, scaring her even more.

                              ANNA (CONT'D)
                  If we don't hear from him soon
                  we're going to the police...

     Nikolai reaches for a bottle of water and manages to take
     a swig. Anna is impatient for a reaction.

                              ANNA (CONT'D)
                  Do you know where he is?

                  He's in Scotland. In Edinburgh.
                  In a five-star hotel.

     Anna is locating the door in case she has to flee as Nikolai
     swings his legs out of the bed to stretch his painful limbs.

                I'm going to need some clothes. I
                arrived here without any. Can you
                get me some?

     Anna doesn't budge.

                            NIKOLAI (CONT'D)
                I can't walk out of here naked.

                You can't walk out of here because
                you're attached to a drip. Explain
                Edinburgh.

     Nikolai sighs, sits back down on the bed.    He finally speaks
     softly.

                            NIKOLAI
                Your uncle knew too much.

     Nikolai shrugs.

                            NIKOLAI (CONT'D)
                I was told to get rid of him. I
                was meant to send him to heaven
                with a bullet in his head. Instead
                I sent him to Edinburgh. With a
                first-class ticket.

     A pause.

                            NIKOLAI (CONT'D)
                He is of the old school. He
                understood the situation. Exile
                or death. Edinburgh was his idea.
                He said they throw a great party
                at New Year. And he said it was a
                good excuse to get away from his
                family.

     Nikolai smiles at Anna.

                            NIKOLAI (CONT'D)
                So... just a pair of jeans and a T-
                shirt. A jacket. And some shoes.

     Anna still looks disbelieving.   Nikolai sighs.

                    (into phone)
                Mum, I don't want to tell you how
                I found him because I don't want
                another argument. I just wanted
                you to know he's definitely safe...

     Anna listens with weariness.

                            ANNA (CONT'D)
                    (into phone)
                No, we can't tonight. I'm working.
                I need the money.
                    (a pause)
                For a place of my own, for Christ's
                sake!

     She listens with growing anger until she finally cuts the
     call without a word. Christine stirs but doesn't wake.

     She leans back against the wall, already regretful.

83   INT. TRAFALGAR HOSPITAL.    WARD OUTSIDE NIKOLAI'S ROOM -      83
     NEXT MORNING.

     The ward is busy as Yuri, the police specialist from the
     Russian desk, enters wearing a heavy overcoat. He looks
     all around and approaches a nurse.
     PINK Revision    -   11/12/06                          89.




84   INT. TRAFALGAR HOSPITAL. WARD. NIKOLAI'S ROOM - MORNING       84

     Nikolai's drip is being removed by A NURSE. Nikolai is
     examining his healing wounds. Then through the glass of
     the door he notices Yuri, speaking to a nurse, and obviously
     recognizes him.

     The nurse points Yuri in Nikolai's direction.

85   EXT. TRAFALGAR HOSPITAL. A FIRE ESCAPE LANDING - MORNING      85

     It's cold and the wind is blowing. We see rooftops behind
     them. Yuri is lighting Nikolai's cigarette. Nikolai is
     wearing Yuri's overcoat loosely over his hospital gown.
     Yuri lights his own cigarette and they smoke in silence
     for a moment.

                           NIKOLAI
               You got my message?

     Yuri chuckles.

                            YURI
               Using a dead body to file a progress
               report must be against FSB
               regulations.

                           NIKOLAI
               It's called improvisation.

                           YURI
               You've been improvising quite a
               lot lately. And taking risks.

     He glances at the cuts on Nikolai's hands...

                           YURI (CONT'D)
                   (in Russian)
               Maybe too many.

     Nikolai suddenly glares at Yuri.

                           NIKOLAI
                   (in Russian)
               You didn't come here to give me
               flowers...

     Yuri shakes his head and prepares to deliver bad news.
     Nikolai turns as if to go back inside. Yuri grabs Nikolai's
     arm and speaks formally....

     Nikolai shakes his head wearily....

                              NIKOLAI
                      (in Russian)
                  Ah, Christ...

                              YURI
                  ...and in light of other violent
                  incidents associated with you, the
                  Russian desk at Scotland Yard have
                  made an official request to the
                  Russian embassy that your undercover
                  operation in London be terminated.

     Nikolai doesn't react for a moment.

                              YURI (CONT'D)
                      (in Russian)
                  You have gone beyond what was
                  agreed.

     With his cigarette dangling from his mouth Nikolai begins
     to unbutton his overcoat..

                              YURI (CONT'D)
                  In my opinion you should see this
                  as good news. You've been in the
                  zone far too long...

     Nikolai turns and slowly pulls open the overcoat and the
     thin hospital gown beneath it.

     He reveals the eight-pointed star tattoos on his chest and
     Yuri reacts with absolute astonishment.

                              YURI (CONT'D)
                  My God...

                              NIKOLAI
                  If they terminate the operation
                  now, they will be wasting this...

     A pause. Yuri looks shocked and slightly horrified.
     Nikolai too suddenly seems almost ashamed that he has got
     this far. After a long silence Nikolai mumbles.

                You tell the Russian desk you saw
                stars over my heart. OK? Tell
                them I'm through the door.

     A pause.   Yuri is still overwhelmed.

                            YURI
                They are bound to ask... who did
                you kill?

     A pause.

                            NIKOLAI
                    (in Russian)
                Tell them I only killed myself.

     A pause. Yuri is humbled. They share a moment of
     understanding as they smoke. Finally...

                            NIKOLAI (CONT'D)
                And you can tell them I'm going to
                replace Semyon at the head of the
                London organization.

     Yuri laughs.

                            YURI
                What drugs are they giving you?
                Maybe it's the anesthetic speaking.

                            NIKOLAI
                I need you to take Semyon out of
                the picture. I want you to arrest
                him.

     Nikolai lights another cigarette from the stub of the one
     he is smoking. Yuri is incredulous.

                            YURI
                Arrest him for what?

                              NIKOLAI
                Rape.

     Yuri begins to chuckle.

                            NIKOLAI (CONT'D)
                The girl was fourteen.

                            NIKOLAI
                She doesn't have to.   She's dead.

     A pause.

                            NIKOLAI (CONT'D)
                But she had Semyon's baby. If you
                prove the baby is his and prove
                the girl was under age when the
                baby was conceived, that's statutory
                rape.

     A pause.   Yuri begins it think it through.

                            NIKOLAI (CONT'D)
                All you need is the baby and some
                of Semyon's DNA. For poetic reasons
                I suggest you take his blood.

     Yuri peers at Nikolai with awe.    A long pause.   Finally
     Yuri smiles.

                            YURI
                You intrigue me.

     A pause.

                            YURI (CONT'D)
                If we had never had this
                conversation they would have sent
                you home. You could have spent
                the Spring in the mountains. Riding
                your bicycle to your office every
                morning through fields of flowers.

     A pause.

                              YURI (CONT'D)
                Why stay?

     Nikolai reacts but doesn't answer. A pause.

                            YURI (CONT'D)
                You keep in touch.

     Yuri studies Nikolai.

     Yuri tenderly takes his overcoat from Nikolai's shoulders
     and goes back through the fire-escape door. Nikolai is
     left cold and exposed in his thin gown.

86   INT. TRAFALGAR HOSPITAL. WARD. NIKOLAI'S ROOM - DAY             86

     Nikolai is playing chess against himself, sitting on the
     bed, trying hard to concentrate. There is a knock and
     Anna enters, carrying an old shopping bag. She takes out
     a worn pair of jeans and a T-shirt, a denim jacket and a
     battered pair of shoes. Nikolai smiles...

                            NIKOLAI
                How is Uncle Stepan?

     Instead of answering, Anna lays the clothes on the bed.

                            ANNA
                    (deadpan)
                They're from the morgue. They
                belonged to someone who died
                yesterday.

     Nikolai picks up the jeans and examines them.     They're way
     too big.

                            ANNA (CONT'D)
                I can't believe I'm doing a favor
                for someone just because he had
                the decency not to murder a member
                of my family.

     Nikolai smiles but Anna turns to leave...

                            NIKOLAI
                Hey... wait a minute...

     Nikolai steps behind the bed screen to pull on the jeans.
     He speaks from behind the screen.

                            NIKOLAI (CONT'D)
                Is your bike still working OK?

     A pause.   Anna considers leaving but hesitates.

                Yeah.     It's OK.

     Nikolai steps out from behind the screen, the baggy jeans
     tightly belted, his chest bare. For the first time Anna
     sees the extent of Nikolai's body tattoos and reacts....

     Nikolai sees her reaction to the tattoos and doesn't care
     for it. He grabs the T-shirt and pulls it on.

                              NIKOLAI
                  Did you get in touch with Tatiana's
                  family in Russia?

                              NIKOLAI

     Nikolai is now dressed, his cut and tattooed arms still
     showing.

                              NIKOLAI (CONT'D)
                  So the baby's still in England.

                  She's staying here for good.

     They peer at each other.

                  Why do you care?

     Nikolai shrugs and grabs the shoes.

                              ANNA (CONT'D)
                  Stepan said you were kind to him.
                  He said you were risking your own
                  life to keep him alive.

     Nikolai laughs.

                  Yeah, and all the thanks I get is

87   INT. TRANS-SIBERIAN RESTAURANT - DAY                         87

     The restaurant is filled with balloons of every color, all
     over the floor and bouncing off the tables. A large `Happy
     New Year' banner is hanging from the wall.

     Kirill is sitting on the floor amongst the balloons, blowing
     up another one. Maria, Semyon's little granddaughter, runs
     in to the restaurant and stops to stare at Kirill. He
     begins to inflate another balloon then stops.

                           KIRILL

               You.

     Maria comes to him and take a balloon. She tries to blow
     it up but fails. Kirill smiles and blows it up for her.

                           MARIA (CONT'D)
               What were you and Grandpa shouting
               about last night?

               Nothing, baby.

                           MARIA
               It sounded like something.

     Kirill takes a deep breath to blow a balloon then stops
     and looks at Maria.

                           KIRILL

               Did you fight each other?    I heard
               banging.

                  No. It's not a fight if one of
                  you doesn't fight back.

     A pause.     Kirill smiles.   We see slight abrasions.

                              KIRILL (CONT'D)
                  So, today I do as I am told.

     She nods and Kirill blows another balloon. At that moment
     Kirill sees on the security monitor behind the bar that a
     police car is pulling up outside the restaurant. His face
     clouds as another pulls up beside it.

                               KIRILL (CONT'D)
                  Maria.   Go upstairs.

88   INT. TRANS-SIBERIAN RESTAURANT - DAY                            88

     Semyon sits at a bare table, opposite Yuri from the Russian
     desk. A uniformed officer stands nearby, and there is a
     police doctor with a medical bag sitting at the next table,
     waiting. The whole scene is rendered surreal by all the
     balloons which bounce around them. Semyon is in full
     charming old man mode.

                              SEMYON
                      (in Russian)
                  You'll have a drink, Yuri...

     He is half on his feet.

                  I've told you, I am half Russian.

     Yuri shakes his head.     Semyon goes to the optic and helps
     himself to a vodka.

                  So what is all this nonsense?

                              YURI
                  We just need a blood sample.

                                   SEMYON
                  For what?

                              YURI
                  We can take the sample right now
                  voluntarily or I can get an order
                  from the court. It's up to you.

     Semyon glances at the doctor and chuckles.

     Semyon's face hardens and he glares at Yuri.

                              SEMYON
                  I am afraid of... conspiracies.

     A pause.     Yuri speaks softly.

                              YURI
                  I will return tomorrow with a court
                  order.

     He gets to his feet.

                  Wait.       I've done nothing wrong.

     Semyon begins to roll up his sleeve, revealing a long scroll
     of tattoos.

     Then a needle is being pushed into Semyon's arm by the
     doctor. Semyon's face doesn't flicker. He stares into
     Yuri's eyes.

89   INT. TRANS-SIBERIAN RESTAURANT. KITCHEN - DAY                    89

     Kirill is preparing food for the night's festivities.
     Semyon enters and goes straight to the sink. He pulls off
     the plaster from his arm where the blood was taken and
     pours some vodka over the tiny puncture hole.

                           KIRILL
               What did they want with you, papa?

                           SEMYON
               To poison me.

     Semyon pours more vodka on the wound then takes a swig.

                           SEMYON (CONT'D)
               They took blood from me with a
               needle. Probably the same needle
               they use for all the junkies and
               whores and blacks and queers.

     He glares at Kirill as he rolls his sleeve down.

                           SEMYON (CONT'D)
               Now I probably have the fucking
               queer disease.

     Kirill has his back turned, doesn't react.   Semyon sits
     heavily. Finally...

                           KIRILL
               Why would they want your blood,
               papa?

     For the first time Semyon looks vulnerable and confused as
     he admits....

                           SEMYON
               I don't know.

     Kirill is surprised to see his father unsure.   He peers at
     him.

                           SEMYON (CONT'D)
               Someone is ahead of me. I don't
               like people ahead of me.

     Kirill is now unnerved by Semyon's quiet confusion. He
     watches as Semyon grabs at the bottle of vodka to drink.
     He speaks softly as he swigs.

                  What the hell did that cocksucker
                  want with my blood?

     Kirill is reluctant to speak at first but eventually chances
     his arm.

                              KIRILL
                  Maybe it's about the baby.

                  Some bitch was out there saying
                  you were the father of a baby.

     Semyon turns to Kirill, his face hardening...

                              SEMYON
                  What are you talking about?

     Semyon approaches and Kirill gets scared.

                              KIRILL
                  It was nothing. Just some bitch...

                  midwife.

     Semyon stares into Kirill's eyes and Kirill mistakes his
     frantic thought process for anger. Kirill backs away.
     Semyon is beginning to catch up.

90   EXT. TRAFALGAR HOSPITAL - NIGHT                               90

     The main entrance of the hospital is busy with visitors
     and staff. There is a `Happy New Year' banner across the
     entrance. In amongst the bustle of visitors we spy a young
     man with his collar turned up and a bunch of red roses in
     his hand.

     We then see that it is Kirill, entering the hospital.

     Anna is walking down a corridor with her crash helmet in
     her hand, heading for another shift.

92   INT. TRAFALGAR HOSPITAL. ELEVATORS - NIGHT                    92

     We are close on Kirill's face as he studies a map of the
     hospital near the elevators.

     Anna comes down a stairwell and spots Kirill - she
     especially notices the roses - just as he gets into an
     elevator. The elevator doors close. Was it really him?
     Anna is not sure. She frowns.

93   INT. TRAFALGAR HOSPITAL. EMPTY CORRIDOR - NIGHT               93

     A door opens and Kirill steps into striped moonlight.
     Clamping the roses under his arm, he pulls a black zip-up
     sports bag from under his coat. After a brief dialogue
     with himself, he produces a half bottle of vodka and takes
     a swig. Then he hurries on.

94   INT. TRAFALGAR HOSPITAL. S.C.B.U. CHRISTINE'S PRIVATE ROOM -94
     NIGHT

     Anna walks onto the ward in her uniform. She checks a few
     stats as she walks by various beds. She then glances over
     at Christine's private room. She tiptoes into the room
     and goes to the crib. She finds it empty - except for a
     bunch of red roses. Outside the ward is now filling up
     with visitors. Babies cry, people laugh.

     Anna goes back out to the ward and calls to a nurse.

                          ANNA
               Sonya! Is someone bathing

     Kirill is at the wheel of Nikolai's Mercedes. He swigs
     from his bottle of vodka, which is now more than half empty.
     He fires the engine and reverses. A car passing by has to
     slam on its brakes. Kirill yells.

                           KIRILL
               Hey, you stupid fucker!!

     A horn blows. The passing car accelerates angrily by. Then
     we hear a baby crying. Kirill looks into the half darkness
     of the back seat and we see Kirill's black sports bag,
     partially zipped up. Christine is crying inside it, her
     little grasping hand protruding past the zipper. Kirill
     speaks softly.

                           KIRILL (CONT'D)

     Anna runs fast down the corridor towards the hospital exit.
     She spots Nikolai ahead of her.

     She pushes past a couple of drunks and flies at him.

                           ANNA

               What are you talking about?!

     Anna studies Nikolai's face and sees his genuine confusion.
     She calms down a little.

               Kirill. Kirill has taken Christine.
               I saw him here! I thought he was
               coming to see you, but he wasn't,
               was he?

     Nikolai curses under his breath and thinks fast.

       The same dockside where Nikolai dumped Soyka and recommended
       this as the best place to dispose of a body. Kirill pulls
       up slowly in Nikolai's Mercedes. The car is parked for a
       long time before finally the headlights are switched off.

101    EXT. TRAFALGAR HOSPITAL. MATERNITY UNIT - NIGHT               101

102    EXT. NINE ELMS. ABANDONED DOCK - NIGHT                        102

       On the edge of the dockside, Kirill is kneeling with the
       zip-up bag before him. Suddenly fireworks begin to burst
       over the Thames. It is the stroke of midnight.

       Kirill unzips the bag. When he looks inside Christine
       stops crying. He peers at her, wiping away tears.

                             KIRILL
                 She's a little girl, Papa, a little

                 Shush, shush...

       Kirill lifts her out of the bag and holds her close to
       him, fireworks still illuminating the London skyline. He
       looks down at the freezing cold water, utterly confused.
       He whispers...

      For a moment we believe he is going to throw her into the
      water. Instead he begins to sing a lullaby to her and her
      crying stops.

      Then we see a single light behind him. In a firework flash
      we see Nikolai and Anna climbing off the bike. They
      approach cautiously. Kirill stares at the man he loves.
      A pause. Christine begins to cry.

                 Kirill, let me take the baby.

                             ANNA
                 She's cold, Kirill.

      Kirill suddenly screams as another barrage of fireworks
      explodes. Nikolai doesn't move. Kirill is dangerously
      close to the edge of the dock. Maybe he'll throw himself
      in too.

                 Kirill, a vor doesn't kill little

      Kirill is motionless.

                 Something like this would be bad
                 for all of us. Your dad has gone

                 It's our turn now.

      Nikolai steps forward slowly.    As he gets closer Kirill
      hugs the baby.

      Finally Nikolai reaches Kirill and hugs him. As he does
      he edges him away from the dockside. The three of them are
      locked in a long embrace.

      Nikolai emerges from the embrace with Christine in his
      arms. He quickly hands her to Anna who hugs her close.
      Kirill turns to Nikolai.

                             KIRILL
                 I swear I didn't know my dad was
                 setting you up.

                               NIKOLAI
                   He's going away. When he's gone
                   the family business will be yours.

      A pause.

                               NIKOLAI (CONT'D)
                   We can be partners again. Thunder
                   and lightning, right?

      Kirill smiles through his tears and nods.

                               NIKOLAI (CONT'D)
                   Get into the car. I'll drive you
                   home.

      A pause. Kirill dries his eyes and heads for the car.
      Nikolai looks at Anna, who is hugging the baby. He waits
      a long time before realizing he must leave her.

                               NIKOLAI (CONT'D)
                   You're OK, yeah?

      Anna nods.

                               ANNA
                   Who are you really? Why have you
                   helped us?




                                                  (CONTINUED)

      Nikolai can't answer truthfully, though he longs to do so.
      There is a long pause before he manages to finds a suitable
      lie.

                             NIKOLAI
                 How can I become King if the King
                 is still in place?

      A pause.   He laughs.

      Anna studies him, unsure. More New Year fireworks explode
      over the river. Kirill yells from the car...

                             KIRILL
                 You come on, Nikolai! We're missing
                 the fucking party of the year out
                 there!! Get here and drive!!
                     (in Russian)
                 That's a fucking order!!

      Nikolai and Anna peer at each other.

                             NIKOLAI
                 Maybe I can drive you somewhere?

      She shakes her head.

                             ANNA
                 There's someone I can call.   He'll
                 come and fetch us.

      Nikolai nods, not liking the information but hiding it.
      Nikolai comes close and gently uncovers Christine's face.
      He smiles. Kirill is hooting the car horn.

      After a moment Nikolai and Anna kiss each other gently
      before Nikolai heads for the car.

104   INT. HELEN'S HOUSE. KITCHEN - DAY                             104*

      A summer's day. Anna, Helen and Uncle Stepan are preparing
      to eat Sunday lunch. Stepan is carving. The conversation
      is jovial as Anna and Helen bring dishes of food to the
      table.

      Then we hear a baby crying. Anna goes to a small crib and
      lifts a six-month-old Christine out. She hands her to
      Helen who hugs her. Over this happy scene we hear Tatiana
      in V.O., a repeat of the first words we heard her say.

                            TATIANA (V.O.)
                My name is Tatiana. My father
                died in the mines in my village,
                so he was already buried when he
                died...

      Anna takes Christine back and takes her to the window to
      peer outside, staring across the park.

105   INT. TRANS-SIBERIAN RESTAURANT - SAME DAY                     105

      Nikolai is sitting at a window table, alone, sipping vodka,
      staring back across the park. He peers out at ordinary
      life going on in the streets outside. Tatiana's V.O.
      continues...

                            TATIANA (V.O.)
                We were all buried there. Beneath
                the soil of Russia. That is why I
                left to find a better life.

      Nikolai finishes his drink.

     EXT. HANCOCK TOWER, CHICAGO - LATE NIGHT

     Lake Shore Drive.  Four o'clock in the morning.  Minimal traffic,
     minimal life.  As MAIN TITLES BEGIN, we PAN UP the face of...

     ...Hancock Tower.  Up, up, forty floors, sixty, eighty, very dark
     up here, street sounds fading fast, and as CREDITS CONTINUE we can
     just make out...

     ...a dark FIGURE.  Like a spider.  Inching its way up the steel
     surface of the 98th floor, and we CLOSE to see...

     The THIEF.  All in black, nearly invisible, with a sleek visored
     helmet that conceals the face.  Two long, oblong backpacks, climb-
     ing ropes and harness across back and shoulders, tools at the belt.
     Moving STRAIGHT UP the face of the skyscraper.  How is it possible?
     CLOSER still to see...

     ...the piton-like BOLTS are electromagnetic, CLANKING to the steel
     to support weight.  A button releases the magnetic charge when the
     bolt is pulled up by cords to a higher position.  The Thief is
     remarkably strong and agile, scaling the wall with fluid precision,
     until...

     ...our summit.  A softly-lit, glass-walled PENTHOUSE on the
     100th floor.  Subtle spots which bathe paintings, sculptures,
     in a cavernous coldly-decorated space.

     Swiftly, deftly, the Thief rigs a suction-mounted HARNESS to the
     steel casing above a massive window.  Pulleys, metal caribiner
     clips, yellow Kevlar ropes.  So superbly practiced, the rigging is
     placed in seconds, huge SUCTION CUPS pressed to the surface of the
     glass.  The Thief reaches to a metal rectangle at the top of the
     rigging, touches a button, a motor WHINES, the ropes TIGHTEN and
     the window...

     ...POPS FREE, hangs SUSPENDED by the Kevlar ropes which amazingly
     sustain its awesome weight.  The huge pane shudders in the wind,
     and the Thief slips...

     ...INTO the Penthouse.  Nearby, an ALARM BOX softly BEEPS its
     60-second warning to the pulsing of a green light, and the Thief
     attaches a small computerized DEVICE which runs a series of
     possible CODES at dazzling speed on its display panel, until...

     ...the right one STOPS.  Illuminated in red.  The beeping, the
     green light, go OFF.  The device is removed.

     Back to the window, air rushing in, attach a similar suction-
     mounted harness from the inside, all exquisitely engineered to rig
     in seconds, press new suction cups to the inside of the dangling
     window pane.  A small remote control clicker...

     ...RELEASES the outside suction cups.  The window's weight now
     supported by the interior rigging.  The outside equipment pulled
     INTO the apartment in a single tug.  The WHINE of a motor, and the
     pane pulls UP, the Thief expertly POPPING it into place.

     No trace of entry.

     Rapidly folding the rigging into an astonishingly compact bundle,
     the Thief SCANS...

     ...the profusion of priceless art.  The paintings run to Otto Dix,
     Franz Marc, Marcel Duchamp.  One statue an obvious Rodin.  The soft
     lighting makes walls seem invisible, everything with an infinity
     perspective in mind.  An obsidian slab dining table that seems to
     end at the horizon.

     The Thief has packed the rigging away, taken out a large cylin-
     drical TUBE bearing a label we can't read.  Knows the way, quickly
     through the spectacular apartment, past oils by early German
     expressionists, Russian futurists, a Rothko, a Kandinsky, a Francis
     Bacon.  The Thief has no interest in these, and as CREDITS CONTINUE,
     we enter...

     ...a powder room.  A lime-green poured concrete sink, a copper-
     plated commode, and across from these...

     ...a single PAINTING.  Unlike the others, clearly an Old Master.
     A 17th century city on the water, churches, spires, an ancient
     bridge.  The Thief wastes no time, unceremoniously...

     ...CUTS the painting from its frame with sure, perfect strokes.
     Rolls it quickly in acid-free paper.  Opens the cylindrical tube,
     pulling out...

     ...another CANVAS which we cannot see.  Deftly unrolls this,
     fitting it carefully into the stolen painting's now-empty frame.
     Re-hangs it.  Stares for a beat through the opaque helmet visor.
     Approves.  Slips the rolled-up stolen canvas into the empty tube.
     Leaves.  Before we follow, we shift angle to see the replacement
     canvas...

     A cheerful acrylic portrait.  Bozo the Clown.

     WITH the Thief now, moving fast, into a panelled library.  There is
     a CHUTE built into the wall, a brass lid with the words U.S. MAIL.
     The Thief pops the labeled tube DOWN the chute.  Gone.  Steps...

     ...onto a bookshelf, reaches up to punch out an overhead grating,
     and...

     Disappears into the vent.  Reaching back to refit the grating
     seamlessly into place.

     INT. VENT

     Halogen flashlight leading the way, our Thief shimmies down the
     narrow space, arriving at...

     ...an open vertical AIR SHAFT, BLASTING air straight up the 100
     floor height of the skyscraper, with frightening FORCE.  Calmly,
     the Thief clips on a different harness, unzips a nylon cover from
     the backpack, and simply...

     LEAPS DOWN the air shaft, startling the shit out of us, as, for an
     instant...

     ...the force of the updraft seems to HOLD the Thief in place,
     suspended above 100 stories of nothingness.  Then suddenly, the
     Thief...

     ...DROPS SHARPLY, an exhilarating moment of absolute FREE FALL,
     until a cord is tugged and...

     ...a nylon PARACHUTE OPENS with a pop.  We watch the Thief drifting
     lazily down.  A ride any kid would pay big money for...

     EXT. HANCOCK TOWER - LATE NIGHT

     Our original exterior VIEW of the skyscraper's penthouse.  REVERSE
     ANGLE now to see in far distance...

     ...the dense forest of silhouetted OFFICE TOWERS of downtown
     Chicago against the night sky, and we ZOOM TOWARD them, covering
     miles in three seconds, to CLOSE on...

     ...the highest floor of the SEARS TOWER, and THROUGH an unlit
     window to see...

     ...a TELESCOPE.  A silhouetted FIGURE looking through it.  SNAP
     to...

     VIEW through the scope's lens.  An amazingly CLOSE detail of the
     Hancock Tower Penthouse.  The scope now PANS DOWN the length of the
     Tower, to...

     The street.  The Thief climbing onto a battered old Lambretta.
     Calm as you please.  And as the scooter glides off...

     We HEAR our unseen voyeur WALK AWAY from our telescope.  A door
     OPENS somewhere, and as CREDITS CONCLUDE, it...

     Closes.  Softly.

     INT. WEBBER ASSURANCE - DAY

     A basement corridor.  Long, bare, dimly lit.  Silent.  We're in the
     bowels of somewhere.  A startling CLANK, like a prison cell
     unlocking.  A FIGURE enters the corridor, coming this way, on the
     hurried side of brisk.

     HECTOR CRUZ is 42, tanned, fit, graying hair swept back in a Pat
     Riley do.  He wears Riley's Armani, too.  Maybe this guy coaches.
     Heels ECHO until he reaches a plain door with discreet lettering...

     NO ADMITTANCE FOR ANY REASON.  There is a dull silver rectangle
     below the words.  He holds his hand up to it...

     Nothing happens.  Shit.  Dries his palm on his perfectly-creased
     slacks.  One more time.  CLICK.  Enters...

     INT. SITUATION ROOM - DAY

     An unexpectedly VAST semi-circular room, the entire inner circum-
     ference made up of a single continuous WALL SCREEN, separated into
     a seamless array of IMAGES...

     Three-dimensional rotating GRAPHICS of every room in the Hancock
     Tower Penthouse, SCHEMATICS of electrical, plumbing, and ventila-
     tion systems.  See-through rotating multicolored models of every
     piece of security EQUIPMENT imaginable, components FLASHING as
     performance simulations are run.  Rapid-fire sequences of indiv-
     idual human PROFILES, complete with photos and bio blurbs.  Screens
     flickering with blizzards of DATA, hurtling past at warp speed.

     The Pentagon and CNN would kill for this room.

     The largest segment of screen, twenty feet square, runs a LIVE FEED
     from the crime scene.  The living room of the Penthouse, crawling
     with slow-moving cops and technicians, doing their slow-moving
     thing.  Surrounding this image are a dozen smaller screens, showing
     this and other rooms from a variety of camera angles.  All live.
     We see the library, the mail chute.  The powder room.  Bozo.

     Cruz skips down three steps to floor level, nine separate CONTROL
     STATIONS, each outfitted with super-tech panels to process the
     avalanche of information.  But today, all stations are empty.

     Except one.

                               CRUZ
                     Baker.  You got it solved?

     And now we see her.  From the rear.  Slouched at her station.
     Looks like a skinny teenager in tousled tawny hair, rumpled
     oversized workshirt, vintage jeans.

                               GIN (O.S., from the rear)
                     Actually.  Yeh.

     Not a kid's voice.  Throaty.  Music and whiskey and sex and
     effortless confidence.  Even the voice turns us on.

                               CRUZ (glances at his watch)
                     What took you so long, Gin?  I
                     called 4:30 this morn...

     And stops.  Because she turns with a look that would freeze anyone
     to stone.

                               GIN
                     I was with someone, all right?

     Now we really see her.  Delicate bones and features, slender body,
     radiating the power of a natural heart-stopping beauty.  GINGER
     BAKER is 32, ethereal and feral at once.  Electric green eyes
     crackle with an intellect and a will that are not to be fucked
     with.

                               CRUZ
                     So?  This is work.

     He is not kidding.  Stainless steel beneath the dapper.  They are a
     matched team.

                               GIN
                     Hector, I hardly know the guy.
                     Why be impolite to strangers?

     And he smiles.  Maybe she's lying.  He likes her.

                               CRUZ
                     Look at those assholes...

     He means the cops on live feed.

                               CRUZ
                     If the Vermeer were lying on that
                     table, they'd toss their doughnuts
                     on it.

                               GIN
                     Yeh, well, they didn't insure it,
                     so they don't have to solve this.
                     To them it's a crime.  To us it's 24
                     mil, less re-insurance, which is...

                               CRUZ (grim)
                     Only thirty percent, Gin.

     Ouch.  Really?

                               CRUZ
                     Which is why you're on this.

     Soft and straight.  You're the best.  I need you.

                               GIN
                     He came in through the window.

                               CRUZ
                     That's not possib...

                               GIN
                     What's not possible is entry through
                     the doors or the vents.  That would
                     have triggered instant alarm.

                               CRUZ
                     The windows are wired, too.

                               GIN
                     Only for trauma.  They used smart
                     glass, where the sensors respond to
                     violation of the panel's integrity.

     He's listening.  He always does with her.

                               GIN
                     I think he scaled the wall, popped
                     the frame.  In one piece.

     She sounds awfully positive.  Then again, she always does.

                               GIN
                     Then, he only had to deal with
                     heat and motion sensors.  They
                     were on 60-second delay, so the
                     owner wouldn't trigger the alarm
                     just be walking arou...

                               CRUZ
                     The pane weighs 200 pounds, the
                     building's 1100 feet high.

                               GIN
                     This particular guy is the best.
                     The best there ever was.

     Almost as if she knows who.  Cruz shakes his head...

                               CRUZ
                     Popping the frame would trigger
                     the alarm.

     She smiles.  First time.  Even at one-tenth power, it is dazzling
     light.  She touches the panel before her...

                               GIN (gently)
                     I wrote a program and ran it, Dumbo.

     The live feed is replaced by a red-outlined rotating three-
     dimensional DIAGRAM of the living room.  The alarm box glows green.
     One window pane glows lavender.  She touches the panel, and the
     window SHATTERS, the alarm instantly emits a PIERCING SCREECH.

     Reset.  As he watches.  This time the window SLIDES AWAY into
     thin air.  No sound.  A stick figure appears, crawls through the
     opening, and the alarm begins the slow BEEP we heard last night.
     Cruz just stares.

                               GIN
                     Here's how I figured it out...

     Live feed replaces the diagram.  Our camera ZOOMS toward a VASE of
     lilies by the window.  All the flowers are tilted in one direction.
     Over the lip of the vase, away from the window.

                               GIN
                     No one arranges flowers like that.
                     It was the draft from the window.

     He turns to her.

                               CRUZ
                     You said.  This particular guy.

     Now she is beaming.  Excited.  And just above a whisper...

                               GIN
                     Andrew MacDougal.

     Delighted at his stupefied reaction.

                               CRUZ
                     Why not Houdini?  Or Pretty Boy
                     Floyd?  Maybe Jesus Christ.

                               GIN
                     Because they couldn't do it.

     His slow smile.  This fucking kid.

                               CRUZ
                     He's been out of the business.
                     For ten years.

                               GIN
                     Maybe not.  No one ever proved,
                     hell, even arrested him, for
                     stealing anything.  But we all
                     know he was numero ichiban for
                     thirty years.  Why not forty?

     She's serious.

                               CRUZ
                     Why?  Because of the Bozo switch?
                     Guys have been copying his pack-
                     rat signature for decades.  Maybe
                     the thief wanted it to look like
                     MacDougal.

     She doesn't even answer.  Just touches her panel, and one of the
     data screens BLOWS UP to huge size.  It is...

                               GIN
                     A list of his private collection.
                     Complete to three acquisitions
                     last Thursday.

     Names SCROLLING up endlessly, next to titles, descriptions,
     estimated retail and black market values.  Turner, Corot, Thomas
     Coles, DeKooning, Klimt, Cezannes, Odilon Redon, Braques, Mary
     Cassatt...

                               CRUZ
                     No Vermeer.  Nothing close.

                               GIN
                     Don't be a putz.  This is his
                     legitimate collection, which he
                     buys.  Presentable for any search
                     warrant surprise party.

     Names keep rolling, Degas, Paul Klee.  Amazing.

                               GIN
                     What he rips off, he fences.  And
                     the money feeds his portfolio of
                     investments, which are daring, savvy,
                     and obscenely succesf...

                               CRUZ
                     Oh, I get it.  He has no interest
                     in Vermeers, so that proves he stole
                     one.  By that logic, he oughta be a
                     suspect most of the time.

     She shakes her head, sadly.

                               GIN
                     You love to embarrass yourself.

     Touches her panel.  The big screen now shows a grainy VIDEOTAPE
     of...

                               GIN
                     The auction.  Where our client
                     bought the painting...

     We see the Great Room of an English Country estate.  Perhaps a
     hundred attend.  Genteel to the max.

                               GIN (O.S.)
                     Ashcroft Hall, Buckinghamshire,
                     four weeks ago.

     The tape PANS five PAINTINGS on the block.  We recognize our
     VERMEER, the city of Delft, the canal, the bridge.  The view PULLS
     BACK to include the crowd, and...

     FREEZES.  One tiny section is circled.  And BLOWS UP twenty feet.
     high, so blurry as to be unrecognizable.  Then, SNAPS to amazing
     resolution.  The image of...

                               GIN (O.S., murmur)
                     Anyone we know?

     ...ANDREW MacDOUGAL, perhaps 60, as charismatic and shamelessly
     virile a face as one can recall.  Etched with character and worldly
     experience, lit by a twinkle behind the razor-keen gaze.  Tall,
     wide shoulders, massive hands.  This guy would be more fun to fuck
     than fight.  By a lot.

                               CRUZ
                     So he was there.

                               GIN
                     Staking it out.  Why bid, when
                     you can mark the buyer, and jack
                     it within the month?

     She leans WAY back in the molded chair.  Lifts her long legs
     up onto the console.  They end in slender bare feet.  The toes
     wriggle.

                               GIN
                     At this moment, he is winging on
                     JAL flight 307 to Narita, ostensibly
                     to attend a prestigious auction at
                     the Hotel Akura, which will include
                     a mixed media collage/oil by Georges
                     Braques, on which he supposedly has
                     his eye.

                               CRUZ
                     But you know better.

                               GIN
                     Bet your ass.  At Vegas odds.

     Touches the panel.  The big screen now holds three faces, three
     names.

                               GIN (O.S.)
                     Research reveals three known fences,
                     still at large, who are believed
                     to have brokered Vermeers to black
                     market buyers.  Sandrine Palmer is
                     hospitalized in Malta with ovarian
                     cancer.

     One face and name disappears.  Two remain.  KOICHI NARUHITO.
     HIROYUKI YAMAJI.

                               GIN
                     The other two.  Live in Tokyo.

     A tiny, dry, adorable, shrug.  Which says, bingo.

                               CRUZ
                     And you did all this since 4:30
                     this morning.

     Grinning small at each other.  She can't help that hers is hot.
     She never can.

                               CRUZ (murmur)
                     Plus.  You were polite to a
                     stranger.

     One of those moments when his attraction to her is too obvious to
     ignore.  Best to defuse by pretending it's a joke...

                               GIN (soft and playful)
                     Sounds like you're sorry you're
                     already a friend.

     Said as banter between pals.  Which doesn't make her wrong.

     INT. HOTEL OKURA, TOKYO - NIGHT

     Auction in progress in the huge traditional LOBBY, where bonsai
     trees, paper lanterns and elaborate painted screens counterpoint
     the sleek, international, big-money crowd.  Everyone milling,
     drinking, schmoozing, networking in a babble of languages, as up
     on the raised platform...

     ...the AUCTIONEER has a new piece on the block, a 6th Century
     temple scroll, from the Asuka period.  It is exquisite, and bidding
     seems to be big time, from the rapidly escalating numbers on the
     overhead DIGITAL DISPLAY, which reveals bidding status in thirty
     currencies simultaneously. As we PAN the hall, we see...

     ...all non-Asians either wearing headphones, or acompanied by
     personal translators at their elbow, to follow the rapid-fire
     auctioneer.

     Except one.

     ANDREW MacDOUGAL stands alone in black tie.  Tall and rugged and
     polished and focused, and, well, pretty gorgeous.  He is bidding on
     the scroll, indicated only by subtle gestures with his program and
     the repeated finger-stabs of the auctioneer in our direction.

                               WOMAN'S VOICE (O.S., subtitled Japanese)
                     Don't do it.

     PULL BACK slightly to reveal Gin, who has stepped to his shoulder.
     She is barely recognizable to us in her satiny slip of a pale
     golden gown that drapes her frame perfectly.  Breathtaking would
     be an insult.

     MacDougal doesn't turn, doesn't seem to even hear her.  Just raises
     his program to up the bid.

                               GIN (softly, subtitled Japanese)
                     You're already over value.  By
                     15 percent.

     And now he turns.  Straight to her eyes.  This is NOT an admiring
     glance at seeing the loveliest woman in the Northern Hemisphere.
     It is a look that says, in the most understated terms, shut up or
     I'll kill you.  She shuts up.

     His glance goes to his obvious bidding RIVAL, a rather butch
     middle-aged Chinese woman in an embroidered version of a Mao suit.
     She indicates her bid by gesturing with a tiny Yorkshire Terrier,
     whom she holds in her stubby hands.  MacDougal raises back.

                               GIN (subtitled Japanese)
                     Will you stop being stubborn
                     for one sec...

     And stops.  Because he has turned.  With the eyes of a lion.  Being
     pulled from an antelope carcass.

                               MAC (quietly, subtitled Japanese)
                     I have a question.

     Rich Scottish voice.  Impeccable Japanese intonation.

                               GIN (brightly, subtitled Japanese)
                     Who the fuck am I?

                               MAC (subtitled Japanese)
                     That is of no interest.

     Oh.  In spite of herself, she looks a little hurt.

                               GIN (subtitled Japanese)
                     What, then?

                               MAC (subtitled Japanese)
                     Why.  Are we speaking.  Japanese?

     Her eyes move across his formidable face.

                              GIN
                     Uh.  I'm showing off.

     His eyes scan the length of her gown.  Her body.

                               MAC
                     Something of a habit?

     She is minus a comeback.

                               MAC
                     You know the alleged value of this
                     piece from some fucking computer,
                     which has no clue of the price I
                     can turn the scroll around for in
                     30 minutes.

     A beat.

                               GIN
                     No, you can't.

     He blinks.  No?

                               GIN (really sorry)
                     It's sold.

     His great head WHIPS around to see Madame Mao KISSING her pooch,
     flushed with victory.  He stares for a long moment, a veneer of
     philosophical almost masking his rage.  When he turns back...

                               MAC
                     Are you a confederate of my
                     adversaries?  Or are you just
                     stupid.

     And walks.  Away.

     HOLD on her.  Feeling like both.

     EXT. HOTEL OKURA - NIGHT

     Mac among the guests awaiting their cars, standing slightly apart.
     From behind him...

     ...a feminine throat clears.  Nervously.  He closes his eyes for a
     beat.  Then, turns.

                               GIN (softly)
                     How about.  If I try humility.

     And presents a business card to him with both hands, Japanese-
     style.  Mac looks in her eyes.  Takes the card with both hands.
     Reads...

                               MAC
                     Virginia Romay...

                               GIN
                     Gin, actually, Gin Romay.  I
                     was named after a card game.

                               MAC
                     Or a cheap cocktail.

     She blinks.  His brows raise...

                               MAC (softly)
                     As in.  I'll have a Gin Romay,
                     please.  With a twist.

     That laser, unsmiling stare.  Beyond sexy.  She gets lost in it for
     a beat.

                               GIN
                     You're supposed to be charming.

                               MAC
                     I'm supposed to be selective.

     Glances back to her card.  Reads...

                               MAC
                     Art and Antiquities Acquisition
                     Advisor, how alliterative...

     Looks up.  Still no smile.

                               MAC
                     And am I the antiquity?

                               GIN
                     In mint condition.

     She sighs.  Achingly lovely.

                               GIN
                     Look, I've studied you, I know...
                     pretty much...everything.

     Do you.

                               GIN
                     Made your first millions selling
                     scrap metal.  Then, gold mining
                     concessions, gems, art, and lately
                     strategic metals for new technologies
                     - platinum, zirconium, titanium...

                               MAC
                     You said.  Everything.

     Huh?  Oh.

                               GIN
                     The cat burglar stories?  Why
                     would anyone...with so much to
                     lose...take those kinds of risks?

     Guileless smile.

                               GIN
                     You'd have to be.  Stupid.

     A held beat.  His glance lifts beyond her shoulder.

                               MAC
                     Excuse me.

     And walks off toward a sleek custom TOURING CAR just pulling up.
     She goes after him.

                               GIN
                     I didn't know Porsche made
                     things like this.

                               MAC
                     Well, they don't...

     Tipping the valet.  Sliding in...

                               MAC
                     ...as a rule.

     Shutting the door.  Through the open window, she hands something
     from her bag.  A plastic rectangle which OPENS into a slide viewer.
     She presses the light ON.  He looks at the slide.

                               GIN
                     Recognize that?

     No reaction.

                               GIN
                     My seller is in Shinjuku, we can
                     go there tonight.

     She leans closer.

                               GIN
                     He wants 4.6 million.  I can
                     get it for three.

     He hands it back.  Looks in her eyes.

                               MAC
                     No, you can't.

     And TAKES OFF.  Her jaw drops slightly, but in one fluid motion...

     She's hailed a cab.

     INT. IMPERIAL HOTEL BAR - LATER

     Graceful, timeless room, designed by Frank Lloyd Wright in the
     '20s.  Burnished.  Elegant.  Way cool.  A place to drink, to deal,
     to dream.  PAN down the polished surface of the bartop, til we
     come to...

     ...a tropical DRINK.  Cute little umbrella, tilted back toward the
     room.  ROTATE ANGLE to see...

     ...INSIDE the umbrella, something small, something mechanical.  A
     woman's HAND ADJUSTS the point of the umbrella ever so slightly,
     and we PAN UP her arm to see...

     ...Gin.  Still in her gown.  She is reading, with half-glasses, and
     one of the bows curls around her ear, which we CLOSE on to hear...

     ...static.  Gin adjusts the drink umbrella, which is a directional
     mike, and hears...

                               MAC (O.S.)
                     ...only it's not bloody football!

     SNAP to Mac's table, well across the room.  Drinking giant beers
     with a large, really fat Japanese guy in a costly; if wrinkled,
     suit.  The hulk listens with stone attention to Mac's rant, as if
     he actually gave a shit.

                               MAC (O.S.)
                     ...it's just that crap Americans
                     call 'football', like you could
                     call your ass a butterscotch scone
                     and have it be one!

     The guy nods seriously.  Maybe he's a Sumo dude.

                               MAC
                     Why you'd want to bring that
                     foolishness to Japan, you're
                     just pissing your investment
                     down a bungee hole.

                               SUMO GUY (major accent)
                     You got Cubano this trip?

     That he does.  Mac pulls out a leather cigar holder, and passes it
     over.  Flat against one side is an ENVELOPE, which Sumo Guy PALMS
     skillfully, slipping it seamlessly INTO his pocket as he withdraws
     a small MATCH BOX.  Takes out one long cigar, lights up...

                               MAC
                     Seriously, put the money into
                     pharmaceuticals or prostitution,
                     something stable.

     The big guy pushes the cigar holder and match box back toward Mac.
     Opening the box, Mac sees one match and a small MICROCHIP fastened
     to the cardboard.  Lights up.  Slides the match box in his pocket.

                               MAC
                     Garbage, perhaps.  Or industrial
                     plastics.

     ANGLE...Gin still engrossed in her reading.  A figure leans down
     next to her.  She startles, slightly.  So surprised to see...

                               MAC
                     My favorite thing in life.
                     Coincidence.

     She gives him the great smile.

                               GIN
                     I'm staying here, what's your
                     excuse?

     And now he smiles.  First time ever.  A little chilling, the way he
     does it.

                               MAC
                     Staying here, as well.  You
                     are in room...?

                               GIN (half a beat)
                     One thirty-eight.

     In one motion, he flags the bartender...

                               MAC
                     Will you send a half-bottle of
                     Chateau d'Yquem '67 to Room 138,
                     please?  And some berries and
                     chocolates for the lady to enjoy
                     it with.

     He presses some currency into the barkeep's hand.  Turning back...

                               MAC
                     Actually, I was just across the
                     room, dickering with a gentleman
                     over the purchase of an interesting
                     Spitzweg.  Until I determined the
                     painting was apparently stolen...

     Oh.   She's shocked.  He agrees...

                               MAC
                     Goes against my grain.  The
                     DeKooning in your slide, the 4.6
                     million you can get for 3.  Can
                     you get it for 2 and a half?

     She looks in his eyes.

                               GIN
                     Sure.

     And as if he believed her...

                               MAC
                     My checkbook is in my safe.  You
                     wait here.

     His smile evaporates.  He is gone before she can say...

                               GIN
                     Okay.  I'll wait here.

     INT. CAR, SHINJUKU DISTRICT - NIGHT

     Mac driving in silence.  Gin stealing glances at him.  Suddenly and
     smoothly, he reaches down, and picks up...

                               GIN
                     That's my purse.

     He opens it.  One eye on the road, he begins to rummage...

                               MAC
                     Just want to see if I'm with the
                     person you say you are.  Can't be
                     too caref...

     She SNATCHES the bag away from him, he GRABS it back, the car
     SWERVES LEFT, and...

     ...CRASHES VIOLENTLY into a parked pure white Bentley.  Metal
     BUCKLES and TEARS, both ALARMS go OFF, a cacophony of horrific
     NOISE.

                               MAC (quietly)
                     Oh, dear.

     People come RUNNING, but our focus is drawn to the refined elderly
     COUPLE who were just returning to their precious Bentley.  Their
     WAILS and ANGUISH would be suitable if all their grandchildren had
     been crushed beneath Mac's wheels.

     Mac and Gin are OUT of the car.  As he exits, Mac has palmed a
     small BLADE, and in a quick unseen motion, RIPPED a jagged tear
     in his left trouser leg.  The old couple RUSH to Mac, SHRIEKING
     their rage and grief in Japanese, Gin is trying to calm them as
     bystanders gather, but Mac cuts through...

                               MAC (subtitled Japanese)
                     We'll go in there, and call
                     the police.

     And HOBBLES off toward the nearest building, a block-square
     30-story skyscraper bearing the name FUJITSU.  The couple, the
     crowd, all race after the limping Mac...

                               GIN
                     Are you all right?

     No answer, he looks dark enough to rain.  INTO the public lobby of
     the huge industrial complex.  Two night GUARDS come hurrying from
     their desk, as the small mob POURS in.  Mac in the lead, a
     commanding presence, tells the guards in a loud, clear voice...

                               MAC (subtitled Japanese)
                     I have damaged the car of these
                     kind people.  Please help them
                     call the police...

     One guard leads the hysterical couple toward a phone.  Mac pulls up
     his trouser leg, and Gin GASPS to see a bloody GASH.  Mac drops the
     trouser back over the wound.  Asks the remaining guard...

                               MAC (subtitled Japanese)
                     May I use a washroom, please.

     The guard nods absently, disoriented by the chaos.  Mac hands his
     billfold to Gin...

                               MAC
                     These are my papers, passport, car
                     registration.  If the police arri...

                               GIN
                     You're going to need stitches,
                     let me get you to a hospital.

     Soft words, genuine concern.  And his eyes flicker.  As if somehow
     seeing her for the first time.  A small spark, but she feels it.
     Softer still...

                               GIN
                     Really, this can all wait.
                     I'll handle it.

     The look holds.

                               MAC
                     That's actually.  Very sweet.

     His first real smile.  It was worth waiting for.

                               MAC (to a guard, subtitled Japanese)
                     Might you have a First Aid kit,
                     of some kind?

     INT. TOILET STALL

     We are inside an empty, closed, Japanese-style toilet stall.
     Porcelain foot rests.  A hole.  The door BURSTS OPEN, and...

     ...Mac enters FAST with the First Aid kit, locking the door,
     hitting the STOPWATCH on his wrist, which begins counting at
     ZERO.  He pulls UP his trouser leg, revealing the bloody gash,
     and simply...

     ...RIPS the entire wound OFF, the rubbery prosthetic wound DANGLES,
     dripping its phony blood.  Mac pulls gauze strips from the kit,
     SOAKS them in bogus gore, expertly WRAPS his leg, then FLUSHES the
     prosthetic DOWN the hole.

     He pulls off the FUJITSU VISITOR badge clipped to his lapel, and
     from a Ziploc bag slides a small sheet of plastic, which he PRESSES
     to the face of the badge, fitting perfectly, turning the badge
     into...

     ...an EMPLOYEE I.D., the name KAWAKUBO, M., the PHOTO of a surly
     Japanese male.  Quickly, Mac takes out the MATCH BOX from the hotel
     bar, and with a fine tweezers gently removes the MICROCHIP, placing
     it INSIDE the badge, activating it with a soft BEEP-BEEP.  He
     reaches now...

     ...behind his back, up UNDER his tux jacket, and RIPS FREE a
     tightly-compressed PACK of what seems white paper or cloth.  He
     SNAPS it loose, revealing it to be...

     ...a baggy CLEAN SUIT, not unlike hospital scrubs and falling to
     the floor...

     ...a white HOOD.  With opaque tinted VISOR.

     INT. SECURITY CORRIDOR

     Mac in his clean suit and opaque-visored hood at an elevator marked
     CLEARED PERSONNEL ONLY in English and Kanji (Japanese characters).
     He holds his badge to the SCANNER, the door PINGS and slides OPEN..

     INT. PREP ROOM ENTRANCE, 29TH FLOOR

     Mac emerging from his elevator at the entrance to an AIR-LOCK with
     sign CLEAN ROOM - CLASS 10.  Holds his badge to the SCANNER, the
     air-lock door lights FLASH froin red to yellow to green.  He
     enters...

     ...the PREP ROOM.  Recorded VOICES purr safety instructions in
     Japanese, while Mac stands, being bombarded by air shower, chemical
     sprayer, blinding UV light.  The next air-lock OPENS.  He enters...

     INT. CLEAN ROOM

     ...a long ASSEMBLY LINE, where ROBOT ARMS work on a stream of black
     SILICON WAFERS, which pass along a clear Lexan CONVEYOR BELT.  The
     wafers move through various airtight CHAMBERS, exposing them to
     multi-colored gasses, cyan, sodium yellow, magenta, etc., as part
     of the microchip manufacturing process.

     More than a dozen TECHNICIANS in their hooded clean suits watch
     over every phase of the work, attached to the walls by grounding
     wires and air hoses, which create a deafening NOISE.  Mac simply
     hooks himself up, and saunters straight THROUGH the area, toward
     the place where the conveyor belt with its newly-processed
     MICROCHIPS...

     ...DISAPPEARS through the wall.  Nearby, a HATCH is built into the
     same wall, and Mac calmly CLANKS it OPEN, squeezing through into...

     ...a dimly-lit MAINTENANCE BAY.  Panels of switches, wires, fuses,
     fans, air cleaners.  Maximum claustrophobia, as Mac CLANGS the
     hatch SHUT behind him, looking instantly to...

     ...an OVERHEAD HATCH with letters in Kanji and English, DANGER
     ARGON GAS.  Mac THROWS back his hood, YANKS out his mini oxygen
     pouch, fits the slender forked breathing tube into his nostrils,
     and slips on thick round infrared GOGGLES that make him look like a
     refugee from 12 MONKEYS.  No time to lose...

     ...up THROUGH the overhead hatch, closing it behind him as he
     enters...

     ...the conveyer TUBE, a horizontal Lexan cylinder three feet in
     diameter, filled with billowing red gas.  Mac stretches out on his
     belly, glancing up to where the clear conveyor belt, with its
     precious cargo of microchips, runs along just above his head in
     eerie red light.  He begins to...

     ...shimmy, crawl, squirm along the length of the tube.  Gas too
     thick to see the end.  He is agile as a commando, hauling ass, when
     suddenly...

     ...the floor beneath his tube FALLS AWAY, and he is crawling in
     space 29 stories above Tokyo, as his tube spans the distance
     between manufacturing and shipping structures.  He goes faster,
     HARDER...

     INT. MICROCHIP VAULT

     A black chamber.  We can scarcely make out the endless rows of
     shelving, the air purifying equipment, the conveyor belt entering
     through its air lock, as machinery folds each priceless microchip
     in foil wrappers, stacks them on shelves.  Through the gasket...

     ...Mac TUMBLES into view, swinging himself neatly DOWN to the
     floor, and in a single motion, he is already FLASHING a neon-green
     pen light along the shelves of microchips.  We see now the wrappers
     are different colors, with different Kanji characters, and Mac is
     definitely looking for something special, until...

     ...he's found it.  A single row, 35 chips, nothing special from
     here, but Mac...

     ...WHIPS out something coiled, SNAPS it to full length, revealing a
     strip of shiny black SATIN CLOTH.  Three feet long, little more
     than an inch wide.  Carefully, Mac lays the strip down directly
     OVER the row of microchips.  And when he lifts it UP again...

     ...the chips have ADHERED to the underside of the cloth.  In one
     deft SNAP of his wrist, he COILS the cloth again, like a yo-yo.
     Turns to leave, and...

     Oh, yeh.

     Tosses a small SACK of something where the chips used to be.  TIM'S
     CASCADE BRAND POTATO CHIPS.  SEA SALT AND VINEGAR FLAVOR.

     INT. CLEAN ROOM

     Mac exiting from the maintenance hatch back into the Clean Room.
     No one sees, no one cares.  Hooking up once again, he ambles toward
     a door clearly marked EXIT ONLY TO EMPLOYEE LOUNGE - RETURN ONLY
     THROUGH SECURITY AREA.

     By the door is an employee notice tacked to the wall.  He pretends
     to scan it.  A stack of flyers.  He takes one.  Exiting into...

     INT. EMPLOYEE LOUNGE

     Past a changing area, vending machines, guys bullshitting.  Mac
     just strolling along, reading his flyer, as...

     A hand.  Touches his shoulder

                               VOICE (subtitled Japanese)
                     Excuse me.

     Mac turns, stares through his opaque VISOR at a well-built SECURITY
     OFFICER.  Dead straight eyes.

                               OFFICER (subtitled Japanese)
                     The company picnic.  Saturday or
                     Sunday?

     His eyes cut to the flyer Mac is 'reading'.  Mac hands it to him,
     and without a trace of Scottish accent...

                               MAC (subtitled Japanese)
                     Better eat first.

     INT. GUEST LOBBY

     Gin is up to her ears in grief.  There are no less than five COPS
     grilling her, taking notes, while the old couple has their second
     wind and are SHRIEKING in top form.  The bystander gallery has
     grown to maybe three dozen, and they're all getting their word in.
     As Gin struggles to cope...

     ...she keeps looking at the clock.  Darting glances toward the
     corridor.  She is freaking out.

     Finally.  She can't stand it.  Hands Mac's billfold to one of the
     cops, pushes her way through the mob, and...

     ...TAKES OFF down the corridor, a security guard in belated
     pursuit, we go...

     ...WITH her DOWN the hallway, WHEEL around a corner, flat-out
     SPRINTING, SKIDS to a stop at the right doorway and BURSTS INTO...

     INT. MEN'S ROOM

     An empty washroom.  She listens.  Nothing.

                               GIN
                     Mr. MacDougal?  Sir?

     No sound.  Uh-oh.

                               GIN
                     Uh.  Mr. Ma...

                               MAC (O.S., from the stall)
                     Just 'Mac'.  And whatever became
                     of a gentleman's privacy?

     The security guard BARGES IN.

                               MAC (O.S.)
                     My God, more females?

     The guard starts railing at Gin a mile a minute.  She calmly takes
     a WAD of bills from her purse.  Hands them to the guy...

                               GIN (subtitled Japanese)
                     Stand outside.  That door.  Two
                     minutes...

     He does.  Alone again.

                               GIN
                     I was worried, it's been twenty...

                               MAC (O.S.)
                     Eighteen, actually.  The leg is
                     fine, but I got sort of...woozy.

                               GIN
                     Woozy.

                               MAC (O.S.)
                     Lost my stomach once or twice.

     CUT INSIDE the stall.  He is just re-taping the folded clean suit
     and hood to the small of his back.

                               MAC
                     I'm an old man.  You probably
                     noticed.

     Awkward silence.  He smiles at that, much amused.  Slips on his
     jacket.

                               MAC
                     You should see me without
                     my teeth.

     UNLOCKS the door.  Remembers...

                               MAC
                     Ah.  Mustn't forget to zip up.

     That's not what he forgot.  He pulls OUT the coiled black satin
     cloth strip, SNAPS it free, microchips snug to the underside.  And
     fits it neatly...

     ...DOWN his trouser leg.  The perfect tuxedo stripe.

     OUT the door.  To meet her gaze.

                               MAC
                     Odd place, this.

     He goes to her.  Offers his arm.

                               MAC
                     What do you suppose they make
                     here?  Video recorders?

     She takes it, wrapping both hers through.

                               GIN
                     Microchips, I think, for computers.

     He opens the door.  Ushers her through...

                               MAC
                     Bad investment.  The best ones
                     are here today...

     Follows her out...

                               MAC (O.S.)
                     Gone tomor...

     Closed door.  Quiet.

     INT. CAB, NIHONBASHI DISTRICT - NIGHT

     They sit together in the rear of the taxi, as it makes its way
     through late night traffic.  She is looking around.

                               GIN
                     This isn't the way to my sel...

                               MAC (quietly)
                     I've changed my mind.

     Looking straight ahead.  Contemplative.  She stares at his
     profile...

                               GIN
                     Mind telling me why?

                               MAC
                     You can't get it for me at 2.5,
                     can you?

                               GIN
                     Well, we can tr...

                               MAC
                     You were setting me up.  The correct
                     price is 2.8.  You conspire with the
                     seller to start at 4.6, so I'll be
                     grateful when you 'bargain' him down
                     to three.  Close enough to fool some
                     people.  unfortunately...

     He sighs.  Never looks at her.

                               MAC
                     I'm old.  I know what everything
                     is worth.

     She keeps staring.

                               GIN
                     So where are we g...

                               MAC
                     I am going to the airport.  You
                     are going on to the rest of your
                     life.  Which...

     He thinks.  Admits...

                               MAC
                     ...should be interesting.

     Her turn to think.

                               GIN
                     You forgot your lugg...

                               MAC
                     The hotels deal with that.  The
                     things I need are always waiting
                     at the next one.
                               (afterthought)
                     I don't carry.  Baggage.

     Little twist on that.

                               GIN
                     Sensible.  And you're off to...?

                               MAC
                     Oh, that's highly personal.

     He still stares straight ahead.  The taxi pulls onto a freeway.
     Toward Narita Airport.  Time running out.  And in her dearest, most
     vulnerable, voice...

                               GIN
                     I did so hope to impress you.

     She puts the fingertips of her left hand.  On his chest.  A
     silence.  No reaction.

                               GIN (hopeful)
                     I'm still hoping...

     And he smiles.  Turns to her eyes.

                               MAC
                     Young lady.  I am old enough to
                     be your grandfather.

     She shakes her head.  Uh-uh.

                               GIN (soft)
                     My father.

     Leans her mouth in for the kill.

                               GIN (whisper)
                     That's part of the rush.

     And softly.  Fits her mouth to his.  The green eyes close, as
     she tastes him.  Nothing predatory in this kiss.  It is tender,
     exquisite.  A kiss of deep longing.  Of true love.

     His arms slip around her.  And in less than five seconds...

                               TAXI DRIVER (O.S., racist accent)
                     Still on fo' airport?

     Nobody.  Says.  Nothin'.

     INT. MAC'S SUITE - LATE NIGHT

     A small bottle.  An ornate label.  Chateau d'Yquem '67.  Gin lifts
     it from the table, studies the label.  She wears only a man's
     oversized t-shirt.  Our rotating ANGLE reveals the empty bed,
     tangled sheets.  Gin looks pretty rumpled herself.

     She lifts the bottle, two glasses, a plateful of chocolates and
     strawberries, and goes to the sliding glass door overlooking...

     ...the TERRACE.  Mac sits on a futon at the balcony railing,
     overlooking downtown Tokyo.  He wears a thin Japanese robe called
     a yukata, and is wrapped in half of a huge down COVERLET from the
     bed.  The other half obviously waiting for...

                               GIN
                     Here.  A reward.

     She curls down into the billowing coverlet, just against his body.
     Sets her things beside him.

                               MAC
                     A reward for what?

                               GIN
                     For not being old.  After all.

     It is a lovely smile.  He studies it for a beat.

                               MAC
                     You mean.  Not as old as I look.

     She traces her finger along his cheek.

                               GIN (a whisper)
                     Yeh.

     And kisses him.  It takes awhile.  She seems to enjoy it.  With
     him, it's harder to tell.  When she pulls back...

     ...he picks up a chocolate.  Tears it in half.  Offers her the
     larger piece.

                               GIN
                     Do I deserve a reward?

     No answer.  He puts the chocolate into her mouth.  With great
     tenderness, he traces the line of her lower lip.  As she swallows.

                               GIN
                     It's so hard to find good casual
                     sex, anymore.  I'm probably out
                     of practice.

     But he just looks at her.

                               MAC
                     What's hard to find.  Is someone
                     you truly want to be with.

     And leans closer.  Just above a whisper...

                               MAC
                     Even for awhile.

     He kisses her.  Beautiful and deep, the way he does it.  And
     when he pulls back, she is staring at him.  As if at a loss for
     something to say.

                               GIN
                     It's lucky we stopped by my room,
                     for the wine.

     She swallows.  Because his gaze is unrelenting. As if not
     forgetting that she's changed the subject.

                               GIN
                     Otherwise, we'd never have found
                     my bag was stolen.  Until tomorrow.

                               MAC
                     Would that make it more stolen?

     She smiles.  His face looks kind now, not formidable at all.  Maybe
     she's wondering if she actually likes him.

                               GIN
                     They even got my prescriptions.

                               MAC
                     Something you need? There are
                     all-night chemists...

     He does look concerned.  And therefore sweet.  She kisses his nose.

                               GIN
                     I take Prilosec.  For stomach
                     acid.  And an inhaler.  For asthma.

     She gets her old smile.  The soft, wicked tease.

                               GIN
                     But since I didn't have to work
                     all that hard tonight...

     He stares at her.  Cocks a finger, like a gun, right between her
     eyes.  Pantomimes pulling the trigger.

                               GIN (softly)
                     Ouch.  I had that coming.

     She pivots, and snuggles her back comfortably into his chest.  He
     wraps strong arms around her.  Pulling her close.

                               GIN
                     Why would someone steal my luggage?
                     Every guest in this place must
                     have more than a wannabe art dealer.

                               MAC
                     Ah.  Maybe the thief thought you
                     had something valuable in there.

     Something in the tone.

                               GIN
                     Such as...

                               MAC
                     Well.  Wannabe dealers make
                     excellent fences.

     A flicker.  In her eyes.  And she cuddles back.  As if enjoying the
     humor.

                               GIN
                     He thought I had a stolen
                     painting.  In my bag.

                               MAC
                     I'm joking, of course.

     Kisses the top of her head.

                               MAC
                     The Vermeer wouldn't fit.

     Her eyes widen.  Just a little.

                               GIN
                     Excuse me?

                               MAC
                     Why, did you do something wrong?

     She turns all the way around.  Their faces are inches apart.  Each
     reading the other's eyes.

                               GIN
                     You said.  Vermeer.

                               MAC
                     The most famous painting stolen
                     this week.

     His turn.  To kiss her nose.

                               MAC
                     If you don't keep up on your
                     craft.  You'll miss all the jokes.

     And lowers her gently onto her back.  Still staring in her eyes, he
     winds her legs around him.  Her mouth parts, but...

     ...he fills it with his own.

     This conversation.  Is over.

     INT. MAC'S SUITE - MORNING

     VIEW of the empty terrace, the rumpled, twisted coverlet.  Maybe
     they spent all night.  HEAR the shower running full blast in a
     distant bathroom.  PULL BACK to see...

     Gin, hair wet, wrapped in a plush hotel robe, rapidly and expertly
     going through dresser, night stand, closet, sofa cushions, every
     goddam thing in the room.  She comes to...

     ...Mac's tux.  The jacket, rifles the pockets, pats the lining.
     The pants now...

     ...something peculiar. The right leg has no stripe. Touches the
     cloth.  Slightly sticky where the stripe should be.  Odd.

     ANGLE...the bathroom.  Shower running full BLAST.  But there's no
     one in it.

     ANGLE...a storage closet.  Mac crouching in the smallspace.  We
     see the travel bag.  The luggage tag, VIRGINIA ROMAY, a Darien,
     Connecticut address.  The embossed initials VR.  But there is
     something else in Mac's hand...

     ...a prescription bottle.  Prilosec.  And a name, GINGER BAKER.
     Chicago address.  Mac puts the pills in the pocket of his robe...

     ...exits the closet.  Locks the door.

     ANGLE...Mac ambling into the bedroom, toweling his hair with one
     hand.  Holding his billfold in the other.  Gin is starting a room
     service breakfast.  Eggs, sausage, Belgian waffles.  The girl can
     eat.

                               MAC
                     I'm so glad I didn't leave Tokyo.

     She looks up.  Trademark dry grin...

                               GIN
                     I love a guy who knows how to
                     sweet talk.

     He stands over her.  Smiling.  What he meant was...

                               MAC
                     There was a call.  While you
                     were sleeping.

     A call.

                               MAC
                     An art dealer I know.  He has a
                     Monet.  Minor, but it is Giverny.
                     He'll let me have it for 5.3 million.

     She stares at him.

                               GIN (cautiously)
                     We can maybe beat that.

                               MAC (pulling plastic from his billfold)
                     I agree.  This is a bank debit card.
                     It gives the bearer access to an
                     account containing 4.6 and change.
                     I dislike round numbers.

     And hand. the card to her.  As her eyes move over it...

                               MAC
                     I'd like you to go down there,
                     and pick up the painting.  If
                     that's all right.

     Without looking up...

                               GIN
                     Me.

                               MAC
                     If I'm there, he'll haggle.  You
                     just hand him the debit card, with
                     that...luminous smile.  And say,
                     take it or leave it.

     Now her eyes come up.  She says nothing.  Hesitant.

                               MAC
                     Oh, dear.  I thought you so
                     wanted to make a good impression.

                               GIN
                     Thought I already did th...

                               MAC
                     And along with making an excellent
                     impression.  You will also make 2
                     percent of the purchase price.

     She blinks.

                               MAC
                     That's $92,000.  And change..
                     For two hours work.

     The look holds.  He goes to the desk.  Lifts a cellular phone.
     TOSSES it to her.

                               MAC
                     Any problems.  Just give me
                     a ring.

                               GIN
                     Stolen painting is it?

                               MAC
                     Of course not.

     And on his way out the door...

                               MAC
                     If it was.  I wouldn't pay more
                     than three.

     EXT. WHARF, YOKOHAMA - DAY

     Gin climbing out of a taxi at a scruffy section of Yokohama's Bund.
     Sleazy shops, pachinko parlors, hostess bars, sidewalk noodle
     counters, all built along a tall rickety PIER nearly thirty feet
     above the pounding surf.  The harbor is gigantic.  Every type and
     size of vessel imaginable.

     Gin carries a long neoprene-covered tube with watertight seals and
     a lightweight bright orange foam cover.  She looks at her slip of
     paper.  Then across at the place...KENDO SOUVENIRS, a schlock
     kickback parlor, with a tourist bus parked out front.

     This can't be right.  Pulls out the cellular phone.  Dials.

                               MAC'S RECORDED VOICE (O.S.)
                     You have reached the voice-mail
                     of AMD Investments.  And, yes,
                     you are at the right place.

     Fucking great.

                               GIN (into phone, pissed)
                     I like men with a sense of humor.
                     This does not qualify.

     SNAPS the phone shut.  Checks the slip again.  Walks firmly across
     the street, through the mobs of tourists, and into...

     INT. KENDO SOUVENIRS - DAY

     The place is huge, ramshackle, loaded with every piece of tourist
     crap imaginable.  The only paintings on display are renderings of
     big cats on black velvet.  She winds her way through, to a counter
     at the back.  One guy there...

                               GIN (subtitled Japanese)
                     May I please speak with Mr. Okati.

                               OKATI
                     You doin' it.

     The best we can say for the pudgy, balding fellow in the Hawaiian
     shirt and spectacularly baggy trousers, is that he does not seem to
     be the guy who is selling you a Monet.  Even a minor one.

                               GIN
                     I think there's some mista...

                              OKATI
                     You from Mac?

     She stops.  Jesus.  The guy COUGHS horribly.

                               GIN
                     I'm from Mac.

                               OKATI
                     Lemme see card.

     She hesitates.

                               OKATI
                     Four million, six hundred
                     thirteen thousand, five hundred?

     Wow.  He slaps his hand on the table.  Lay it down, toots.

                               GIN
                     You first.

     He shrugs.  Lifts straight up, from beneath the counter...

     ...a brown paper-wrapped rectangle.  Not much larger than two feet
     square.  She can't even believe she's here, doing this.  Gestures
     to him.  Open it up!

     He obliges, COUGHING grossly all the while.  Unwrapped, the
     painting does look like a Monet.  From here.  She stares at it.

                               GIN
                     Now bring me the real one.

     He doesn't blink.

                               OKATI
                     This as real as it gets, lady.

     And from within her pocket.  The cellular RINGS.  She takes it
     out.  Puts it to her ear.

                               MAC (O.S.)
                     You got it?

                               GIN (into phone)
                     Is this an audition, a joke, or
                     a rip-off?  I'm staring at an
                     obvious forgery, here.

                               MAC (O.S.)
                     Turn it over.

     This gives her pause.  Then, cradling the phone against her
     shoulder, she does as she's told.  To see...

                               MAC (O.S.)
                     Is there an envelope?  Taped to
                     the back?  In a Ziploc bag?

     Sure is.

                               GIN (into phone)
                     Uh-huh.

                               MAC (O.S.)
                     Detach the bag.  Read what's
                     in it.  Aloud.

     She does.  Carefully unfolding several sheets of paper, maps...

                               GIN (reading into phone)
                     Shikoku Naru, a freighter, it
                     says, Yokohama to Jakarta...dates,
                     statistics...specs on some kind of
                     machine, diag...

                               MAC (O.S.)
                     Papers back in the envelope,
                     envelope back in the Ziploc, very
                     quickly, without seeming to hurry...

     Her eyes are flickering questions, but she does as she's told,
     cradling the phone with her shoulder.

                               MAC (O.S.)
                     Now take the debit card from your
                     purse, slipping the Ziploc into the
                     purse as you do it, shielding the move
                     from everyone in the room but Okati.

     And she does.  More deftly than we could ever have imagined.  Like
     a pro.

                               MAC (O.S., quietly)
                     Give him the card.

     A beat.

                               GIN (into phone)
                     Mac, the painting's a forg...

                               MAC (O.S., even quieter)
                     This is a test.  Of whether you'll
                     still be alive four minutes from
                     now.  Do you hear me?

     Her face freezes.  In a pleasant smile.

                               GIN (into phone)
                     Yes, Mac, I do.

                               MAC (0.5.)
                     Now.  Hand him the card, and tell
                     him in Japanese to pretend he is
                     checking it by phone.  Tell him to
                     take awhile, as if he's on hold.

     She turns the sweet plastic smile to Okati.  Hands him the card...

                               GIN (subtitled Japanese)
                     Mac says, pretend you're checking
                     this by phone, and take your ti...

                               OKATI (subtitled Japanese)
                     ...like I'm on hold, sure.

     And suddenly, his eyes are keen and quick, and he is no longer some
     schmuck in baggy pants.  He takes the card, stares at it comically,
     picks up the phone.

                               MAC (O.S.)
                     While he's checking, look around
                     the room casually, as if searching
                     for the cheesy handbags...

     She begins to.

                               MAC (O.S.)
                     All the while laughing, as if you
                     are chatting with someone you
                     actually like.

                               GIN (into phone)
                     I'm not that good.

     But she is.  And she laughs, as she strolls over to the cheesy
     handbags.

                               MAC (O.S.)
                     As you're looking around, do you
                     notice any m...

                               GIN (into phone)
                     Three guys, two together, one
                     alone.  Cheap suits, not looking
                     at me in a cop-casual way.

                               MAC (O.S.)
                     Call out cheerily to Okati, in
                     English, 'Where's the toilet?'

                               GIN (into phone)
                     Can I say, 'little girl's room'?

     A beat.

                               MAC (O.S.)
                     Wing it.

                               GIN (calls out, cheerily)
                     WHERE'S THE CRAPPER?

     Okati, absorbed by his make-believe phone call, points around the
     back.

                               MAC (O.S.)
                     Get going.  Now.

                               GIN (into phone, as she saunters)
                     Mac, the painting isn't...

                               MAC (O.S.)
                     You've got what we bought, are
                     you out of their sight?

     She turns the corner.  Filthy corridor.  Restrooms at opposite
     ends.

                               MAC (O.S.)
                     Run into the men's toilet.
                     I know you know how.

     A beat of uncertainty.  She looks both ways.

                               MAC (O.S., ominous)
                     Are you running?

     And she DOES.  SPRINTING down the garbage-strewn hallway, throws
     OPEN the men's room door, BURSTING IN on...

     ...a wispy OLD GUY taking a leak through a HOLE in the floor.

                               GIN (subtitled Japanese)
                     GET THE FUCK OUT OF HERE!

     The panicked little man STARTLES.  Bolts OUT the door.

                               MAC (O.S.)
                     Jump.

     Jump?  HEAR now, from the corridor, footfalls POUNDING.  She looks
     down through the piss hole.  The surf ROILS thirty feet below.

                               GIN (into phone)
                     It's too small.

                               MAC (O.S.)
                     The window, twit!

     Oh.  She hops OVER the disgusting hole, boosts herself UP to the
     small window, footfalls racing CLOSER, HOISTS herself HALFWAY
     through, DROPPING the phone a scary 30 feet to the surf below, as
     behind her, the door...

     ...SLAMS OPEN and she FLIES OUT the window...

                               GIN
                     SHIIIIIIIIIIT...

     WITH her in SLO-MO, kicking and flailing and grasping her shoulder
     bag, and she...

     HITS the ocean like a ton of bricks.  Disappears.  Comes up,
     sputtering in the swirling water, as from out of the shadows of
     the pilings...

     ...an engine ROARS to life, the BLUR of a custom JETSKI, Mac
     reaching to scoop the startled girl OUT of the water, and they...

     ...BLAST OFF, as bullets RAIN helplessly after them.  The AGENTS
     shouting into their cellulars, racing in frustration down the pier,
     which rapidly vanishes behind us, as...

     ...Gin hangs onto Mac for dear life.  This baby is REALLY hauling.
     He wears an orange waterproof slicker with matching trousers.
     Shouts back, against the noise...

                               MAC
                     ARE YOU PISSED OFF?

     She thinks.  Admits, shouting in his ear...

                               GIN
                     ACTUALLY.  IT'S INCREDIBLY COOL!

     He is heading into deep water, a major shipping channel, points to
     one side, and she sees...

     ...a huge HARBOR PATROL vessel FIRE UP in near distance.  The chase
     is ON.  They speed toward the WAKE of a luxury liner, and as she
     realizes...

                               GIN
                     OH NOOOOOO...

     They SLAM INTO the wake HEAD ON, and are AIRBORNE for an amazing
     distance, JOLTING back to the surface, RACING toward...

     ...two gigantic FREIGHTERS which approach each other from opposite
     directions.  The Harbor Patrol in hot pursuit, BLASTING its HORN...

                               GIN
                     WE'RE GONNA DIE, AREN'T WE?

                               MAC
                     JUST AS SOON AS I'M READY!

     As we near the outbound freighter, Mac CUTS his speed.  Now the
     Harbor Patrol is really gaining.

                               GIN
                     FASTER, NOT SLOWER, YOU TWIT!!

                               MAC
                     HAVE TO GIVE THEM A SPORTING
                     CHANCE...

     Cruising STRAIGHT TOWARD the part side of the outbound freighter,
     as the inbound freighter begins to pass it on the far side...

                               MAC
                     ...SOMETHING WE SCOTS LEARNED
                     FROM THE BRITS!

     As the Harbor Patrol is nearly ON them, Mac VEERS suddenly AROUND
     the stern of the outbound freighter, the Harbor patrol WHEELING
     madly to pursue, only to find we are both CAREENING straight AT...

     ...the starboard side of the inbound freighter, Mac CUTS his wheel
     in an adroit nearly right-angle SWERVE, and hears the SCREAMS as
     the Harbor patrol...

     PLOWS INTO the freighter!  Wasting no time, he ACCELERATES into
     maximum BURN, STREAKING toward the immensely crowded harbor and its
     thousand vessels.  Gin can't help but look back at the impressive
     crash site, mouthing a silent WOW.

     Nearing the harbor, Mac CUTS speed completely, drifting between two
     huge ships and...

     ...vanishing from sight.

     EXT. SMALL CHANNEL - DAY

     The tiny Jetski cruises in a quiet channel, crowded with vessels of
     all sizes, tugs, fishing boats, pleasure craft, junks, sampans, all
     larger than we are.  Gin clings close to Mac, although it is no
     necessary.  More like romantic.  She is still flushed with
     the rush.

                               GIN
                     I guess you're gonna explain
                     all this, huh?

     But he says nothing.  Pulls out a water-tight duffle.  Hands it
     back to her, without looking.

                               MAC
                     Dry clothes, you'll need them.
                     In five minutes.

     She takes the bag, confused.

                               GIN
                     I'm supposed to change?  Here??

                               MAC
                     I won't look.  Gentleman's word
                     of hon...

                               GIN
                     There are a million sailors!

                               MAC
                     I've seen you naked.  Give the
                     boys a thrill.

     He means it.

                               MAC
                     You probably won't be dating
                     any of them, so what the hell.

     Gin looks around as they float through the maze of watercraft.  No
     one seems to be paying much attention.  What the hell.  She unzips
     the bag, pulling out...

                               GIN (astonished)
                     These...these are mine!

     He never looks around.

                               MAC
                     Found 'em in your room.  Perhaps
                     the thief wasn't your size.

     She stares at the back of his head.  wondering.  He is stripping
     off his slickers.  A neatly-tailored SUIT beneath.

                               MAC
                     We have a business appointment.
                     In four minutes.

     Okay.  She pulls her dress off OVER her head.

                               GIN
                     Business, huh?

     She ignores some nearby WHISTLES and SHOUTS.  Begins drying herself
     with a fluffy towel from the bag.

                               MAC (never turns)
                     Time has come to tell you.  What
                     business.  I'm actually in.

     Uh-oh.  Paydirt.

                               GIN
                     Uh.  Am I gonna like th...

                               MAC (quietly)
                     I'm a thief.

     She can scarcely believe he's admitting this.

                               MAC
                     And now that I've told you.
                     I'll have to kill you.

     He chuckles a Scottish chuckle.  Cold and warm, at once.

                               MAC
                     Or...

     She slips the dry dress OVER her head.

                               MAC
                     ...you can spend the most
                     interesting three weeks of
                     your life.  Training.

                               GIN
                     Training for wha...

                               MAC
                     ...followed by the most exciting
                     night of your life.  After which,
                     you can walk away with 20 million
                     untraceable dollars...

     She blinks.  He means this.

                               MAC
                     ...which will come in handy.
                     Things being what they are.

     He shrugs.

                               MAC
                     From now on.  You can valet park.

     She begins taking off her wet underwear, underneath the dress.  We
     suspect unseen hordes crestfallen at her modesty.

                               GIN
                     And if I refuse?

                               MAC (very quietly)
                     Don't.  Please.

                               GIN
                     I mean, you won't really kill
                     me, I'm far too adorable.

     He looks around at her.  As if deciding on that.

                               MAC
                     Last night, at Fujitsu, I did
                     some business.  While you thought
                     I was in the toilet.

     Jesus.

                               GIN
                     What could you possibly steal
                     in 18 min...

                               MAC
                     Thirty-five super-microchips.
                     Each worth one million dollars.
                     And change.

     Staring dead at her eyes.

                               GIN
                     You hate round num...

                               MAC
                     I stole your suitcase when I
                     left you at the bar.  I have
                     since sent it on to the States,
                     with three chips, well hidden.

     Are you following?

                               MAC
                     Since you aren't there to claim
                     it, the bag will sit at Customs.
                     Safe.  Unless...

     No smile.  No smile at all.

                               MAC
                     They receive.  An anonymous.  Tip.

     Holy.  Fucking.  Christ.

                               GIN
                     That's entrapment.

                               MAC
                     No, entrapment is what cops do
                     to robbers.

     We can feel her heart pounding from here.

                               MAC
                     Blackmail.  Is what robbers
                     do to schmucks.

     And leans.  To kiss her mouth.

                               MAC (softly)
                     Even adorable ones.

     They have glided up beside the gangway of a gigantic FREIGHTER.  It
     is at water level, the steps they use for their tender.  He points
     up to the name...

                               MAC
                     Pop quiz.

     SHIKOKU MARU.  She nods, slowly.  Pulls the Ziploc bag from her
     purse.  Hands it over.  He removes the sheets of paper.  Begins to
     peruse them...

                               MAC
                     Admit it's a rush.  The best day
                     of your heretofore drab life.

                               GIN
                     Fuck you.

     He glances up.

                               GIN
                     ...accompanied by related foreplay.

     And gives him the smile. What a gal.

     He offers his hand.  She rises, hops lightly to the steps of the
     gangway in her bare feet.  He pulls dry shoes from the duffle.  And
     as she slips them on...

     ...he FLIPS a switch, and the Jetski begins to FILL with water, Mac
     stepping to the gangway beside her.  They watch...

     ...the Jetski rapidly SINK out of sight.

     No evidence.  A thorough guy.

     INT. FREIGHTER HOLD - DAY

     Mac and Gin stand inside a gigantic CARGO BAY, watching massive
     CONTAINERS being loaded by crane from a dock, through the gaping
     HATCH.  The chamber is a vaulted cathedral of steel, painted
     hospital green, and Mac's eye moves over all of it, seeming to
     inspect every plate, every pan head rivet.

                               VOICE (O.S., British cheer)
                     Hullo, there!

     They turn to see a round little man with watering eyes and a very
     wide necktie, skipping-down the iron steps.  Bursting with a
     salesman's bonhomie, he extends a plump hand...

                               MAN
                     Nickerson Carlsby, Mr...
                     MacDuff, yes?

                               MAC
                     Banquo MacDuff.  This is my
                     associate-fiancee, Ms. Duncan.

     The little man pauses.  A tic in the well-oiled smile...

                               CARLSBY
                     That is...fiancee and assoc...

                               GIN (cheery herself)
                     I'm a hyphenate.

     Ah.  Like that makes complete sense.  Fingers the gardenia in his
     lapel...

                               CARLSBY
                     Well, it's a pleasure, in this
                     alien place, to do business with
                     a countryman.

                               MAC
                     I'm a Scot.  It's a different
                     country.  Culturally and historically.

     I see.

                               CARLSBY (looking around)
                     Well.  They've brought you to
                     quite the wrong place, I see.

                               MAC (looking around)
                     Thank God.

     ANGLE...Carlsby leads the way along a narrow catwalk, which ends at
     a steel door.  He presses his thumb to the I.D. panel, and speaks
     into the voice box...

                               CARLSBY (confidential code-voice)
                     In Penny Lane, the barber shaves
                     another customer...

     The door CLANGS open.  They go through it, as a gangway leads
     toward an open five-foot-thick VAULT DOOR, where two ARMED GUARDS
     rise from their seats.  Carlsby ignores them as if they were
     furniture.  THUMPS the door...

                               CARLSBY
                     Five feet thick with hidden rein-
                     forcements, no way to drill through!

                               GIN (authoritative)
                     Impressive.

                               CARLSBY
                     Only the tip of our security
                     iceberg.  See these two Brinks
                     locks...?

     They do.

                               CARLSBY
                     The Captain keeps one key.  The
                     other is continually forwarded:
                     to the Chief of Security at next
                     port.  There is no way to enter
                     during voyage.

                               GIN
                     I like this.

     Carisby glances to Mac.  He is stone.

                               CARLSBY
                     The best armed guard, rotated every
                     six hours.  A redundancy, of course,
                     but we would rather be safe three
                     times over than merely two.

                               GIN
                     Sound mathematics.

                               MAC (very quiet)
                     What if there's a fire?  In the
                     chamber.

     Ah.  Carlsby leads them through the open door, into...

     ...the maximum-security HOLD.  Primo.  The steel coated with sleek,
     matte, black all-grip paint.  Tubby points up...

                               CARLSBY
                     Sprinklers.  New design.  Incredible
                     power.  The entire chamber is water-
                     proof, fireproof, airtight.  If the
                     ship sinks, God forfend, your cargo
                     is secure for salvage.

     No reaction.  Mac does not look convinced.

                               CARLSBY
                     And your cargo is...?

                               MAC
                     Wine.

     Wine.

                               MAC
                     The bloody Japs bought up half
                     the premium clarets in the universe.
                     You may have heard.

     Actually.  He has.

                               MAC
                     I'm in charge of shipping some
                     14,000 bottles, most quite rare,
                     to a number of premium hotels in
                     Hong Kong, Bangkok, Singapore,
                     Phuket, and Penang.

     Carlsby gets the romance of it all.

                               MAC
                     All of which are destinations on
                     your October voyage.  Five months
                     from now.  However...

     And turns to the man.  With laser, disapproving eyes.

                               MAC
                     Wine.  Doesn't prefer.  To be
                     jostled.

     The man beams.  Gestures to a series of PLATFORMS, each SWAYING at
     different heights, in different directions.

                               CARLSBY
                     Our 'delicate treasure' platforms,
                     suspended on gimbals.  Your cargo
                     remains unruffled by roiling seas.
                     Then, on arrival, is plucked...

     Pointing once more...

                               CARLSBY
                     By that forklift, and gently
                     deposited on dock through the
                     cargo hatch...

     ...a huge circular hatch cut into the hull.  Mac's eyes stare
     blankly at it.  A long beat.  He pronounces it all...

                               MAC
                     Adequate.  I suppose.

     And then turns once more.

                               MAC
                     Did we see...a bathing pool.
                     On deck?

                               CARLSBY
                     Oh, yes, sir.  The Shikoku Maru
                     carries sixteen luxury suite pas-
                     senger cabins.  The finest cuisine.
                     For valued clients who prefer to
                     cruise in privacy.

     Mac.  Thinks this over.

                               MAC
                     Mildly.  Interesting.

     INT. PASSENGER DECK - DAY

     Carlsby ushering the couple along a plushly-appointed hallway.  A
     secret oasis of refinement in the heart of the massive freighter.
     He opens a burnished door, into...

     ...an elegant SUITE.  Cherrywood panels, spacious windows with
     views of the harbor.  The finest furnishings.  It is breathtaking.
     Even...

                               MAC
                     Adequate.  I suppose.

                               GIN
                     But dearest, in five months,
                     we'll be in Cape Town.

     Mac pulls from his pocket the folded sheets that had once been
     taped to the back of Okati's Monet.  Peruses them casually.

                               MAC
                     Anything sooner?  That goes
                     perhaps from...say, Sri Lanka?
                     To Jakarta.

     And looks up.  To a man dumbstruck.  By coincidence.

                               CARLSBY
                     Why, yes.  In three weeks.

     INT. CESSNA - DAY

     Looking DOWN on California's San Joaquin Valley from 12,000 feet,
     as air RUSHES past our open door.

                               MAC (O.S.)
                     You seem depressed.

     PULL BACK to see them both in jumping suits.  He's checking her
     gear.  She's eyeing the expansive grid of fields below.

                               GIN
                     At your insistence, I'm leaping
                     to my death, and I don't know why!

     He clips a tether from his harness to hers.

                               MAC
                     Because.  You're a greedy girl.

                               GIN
                     I'm not jumping until you talk
                     about this, it's been two days!

     She folds her arms across her chest.  Rebellious.  He smiles at her
     tenderly.  Nods, okay.

                               GIN
                     Why are we going in three weeks,
                     if the wine is on a different
                     route months lat...

                               MAC
                     There is no wine.  That just bought
                     us a look at their security.

     She stares at him.

                               GIN
                     I knew that.

                               MAC
                     What we want is on the boat in
                     three weeks.  Now can we jump?

                               GIN
                     The machine in those diagrams.  on
                     the back of the painting.

     Maybe.  He's still smiling.

                               GIN
                     What does it do, make gold?

                               MAC
                     We're nearing the targ...

                               GIN
                     Why won't you trust me?

                               MAC
                     How do I know who you are, hmmn?

     Stares in her eyes.

                               MAC
                     For all I know, your name isn't
                     Virginia Romay.  Maybe you're
                     a cop.

     She stares back.  Dead straight.

                               GIN
                     Why would a cop do all th...

                               MAC (softly)
                     Entrapment, remember? What cops
                     do to robbers.

                               GIN (just as softly)
                     Oh.  That.

     His smile is light, affectionate.  Gently, he backs her to the edge
     of the doorway...

                               MAC
                     One...two...

     She THROWS her arms around his neck.  Holds him close.

                               GIN
                     Mac, I'm afraid.

     Vulnerable and touchingly real.  His arms slide around her.

                               GIN
                     Of you.

                               MAC (a murmur)
                     Smart girl.

     And JUMPS, Gin SHRIEKING in his arms, as we...

     FOLLOW them, TUMBLING in FREE FALL, until he releases her, and bot
     EXTEND their arms and legs, as if flying, as if gliding face down,
     her shriek CONTINUING.  He floats at the end of their tether, a few
     feet above her.  And at last...

     ...her SCREAMING STOPS.  We see the pure adrenaline rush.  Shouts
     back...

                               GIN
                     NEXT TIME, I'M ON TOP!

     EXT. HILLTOP, MARIN COUNTY - DAY

     Woods, rolling hills, a dirt path.  Mac stands by a sign at a
     crossroads, names, arrows, STINSON BEACH, BOLINAS, MT. TAMALPAIS,
     MILL VALLEY.  There is a phone booth nearby.  He holds a stopwatch,
     looking down the path, as...

     ...Gin runs into view, steady stride, breathing hard, sheened with
     sweat.  Approaching him, she slows to a stop.  Hands on her knees,
     catching her wind. He CLICKS the watch.

                               MAC
                     Consistent.  And rather impressive.

     She sends a nasty smile, thanks a bunch.  But maybe she likes the
     compliment, after all.

     EXT. MAC'S CABIN, BOLINAS - NIGHT

     Rustic cabin in moonlight.  Ringed by woods.  Middle of nowhere,
     which is where Mac likes it.  As we approach the lit window, we
     hear two oddly-matched sounds.  splashing water.  And the HISS of a
     violent POWER TOOL.  We MOVE THROUGH the window, into...

     INT. BATHROOM - NIGHT

     Two figures stand in the shower, spray SOAKING their shorts and
     tank tops.  Gin is operating a sleek WELDER, trying to perform
     micro-surgery on a DARTBOARD which Mac waves in all directions at
     the end of a short pole.

                               MAC
                     All right, six and seven...

     She blinks the spray from her eyes, and deftly SEARS the wire
     dividing those two numbers on the board.  As Mac keeps waving it,
     she goes off line.  Concentrates.  Gets it right.  The wire PEELS
     away...

                               MAC
                     Three and four...

     EXT. CABIN - DAY

     CLOSE on Gin operating a small steamshovel with a loading
     attachment on the front.  It is mounted with two 2 x 4's, set
     close together, protruding from the loader.  She maneuvers the
     wooden prongs toward a pile of big rocks.  But as she positions
     to scoop one up, her vehicle SWAYS WILDLY, and we PULL BACK to
     see it is...

     ...dangling from a CRANE, operated by Mac.  Gin stays with it,
     concentrates, and on the next pass she glides her boards UNDER a
     huge rock, LIFTING it awkwardly.  Ignoring the bumpy ride, she
     pivots, and deposits her prize in place atop what has become...

     ...a WALL of stones.

                               GIN
                     What the hell are we building?

     He gives this some reflection.

                               MAC
                     A chalet, I think.  Or an outhouse.

     EXT. OCEAN - NIGHT

     Mac and Gin paddle KAYAKS, side by side.  A full moon slams off
     the rolling surface of the sea.  Light chop, enough to bob pretty
     strong once they stop paddling.  His stopwatch GLOWS.  He says
     only...

                               MAC
                     Forty seconds.

     And she FLIPS OVER, submerging her head and torso, and we go...
     ...WITH her underwater, upside-down in the kayak, she STRUGGLES to
     FREE a group of tools which are tethered to her wetsuit.  Fumbling
     to BREAK the seal on a slender TUBE, which BURSTS, sending a GLOW
     of yellow-green LIGHT in all directions.  She fits the flexible
     tube around her head like a headlamp, pulling out...

     ...a small ELECTRIC FAN with side HANDGRIPS of black metal.
     Buffeted by the current, Gin manages to flip a small switch on the
     housing of the fan, and...

     ...nothing happens.  Again.  Nothing.  And again.  SHIT!  With a
     supreme effort, she tries to ROLL herself upright, but...

     ...can't quite make it.  Blind PANIC now, blowing bubbles, FLAILING
     at the kayak, which suddenly...

     ROLLS upright, manipulated by Mac.  She sputters and tries to
     THROW the tethered fan at him, but it snaps back and SLAMS her
     across the shoulder.  She is furious.

                               GIN
                     Get your fucking equipment
                     together, man, this is a
                     professional operation!!

     EXT. WOODS - DAY

     Gin in a clearing, arms at her sides, a determined look.  Mac is
     somewhere just behind us.

                               MAC (O.S.)
                     This time, when you raise your
                     arm.  Don't breathe.

     She nods, got it.  Focused.  suddenly, in the clearing before her,
     a HOSTAGE SILHOUETTE TARGET pops up, the outline of a terrorist
     shielding himself with a hostage, Gin's arm rising with a BLUR
     and...

     ...BLAMM, BLAMM, BLAMM!!!  The paper terrorist is NAILED in the
     head.  Two out of three.  She lets out a thin stream of air.  Proud
     of herself, but too cool to gloat.

                               MAC
                     Very, very nice.  Had a tour
                     with the Mosad, did you?

     She turns slowly.

                               GIN
                     Where does this fit in the
                     game plan?

     His enigmatic, yet fond, smile.

                               MAC
                     Oh, it doesn't.  But one
                     never knows...

     A quiet wink.

                               MAC
                     You might need it with me.

     INT. CABIN - NIGHT

     CLOSE on Gin leaning back at a 45 degree angle.  She is sweating.
     This is hard.  HEAR a SLAM-THWOCK!  And ANOTHER.  PULL BACK to
     reveal...

     She is climbing UP the inside of the angled A-frame CEILING, using
     hand rods with powerful SUCTION cups, and similar suction devices
     on the balls of her feet.  A human spider, inching up the wall with
     everything she's got.  She SLAMS the next hand rod down, and it...

     ...slips.

                               GIN
                     Shit.

     ...as she TUMBLES eighteen feet to...

     DISAPPEAR in an ocean of STYROFOAM packing bubbles, which EXPLODE
     in all directions like popcorn in a nuclear accelerator.

     She has totally VANISHED.  Buried alive.

                               GIN (O.S.)
                     DID I SAY SHIT?

     Mac is wading into the sea of plastic bits, DIGGING her body out
     with his bare hands.  Once more, she comes up sputtering.

                               GIN
                     This one, I will not get!

     He's holding her in his arms.  Leans close.

                               MAC
                     But you will, you'll get it all.
                     You are actually...

     He kisses her.

                               MAC
                     Quite remarkable.

     Something in the way he looks at her.  Her return gaze is naked.
     It looks like love.

                               MAC
                     Take the rest of the evening off.

     And kisses her again.  Her eyes close.

     EXT. FRONT PORCH - MORNING

     Mac sits alone at a table, sipping coffee, reading Barron's.   A
     short-wave radio is playing BBC World Service.  Leaning against an
     open laptop, is...

     ...Mac's stopwatch.  He glances up at it.  What he sees makes him
     reach into a duffle at his feet, withdraw...

     ...a rectangular gun-metal gray DEVICE.  Looks like a cross between
     a remote control clicker and a large cell phone.  Turns it ON.  The
     power display GLOWS green.

     EXT. HILLTOP - MORNING

     Gin running alone.  Up the dirt path we've seen before.  Ahead, the
     crossroads, the sign.  The lonely phone booth.

     EXT. FRONT PORCH

     Mac tuning the device, which is an advance-design SCANNER.  We HEAR
     overlapping CONVERSATIONS through bursts of STATIC...

                               OVERLAPPING VOICES (O.S.)

     INT. PHONE BOOTH

     Gin at the phone.  Inserts her credit card.  Catches her breath.

     EXT. FRONT PORCH

     Mac HEARS a phone RINGING over the scanner.  Punches RECORD, PLUGS
     the scanner INTO his laptop.

                               VOICE (O.S.)
                     Webber Assurance.

                               GIN (O.S.)
                     This is oh-four-six-one.  Hector
                     Cruz, please, on a secure line.

                     Go ahead, please.

                               GIN (O.S.)
                     Thank y...

     The line goes DEAD.

     So do Mac's eyes.  Click the scanner OFF.

     INT. PHONE BOOTH

     Gin in her throaty, playful voice...

                               GIN
                     ...no way I'm telling you shit.

                               CRUZ (O.S.)
                     Baker, this is an extremely
                     dangerous g...

                               GIN
                    ...right now, you're more dangerous
                    than he is.

     A pause.  Her voice is smiling.  Not her eyes.

                               CRUZ (O.S.)
                    You want to explain th...

                               GIN
                    If I tell you what this is, and
                    where this is, you'll send back-up,
                    and those morons will blow my cover,
                    and I'll be too dead to accept your
                    apology.

     A longer beat.

                               CRUZ (O.S.)
                     You're fucking him, aren't you?

                               GIN
                     Right to the wall.

     Her eyes are stone cold.  We've never seen her like this.  She
     looks like Mac.

                               CRUZ (O.S.)
                     You're over your head, Baker.

                               GIN
                     Only romantically.  I'll write to
                     him in prison.

     She's pulling out a different piece of plastic.  A drug store phone
     card.

                               CRUZ (O.S.)
                     Okay, it's your funeral.  Next time
                     I see you, I owe you a spanking.

                               GIN
                     Ooooo.  Is that a promise?

     Her cold eyes through his chuckle.

                               CRUZ (O.S.)
                     While you're on secure, do you want
                     a transfer?

                               GIN
                     Nope.  I'm headed back to the hot
                     tub.  I'll call again, if I'm in
                     the mood.

     And hangs up.  Collects her thoughts.  Inserts the phone card.
     Dials from memory.  Fifteen digits.  She must be calling Mars.
     At last...

     ...a man's VOICE.  In a strange sing-song language.

                               GIN (subtitled Mandarin)
                     Is it over?

     SMASH CUT TO...

     EXT. TIENANMEN SQUARE, BEIJING - NIGHT

     Late night, mostly youngsters strolling the unfathomable vastness
     of the square.  At what seems an immeasurable distance, the huge
     illuminated portrait of Mao zedong hangs from the Gate of Heavenly
     Peace.  The scale of this place is unique in all the world.  PAN to
     a nearby parked...

     ...Mercedes.  COL. QIU of the People's Liberation Army, lounges at
     the wheel in full uniform.  Talks into his cellular...

                               QIU (subtitled Mandarin)
                     ...it's not over yet, it hasn't
                     even begun.

     He listens, winces.  We can hear Gin's voice yelling at him in
     Mandarin, dishing out a major piece of her mind.

                               QIU (subtitled Mandarin)
                     ...after Midnight, when his meeting
                     ends.  In Zhongnanhai.

     He doesn't like her attitude.  And there's plenty of it.

                               QIU (subtitled Mandarin)
                     The mask will be ready...

     A phalanx of TROOPS march past.  The Colonel turns his face to
     shadow.  Drops his voice...

                               QIU (subtitled Mandarin)
                     You fucking bring the bones.

     EXT. ZHONGNANKAI, BEIJING - LATE NIGHT

     The walled compound where the Politburo's elite work and live.
     From an open gateway...

     ...the MINISTER OF FINANCE appears, flanked by bodyguards in the
     drab green of PRC police.  They step onto the street and turn into
     a narrow hutong.  Down the alleyway comes a young man walking his
     bicycle through shadow.  Nearing us, he raises his right hand,
     and...

     ...SHOOTS each bodyguard TWICE through the chest, DROPS the bike,
     LURCHES at the Minister with something cylindrical and gleaming,
     and...

     ...SPRAYS the cowering official's FACE with something that makes
     him SCREAM in pain, the assassin RUNNING down the hutong for his
     life, as a fallen guard...

     ...SHOOTS him in the back, and he goes SPRAWLING, SKIDDING, face
     down.  Lifeless.

     INT. OPHTHALMOLOGIST'S OFFICE, BEIJING - NIGHT

     Col. Qiu walks beside a jaunty ophthalmologist, DR. HONGWEI, who
     is turning ON lights in the darkened office as they go.  Behind
     them, two PLA SOLDIERS half-carry the agonized minister.  Into an
     examination room...

     ...the minister gently set into an examining chair.  The doctor
     tilts the face up, shines a light into the minister's eyes, which
     makes him GROAN.  Eye drops now, which make the man YELP in pain.
     HONGWEI now moves the RETINAL SCANNER into position, resting the
     minister's chin on the slot provided.  Turns it ON.  The machine's
     panel FLASHES numbers in red lights.  Hongwei looks into the box
     from the reverse angle, to view...

     ...a red LASER SCAN moving across the pupil vertically, then
     retracing its path horizontally, left to right, right to left,
     up and down, at speed.

     Hongwei moves to a computer monitor with a graphic rendering of
     the retina, clicks the keypad to section off a slice of the
     graphic, and ENLARGES the section 100 times.  Looks like pixels.

     Back to the scanner.  Touch a button, and...

     ...a COMPACT DISC pops out of the disc drive.  He places it in a
     box, telling the minister...

                               HONGWEI (subtitled Mandarin)
                     We send this to the lab for finer
                     analysis.  One piece of advice,
                     huh...?

     The minister squints up, painfully.

                               HONGWEI (subtitled Mandarin)
                     No more red pepper in your eye.
                     Not for awhile.

     The doctor LAUGHS.  The minister seethes.  But Colonel Qiu...

     Has his mind.  On business.

     EXT. GOLDEN GATE BRIDGE, SAN FRANCISCO - LATE NIGHT

     CLOSE on Gin's gloved hand, holding something we can scarcely see,
     as MIST floats up between us.  It is a carabiner with a nylon rope
     attached, and she CLIPS it to a thick wire.

                               GIN (O.S.)
                     I'm freezing my tender parts.

     PULL BACK to see her in climbing harness, scaling a nearly-vertical
     CABLE, three feet in diameter.  Enveloped in fog which reveals,
     then conceals.

                               MAC (O.S.)
                     I'm relieved to hear you have some.

     PULL WAY BACK to see him below her.  The two of them climbing
     the GOLDEN GATE BRIDGE.  They are near the top, more than 700
     feet above the silvery black BAY.  A precarious, dizzying sight.

                               MAC
                     What's amazing, is that only eleven
                     workers died during construction of
                     this thing...

                               GIN (grim)
                     ...thanks for sharing...

                               MAC
                     Of course, the others were saved by
                     a safety net.

     Gin keeps her focus on the small railed PLATFORM just above her.  A
     gutsy gal.

                               MAC (loving it)
                     Now, as for the suicides, they
                     always jump facing the city.  Avoids
                     that tall fence about 50 stories down,
                     see it, there?

     She's at the platform.

                               GIN
                     I never liked you.

     Unclips one last time.  This won't be easy.  Throws her rope
     OVER the railing, and to her surprise, Mac braces himself with
     his legs...

     ...lifts her from the waist with strong hands, boosting her easily
     to the platform.  Grateful, she hates to confess it.

                               GIN
                     One act of fucking human kindness...

                               MAC
                     Call it a lapse.

     And he swings lightly up beside her.  The fog has rolled past.
     There are several million stars.  Transcendent beauty.  She slows
     her breath...

                               GIN
                     And how does this fit into
                     the game pl...

                               MAC
                     Oh, it doesn't.  We came for
                     the view.

     And from his contoured backpack, he pulls a bottle of Cristal.
     Flutes, wrapped in velvet.  He POPS the cork in one motion, and it
     SAILS to its watery doom.  She can't help but watch.

     One more motion to pour both glasses.  Hands one to her.  Toasts...

                               MAC
                     To Ginger Baker.

     He clicks her glass.  She stares straight in his eye.  Shows no
     surprise, no fear...

                               GIN
                     I'm partial to drummers.  If they
                     played with Clapton and Winwood.

     And takes a sip.  Cool as a goose.  Licks her lips.

                               GIN
                     The prescription bottle.  When you
                     stole my suitcase.

     But he's not drinking.  Only staring.  The wind has picked up.

                               GIN
                     Armand Baker was my husband, May 13
                     to October 27, 1982, he played alto
                     sax, I was 17 years old.

     She takes another sip.  Good wine.

                               GIN
                     He named me Ginger.  He likes
                     drummers, too.

                               MAC
                     And you get sentimental for him.
                     Every time you order drugs.

                               GIN
                     I have I.D. in that name.  I use
                     it for various things I don't want
                     traced.  When credit unions turn
                     their computers my way.

                               MAC
                     I could listen to you lie all night.

     She toasts him.

                               GIN (softly)
                     Same here, fella.

     Slowly, he reaches to an inside pocket, watching to see if she
     flinches.  Her eyes do flicker.  And follow.  He withdraws not a
     pistol, but a handful of...

                               MAC
                     Do you like diamonds?

     Nine DIAMONDS, so large, so exquisite, she has to keep her eyes
     from bugging.  Wow.

                               MAC
                     You asked.  Does the machine.
                     Make gold.

     Holy.  Christ.

                               MAC
                     Gold is shit.  It's six thousand
                     dollars a pound.  Worth your weight
                     in gold...?

     His eyes travel her body...

                               MAC
                     That would put you at seven
                     hundred thousand.

                               GIN
                     Would you pay it?

     And he leans.  Looks in her eyes.

                               MAC
                     When the light hits you just
                     right.  I'd pay more.

     She liked that.  Maybe a lot.

                               GIN
                     The machine.  That we are stealing.
                     Makes diamonds?

     No answer.

                               GIN
                     Real ones?

                               MAC
                     Gem quality.  First ever.  God
                     save Japan.

     He toasts Blessed Japan to the East.  Takes a hit.

                               MAC
                     A diamond reactor takes graphite,
                     runs it through a combination of
                     lasers, electron beams, and scanning-
                     tunnel mg microscopes.

     He means this.  She is transfixed.

                               MAC
                     This one uses krypton-fluorine laser,
                     with a new isotope of krypton.

     She looks down at the diamonds in his palm.  His fist CLOSES.

                               MAC
                     The atoms are rearranged.  And
                     the molecule of graphite becoznes
                     a molecule of...

     He turns his fist UPSIDE-DOWN.  And LETS GO!  She GASPS as the
     brilliant stones FALL toward the sea.  Watching, watching, long
     after the moonlit glimmer has evaporated.  A hush.

                               GIN
                     I hate it.  When you make
                     a point.

     INT. SHIKOKU MARU - DAY

     CLOSE on two open PASSPORTS.  The names say BANQUO MACDUFF and
     ISADORA DUNCAN.  The faces are Mac and Gin.

                               STEWARD (O.S.)
                     All right, then.  All set.

     PULL BACK to see Mac and Gin dressed as tropical tourists.  She
     hangs on his arm.

                               STEWARD
                     We will keep your passports in
                     our safe until Jakarta.

                               MAC
                     Of course.

                               STEWARD
                     You are Suite 16...

                               GIN
                     ...and never been kissed.

     The steward doesn't get it.  Gin shrugs, sorry.

                               MAC
                     We had booked Suite 9.

                               STEWARD
                     16 is our Tokugawa Suite, far
                     superior, trust me.

     Mac consents.  A little wary.

                               STEWARD
                     You luggage is in the room, these
                     are your keys, the housekeeper
                     will show you t...

                               GIN (pouting)
                     Oh.  Can't we stroll around the
                     port?  Just a little?

     The steward checks his watch.

                               STEWARD
                     I'd be on board in forty minutes.
                     Just to be safe.

                               GIN (sweet smile)
                     Better safe.  Than sorry.

     EXT. DOCK, COLOMBO, SRI LANKA - DAY

     Mac and Gin stroll down the gangway, to the seedy, dangerous-
     looking wharf.  At the bottom of the gangway...

     ...a wooden board to mark the whereabouts of guests.  Each
     stateroom has a peg, which can be moved to ABOARD or ASHORE.  Mac
     moves the peg for 16...

     ...to the ABOARD position.

     And off they go.

     INT. SMALL PLANE - NIGHT

     Mac in his jump suit piloting the Dehaviland DHC-53 across the
     endless black of the Indian Ocean.  For the moment, he seems alone.
     Then...

                               MAC
                     Down there.  Ten o'clock.

     He means a tiny grouping of LIGHTS.  Way down there, against the
     darkness.  He switches on the AUTOPILOT.  Goes back to...

     ...Gin, waiting in her jump suit, sitting on a large pack of gear
     just beside the window of the jump door.  Next to her, a pack that
     is even larger.  No fear in her eyes tonight.  Pure adrenaline.

                               GIN
                     Are you dumping fuel?

                               MAC
                     Changed my mind.  There's nothing
                     on the instruments downrange.  The
                     longer she flies before she ditches,
                     the less chance they notice on the
                     Bridge.

     As she stands, he begins to strap the huge pack ONTO her body.
     Jesus.  With her chute, and the other gear attached, the load makes
     us uneasy.  Not her.

                               MAC
                     You should lose the oxygen tank
                     at 8000 feet.

                               GIN
                     And how do I judge that?  Babe's
                     intuition?

     He points to an altimeter device on his wrist.  It says 12,000
     feet.  She cuts him a look.

                               GIN
                     So I just ask you on the way down?
                     Or were you planning to e-mail me.

     He pulls out an identical device.  Strapping it to her wrist...

                               MAC
                     I hate a crybaby.

     He straps the even-larger gear pack to himself.  Checks the path of
     the tiny lights far below.  Then, looks in her eyes...

                               MAC (simply)
                     You can do this.

     Not merely reassurance.  Affection.  Something connective between
     them.  You are my partner.  Her eyes send back that personal bond,
     and she nods.  I can do this.  Good girl.

     He pulls on his oxygen mask, goggles.  She does the same.  He OPENS
     the door, air BLASTING in.  One more look down below, and he holds
     up ten fingers.  Counts them down, nine...eight...

     She moves to the edge.  Watching him.  And on zero, she...
     ARCHES out INTO the starry VOID, and we go...

     WITH HER, the incomparable RUSH of freefall, straining to see him
     FOLLOW, skillfully altering his position to gain on her, coming
     close.  She is looking between him and her altimeter, as...

     ...his oxygen tank FALLS AWAY, and she CUTS hers loose, the air
     RUSHING past her, she looks DOWN...

     ...the lights below are beginning to take the shape of the
     freighter.  Back up to Mac, as he...

     PULLS his CHUTE, it is black and square, and JOLTS him to what
     seems like a full STOP far above her, and she YANKS her cord,
     but...

     ...nothing.  It doesn't open.  She is ROCKETING down, looking back
     up to see Mac make an exaggerated CUTTING sign across his body, and
     she closes her eyes, PULLS her secondary chute, which...

     POPS open, JARRING her violently, and she GASPS with the shock.  He
     is well above her now, she isoff course, frantically trying to
     manipulate her trajectory, seeing him swooping closer, the
     freighter LOOMS in distance, she looks down and suddenly...

     ...the sea is RUSHING at her, she FIGHTS her braking mechanism,
     SHOUTING at herself...

                               GIN
                     FLARE, FLARE...

     ...and SLAMS INTO the water, PLUNGING down, twisting, disoriented
     CUTTING her chute loose, struggling not to get tangled, in a panic
     to BREAK her light tube, which...

     ...GLOWS yellow-green, illuminating the freezing depths, she FITS
     it around her head, fights now to pull out the small ELECTRIC FAN
     we've seen before, KICKING herself toward the surface, fighting
     against the weight of her gear pack, she...

     ...flips the switch, and the fan becomes a PROPELLER which ROCKETS
     her upward, but she loses her hold on one handgrip, tries
     desperately to hang on with one hand, but it...

     ...PULLS FREE, goes SHOOTING off into the blackness without her,
     one instant of TERROR in her eyes, and...

     Mac is THERE, diving at her with his propeller, she GRASPS his legs
     in a death grip, and suddenly, they are...

     AT the surface, Gin GASPING for air, and he CUTS his propeller,
     CRADLES her body with one strong arm, murmuring in her ear...

                               MAC
                     It's over, it's over...

     Her eyes are wild.

                               MAC
                     Catch your breath, quickly.
                     Hang on for the wake.

     She sees the FREIGHTER now, a black mountain CUTTING the sea, a
     huge WAKE pluming from its bow.  She grabs his waist with all
     she's got.

                               GIN
                     DO IT! GO!

     And he KICKS the propeller to LIFE, they ZOOM off, straight AT the
     towering wake and burst THROUGH it, RACING to the freighter's
     looming hull, speeding alongside, Mac looking up to find...

     ...a series of metal RUNGS, which begin twelve feet above the water
     line, climbing the dizzying height to the freighter's deck, far
     above.  Mac has a Kevlar rope with a GRAPPLING HOOK, and as he
     reaches the rungs, he...

     ...THROWS it high, one of the pronged hooks CATCHING on a rung
     twenty feet above them...

                               MAC
                     HOLD TIGHT!

                               GIN
                     IF YOU FUCKING INSIST!

     And he LETS GO of the propeller, PULLING both of them, laden with
     gear, OUT of the water with sheer brute strength.  PLANTING his
     feet against the outward curve of the hull, he CLIMBS with all his
     strength, hand over hand, until he finally...

     ...GRASPS the bottom rung.  He PULLS them up, until she can GRAB
     ON.  They hold tight to their rung for a beat.  He attaches them
     both with metal carabiner clips.

                               MAC
                     If I were you, I'd watch
                     the desserts.

                               GIN
                     Boy, I'll bet you were in
                     shape before you got old.

                               MAC
                     Too long ago to remember.

     And pulls himself up to the second rung, so that he is standing an
     the first.  Offers her his hand...

                               GIN
                     I can take it from here, thanks.

     Suit yourself.  They begin to climb up the rungs, like a tilted
     backwards ladder, re-attaching their clips as they go.

                               GIN
                     If you'd packed my primary chute
                     right, I wouldn't ha...

                               MAC
                     Yes, you would.  You're a girl.

     Up, up.  And stop.  They are nearly halfway to the top.  Looking
     across the curved hull to...

     ...a large circular HATCH.  Thirty feet away.  The goal.  Mac
     pulls from his pack...

     ...their SUCTION CUP gear.  With practiced speed, they fasten cups
     to the balls of their feet, take hold of the hand rods with cups
     attached, and Mac takes the lead as they begin to...

     ...move LATERALLY across the hull's surface toward the hatch.  Mac
     is amazingly agile at the arduous process, scuttling sideways like
     a crab across the precariously tilted-back hull.  Gin is deter-
     mined, but falls well behind, intent on making every suction seal
     solid one.  Dark water RACES by beneath her.,  By the time she looks
     up at the hatch...

     He is gone.

                               MAC (O.S.)
                     Anytime you're ready.

     She looks UP sharply.  He is ABOVE the hatch, attached to the hull
     by the balls of his feet, hanging down like a bat.  Noting her
     astonishment...

                               MAC
                     Better angle.

     That it is.  He has pulled a thick cylinder from his pack.  It's a
     battery-operated AIR WRENCH, and with a menacing WHIRR, only
     partially masked by the ship's wake, he begins to swiftly POP all
     the rivets around the hatch.

     Gin has pulled out the slender WELDING TOOL we saw in the shower,
     and begins CUTTING through the metal seals around the hatch's rim.

     At thecrucial moment...

                               MAC
                     You might want to move aside...

     Which she BARELY does, as the hatch door PLUMMETS past her to the
     sea.  BIG splash.  Gone.  When she turns back, Mac is already
     THROUGH the opening and she follows, their yellow-green headlamps
     partially revealing...

     ...the maximum-security HOLD.  We've seen this with Carlsby.  The
     fork lift.  The shadowy multitude of PLATFORMS on their gimbals,
     all SWAYING, in different directions with the plunging of the ship.
     Gin just stands, staring everywhere, like she's broken into Fort
     Knox.  The ROAR of the engines is louder here, and he moves close
     to her to speak beneath it...

                               MAC
                     May I trouble you for the torch?
                     Or would you rather just dance.

     Oh.  Slightly embarrassed at her lack of split-second efficiency,
     she tries to find the thing in her gear.  After watching her fumble
     for a bit...

                               GIN
                     I know I packed it.

     ...he just reaches in and pulls it out.  A small LANTERN which he
     FLICKS on, brilliantly ILLUMINATING the entire hold.  Scans the
     platforms...polnts to a CRATE wrapped in 4-ply heavy duty plastic
     membrane.

                               MAC
                     Coal into diamonds.  A wealth
                     machine.

                               GIN
                     How do you know that's it?

                               MAC (as if stating the obvious)
                     It's 12 by 9 by 7 feet.  And it's
                     the only thing worth waterproofing,
                     in case the ship sinks.

                               GIN (softly)
                     ...you twit.

                               MAC
                     Hmmn?

                               GIN
                     I'm just finishing your sentence.
                     Can't you answer a question with-
                     out making me feel stupid?

     He's heading toward the swaying platforms...

                               MAC
                     Why would I bother?

     He is climbing onto a lower platform, easily vaulting up to the
     magic crate.  She follows, but it isn't as easy as he's made it
     look.  She has to scramble, almost falling.  He's already pulled
     from his gear...

     ...six rubber POUCHES.  She hands him her welding tool, and he
     begins attaching the pouches to the top and sides of the crate.

     The plunging ship has the platform really rocking.

                               GIN (concerned)
                     They don't look like flotation
                     bags...

                               MAC (working fast)
                     Shit.  Well then, let's forget
                     the whole thing.

     She stares at him.

                               GIN
                     Okay, it was a dumb ques...

     His eyes come UP.  So fast that her breath stops.  He looks plenty
     angry.

                               MAC
                     Let's get one thing straight.  I
                     don't work with partners much,
                     because basically, I find most
                     people to be idiots.

     She swallows.  Hard.

                               MAC
                     You, in contrast, are first-rate.

     He watches the effect of that play across her eyes.

                               MAC
                     And if I think so.  Maybe you
                     should start thinking the same.
                     Now move your ass.

     And goes back to work.  She pauses a beat.  Then pulls out two
     lengths of Kevlar rope.  Begins securing their platform to the one
     above, to minimize the amount of sway.  As she struggles with this,
     she sees him finish by welding a very small gray BOX to the top of
     the crate.

     When he glances up, he sees her staring at the box.

                               MAC
                     GPS transponder.  Sends a scrambled
                     signal by satellite...

     He touches the device.  It BEEPS.  A light glows RED.

                               MAC
                     Precise coordinates.  You could
                     find a golf ball in the Gobi Desert.

     He rises.  JUMPS down to the floor.

                               GIN
                     Where you g...

                               MAC (walking away)
                     Fork lift.

                               GIN
                     That's my assignm...

                               MAC (turning back)
                     Unless you've got the keys,
                     someone has to hot wire it.

     Oh.

                               MAC
                     Finish up on the floaters.

     And heads off toward the fork lift.  Finish up?  She looks at
     the rubber pouches.  They seem finished to her.  Tugs at a couple.
     On pretty firmly.  Across the way, we HEAR the fork lift turn its
     engine OVER.

                               GIN
                     Won't they hear it?

                               MAC (O.S.)
                     Over these engines?  Through five
                     feet of steel?

     She hurriedly secures the last of her Kevlar lines.

                               MAC (O.S.)
                     Hell, if they do, they don't have
                     the second key to get in.

     He is driving up in the rickety fork lift.  Weaving around crates
     and equipment.

                               MAC
                     Thank God for redundant security.

     He hops lightly from the fork lift, reaches up, and she jumps down
     INTO his arms.  Quickly, the switch places, Gin climbing into the
     idling fork lift, as Mac clambers up to UNBOLT the crate's pallet
     with his air wrench...

     Gin moves the fork lift into position.  Mac bracing his legs
     against neighboring cargo, using all his strength to hold our
     crate steady.  He is really straining.

                               GIN
                     How many tries do I get?

                               MAC (with effort)
                     One, before I beat you senseless,
                     dump you over the side, and donate
                     your share to charity.

     She brings the fork UP.  The crate sways slightly.  She lines up
     her prongs against the pallet's receiving holes...

                               GIN
                     You gotta work on that impatient
                     streak.

     ...and slips them straight IN.  First try.

                               GIN (amazed)
                     How professional.

     She LIFTS the crate, but the boat LURCHES, and she nearly LOSES it
     off the fork.

     But she doesn't.  SWINGS her load around now.  Heading for the open
     hatchway, the roiling sea racing by.  Picking up SPEED, slightly...

                               GIN
                     Uh.  Thing on the left is
                     the brakes?

                               MAC (laconic)
                     Or the thing on the right.

     By now she is really ROLLING toward the wide open spaces...

                               GIN
                     MAC, IT'S JAMMED!

     He POUNCES off the platform, FLYING after the lift as it
     ACCELERATES THROUGH the opening...

                               MAC
                     JUMP, for God's sa...

     ...TIPPING at the hatchway lip, the crate sliding OFF the prongs,
     our forklift TUMBLING OUT the hatch to the sea, just as Mac...

     ...SNATCHES Gin by her HAIR, pulling her FREE of the falling
     forklift, CATCHING the rim of the hatchway with his free hand, Gin
     SCREAMING in fright and pain, BLINDLY grabbing his arm to be...

     ...jerked BACK to safety.

     Clutching Mac, she watches the sea behind them.  Where the crate
     and the forklift disappeared.

                               MAC
                     You did activate the floaters.

     Her head WHIPS around.  Aghast.

                               GIN
                     Activa...

                               MAC
                     I did say, 'Finish up on the
                     floaters'.  Surely, you heard me.

     Her life.  Flashes before her eyes.  As behind the ship...

     ...the crate BOBS to the surface.  We can see the tiny red light on
     the transponder from here.

                               MAC (softly)
                     Oh.  Guess I did it m'self.

     She WHIPS back, and starts POUNDING at him with her fists.  He is
     laughing so hard, he takes a few good shots before he can GRASP her
     wrists.  She SPITS in his face.  He strikes back by...

     ...kissing her hard.  She struggles for a beat.

     And then she lets him.

     When they finish, he reaches to UNZIP her jumping suit.  All the
     way.  Pulls it down gently, revealing...

     ...her evening gown.  A wrinkle-free material which slips down
     across her legs from where it had been bunched across her hips.
     He is unzipping his outfit as well, revealing formal wear of his
     own.  He stuffs the suits into his gear pack, removing only...

     ...her evening bag and shoes.  Then lifting both packs, he...

                               GIN
                     Um...

     ...FLINGS them into the black ocean.  Gone.

                               GIN
                     ...I wouldn't do that.

     So he turns.  She looks really stunned.  And scared.

                               MAC
                     Excuse me?

                               GIN
                     Well...I saw our suction things.
                     Lying...over...there?

     She points.  To where no suction things are lying.

                               GIN (a mouse)
                     ...so I put 'em in my pack?

     His eyes WIDEN.

                               GIN
                     Or maybe.  I put 'em there.

     And points.  To where they are.

     She tilts her head.  Gives him a great smile.  Is he enraged?  His
     dry grin says, not hardly.

                               MAC
                     I like a quick study.

     Then again.  You can never tell.

     EXT. FREIGHTER DECK - NIGHT

     Expansive barely-lit deck under a canopy of stars.  A silver-haired
     couple in immaculate evening attire stroll alone, he is humming to
     barely-audible dance music from a distant lounge.  She clings to
     his arm, it is romantic.  Until they reach the railing where he
     turns, and says something quietly in German...

     She stiffens.  Pulls her arm away from his.  She sneers coldly,
     calls him a name in German, and he UNLOADS on her, a barrage of
     German-language INVECTIVE that would melt a tank.  She absorbs the
     abuse without flinching, turns toward the rail, HAWKS and...

     ...SPITS over the side.  Strides away from him.  He watches her go.
     Then...

     ...SPITS over the side himself.  And follows her.

     Half a beat.

     Mac's head APPEARS above the rail.  Just where they spit.  Not a
     mark on him.

     INT. BALLROOM - NIGHT

     Our old German couple are DANCING wonderfully in each other's arms
     Inspiring.  PAN a dozen really old couples dancing to the three-
     piece Filipino ensemble, until we come to...

     Gin and Mac spinning slowly, flawlessly, their eyes telling the
     surrounding geezers that they are very much in love.  We CLOSE to
     hear their sweet murmurings...

                               MAC
                     ...no matter how many stones we
                     make, the diamonds are just an
                     appetizer.

                               GIN (dreamily)
                     And the meal...?

                               MAC
                     My contract.  With DeBeers.

     She blinks.  Hit by a ton of bricks.

                               GIN
                     Oh my G...

                               MAC
                     Sensible folks, DeBeers.  A world
                     monopoly in diamonds based on one
                     simple principle...something's only
                     priceless if it's scarce.

     He WHIRLS her in a tight spin.  The geriatic Germans can only watch
     and envy.

                               MAC
                     These guys dig up all the diamonds
                     on the planet, just to keep them out
                     of circulation.  Otherwise, you could
                     buy 'em at the Five and Dime...

                               GIN
                     Watch the old guy stuff, they don't
                     have dimestores anym...

                               MAC
                     Imagine the chaos we could cause.

     She is imagining.

                               GIN
                     You said 'contract'...

                               MAC
                     We're sort of bounty hunters.

     Gin likes the ring of that.  Green eyes dance with delight.

                               MAC
                     Our machine is worth far more
                     dead.  Than alive.

                               VOICE (O.S.)
                     Glad to see you're both alive.

     They look over.  The officious STEWARD from this afternoon.  Now in
     black tie.

                               STEWARD
                     When you missed cocktails.  And
                     supper.  I thought of knocking
                     on your door...

     Mac turns Gin so that she can send the boob a lazy smile...

                               GIN
                     Oh, I wish you had.  We love having
                     strangers join us!  Maybe later...?

     Mac turns her once more, so that he faces the flummoxed steward
     across her bare shoulder...

                               MAC
                     Promise you an interesting time...

     Trademark smile.

                               MAC
                     Or my name's not Banquo MacDuff.

     You twit.

     INT. CORRIDOR - NIGHT

     Our couple moving down the softly-lit hallway, past the burnished
     doors of luxury suites.  Her arms wrapped around one of his, their
     bodies close together.

                               MAC
                     ...well, I would ask what you're
                     doing with the rest of your life.
                     But that's your own bloody affair,
                     isn't it?

     She sighs.

                               GIN
                     Yeh.  Anyway, before you get too
                     choked up on the farewell.  I feel
                     I owe you a confession.

     He glances down.  Really?  Really.

                               GIN
                     Time has come to tell you.  What
                     business.  I'm actually in.

     He thinks about this.  And then...

                               MAC
                     Not here.

     EXT. DECK - NIGHT

     Mac leads her along the empty moonlit deck to...

     ...the BOWSPRIT, a long, narrow platform, ringed by a flimsy rail,
     it juts far out above a churning sea.  The whipping of the wind
     makes it seem all the more precarious.

                               MAC
                     It only looks dangerous...

     Holds out his hand.  She hesitates.

                               MAC
                     You couldn't fall off.  Unless
                     someone threw you over.

     Gives her the smile.  She puts her hand in his, and they hop
     UP to the platform.  Walk its length to the very end.  He turns
     now, leans casually against the fragile railing.  They are inches
     apart.

                               MAC
                     More intimate.  For a confession.

     Gin looks down at the plume of wake leaping off the bow.

                               MAC
                     What business.  You are actually.
                     In.

     She looks up.  To his eyes.  Into them.

                               GIN
                     Yeh.  I'm not an art dealer.

                               MAC
                     Of course not.  You're a cop.

     And tilts his head.  Just to one side.

                               MAC
                     An insurance investigator for
                     Webber Assurance, your boss is
                     an idiot named Hector Cruz, you've
                     been there four years and ten
                     months, you're quite the rising star.

                               GIN (evenly)
                     Nope.

     His head tilts.  Just a little farther.

                               MAC (very softly)
                     Nope?

                               GIN
                     I'm a thief, Mac.

     Holds the look.

                               GIN
                     For five years, I've used the
                     database of every client Webber
                     has to plan my jobs.  Museums,
                     banks, jewelers, rich people, I
                     have floor plans, alarm codes,
                     passwords, the works.

     His face absolutely neutral.  Unreadable.

                               GIN
                     I've made a fortune.  It's not
                     enough.

                               MAC
                     Why n...

                               GIN
                     Why wasn't it enough for you?

     He falls silent.

                               GIN
                     The Vermeer that was stolen from
                     Hancock Tower?  That was my job.
                     I scaled the building with
                     electromagnets, and parachuted
                     down an air vent...

     No smile at her lips.  Strictly business.

                               GIN
                     ...after mailing the painting.  To
                     where we're going next, actua...

                               MAC (quietly)
                     We.

     She looks him up and down.

                               GIN
                     Yeh, we.  You passed the audition.

     Now he smiles.  First time.

                               MAC (a murmur)
                     Imagine my relief.

                               GIN
                     I need a partner.  For the biggest,
                     smartest, job.  Ever.  The one you
                     retire off of, because nothing else
                     could ever compare with the rush.

                               MAC
                     Ever.  Is such a long time.

                               GIN
                     This is a job that can only be done
                     in one place, in one split-second
                     in human history.  If we miss that
                     instant.  We lose.

                               MAC
                     And it's worth...?

                               GIN
                     Eight billion dollars.  That's
                     eight thousand million.

                               MAC
                     How much in shillings?

                               GIN
                     You're not a real trusting guy.

                               MAC
                     And I tried so hard to hide that.

                               GIN
                     It's two jobs.  The first steals
                     something priceless from the National
                     Palace Museum in Taipei.  We don't
                     keep that.  We trade it in for our
                     ticket to the show.

                               MAC
                     One moment in time, you s...

                               GIN
                     Midnight, July 1, 1997.  Eight
                     days from now.  The moment that
                     Hong Kong is annexed by china.

     And now.  She has his interest.  She can see that.

                               GIN
                     80-20 split.

                               MAC
                     Don't be so hard on yourself.  It's
                     your plan, you should take at least
                     thirty perc...

                               GIN
                     My 80, your 20.  Asshole.

     He thinks this over.

                               MAC
                     50-50.  Or you can swim to Taipei.

     She is not impressed.  Or afraid.  He grins...

                               MAC
                     What are you gonna do with six
                     billion dollars that you can't do
                     with four?

                               GIN
                     Hold the record.  Alone.

     This.  He likes.  So much that he leans to kiss her, with
     surprising tenderness.

                               MAC
                     Your share is 50%.  And one dollar.

     Her hard stare.  And then, she smiles.  Just barely.  Still in his
     arms...

                               GIN
                     I like what you left.  In the hold.

                               MAC
                     You didn't even see wha...

                               GIN
                     A lump of coal.  A pair of pliers.
                     A note that said, 'Squeeze hard'.

     This is the most taken with her that he has ever looked.  She leans
     up and kisses him.  Whispers...

                               GIN
                     Squeeze hard.

     EXT. STREET, SHIHLIN DISTRICT, TAIPEI - LATE NIGHT

     Ugly section of an ugly town.  Unmarked warehouses, alleyways
     teeming with food stalls.  HEAR a motorcycle approach, and see...

     ...Gin driving, Mac sits behind her.  Going real fast, maybe she's
     showing off, we FOLLOW them DOWN a blind alley, as she smoothly
     WHEELS them into...

     ...an open FREIGHT ELEVATOR.  She climbs off, he doesn't.  As Gin
     goes to work the controls, Mac sees a cat curled in the corner,
     mewing softly.

                               GIN
                     That's Madame Chiang Kaishek, she's
                     my bud.  An evil streak a mile wide.

     The elevator JOLTS to life.

                               MAC
                     No surprise.

     They CLANG upward.  Mac seems utterly relaxed.  Gin paces a little,
     hugging herself.  Her features tense.

                               MAC (gently)
                     Tired?

     She blinks up.  He is straddling the bike.  Smiling at her.

                               GIN
                     I have a lot on my mind.

     Ah.  Well...

                               MAC
                     You look beautiful doing it.

     He seems to mean that.  And it seems to melt her a little.  She
     sags against the wall, closing her eyes, as...

     ...they JOLT to a stop.  She PULLS the heavy LEVER, and the door
     SLIDES noisily open, to reveal...

     ...a gigantic LOFT.  She flicks on a dim light, but we see only
     part of the cavernous space.  She strolls, Madame Chiang trotting
     along behind.  Mac follows, looking around, then down to see...

     ...a pile of MAIL, cables, packages.  The unopened MAILING TUBE we
     saw in the Hancock Tower penthouse.  He crouches, lifts the tube in
     his hands...

                                    GIN (O.S.)
                     You wanna buy a Vermeer?

                                    MAC
                     Rather steal it.

                                    GIN (O.S.)
                     Been there, done that.

     He nods to himself.  Guess so.  He rises to see her framed against
     the gaping starlit opening of a huge LOADING DOOR.  The twinkling
     island lies below.  But here, Gin stares down at...

     ...an elaborate architectural MODEL.  Fifteen feet across, it
     features an imposing yellow, pagoda-roofed BUILDING, built into
     the side of a model MOUNTAIN.  Formal gardens, fountains, tiny
     Kuomintang flags.  Stretching away from the building, a large
     portion of the CITY, with shops and alleyways elaborately detailed.
     As Mac joins her...

                               GIN
                     National Palace Museum, Taipei,
                     Taiwan.  Repository of four
                     thousand years of Chinese culture...

     He bends to lift UP the detachable roof.  All the rooms are
     detailed within, down to exhibit cases.

                               GIN
                     Works of gold, bronze, jade, onyx,
                     pots and scrolls, paintings and
                     porcelains and lacquer work.  Every
                     treasure the Kuomintang could loot
                     before the Reds took over.
                               (beat)
                     Ever rob the place?

                               MAC
                     No.  If memory serves.

     She takes him by the hand, and leads him toward the gaping doorway,
     walking straight toward it...

                               GIN
                     You need to eat something, or
                     are you ready for sex?

     And just at the edge of it...

                               MAC (torn)
                     The options seem so limited.

     They jump THROUGH the opening.  And VANISH.

     Our ANGLE closes on the doorway, to see OUT now, sitting like a
     jewel against the hillside...

     ...the NATIONAL PALACE MUSEUM, looking exactly like the model.  The
     town spread out beyond.  Just as in the model.  And now we TILT
     sharply DOWN to see...

     ...a loading PLATFORM, suspended above the island, only a few feet
     below our opening.  Like a balcony without a railing.  Mac and Gin
     already sinking down onto a waiting futon.

     Looks like he's made his pick.  Among limited options.

     INT. LOFT - SUNRISE

     CLOSE on the MODEL MUSEUM in early light.  Propped against it, the
     unrolled Vermeer.  Pinned to the painting, a note we can't read.  In
     the B.G., HEAR what sounds like the rattling of a SUBWAY TRAIN,
     which runs a short distance and STOPS.  We TILT ANGLE now, to
     see...

     ...through the sunlit opening of the loading door.  Mac's head
     APPEARS, peeking up over the lip.

                               MAC
                     Ginny...?

     LOST in another brief subway rumble.  He lightly VAULTS up through
     the doorway.  Looks around, no Gin.  Goes to the model.  Lifts the
     note pinned to the Vermeer...

                               MAC (reads)
                     This lovely parting gift can be
                     yours.  If the price is right.

     Stumped.  Not in his cultural database.  He looks at the model, to
     see that the stretch of city between museum and mountain has been
     lifted away, revealing...

     ...an underground RAILWAY TUNNEL between the two.  Mac examines the
     tiny train, the tracks, the winding route.  From the side walls,
     well above the tracks, huge VENTILATION PIPES open onto the tunnel.
     Starting at the museum end, they are labeled VENT #1, and so on.
     There are five.  The last one shortly before...

     ...the mountain.  Where a cavernous opening is labeled BARRACKS.
     Tiny toy soldiers kneel on a landing, rifles in position to shoot
     at the oncoming train.  And as Mac studies this curiously...

     ...the nearby SUBWAY RATTLES the walls once more.  Sounds like it's
     in the room, somehow.  Mac rises.  Saunters across the loft, and we
     see for the first time the enormity of this space.  Suddenly, the
     floor ends, and we are looking down nearly thirty feet onto...

     ...a spacious HANGAR, outfitted with 150 feet of RAILWAY TRACK, at
     the far end of which sits a full-sited TRAIN CAR, exactly like the
     one in the model.  And just below us...

     ...Gin crouches on a concave platform of corrugated metal, eighteen
     feet above the track.  She holds a remote control device, which she
     uses to REV the train's engine, far down the line.  She looks
     really tense.

                               MAC
                     Good morning.

     She startles slightly.  Shuts OFF the train's engine.  As she looks
     up to him now, the silence is noticeable.  He crouches down, only a
     foot or so above her...

                               MAC
                     Quite a parting gift.  I would
                     have settled for roses.

                               GIN
                     It's a joke.  You know, a joke?
                     People who have a sense of humor
                     make them?

     He's clueless.  But smiling.

                               GIN
                     You're rich, go buy an American,
                     have him fill you in on the culture.

                               MAC
                     Ah.  American culture.  Well,
                     that is a joke.

     He leans down.  Strokes her hair very gently.

                               MAC (murmurs)
                     Relax.  It's only eight billion
                     dollars.

     She looks up into his eyes.  But she can't smile.

                               MAC (softly)
                     Your Vermeer?  I like this View Of
                     Delft better than the larger one.
                     The sky is more emotionally rendered.

     Staring in his eyes.  And just as softly back...

                               GIN
                     Nice.  When a sky is that.

     He holds the look.  Very strong and very gentle...

                               MAC
                     Is it easier now? Not pretending.

     Is it?

                               MAC
                     Not pretending you're an innocent.
                     Not pretending you...like me.

     No answer.  Effortlessly, he hops down to join her.  Never losing
     eye contact.

                               MAC
                     Here's a tip from an old-timer.
                     Never forget who you are...

     Settles next to her.  Bodies touching.

                               MAC
                     It gives you someone to be.  When
                     you stop pretending.

     Okay?  She nods, slowly.  Her eyes moving over his face.  Maybe
     more feelings going through her than she can sort out.

                               MAC (still soft)
                     So.  Our train runs from the museum,
                     through an underground tunnel.  To
                     a mountain.

                               GIN
                     Because the museum displays 10,000
                     relics at any given moment.  But
                     there are 60 times that many, stored
                     in the mountain.

     This overwhelms.  Even Mac.

                               GIN
                     Which is why it's guarded.  By an
                     army.

     She is unfastening the small pack at her feet...

                               GIN
                     The train shuttles relics to and
                     from storage.  It looks exactly
                     like that.

     So Mac looks down the line.  At the train car.

                               GIN
                     I've been down the air ducts four
                     times.  The train always has two
                     armed guards.  Always travels between
                     32 and 36 miles per hour.  Relics
                     don't like to be jostled too much.

                               MAC (all business now)
                     Your model has five vents.

                               GIN
                     We go down the first.  Back up the
                     third, if you're lucky.  If not, we
                     have to get out by the fourth.

                               MAC (simply)
                     Then we will.

     She pulls from the pack four thick DISCS, each about eight inches
     in diameter, each with a toggle switch and a wrist loop.  She
     starts to put two of them on...

                               GIN
                     Electromagnets, incredibly powerful.
                     This switch is on-off.

     He gestures at the train, the track, the hangar...

                               MAC
                     Seems like overkill.  For one
                     simple jump.

                               GIN
                     Well, it's an eight billion
                     dollar jump.  You miss the
                     train...you've missed the train.

     Flicks ON her remote.  Down the track the engine REVS.  Like crazy.

                               GIN
                     We've got five days to grab the
                     Bones, trade them for the Scan, and
                     pull our 8 billion out of Hong Kong.
                     Once midnight passes on July 1st...

                               MAC
                     ...we've missed the train, yeh.
                     The Bones?  The Scan?

                               GIN
                     Oh.  Have I neglected to fill
                     in the details?

                               MAC
                     An oversight.

                               GIN
                     Which I learned from the master.
                     Hey.  Wish me luck...

     CLICKS the remote, the train LEAP5 forward, 36 MPH never seemed so
     fast!  She has a split-second to LEAP down, the train SAILS beneath
     her, Gin's feet GRAZE the back end of the platform at the rear of
     the car, she SWIPES DESPERATELY with the magnets, can't connect,
     and is THROWN into a ROLL along the side of the tracks.

     She's UP on her knees, watching the train SLAM into the massive
     blue PADS at the end of the track.  She is bruised, shaken, but
     most of all, really worried and really pissed.

                               MAC (quietly)
                     Jump sooner.

     She pulls out the remote...

                               GIN
                     Be my fucking guest.

     The train ROCKETS backward, straight PAST where she kneels, to
     BRAKE at the start of the track once more.  She nods up to Mac,
     who is strapping on his magnets.  He crouches, nods, ready.  And
     the train...

     ...BLASTS toward him, he counts, JUMPS, and SLAMS ONTO the ROOF of
     the train, which PLOWS into the heavy padding, FLINGING him twenty
     feet like a rag doll to land in a HEAP.

     He lies still.  Then blinks, surprised he's alive.  HEARS a rich
     whiskey LAUGHTER down the track.

                               MAC
                     I'm too old for this shit!

     And as he pulls himself up.  She is staring at him, from her
     knees...

                               GIN
                     Know a dude named Wiley Coyote?

     ...with what can only be described as love.

                               GIN (softly)
                     Forget it.

     EXT. NATIONAL PALACE MUSEUM, TAIPEI - DAY

     AERIAL VIEW down toward the sweeping pagoda roofs of the MUSEUM,
     the formal gardens, the fountains, the tree-lined driveway.  CLOSE
     now, as a cab pulls up, a couple emerges...

     She is first.  Chanel suit with an extremely short skirt, revealing
     endless legs.  She helps him from the taxi, a white-haired geezer
     who seems well past 90, fumbling with his walking stick, and making
     quick, erratic, bird-like glances in every direction.

     She takes his arm for support.  Murmurs in his ear...

                               GIN
                     Isn't it easier now?  Not pretending?

     Gives him a full-tongue KISS in the ear, which has bystanders
     noticing.  Starts to help him up the stairs, still whispering
     close...

                               GIN
                     Five years, you won't need
                     make-up.

     In answer he GRABS her ass, and she YELPS with delight, attract-
     ing attention all around.  His turn to whisper, as he massages
     her backside...

                               MAC
                     We agreed.  No underwear.

                               GIN
                     Overkill.  I can do it with legs.

     He stops.  Gives the long legs a dubious twice-over.

                               MAC
                     I'd lose the underwear.

     INT. MUSEUM - DAY

     Mac leaning on her arm, as they pass case after case.  Bronzes,
     jades, lacquer work.  Every object exquisite, priceless.

                               GIN
                     The Oracle Bones date back to the
                     Shang Dynasty, 3500 years ago.
                     They are writings...carved into
                     ox bones, tortoise shells...

     She cuddles close to him.  They approach a tour group, the female
     guide speaking in four European languages.  Really loud.

                               GIN
                     The oldest Chinese writing any-
                     where, the first proof of Chinese
                     civilization.

                               MAC
                     What makes this one so valuable?

     He stops, drowned out by the tour guide, rhapsodizing over an urn.
     Butts into her rap...

                               MAC (subtitled Italian)
                     Except it's Chien-lung, mimicking
                     Sung Period.  The color is far too
                     delicate.

     The woman gets real insulted.  Apparently, he's right.

                               MAC (subtitled German)
                     It's all right, you have a nice
                     body.

     And walks on.  Confides to Gin...

                               MAC
                     When you're old, you can do
                     anything

     GRABS her bottom once more, altering her voice slightly on...

                               GIN
                     There we are.

     A separate display room.  A single steel pedestal.  Under the
     smart-glass security case, one single object.  It is a fragile,
     yellowed fragment of bone.  The shoulder blade of an ox.  Covered
     with tiny script.

                               GIN
                     Last year, ancient artifacts were
                     discovered in the Gulf of Mexico.
                     An Olmec civilization, 3200 years old.

     No tourists in the display room.  A velvet rope is up.  Three
     GUARDS mill at the entrance.  This exhibit is off-limits.

                               GIN
                     Amazingly, markings on these
                     Olmec figures were identified
                     as Shang Dynasty writing...

     A sign explains, SORROWFUL TO INFORM ORACAL BONE CLOSE FOR TRAVEL
     EXIBITION UNTIL IS NOVEMBER.

                               GIN
                     This particular Bone is price-
                     less, because it is the one that
                     establishes the link.  Proves that
                     American civilizations descend from
                     Chinese ancestors.

     She is pulling out her coin purse, as they stand by the rope.
     Unzipping it slowly...

                               GIN
                     Exactly the kind of propaganda
                     shit they eat up in Beijing.  The
                     mainland would pay anything to get
                     its paws on th...

     As her shaking 'elderly' companion SPASMS, knocking the purse OUT
     of her hand, it CLATTERS to the floor, sending a hundred coins
     ROLLING in all directions.  Some under the rope.

                               MAC (old guy voice)
                     SHIT!  BLOODY HELL!!!

     And collapses to the hardwood floor in search of the coins, HOWLING
     as he BANGS his knees.  Some bystanders hurry to help.  And one of
     the guards.  As Mac tries to crawl under the rope to pursue
     coins...

     ...the guard STOPS him with a firm hand, pointing at the pidgen-
     English sign.  Meanwhile, calmly, very slowly...

     ...Gin crouches down to retrieve coins, the short skirt riding
     recklessly high on her upper thighs.  The two remaining guards
     hurry to help her.  Mac's guard, bystanders, all transfixed by the
     marginal preservation of her modesty.  Noticing the eye-lines all
     around, she confides to the nearest guard...

                               GIN (in Mandarin, helpful)
                     Those are the coins.  These
                     are my legs.

     Unnoticed, Mac is BANGING his wristwatch, which seems to have
     broken.  CLOSE on him now, manipulating a glide point DEVICE on
     the side of the watch, and we RACK FOCUS to see...

     ...one coin.  Inside the rope.  Move.

     As Mac checks to see all eyes are elsewhere, he guides the coin's
     slide slowly, inexorably, to...

     ...ATTACH itself magnetically.  To the steel pedestal.  Beneath the
     Bone's case.  As it does, Mac's watch BEEPS slightly, as we CLOSE
     on it to see...

     ...DATA flickering across its face.

                               MAC (old guy voice)
                     Amanda!  Time for my pills!

     INT. NOODLE SHOP, TAIPEI - DAY

     Gin and Mac at a long communal table, ignored, by Taiwanese couples,
     families, businessmen, chattering loudly all around them.  Gin
     looking down at her bowl, she's barely touched her meal...

                               GIN
                     ...no, I don't think that way.

     Glances up.  Mac is eating heartily, happily.

                               GIN
                     ...and I suppose you do?

                               MAC
                     Get lonely?  Sure, all the time.
                     It's healthy.

     Stuffs his mouth full.  Talking around it...

                               MAC
                     What's unhealthy.  Is denial.

     She's studying him as he eats.  Since he's not looking at her,
     Gin's eyes are thoughtful, appraising.

                               GIN
                     Be real.  you could never see
                     yourself...you know, quitting the
                     game.  Settling...down.

     And he looks up.  Direct to her eyes.  A dead straight, heart-
     stopping look.  Before the wonderful smile.

                               MAC
                     Why, Ginger.  This is so sudden.

     She cuts him a hard look.  Not funny.

     INT. MUSEUM - DAY

     Late afternoon, the place has closed.  Four armed GUARDS,
     accompanied by a museum OFFICIAL, push a large DOLLY across the
     hardwood floor, heels clicking, wheels rumbling softly, into...

     ...the room we've seen.  The dolly stops by the display case of the
     priceless oracle Bone.  The four guards position themselves around
     the triple-paned bulletproof case.  It will be a bitch to lift.

     The official has a key.  He inserts this into the lock of the
     titanium frame which holds the case to the steel pedestal.  And
     as it CLICKS, we...

     SMASH CUT TO...

     INT. NOODLE SHOP - DAY

     Mac's arm rising with noodle-laden chopsticks, the wristwatch
     BEEPING softly.  He drops the chopsticks, rising in one fluid
     motion as Gin does the same, throwing some bills on the table,
     he leads her...

     ...OUT the door, INTO the street, step OFF the curb, turn, DROP
     flat on his back, SLIDE DOWN the gutter, Gin following a split-
     second behind...

     INT. TUNNEL LOADING DOCK

     A train car stands, pulled up to a loading dock.  Two SOLDIERS with
     assault rifles on the train's rear platform, waiting.  Along one
     side of the tracks, a gravel roadway.  An open air Jeep-type
     military vehicle stands empty.  One of our soldiers speaks into a
     walkie-talkie, watching a huge steel DOOR at the entrance to the
     loading dock, which...

     ...OPENS now.  Through it come the four armed museum guards,
     surrounding the dolly which carries the Bone's massive bulletproof
     display case.  The official is with them, and hands paperwork to
     one of the waiting soldiers, as the museum guards LIFT the case,
     and carry it onto the train.

     INT. TUNNEL SHAFT

     An empty stretch of dimly-lit track, somewhere down the line.
     Silent.  PAN up, way up, to...

     ...the shadows of a huge air vent.  Must be vent #1, because two
     FIGURES are crouched there, as close as lovers.  Even we can barely
     make them out, until we CLOSE to hear the hushed...

                               GIN (strapping on a backpack)
                     ...way we can use those in here.
                     I thought I was in charge of
                     this operat...

                               MAC
                     You're in charge of ego and worrying.
                     I'm in charge of keeping you alive.

     He is holding something dull gray and small.  It looks like a trun-
     cated nerf football with one end pointed and the other cut blunt.

                               MAC
                     These are plasma jet.  All the
                     force is directed forward, instead
                     of dissipating in a sphere like a
                     grenade.

     He has four of these.  Gives her three.

                               GIN
                     I don't need th...

                               MAC (whispers)
                     Shut up.

     He reaches out, gently...

                               MAC
                     You don't trust me, you won't get
                     through this.

     Touches her face.

                               MAC
                     Try to adjust to that for three
                     more days.  After July 1...

     Stares in her eyes.

                               MAC
                     ...you'll never have to trust again.

     And smiles.  One more whisper...

                               MAC
                     Something.  To look forward to.

     INT. TUNNEL LOADING DOCK

     The museum guards are back on the landing with the official.  Our
     two soldiers stand facing them from the rear platform of the train
     car, as...

     The train RUMBLES to life.  Ready to go.

     INT. MUSEUM

     Two guards arrive with a hand truck to carry off the empty
     pedestal, which once supported the Bone's case.  One tilts the top
     of the pedestal back, supporting its weight, as the other stoops to
     lift the base, and...

     ...stops.  He sees the coin.  Oddly flat against the pedestal's
     shaft.  He kneels, tries to lift the coin, but the magnet HOLDS it
     fast.  He looks up to his companion.  Then...

     ...PEELS the coin free, the other guard reaches for it, the first
     guard YANKS it away, and it FLIES from his hand, INTO the wall, and
     drops.  As the guards go to look, the coin's back has come away.
     Revealing...

     ...electronics.

     INT. TUNNEL LOADING DOCK

     An ALARM SHRIEKS at a deafening level.  Five museum GUARDS BURST
     through the doorway, LEAP from the landing, pile into the Jeep, and
     BLAST OFF down the gravel roadway after the departed train.

     INT. BARRACKS ENTRANCE

     A much larger landing at the other end of the tunnel, facing back
     the opposite way.  The ALARM SCREAMS here, too, and massive steel
     doors CLANG open, as 25 SOLDIERS with assault rifles SWARM out onto
     the landing, taking up sharpshooter positions, weapons pointing
     back up the track.

     INT. AIR VENT #1

     Mac and Gin crouched in the vent, high above the track, gas masks
     dangle around their necks, magnet paddles from their wrists,
     various objects from their belt loops.  The alarm ECHOES,
     absolutely EAR-SPLITTING.  She leans to shout in his ear...

                               GIN
                     WE HAVE TO ABORT!

     Above the siren, we can now hear the TRAIN coming...

                               MAC
                     HOW DO YOU EXPECT TO MAKE A CAREER
                     OF THIS, IF YOU CAN'T TAKE A LITTLE
                     INCONVENIENCE?

     The train LOUDER, closer, the alarm BLARING...

                               GIN
                     THEY'VE GOT AN ARMY DOWN TH...

                               MAC
                     I can do this.

     Quietly.  Straight in her eyes.  The train ROARS into view, FLASHES
     beneath them, as he GRABS her wrist and...

     ...JUMPS, HURTLING DOWN, both STRIKING the empty rear platform,
     Gin slipping off, but he HOLDS her fast, SWIPING with his magnet
     which...

     ...CLANKS hard, LOCKS solid.  He PULLS her onto the platform,
     she looks dazed, clinging to him, he tugs her gas mask into place,
     slips on his own, and...

     ...FITS a magnetic DEVICE from his belt loop ONTO the door
     lock, SPINS a dial on the device, which POPS the lack OPEN,
     Mac BURSTING...

     ...THROUGH the door, lobbing a GAS GRENADE at the startled guards,
     who try to whirl and FIRE through the fog of red smoke, two wild
     SHOTS above the rolling Mac, and they are felled by the gas where
     they stand.  Gin races in, falling on her butt, as the car ROCKS
     along the track.  Points OUT the window...

                               GIN (through mask)
                     THERE'S THE NUMBER TWO VENT, ONLY
                     45 SECONDS TO THE THIRD!

     Scrambling to her feet, Mac wheeling toward the Bone.

                               GIN (through mask)
                     TEST THE CASE!

     He THROWS a handful of coins at the glass case, and purple UV BEAMS
     ARC from the glass to FRY the coins in midair.  Mac pulls a dull
     rectangle the size of a cigar box from Gin's backpack, as we
     SMASH CUT to...

     INT. TUNNEL

     The Jeep BLASTING after the train at crazy speed, the four non-
     drivers with weapons at the ready...

     INT. BARRACKS LANDING

     TROOPS FILL the platform, and have spilled onto the tracks, enough
     weapons to dust Butch and Sundance.

     INT. TRAIN

     Mac operating the cigar box which is actually a customized
     OSCILLOSCOPE, with countless KNOBS and a SCREEN which displays
     WAVE PATTERNS.  The machine is emitting SHRILL whistling TONES
     that cut through even the siren.

                               GIN (through mask)
                     TAKE IT TO 30 AND CLIMB!

     Mac SPINS the dials and two overhead light bulbs BLOW.  The glass
     case housing a fire ax SHATTERS.  The Bone's case is untouched.

     SMASH CUT to...

     INT. TUNNEL

     WITH the Jeep, BOMBING around a curve to SEE the train at last.  WE
     OPEN FIRE, accelerating after the train with everything we've got,
     gravel FLYING like shrapnel, and up ahead...

     ...the train's windows BLOW OUT, the tunnel SHOWERED with glass
     fragments.  SMASH CUT...

     INT. TRAIN

     Mac JUICING the box, the deafening TONE competing with the sirens,
     the gunshots, Gin SHRIEKING as she points through a blasted-out
     window...

                               GIN (through mask)
                     THIRD VENT GONE!

     And the Bone's case EXPLODES, Gin WHIRLING away to protect her
     face, as we SMASH CUT to...

     INT. TUNNEL

     The Jeep now ALONGSIDE the rear platform of the train.  The driver
     fighting to hold it steady, as...

     ...the guards begin to CLAMBER over the side, GRASPING for the
     platform's rails, one goes DOWN screaming onto the tracks, but two
     MAKE IT, then a third, they BURST...

     ...INTO the train to see...

     Nothing.  Two groggy, half-conscious soldiers.  Discarded gas
     masks, oscilloscope.  No Mac.  No Gin.  And inside the shattered
     case...

     A chicken bone.  The pack-rat strikes again.

     INT. TUNNEL

     Mac and Gin FLATTENED to the side of the train above the window
     line, held fast by their magnets.  We are on the opposite side from
     the gravel path, so the train screens us from the jeep.  SHOUTING
     above the din...

                               GIN
                     THERE'S THE FOURTH!

     Up ahead an AIR VENT looms, we are HURTLING toward it.  Mac and Gin
     each free one hand, reach into their backpacks for...

                               GIN
                     OUR LAST CHANCE, THE FIFTH IS
                     AT THE BARRACKS!

     ...twin GRAPNEL GUNS, which look like big 9mm pistols, but with a
     blunt, round end.  As we STREAK toward the VENT, Gin lifts her gun,
     SHOOTS at it, a cable-attached PROJECTILE EXPLODING toward the
     target, OPENING in mid-flight to a three-pronged HOOK, which...

     ...FALLS just SHORT, the hook tumbling to CLANG on the tracks, as
     Mac...

     ...FIRES his, the projectile EXPLODING, the hook OPENING and...

     ...BITES into the wall, only four feet from the vent, its cable
     stretching back to the gun in Mac's hand, we're almost there, and
     Mac slips the pistol...

     ...INTO Gin's free hand.

                               GIN
                     WHAT ABOUT YOU?

                               MAC
                     ALLOW US A MOMENT OF CHIVALRY.

     Their eyes meet.  He sees her hesitate to abandon him.

                               MAC
                     FIRST RULE.  SAVE NUMBER ONE.

     They FLASH PAST the vent, Mac RELEASES her magnet, Gin's freed hand
     GRASPING to join the other at the pistol, as she...

     ...ROCKETS up, CATAPULTED back toward the vent by the retractable
     cable, as a RIFLE APPEARS from a window beneath us, taking aim at
     Gin, and Mac...

     KICKS it off line, the shot BOOMING, the guard almost dropping
     the weapon, then SWINGING it back UP, slamming the muzzle directly
     INTO Mac's GROIN, as Mac...

     ...GRASPS the barrel, YANKING it up, SLIPS the shot SCREAMING past
     his head, PULLING the guard half out the window to KICK his face,
     sending him DOWN to the tracks, as we CAREEN around a curve, seeing
     in distance now...

     ...the END of the line, the massive BARRACKS LANDING, the phalanx
     of TROOPS, the fifth and final AIR VENT midway between us.  Mac's
     free hand pulls out...

     ...the lone PLASMA GRENADE he kept for himself, and as we CAREEN
     toward the troops, Mac HEAVES the grenade uptrack, and it...

     ...EXPLODES in a horrifying FIREBALL, which RIPS UP the train
     tracks, COLLAPSING a section of tunnel wall ONTO the gravel path, a
     choking CLOUD of yellow SMOKE filling the tunnel, obscuring
     everything, our train ROCKETING...

     ...TOWARD the flames, nearly AT the metal SUPPORT BEAM which runs
     vertically up to the final air vent, and as the train FLASHES PAST
     it, Mac...

     LUNGES out, SLAMMING both magnets ONTO the support beam, the
     momentum FLATTENING his body fully horizontal like a flag on a
     pole, the train PLUNGING ON without him, as guards shoot blindly
     back from the windows, the jeep PLOWING full tilt INTO the rubble
     of tunnel wall, the train...

     ...DERAILING in a terrifying CRUSH of twisted metal, screams,
     shouts, the smoke and flame everywhere, and we SNAP TO...

     REVERSE ANGLE...the soldiers' POV from the landing, SCATTERING as
     the derailed train HURTLES AT them, INTO them, chaos, until at last
     they see...

     ...above the clearing smoke, near the tunnel ceiling...

     ...Mac CLIMBING deftly up the support beam, magnets CLANKING, hand
     over hand, nearly at the vent, and the shouting troops...

     ...OPEN FIRE, bullets CHEWING UP the tunnel wall, as we SMASH CUT
     TO...

     INT. STORAGE ROOM - DAY

     Silence.  Cluttered, dimly-lit storage room.  Boxes of SHOES reach
     to the ceiling, Gucci, Bruno Magli, the good stuff.  Footsteps
     precede...

     ...a young SALESMAN, tailored, attractive.  He goes right to the
     shelf he needs.  Opens a box.  Takes it and two others.  As his
     steps recede, we PAN UP to...

     ...the ceiling.  The mesh grating, which soundlessly...

     ...slides away.  Gin DROPS lightly, twelve feet to the floor.
     Filthy from her adventure, she quickly unzips her backpack to
     remove...

     ...a sleek Halliburton case.  Opens it.  The Oracle Bone undamaged
     in its cushioned setting.  Steps returning, she is...

     ...OUT of her jumpsuit in a heartbeat, revealing a costly slip of a
     dress, kicks the jump suit under the bottom shelf, as...

     ...the young salesman APPEARS to find her peeking into a shoe box.
     He is startled.  She scowls at him, rubbing the grime from her
     face...

                               GIN (subtitled Mandarin)
                     There you are!  Do you know how
                     filthy this place is?

     Shows her dirty fingers as proof.

                               SALESMAN (subtitled Mandarin)
                     Madam, no one is supp...

                               GIN (subtitled Mandarin)
                     I'm looking for dress pumps, I'll
                     need eight pairs.

     Oh.

                               GIN (subtitled Mandarin)
                     Unless you're too busy to help me.

                               SALESMAN (subtitled Mandarin)
                     Well, no, I...

                               GIN (subtitled Mandarin)
                     Come to think of it, I need some
                     dresses for evening...

     Lifts the Halliburton case, slings her pack over her shoulder,
     strides to the doorway.  See the crowded upscale boutique...

                               GIN (subtitled Mandarin)
                     Are you coming?

     Out she goes.  And he follows.  Maybe he's on commission.

     INT. VENT - DAY

     Mac, very much alive, somewhat the worse for wear, crawling through
     a darkened pipe on his belly, toward...

     ...a grating.  Light filters through.  Reaching the screen, he
     squints through it.  Can't see shit.  Listens.  Nothing that rises
     above an ambient wooshing of air in the duct.  He grasps the wires,
     pushes, and...

     ...FALLS straight THROUGH, tumbling ten feet to CRASH LAND in a
     heap.  HEAR feminine SCREAMS before we look up to...

     ...three young WOMEN trying on lingerie, being attended by an older
     SALESWOMAN.  The girls are half-naked and as Mac rises, one THROWS
     a red lace TEDDY in his face.  He peels it off, and still holding
     the garment, calmly tells the saleswoman...

                               MAC (subtitled Mandarin)
                     It's all right, the security cameras
                     behind the mirrors are working again.

     At which the customers SHRIEK, cover themselves all the more, and
     begin screaming at the poor saleswoman.  During which...

                               MAC (subtitled Mandarin)
                     Well.  If everything is in order...

     All four women.  Look at him.

     EXT. LINGERIE SHOP, SHIN KONG MALL - SUNSET

     CLOSE on an entrance, just as Mac comes...

     ...FLYING THROUGH, propelled by two sizeable SECURITY GUARDS, once
     again landing in pieces.  It's a long day.  As Mac clears his head,
     they stand at the doorway with folded arms.  Hoping he wants some
     more.

                               MAC
                     WHAT KIND OF A COUNTRY IS THIS?  IN
                     BRITAIN, A MAN CAN TRY ON LINGERIE
                     WITHOUT COMPROMISING HIS DIGNITY!

     The bruisers look at each other.  No habla Espanol.

     EXT. KAOHSHING HARBOR, TAIWAN - DUSK

     A super TUGBOAT, engines RUMBLING, ready to pull out.  A woman
     paces the deck.  Every time we see her, she seems more tightly
     wrapped.  At last...

     ...here he comes, stepping briskly from the taxi, striding up the
     gangway, pulling from inside his coat...

     ...the red lace teddy.  He drapes it over her face, and she pulls
     it away, steps into his arms...

     ...her kiss is urgent.  Real.  HOLD on the look in her eyes.  What
     is she thinking?

     He strokes her hair, gently.  Then, goes to look into the
     Halliburton case, which stands by the rail.  As he crouches.  As he
     looks at the Bone...

     She is watching him.  An intensity to her gaze.  More feeling than
     she is comfortable with, which...

     ...disappears completely, as he turns to her.  And when he mimes
     FLINGING the case into the sea...

     She laughs.

     EXT. STATUE SQUARE, HONG KONG - DAY

     CLOSE on a British Petroleum BILLBOARD with a huge DIGITAL CLOCK,
     counting down by seconds...JUNE 29, 1997, 11:32 A.M. - 1 DAY, 12
     HOURS, 27 MINUTES, 48 SECONDS TO:  REUNION WITH CHINA!

     PAN to an AERIAL VIEW of...

     Hong Kong's bustling STATUE SQUARE, the hub of countless feeder
     streets and alleyways, as we ROAM to a SERIES OF SHOTS...

     ...billboards everywhere.  Western businesses that announce WE'LL
     STILL BE HERE FOR YOU.  Others, primarily British, sending
     farewells, gratitude for past patronage.  China-sponsored
     depictions of happy Hong Kong and Chinese citizens, proclaim ONE
     COUNTRY, TWO SYSTEMS.

     ...moving vans, people pushing carts of belongings, shop signs
     advertising blowout inventory clearance sales.  Traffic beyond
     gridlock.  The human ant colony.

     ...incredibly long queues in front of post offices, American
     Express, the imposing glass and steel skyscraper called the HONG
     KONG AND SHANGHAI BANK BUILDING.

     ...large groups of uniformed CHINESE SOLDIERS in the streets.  More
     orderly DEMONSTRATION by anti-China PROTESTERS, their signs say
     MORE DEMOCRACY and FREE HONG KONG, their numbers watched by Chinese
     soldiers, who in turn are watched by British soldiers.

     CLOSE on the square now.  A couple at a sidewalk vendor.  Mac is
     purchasing a t-shirt.  Gin dutifully lifts her arms, and Mac slips
     the garment over her head.  It says CHINA GOT HONG KONG, AND ALL I
     GOT WAS THIS LOUSY T-SHIRT.

     He regards her thoughtfully, and she turns, modeling for him as if
     wearing a Givenchy original.  He approves, lifts the Halliburton
     case, and they move on, strolling, chatting until Mac...

     ...bumps HARD into a Chinese SOLDIER, both men REELING with the
     impact.  The soldier carries an identical HALLIBURTON CASE, and the
     two men set their cases down side by side, as Mac steps forward...

                               MAC (subtitled Mandarin)
                     FUCKING HELL!  WATCH WHERE
                     YOU'RE GOING, MAN!

     No one notices, no one cares.  Gin tugs on Mac's arm, don't get
     involved, dear.  Mac reluctantly steps back.  The soldier glares at
     him.  Then, bends and picks up...

     ...Mac's case.  A parting epithet in Mandarin, and the soldier
     starts off.  Watching him, Mac unobtrusively fingers a concealed...

     ...PISTOL, ready for action.  But keeps watching, as within a few
     yards, the soldier...

     ...stops.  Opens the case.  Checks out the Oracle Bone, right there
     in the middle of the square.  Mac and Gin watching across the
     distance, with hair-trigger keenness.  At last the soldier CLOSES
     the case...

     ...walks back to us.

                               SOLDIER (subtitled Mandarin)
                     I believe I took your case.

     Handing it to Mac, he leans forward, and in low, aecented
     English...

                               SOLDIER
                     21 Old Peak Road.  In 45 minutes.

     Picks up his own case.  And is gone.

     EXT. MANSION, VICTORIA PEAK - DAY

     A vintage Aston Martin pulls up to a spectacular gated MANSION.
     Sparkling white, it is a blend of Edwardian and Regency.  Gin is
     driving, speaks into the voice box, and the gate swings open.  As
     they pull up the crushed rock driveway...

     ...a BUTLER appears, as British as the architecture.  Climbing from
     the car, Mac has the Halliburton case.

                               BUTLER
                     Will you please come this way?

     And leads them around the side of the house.  They walk slowly, a
     distance behind the butler, taking everything in.

                               MAC
                     I like this.

     His voice is strong, calm.  No hint of a smile.

                               GIN
                     You like wha...

                               MAC
                     Not being told what the fuck
                     we're doing.

     She looks equally serious.  Just more tense.

                               GIN
                     You're on a 'need to know' basis.
                     You'll get each step in time to
                     execute, I thought you agreed to
                     those condit...

                               MAC (quietly)
                     I like your not trusting me.
                     Because it frees me to do
                     the same.

     They come upon the spacious GROUNDS behind the mansion.  A
     breathtaking view down the slope of Victoria Peak to Hong Kong and
     the harbor.  Kowloon across the water.

                               GIN
                     I trust you.  I only need to...

                               MAC
                     ...remain in control.

     They pass a towering row of perfect ROSEBUSHES.  Mac SNAPS OFF a
     giant blossom.

                               MAC
                     Which is a sign of weakness.

     And hands it to her.  Their eyes meet.

                               MAC
                     I like that, too.

     At the edge of the garden, above the commanding view, a luncheon
     TABLE has been set.  Spread with delcacies.  Two SERVANTS attend,
     also British.

     Only the host is seated.  He does not rise.

                               GIN
                     Colonel

     Col. Qiu glances up from his meal.  Green PLA uniform, absurdly
     decorated, wraparound Gautier sunglasses.  We recognize him as the
     man who took Gin's call in his Mercedes in Tienanmen Square.  The
     man who accompanied the poor Minister of Finance to the ophthal-
     mologist.

                               QIU
                     You look lovely, Ginger.  Is
                     the rose for me?

                               GIN
                     Of course.

     And leans prettily.  To fasten it in the buttonhole of his lapel.

                               GIN
                     Col. Qiu Lai Chuen, this is
                     Andrew MacDougal.

     Hearing his real name, Mac cuts her a look.

                               GIN
                     Real names here, darling.  The
                     Colonel and I have every incentive
                     to keep each other's secrets.

     And she sits.  Close to Qiu.  Mac looks around at the property,
     the view.

                               QIU
                     Like the place, Andy?

                               MAC
                     Please.  Mr. MacDougal will do.

     The Colonel smiles.  First time.  Like an alligator.  Mac notices
     that the tablecloth is actually...

     ...a Union Jack.  He fingers the flag.

                               QIU
                     This way.  Doesn't matter if we
                     spill.

                               MAC
                     My sentiments exactly.

     He sits.

                               QIU
                     This place was a gift.  From
                     its former owner.  A Brit whose
                     business will now happily continue
                     to function.  Perhaps...even expand.

                               MAC (spreading his napkin)
                     Planning to spend much time here?

                               QIU
                     Tho it has required many sacrifices.

                               GIN
                     The Colonel has divorced his
                     wife.  To facilitate the necessary
                     entertaining of Western women.

                               QIU
                     Tho some are more entertaining
                     than others.

     And runs the back of his knuckles up the length of Gin's bare arm.

                               MAC
                     Colonel.  You are touching the woman
                     I love...

     Which brings Qiu's eyes over.  Really?

                               MAC
                     From time to time.

     And pulls up the Halliburton case.  Handing it across the table.
     As Qiu takes the case in his lap, opens it...

                               QIU
                     You're a Scot.  Would you like
                     some 25-year-old Macallan?

                               MAC
                     Sure, I'll take a case.

     Qiu glances across the lawn to the butler, who stands behind the
     bar trolley.  As the drinks are prepared, the Colonel studies the
     Bone.

                               GIN
                     The Colonel told his Minister
                     of Culture that he could mount
                     a surgical raid to liberate this
                     treasure from Taiwan.

                               MAC
                     Ah.  How much was the Minister
                     told the raid would cost?

                               QIU (not looking up)
                     Counting equipment, personnel,
                     bribes, an even fifty million
                     American.  All in.

                               MAC
                     Which you can now keep.

     The drinks arrive.

                               QIU
                     He would have paid twice that.
                     But my needs are modest.

     And lifts from beneath the table, a leather POUCH.

                               QIU
                     Unlike.  The woman you love.
                     From time to time.

     Drops it into Gin's lap.  She opens the pouch to reveal...

     ...goggles.  Like one would wear in a tanning salon.  Only these
     are flesh-colored with one small hole in the center of each lens.
     Slightly larger than the size of a pupil.

     She slips them on.  A bright smile.

                               GIN
                     How do I look, honey?

     And Mac smiles.  In return.

                               MAC
                     Like a woman.  Of mystery.

     INT. SUITE, PENINSULA HOTEL - LATE NIGHT

     Glass doors open WIDE to a terrace which overlooks Kowloon, the
     harbor, Hong Kong Island beyond.  More lights than stars in heaven.
     And speaking of heaven...

     ...the SOUNDS of lovemaking are fierce, feral, an urgent rhythm,
     part comic, part wondrous, and mostly, arousing enough to make us
     PAN TO...

     ...lovemaking in silhouette.  This is the lovemaking of tigers,
     mesmerizing to watch, ferocious enough to inspire envy, and
     somehow...

     ...tender enough.  To suggest real love.

     LATER...Mac and Gin sit before the open terrace.  There is wine and
     food and abandoned clothing all around them.  She has her pack
     drawn near.  And Qiu's leather pouch.  She removes the goggles...

     This is the moment.

                               GIN
                     In the Hong Kong and Shanghai
                     Bank Building.  Is a room with
                     two computers.  One for you.
                     And one for me.

                               MAC
                     Glad I have a function, here.

                               GIN
                     The room is a vault on the 14th
                     floor.  Access codes to that room
                     are changed daily, computer pass-
                     words on the hour, but...

     But.  She is electric, more alive than he's ever seen her.

                               GIN
                     Four men in the world.  Don't need
                     codes.  Their retinas will scan to
                     unlock everything.  One of these is
                     China's Minister of Finance.

     She lifts the goggles...

                               MAC
                     And his retinal plate is in there.

     Yep.

                               MAC
                     Our trade for the great train
                     robbery.  All right, let's say
                     we're in the door.  Now what?

     From her pack, she pulls a slender black rectangle.  Opens it to
     reveal a shiny metallic DISC.

                               GIN
                     Hong Kong has a huge portion of its
                     holdings invested in foreign banks.
                     In hundreds of separate accounts...

     Holds up the metallic disc.

                               GIN
                     This CD ROM is programmed to send,
                     instantaneously, thousands of instruc-
                     tions, with all necessary confirmation
                     codes, to transfer reasonably modest
                     sums out of those accounts....

                               MAC
                     Modest.

                               GIN
                     Two or three million at a crack,
                     in odd numbers.  Total, eight
                     billion.  And change.

                               MAC
                     And you've set up a laundry.

                               GIN
                     Every wire transfer gets rocketed
                     through a series of multiple switches,
                     Austria, Uruguay, Antigua, The Channel
                     Islands, the Caymans...

                               MAC (quietly)
                     Seychelles?

                               GIN (beat)
                     I left that out.

                               MAC
                     You're forgiven.

                               GIN
                     Thank you.  As soon as each deposit
                     lands somewhere, it's shot somewhere
                     else, til the Mafia couldn't find it.

                               MAC
                     But those first instructions,
                     transferring the 8 billion dollars.
                     They're recorded in the main computer.

     She waggles the disc.

                               GIN
                     Nope.  The CD instructs the computer
                     to erase the real transactions.
                     And replace them in its memory
                     with an innocuous loan coded XJ6.
                     Little homage to Limeyland, there.

                               MAC
                     Dearest.  The accounts won't
                     reconcile.

     She waggles the disc.  Again.

                               GIN
                     Wrong.  The CD instructs the computer
                     to over-report all account totals
                     forever, in the exact amounts we've
                     lifted.  So the Chinese think the
                     money's still there.

     On this one.  He has to smile.

                               MAC
                     The money.  Is still.  Missing.

                               GIN
                     Sure, the foreign banks know
                     they sent out some money.  But
                     they think Hong Kong knows it,
                     too.  And since we're leaving
                     plenty in every account...

                               MAC
                     The shit doesn't splatter.  Until
                     the first account runs dry.

     Exactly.

                               GIN
                     And then.  Comes the really
                     brilliant part of the whole
                     thing!

                               MAC
                     I was hoping there'd be one.

     He settles back.  Looks at her.

                               GIN
                     Admit it, so far you're
                     blown away.

     Well...

                               MAC
                     It does sound like the beginning
                     of a beautiful friendship.

     And his fingers reach out...

                               MAC
                     Pity it will be over.  In
                     21 hours.

     Touch her hair.  Her face.  She swallows.  A raw moment.  A
     hoarse...

                               GIN
                     Bet you say that.  To all the
                     one-night-stands.

     But he's just staring in her eyes.  The look pins her.  She can't
     wriggle off.  A murmured...

                               MAC
                     No, ma'am...

     He leans to her...

                               MAC
                     Only the best of them.

     They kiss.

     EXT. STATUE SQUARE - ROUND MIDNIGHT

     CLOSE on the British Petroleum billboard, where the countdown CLOCK
     says...JUNE 30, 1997, 11:41 P.M., 0 DAYS, 0 HOURS, 18 MINUTES, 51
     SECONDS TO:  REUNION WITH CHINA!

     The square is beyond BEDLAM.  Times Square looks deserted New
     Year's Eve compared to this carnival CRUSH of humanity, rock and
     rolling as if reunion with China was the doorway to Paradise.

     Singing, chanting, screaming, dancing, music and booze everywhere,
     firecrackers exploding, soldiers and civilians, tycoons and
     hookers, tourists and peddlers and Party members and homeless,
     going absolutely nuts.

     Who knows.  Could be the last party.  Ever.

     WHIP PAN to the crowded plaza in front of the towering glass-and-
     steel headquarters of the HONG KONG AND SHANGHAI BANK.

     ZOOM to focus on our smashing couple in evening wear, Gin with a
     large beaded shoulder bag.  Mac presents an invitation to a PLA
     soldier, who admits them into...

     INT. PUBLIC LOBBY, HONG KONG AND SHANGHAI BANK

     ...a VIP party going full blast in the lobby of this truly
     breathtaking structure.  A central ATRIUM rises 47 floors, creating
     a soaring clear core, around which the offices and working spaces
     are ringed.  The view straight up is interrupted only at three
     well-spaced levels, where thick CANOPIES of glass, stitched
     together with spidery skeletons of steel, SPAN the open core.
     Mac looks up...

     ...at the balcony railings surrounding the atrium, the revelers
     have been granted access to the lower five floors.  Above these,
     all is empty.

                               MAC
                     Nice of the Colonel to provide an
                     invitation...

     She is guiding him toward one of the multiple hors d'oeuvre
     stations.  Half the celebrants seem to be armed PLA soldiers, many
     with rifles slung boldly across their shoulders.

                               GIN
                     Well, I promised him a bonus.
                     Five million.  Comes out of
                     your share.

                               MAC
                     ...long as I don't have to have
                     sex with him.

     Mac loads up on six hors d'oeuvres, piling them on a napkin, as
     she takes two flutes of champagne.  They step away from the mob
     toward a potted plant near the wall, and Mac...

     ...drops his snacks with a SPLAT.  Shit.  Bending to clean the
     mess, he slips from his waistband a flat CIRCUIT BOARD with a
     bank logo and a three-pronged plug.  In a single motion, he plugs
     it INTO a socket concealed by the pot, scoops up his canapes,
     and we CUT TO...

     INT. SURVEILLANCE ROOM

     Three SECURITY OFFICERS blink, as ALL FIFTY monitor screens go
     HAYWIRE at once.  The images compressed to a blur of lines between
     a series of diagonal SLACK BARS that slash across the screens.  The
     way your TV acts when the horizontal hold goes out.  They can't
     believe it.

     Stumped, they start slamming buttons, flipping switches, jabbering
     to each other.  Now the images begin to ROLL vertically, as if in
     response to their attempts at adjustment.

     Welcome to the world of high tech.

     INT. ELEVATOR BANK

     Mac and Gin wait with a party of older Brits, who've had plenty
     to drink and are carrying more.  Two armed soldiers flank the
     elevators.  A car arrives.  As the Brits enter...

                               MAC (politely)
                     We'll take the next one.

     Waiting, calmly.  Mac smiles at a soldier.

                               MAC (subtitled Mandarin)
                     What time tomorrow do the tanks
                     roll in?

     The guy LAUGHS.  An elevator arrives.  Gin sipping champagne as
     they enter.

     The doors CLOSE.  They are alone.  The panel has floors 1 through
     5 lit.  The other numbers, 6-10 and 16-47, are dark.  There are NO
     numbers 11-15.

     Mac pulls from his pocket a small flat DEVICE, not much thicker
     than a credit card, with a window and a series of LED lights
     on its face.  He fits it into a SLOT beside a black glass PLATE
     on the elevator panel.  Immediately, the LEDs scramble, all RED,
     numbers FLASH across the card's window, as the device begins
     to lock on the elevator code.  In sequence, the LEDs turn GREEN,
     and...

     ...the glass plate LIGHTS, announcing in Kanji and English...ACCES
     GRANTED TO FLOORS 11, 12, 14, 15.  Mac presses the lit number 14.

     The elevator RISES.  He looks over at her.  She is tight enough
     to snap.  We can feel her heart racing from here.

                               MAC
                     So all that time, sitting at your
                     computers.  All the research, the
                     access codes your job allowed you
                     to steal, floor plans, schematics...
                     setting up all your bank accounts...

     She looks irritated.  He is smiling, gently.

                               MAC
                     Years of work, comes down to....
                               (checks his watch)
                     ...six minutes.  Don't be
                     nervous.  Easy come, easy go.

     She looks away.  The elevator stops.

                               MAC
                     Your share prob'ly works out
                     to, what?  Dollar and a quarter
                     an hour?

     Me laughs.  The door opens.  She is pissed off.

                               GIN
                     What's your point?

                               MAC (very real)
                     That I like you, Ginger.

     Now they're staring at each other.  An open elevator door.  An
     empty dim hallway.  They see only each other.

                               MAC
                     The dedication, the skill,
                     the guts...

     He holds out the crook of his arm.  As a gentleman escorts a lady.

                               MAC
                     I'm going to see you get
                     everything you deserve.

     Her eyes flicker on that.  So he grins...

                               MAC
                     Woman.  If you can't have
                     fun, right now.  You're in
                     the wrong business.

     She looks in his eyes.  Her body seems to relax, just a little.
     She takes his arm.

     INT. 14TH FLOOR

     CLOSE on a KEYPAD.  Next to it, a mirrored PLATE with two
     APERTURES, set apart the distance of human eyes.  Gin's goggled
     face DROPS into frame, reflected in the mirrored surface.  She
     fits her eyes to the apertures...

                               GIN (whispers)
                     Open.  Sesame.

     A red scanning light APPEARS.  Tracks vertically.  BEEPS.  Tracks
     horizontally.  And from somewhere...

     ...a soft CLICK.  PULL BACK now, to see...

     They stand at what seems the door to a BANK VAULT.  Round,
     gigantic, heavy steel.  Bolts eyerywhere.  Mac reaches to GRASP
     the handle, and...

     CLANG.  The door swings OPEN.  They stare at the inner sanctum...

     ...a windowless ROOM.  Dim, eerie fluorescence.  A blast of white
     noise from the elaborate air-cooling system.  Two large MAINFRAME
     COMPUTERS face each other from opposite walls, desks and work
     stations with PC monitors filling the space between.  As Mac closes
     the vault door behind them...

     ...Gin goes quickly to the smaller mainframe.  Pulls the high-
     resolution monitor around on its adjustable arm.  The screensaver
     displays Guernsey cows swimming among tropical fish.  She hits a
     key.  The screen saver replaced by, WELCOME.  AUTHORIZATION MODE
     PLEASE.  Two boxes for PASSWORD and SCAN.  She hits SCAN.  A
     plastic shield RISES, revealing...

     ...the mirrored PLATE, the tiny APERTURES.  Gin leans to fit her
     goggled eyes in place.  The red scanning light.  Vertical track.
     BEEP.  Horizontal track.  And the monitor announces...WELCOME
     MINISTER FEIHONG.  Gin takes off the goggles, and...

     ...THROWS them across the room to Mac at the larger mainframe.  As
     he repeats the scanning process, Gin is loading the precious CD-ROM
     into her mainframe's driver.  Watches the screen...

                               GIN
                     Uploading.  And you've got...
                     two minutes, fifty seconds.

     WITH Mac now.  Typing the words CONTROL PANEL.  The screen now
     shows icons for time setting, and he clicks his mouse to create a
     CLOCK in the center of the screen, labeled LOCAL TIME, and reading
     11:57:19, changing with each second that passes...

                               MAC
                     So let's see.  Across town at
                     the British Consulate...

     INTERCUT...frenzied activity in a large war room filled with
     computers, wall screens, every worker functioning at top speed...
     CONTINUE to hear Mac over this...

                               MAC (V.O.)
                     ...everyone is working frantically
                     to complete transactions before
                     they go off-line at midnight.

     CUT BACK to Mac in the vault.  He clicks his mouse to create a
     clock at the LEFT of the screen, labeled BRITISH TERMINAL TIME.
     It is, of course, showing the same time as the local clock.

                               MAC
                     ...then, deep in the high-tech
                     bowels of the Bank of China
                     Building, just across the square...

     INTERCUT...an even larger war room, even better staffed and
     equipped.  Everyone...doing...nothing.  Staring at blank monitors
     and wall screens.

                               MAC (V.O.)
                     ...the Chinese are sitting on
                     their thumbs, waiting to come
                     on-line at midnight.

     CUT BACK to Mac in the vault.  He clicks his mouse to create
     another clock at the RIGHT of the screen, labeled CHINA TERMINAL
     TIME.  Shows the same time as the other clocks.  11:58:22.

                               MAC
                     I feel for these boys.  Let's
                     give them a breather, hmmn?

     CLICKS the mouse, and the BRITISH TERMINAL TIME begins FLASHING.

                               MAC
                     We'll let the Brits go off-line
                     4 seconds early.

     As the flashing clock reaches 11:58:30, and Mac HITS the key four
     times, advancing the British clock to 34 seconds, four seconds
     later than the others.

                               MAC
                     And we'll give our new Chinese
                     overlords 4 extra seconds of rest
                     before they have to go on-line.

     As the local and Chinese clocks reach 40 seconds, Mac HITS the key
     four times, regressing the Chinese clock back to 36 seconds.

     We watch all three clocks, clicking down the last moments of
     British rule.  The British clock is 4 seconds FAST, the Chinese
     clock 4 seconds SLOW.

                               MAC
                     Playing God here, Ginger.  We've
                     created 8 seconds that do not
                     exist, anywhere but in this room.

     LOCAL TIME...11:59:00.  One minute to midnight.

                               MAC
                     8 seconds, where no one is on-line
                     but your little CD-Rom.

     He turns around.  Her eyes are waiting.  Across the room.

                               MAC
                     And when, eventually, everyone
                     discovers what transaction XJ6
                     was really about...

                               GIN
                     China will think it happened
                     before midnight.  Britain will
                     swear it happened after midnight...

                               MAC
                     They'll each be positive.  The
                     other guy.  Did it.

     Mac sighs.  This is a sad thing.

                               MAC
                     Liable to be an ugly international
                     incident.

     She squints across at his clock.

                               GIN
                     Britain off-line in 18 seconds.
                     We're bulletproof.

     His smile returns.  Bittersweet and real...

                               MAC
                     Baby girl.  Nothing.  Is
                     bulletproof.  Ever.

     The look holds.  He turns back to his screen.  She lingers on him
     for an instant.  Then, back to the mainframe, finger poised above
     her ENTER key...

                               MAC
                     Britain goes bye-bye in 6...
                     5...4...3.

     INTERCUT...The British Consulate.  All screens go DARK.  A logo
     APPEARS of a POPPING Champagne BOTTLE, whose spray forms a Union
     Jack twined with a PRC flag, everyone SHOUTS, cheers or curses, and
     we SMASH CUT...

     BACK to Gin...striking ENTER, the screen flashing TRANSACTIONS XJ6
     PROCESSING.

                               GIN (softly)
                     Jesus God, it's going through.

                               MAC (watching his clocks)
                     Hong Kong midnight, happy new year.
                     Except at China Bank.

                               GIN (to her screen)
                     C'mon, c'mon...

     Her screen flashes TRANSACTIONS XJ6 COMPLETED, hear her SHRIEK of
     ecstasy, as we...

     INTERCUT...Bank of China where dark screens suddenly LIGHT with the
     same stupid PARTY LOGO.  Only nobody cheers.  They just get to
     work.

     BACK TO the vault...

                               MAC
                     Feel like a nightcap?

     But across the way, Gin is JAMMING a button.  Again.  Again.

                               GIN
                     The CD won't come out of
                     the driver.

     Houston.  We have a problem.

                               MAC
                     Relax, don't jam it...

                               GIN (jamming it)
                     FUCKING THING!!

     He crosses the room.  She's rummaging on a nearby desk, finds a
     LETTER OPENER.

                               MAC
                     Don't panic, now, there's no rush...

                               GIN
                     We can't leave it IN THERE, it's
                     got all our accounts, everything
                     that can NAIL us to a goddam CROSS!!

     She's fitting the letter opener INTO the narrow slot above the lid
     of the driver.

                               MAC
                     Easy with that, there's no ru...

     WHOOP!  WHOOP!  WHOOP!  WHOOP!  Every SIREN in the skyscraper is
     SHRIEKING, lights are FLASHING CRIMSON, Gin's screen says SECURITY
     BREACH in a selection of languages.

     Gin just staring at it.

                               GIN
                     There's a rush.

     The sirens are EAR-SPLITTING.  We know that elsewhere in this
     building, all hell must be breaking loose.  Gin is YANKING Mac's
     arm out of the socket...

                               GIN
                     LET'S MOVE IT, WHAT ARE YOU
                     WAITING F...

                               MAC
                     The disc.  Is still in there.

     Yeh.  She stares at it.  Really scared.

                               GIN
                     We can't help it, we...we've
                     gotta...

     He stares at her.  In one motion, he SNATCHES a stapler from the
     desk and SMASHES the driver with all his strength.

     It pops open.  Calmly, he plucks her CD from the tray.  She mouths
     a barely audible...

                               GIN
                     What a guy.

     But just as she's about to bolt...he holds up one hand.  Slips
     another CD from his pocket.  We see the words KENNY G.

                               MAC
                     Was wondering where to leave
                     this...

     Pops it IN the drive.  SLAMS it shut.

                               MAC (quietly)
                     Time to go.

     INT. CORRIDOR

     Mac and Gin RUNNING full tilt through the siren BLARE, turning a
     corner to see ahead...

     ...the balcony railing, the building's empty central CORE.  Mac
     BOLTS straight TOWARD it, Gin sprinting to follow, lungs pounding,
     they reach the railing, looking DOWN to see...

     Hysteria, unimaginable chaos.  Soldiers, black-tie partygoers,
     SCRAMBLING in all directions, looking to his left Mac sees...

     ...the bank of ELEVATORS, soldiers POURING in, some cars already
     RISING, fourth floor, fifth.  Now he looks directly BELOW, where...

     ...soldiers are POUNDING up the metal service staircase, the front
     rank almost at the third floor.  In the lobby, some faces look up
     to see us, but no one is shooting.

                               GIN
                     They don't know we're the
                     bad guys.

     He PLUNGES his hand into her shoulder bag...

                               MAC
                     Time they find out.

     Pulls OUT two PLASMA GRENADES, and FLINGS one toward the elevator
     cables three floors down and it...

     ...EXPLODES in a horrifying FIREBALL, causing PANDEMONIUM in the
     lobby below, the elevator cables BLOWN AWAY, cars PLUNGING, the
     yellow smoke momentarily screening us from the soldiers far below,
     and Mac HURLS the second grenade...

     ...STRAIGHT DOWN and the fireball WIPES OUT the staircase, a huge
     section of ninth floor landing RAINING down on the lobby.

                               GIN
                     Okay.  How do we get down?

                               MAC
                     Down?  I never liked down.

     Grabs her hand and they RACE to the staircase, as smoke BILLOWS
     everywhere below.  UP they go, two stairs at a time, the lowest
     glass-and-spiderweb-steel CANOPY is three floors above us, the
     cacophany of SHOUTS below is like an amplified insane asylum.

     He is dragging her now, up, up, BULLETS are flying blind through
     the smoke, CHEWING up metal and glass all around us, up, up, and
     as the smoke at last clears, they have reached...

     ...the canopy floor.  They can see the army down below.  Clutching
     her hand, Mac leads her OVER the railing, ONTO the canopy itself,
     and together they RUN...

     ...straight ACROSS the heavy glass toward the far side of the
     building, like space-walking above the throng 150 feet below,
     BULLETS now TRACING their path from beneath, SLAMMING OFF the
     underside of the bulletproof canopy, Gin SHRIEKING with fright
     as they go.  We see ahead...

     ...three EXECUTIVE ELEVATORS beginning to climb the far wall.
     These are glass-enclosed tubes, all filled with soldiers, the car
     in the lead already at the tenth floor.  Mac keeps running straight
     TOWARD them.

                               GIN (out of breath)
                     WE'VE GOT ONE MORE GRENADE!

                               MAC (not)
                     SAVE IT FOR A RAINY DAY!

     They make it to the edge of the canopy, the lead elevator only two
     floors below them.  We can see the soldiers through the glass.  Mac
     GRASPS her hand, and as the car nears our level...

                               MAC
                     You can do this.

     They LEAP across five feet of open air to...

     ...LAND squarely on the car's metal roof, Mac WRAPPING his free arm
     AROUND the cable, and UP we go.  The ant colony below us receding
     fast.

     Gin is hanging onto the cable, petrified.  Mac is looking up toward
     the roof.

                               GIN
                     Okay, now what?

                               MAC (absently)
                     Shut up.  You're on a 'need-to-
                     know' basis.

                               GIN
                     Mac, I'm sorry.

     He looks at her.  Just now, she seems more miserable than afraid.

                               GIN
                     Turns out, I'm a screw-up.

     He doesn't smile.  Passing the third canopy.

                               MAC
                     Well.  Something to be said for
                     being self-aware.

     Looks back up.  Forty-first floor.  Six to go.

                               MAC
                     May I have the last grenade, dear.
                     It's about to rain.

     She blinks.  Huh?  So he reaches into her bag, pulls out the
     grenade, and THROWS it...

     ...STRAIGHT up.  The roof above them EXPLODES in a FIREBALL, and
     SHIELDS her body against the wall of their shaft, as a huge SECTION
     of roof comes RAINING down.  We watch as it...

     ...CRASHES through the upper canopy, TONS of roof and glass
     PLUNGING to...

     ...BLAST through the middle canopy, everyone below SCRAMBLING for
     shelter, as the whole shebang...

     ...EXPLODES through the lowest canopy.  Gin can only GAPE at the
     incredible display.  Mouthing a silent WOW.

     They've passed the second canopy, thirty-sixth floor.  Still
     climbing.  The other two elevators maybe five floors below us.

                               MAC
                     You see, banking will be more
                     democratic under China.

     She looks to him.

                               MAC
                     Well.  No more glass ceiling.

     The elevator car has STOPPED.  We are at the roof.  The soldiers
     are in the car beneath our feet, nowhere to get out.  Above our
     heads.

     ...the last few feet of elevator cable.  And starry sky, where our
     patch of roof used to be.

                               MAC
                     How refreshing.  The night air.

     He begins to shimmy up the few feet of cable.  At the top, he
     reaches out with one hand toward the lip of the remaining roof,
     GRABS it, LUNGES with his free hand, and...

     ...DANGLING 47 floors, he pulls himself UP, swings ONTO the roof.
     Reaches back down.  She is only twelve feet below him.  Frozen with
     fear.

                               GIN
                     I can't do this.

                               MAC
                     You can.  If I say so.

     She stares up at his eyes.  He smiles.

                               MAC
                     If you stay.  You'll have to pay
                     for the damage...

     She looks down at the mess below.

     And starts to climb the cable.  Not so easy in a ball gown, but the
     adrenaline is pumping.  Gets to the top.  Here's the hard part.
     One hand reaches out...

     ...GRABS his.  She lets GO.  And she is DANGLING in space.

                               MAC
                     Now that split.  Did we say
                     60-40?

     And with all his strength, hauls her up onto...

     ...the roof.  Two-thirds of it remain.  At the far edge, a gigantic
     MAINTENANCE CRANE, itself two stories high.  But between here and
     the crane...

     ...a HELICOPTER.  Big and beautifUl and empty.  She looks like
     she's seen God.  Mac starts to jog toward it, she runs to follow
     but sees him go...

     ...straight PAST the chopper.

                               GIN
                     HEY!

     He turns back.

     She points to the copter.  It's over here.

                               MAC
                     Got the keys?

     Oh.

                               GIN
                     I thought you could...hot-wire
                     stuff?

     Guess not.

                               MAC
                     They fix those things so you
                     can't steal them...

     And keeps walking.  Toward the monster CRANE.

                               MAC
                     These, they're not so worried.

     Moving fast, he points off to his right.  Her eyes follow a
     long CABLE, leading from the arm of the crane, across the roof,
     attaching by a huge HOOK to a massive WRECKING BALL.

                               MAC
                     Go grab that hook.

     He reaches the crane's cab.  Turns back to see she hasn't moved.

                               MAC
                     Let me rephrase that.  Run
                     and grab that hook.  Or die...

     Got it?  She takes off running.  He hops IN the cab.  PUSHES the
     start button.  It rumbles to life.  Tests some levers...

                               GIN (O.S.)
                     SHIT!  DON'T DO THAT!

     He turns to see that he's tightened the cable, pulling her ball six
     feet in the AIR.  She clings to the hook with a true death grip.
     He lowers her ball to the roof.  Getting the hang of it.

                               MAC
                     This only works if you shut
                     your eyes.

     Which makes her eyes BUG OUT.

                               GIN
                     You're not gonna lower me over
                     the side.

                               MAC
                     Of course not.  Now close baby
                     eyes...
                               (she won't)
                     Suit yourself.

     He THROWS a lever and the crane's arm begins to SWING in a circle,
     finally taking the ball WITH it, and as she SCREAMS, Mac...

     ...POUNCES out of the cab, RACING along the edge of the roof, NOT
     toward the ball which is sweeping the hysterical Gin in a widening
     ARC, but toward the point where he thinks the ball will clear the
     edge, and JUST as it does, he...

     ...LEAPS aboard, throwing one arm around the hook, the other around
     her, and they go...

     ...OVER the side, WHOOSHING DOWN in a gigantic, every-increasing
     LOOP, as the endless steel cable UNWINDS from its huge drum like a
     fishing reel hooked onto a killer whale.

                               GIN
                     OH NOOOOOOOOOO....

     The ride no theme park could insure, SWOOPING out ACROSS the
     skyline, DROPPING like an anvil, as the cable UNSPOOLS hundreds of
     feet, nothing but NOTHING for miles below them, Gin grabbing a
     breath to SHRIEK her guts out, as the monstrous pendulum reaches
     its max, begins to slow toward that one nauseating motionless
     instant...

                               MAC
                     Let go NOW!!

     He YANKS her loose, and they drop...

     ...four feet.  The ball SWINGS OFF lnto space to some unknown
     mayhem.  Clutching Mac, Gin looks WAY down to the street, and
     realizes they are standing on...

     ...a rooftop.  Quiet, safe.  Alone.

                               MAC
                     Planning.

     She WHIPS around, GLARING death at his eyes.

                               MAC
                     And dumb luck.

     She COLLAPSES in his arms, every muscle trembling in spasm,
     sobbing...

                               GIN
                     God, I hate you.

     He holds her tenderly.  Kisses the top of her head.

                               MAC (softly)
                     Good.  I hate you, too.

     EXT. NATHAN ROAD - EARLY MORNING

     WITH Gin in a soft brunette wig, walking briskly, light carry-all
     across her shoulder.  Very early, even the busiest street in the
     world is less than that at this hour.  Up ahead...

     ...Tsimshatsui Station, a tall man with a tourist shopping bag,
     leaning casually against a pole.  Talking into a cellular.

     As she approaches, Mac doesn't seem to notice, but she can now hear
     his conversation...

                               MAC (into phone)
                     ...if I can't have my usual
                     suite, I'll take my business
                     to the Bristol, simple as that.

     He sees her now.  Smiles small.

                               MAC (into phone)
                     ...why indeed should I be more
                     loyal to you than you've been to
                     me?  Think it over.

     SNAPS the phone shut.

                               MAC
                     You ran your calls.

     She did.  She is frankly exhilarated.

                               GIN
                     All the transactions, all the
                     transfers.  It's a miracle.

                               MAC
                     Why?  The CD erased the trans-
                     actions, all accounts seem in
                     order.  It looks like the thieves
                     were stopped in time.

     She sighs.  It is a miracle.

                               GIN
                     The Colonel says police have
                     nothing.  A man in black-tie, a
                     blonde in a gown.  The elevator
                     guards saw faces, but no mug shots
                     to ID.  I think it's over.

     Mac's smile.  Bittersweet affection.

                               MAC
                     Except it never is, really.
                     Quite.  Over.

     She smiles.  It is easy, but dazzling.  Atypically soft.

                               GIN
                     Well, one hopes not.  The Bristol,
                     huh?  In...Paris?

     Ah.

                               MAC
                     You're not going back to Mr. Cruz,
                     and the nine-to-five?

                               GIN
                     Not hardly.  I've arranged to be
                     killed in a car crash.  On Taipei.
                     Amazing how little it costs.

                               MAC
                     Well.  You want to watch those
                     pennies.

     She takes a breath.  Scared, in an excited way...

                               GIN
                     I could arrange for two.  In that
                     crash.

     His smile back.

     He looks at his watch.  Takes her hand.  Leads her to the subway
     steps.

                               MAC
                     You know, for a bitch.  You can
                     be awfully sweet.

                               GIN
                     Woman of mystery.  What do you say?
                     I like the Bristol, just fine.
                     mean, it's not the Ritz...

                               MAC
                     You know, all night I've been
                     wrestling with something...

                               GIN
                     Not the most flattering way to
                     put it.

     He takes his big tourist shopping bag.  Puts it in her hand.

                               MAC
                     I've changed your travel plans.

     They are descending now.  Into the vast underground train station.

                               GIN
                     Mine.

                               MAC
                     Instead of taking the subway to
                     the airport, you change at Jordan
                     Station for Kowloon Tong.  Got that?

     Got that?

                               MAC
                     Jordan is only 90 seconds up the
                     line.  Like a wire transfer, you're
                     gone.  Vanished.

     He holds up a silencing finger.  Listen to me.

                               MAC
                     In this bag are passports,
                     tickets, papers.  An amber wig, a
                     good one.  A dress you can slip on
                     in five seconds.

     Her eyes moving over his face.  What is this?

                               MAC
                     You're on a tight connection to
                     the Trans-Siberian Express, be in
                     Europe in a week.

                               GIN
                     Mac, wh...

                               MAC
                     Shhh.  You always talk too much.

     They're at the booth.  He pays their fare.  Through the turnstiles,
     now.

                               MAC
                     Time has come to return the favor.
                     One last time.

     Smiles at her.  As they enter a tunnel.

                               MAC
                     Tell you.  What business.  I'm
                     actually in.

     And in an instant of blind panicked clarity.  She gets the whole
     thing.

                               GIN (hushed)
                     My God.  You're a cop.

                               MAC (very softly)
                     That's my girl.

     Keep walking.  People are everywhere.  But they are alone in the
     world.

                               MAC
                     See, my profession was cover,
                     too.  A notorious thief has access
                     to colleagues, their plans...

     He sighs.

                               MAC
                     I've turned in...well, couple
                     hundred.  over forty years.
                     Scotland Yard, Interpol, FBI...

     Looking around the tunnel.

                               MAC
                     Thought I might retire.  After you.

                               GIN
                     And all the...microchips, the
                     diamond machine...

                               MAC
                     Well, the chips were returned.
                     The machine was just a box, did
                     you actually think it was real?

     Glances at her.

                               GIN
                     I thought...everything was real.
                     Stupid girl.

     End of the tunnel in sight now.  It leads to a massive, endless
     quai.  Trains in transit.

                               GIN
                     Those were your jobs, so I could
                     have claimed entrapment.  You had
                     to wait.  For mine.

     Nearly there.  He says nothing.  Looks pretty grim.

                               GIN
                     The Oracle Bone...

                               MAC
                     Well, the State Department liked
                     that one.  They have more fish to
                     fry with Beijing than Taiwan.

     He sighs.

                               MAC
                     So they're taking credit for
                     letting it go through.  Tho I'm
                     afraid your Colonel may be in for
                     a career disappointment.

     She stops walking.  She has to know...

                               GIN
                     And the 5 billion.

     Ah.  That.

                               MAC
                     I haven't told them.

     Gently, takes her arm.  Leads her onto the endless train platform.
     Walking slower now.

                               MAC
                     I said you hadn't revealed the
                     job.  That it wouldn't take place
                     until after the changeover.

     Down the platform they stroll.  As her eyes wander...

                               MAC
                     Don't look, they're there.

     Her breath catches.  Her eyes go down.

                               GIN
                     And my tickets.  In the shopping bag?

                               MAC
                     Well.  Kept my options open.  If
                     I give you up, they don't matter,
                     do they?

     Her heart pounding through her chest.

                               GIN
                     If.

                               MAC
                     Had lots of crazy thoughts.  One
                     was retirement.  With four billion
                     dollars.  After all, I know some
                     places where life could be private...

                               GIN
                     But you couldn't do that, huh?

     They've stopped.  Just two travellers in a strange land.  waiting
     for a train.

                               GIN
                     Otherwise.  They wouldn't be here.

     He nods.  Smiling pleasantly.

                               MAC
                     Creature of habit.  I suppose.

     We feel her adrenaline racing.

                               GIN
                     Lots.  Of thoughts, you s...

                               MAC
                     Keep smiling.  They won't move,
                     until I raise my left arm.

     And so she smiles.  As prettily as she can manage.

                               MAC
                     I thought.  Well, I've got the CD.
                     I could contact the banks, reverse
                     all the transactions...

     A train is COMING.  We HEAR it.

                               MAC
                     ...except maybe.  Leave you with...
                     oh, a hundred million, say.  To
                     tide you over.

     SEE the train.  Slowing.  Pulling in.

                               MAC
                     Then, I thought, nah.  Not my style.

     With a SHRIEK of metal.  The train PULLS toward us.

                               MAC
                     I figured.  What the hell?

     What the hell?

                               MAC
                     Let her keep the lot.

     The train STOPS.  The doors OPEN.  People come out, people go in.
     Pouring around them.  They are alone again.  The subway doors stand
     open.  Two feet away.  She looks at them...

                               MAC
                     No rush.  The doors won't close for
                     60 seconds.

     Sixty seconds.  And still smiling...

                               MAC
                     There's a pistol in the bag.  Reach
                     in slowly.  Take it out fast.  Point
                     it at my temple.

     She freezes to stone.

                               MAC
                     You can do it.  If I say you can.

     And she...DOES IT.  A blinding MOVE, the gun straight at his head,
     Mac miming fear, raising his hands to chill the agents we...

     WHIP PAN to see.  Half a dozen, everywhere, but none too close.
     They REACT, pull their weapons, but it's a stand-off.  BACK TO...
         
     Two people. Alone in the universe.

                               MAC
                     Step onto the car, keep the
                     pistol trained on my face.

     She hesitates.  Does as he says.  Passengers are screaming,
     cringing, bolting for other cars.  Our world is FROZEN.  His hands
     raised...

                               MAC
                     Seems I was wrong.

     Gentle smile.

                               MAC
                     Entrapment.  Is what robbers.
                     Do to cops, huh?

     Her eyes are flooding.  The gun is trembling.

                               MAC
                     Twenty seconds.  Shoot me in the
                     shoulder, it'll slow them down.

     Her pistol is shaking like she has palsy.  Tears are on her cheeks.

                               GIN
                     Oughta shoot you in the face.

                               MAC
                     Come on, you can do it, if I sa...

                               GIN
                     No way.  Not anymore.

     She sobs.  She can't stand this.

                               MAC
                     Ten seconds, hold on.

                               GIN
                     When do I see you?

     There is no answer.  There are no words.

     The doors HISS SHUT.  She stares, training her pistol on him
     through the glass, his hands reaching back to hold off the agents,
     and the train...

     PULLS away.  An instant to pick up speed, and it ROARS into a
     tunnel.  Gone.

     Mac stands motionless as ALL HELL breaks loose around him, AGENTS
     rushing to his side, Mac shaking his head, calmly...
         
     Still staring after the train.

                               MAC
                     Airport.  Changing at Mongkok
                     Station, we can cut her off.

     Walkie-talkies WHIP out.  These guys are the same the world over.
     We begin to CRANE UP...

                               MAC
                     She might lose the wig, be looking
                     brunette or blonde, navy pants suit...

                               AGENT
                     I think Yaumatei changes for the
                     airport, and it's closer.

     Keep PULLING UP, an AERIAL VIEW now, too high to see their faces...

                               MAC (O.S.)
                     I think you're wrong, but cover it.
                     You got maybe four minutes.

     HIGHER still, the mob below an ant colony...

                               MAC (O.S., calmly)
                     No problem.  She's trapped.

     But as the crowd parts.  We can make out one lone man...

     Staring after.  What has gone.



     FADE TO BLACK.  ROLL END CREDITS.

     EXT. HANCOCK TOWER, CHICAGO - LATE NIGHT

     Lake Shore Drive.  Four o'clock in the morning.  Minimal traffic,
     minimal life.  As MAIN TITLES BEGIN, we PAN UP the face of...

     ...Hancock Tower.  Up, up, forty floors, sixty, eighty, very dark
     up here, street sounds fading fast, and as CREDITS CONTINUE we can
     just make out...

     ...a dark FIGURE.  Like a spider.  Inching its way up the steel
     surface of the 98th floor, and we CLOSE to see...

     The THIEF.  All in black, nearly invisible, with a sleek visored
     helmet that conceals the face.  Two long, oblong backpacks, climb-
     ing ropes and harness across back and shoulders, tools at the belt.
     Moving STRAIGHT UP the face of the skyscraper.  How is it possible?
     CLOSER still to see...

     ...the piton-like BOLTS are electromagnetic, CLANKING to the steel
     to support weight.  A button releases the magnetic charge when the
     bolt is pulled up by cords to a higher position.  The Thief is
     remarkably strong and agile, scaling the wall with fluid precision,
     until...

     ...our summit.  A softly-lit, glass-walled PENTHOUSE on the
     100th floor.  Subtle spots which bathe paintings, sculptures,
     in a cavernous coldly-decorated space.

     Swiftly, deftly, the Thief rigs a suction-mounted HARNESS to the
     steel casing above a massive window.  Pulleys, metal caribiner
     clips, yellow Kevlar ropes.  So superbly practiced, the rigging is
     placed in seconds, huge SUCTION CUPS pressed to the surface of the
     glass.  The Thief reaches to a metal rectangle at the top of the
     rigging, touches a button, a motor WHINES, the ropes TIGHTEN and
     the window...

     ...POPS FREE, hangs SUSPENDED by the Kevlar ropes which amazingly
     sustain its awesome weight.  The huge pane shudders in the wind,
     and the Thief slips...

     ...INTO the Penthouse.  Nearby, an ALARM BOX softly BEEPS its
     60-second warning to the pulsing of a green light, and the Thief
     attaches a small computerized DEVICE which runs a series of
     possible CODES at dazzling speed on its display panel, until...

     ...the right one STOPS.  Illuminated in red.  The beeping, the
     green light, go OFF.  The device is removed.

     Back to the window, air rushing in, attach a similar suction-
     mounted harness from the inside, all exquisitely engineered to rig
     in seconds, press new suction cups to the inside of the dangling
     window pane.  A small remote control clicker...

     ...RELEASES the outside suction cups.  The window's weight now
     supported by the interior rigging.  The outside equipment pulled
     INTO the apartment in a single tug.  The WHINE of a motor, and the
     pane pulls UP, the Thief expertly POPPING it into place.

     No trace of entry.

     Rapidly folding the rigging into an astonishingly compact bundle,
     the Thief SCANS...

     ...the profusion of priceless art.  The paintings run to Otto Dix,
     Franz Marc, Marcel Duchamp.  One statue an obvious Rodin.  The soft
     lighting makes walls seem invisible, everything with an infinity
     perspective in mind.  An obsidian slab dining table that seems to
     end at the horizon.

     The Thief has packed the rigging away, taken out a large cylin-
     drical TUBE bearing a label we can't read.  Knows the way, quickly
     through the spectacular apartment, past oils by early German
     expressionists, Russian futurists, a Rothko, a Kandinsky, a Francis
     Bacon.  The Thief has no interest in these, and as CREDITS CONTINUE,
     we enter...

     ...a powder room.  A lime-green poured concrete sink, a copper-
     plated commode, and across from these...

     ...a single PAINTING.  Unlike the others, clearly an Old Master.
     A 17th century city on the water, churches, spires, an ancient
     bridge.  The Thief wastes no time, unceremoniously...

     ...CUTS the painting from its frame with sure, perfect strokes.
     Rolls it quickly in acid-free paper.  Opens the cylindrical tube,
     pulling out...

     ...another CANVAS which we cannot see.  Deftly unrolls this,
     fitting it carefully into the stolen painting's now-empty frame.
     Re-hangs it.  Stares for a beat through the opaque helmet visor.
     Approves.  Slips the rolled-up stolen canvas into the empty tube.
     Leaves.  Before we follow, we shift angle to see the replacement
     canvas...

     A cheerful acrylic portrait.  Bozo the Clown.

     WITH the Thief now, moving fast, into a panelled library.  There is
     a CHUTE built into the wall, a brass lid with the words U.S. MAIL.
     The Thief pops the labeled tube DOWN the chute.  Gone.  Steps...

     ...onto a bookshelf, reaches up to punch out an overhead grating,
     and...

     Disappears into the vent.  Reaching back to refit the grating
     seamlessly into place.

     INT. VENT

     Halogen flashlight leading the way, our Thief shimmies down the
     narrow space, arriving at...

     ...an open vertical AIR SHAFT, BLASTING air straight up the 100
     floor height of the skyscraper, with frightening FORCE.  Calmly,
     the Thief clips on a different harness, unzips a nylon cover from
     the backpack, and simply...

     LEAPS DOWN the air shaft, startling the shit out of us, as, for an
     instant...

     ...the force of the updraft seems to HOLD the Thief in place,
     suspended above 100 stories of nothingness.  Then suddenly, the
     Thief...

     ...DROPS SHARPLY, an exhilarating moment of absolute FREE FALL,
     until a cord is tugged and...

     ...a nylon PARACHUTE OPENS with a pop.  We watch the Thief drifting
     lazily down.  A ride any kid would pay big money for...

     EXT. HANCOCK TOWER - LATE NIGHT

     Our original exterior VIEW of the skyscraper's penthouse.  REVERSE
     ANGLE now to see in far distance...

     ...the dense forest of silhouetted OFFICE TOWERS of downtown
     Chicago against the night sky, and we ZOOM TOWARD them, covering
     miles in three seconds, to CLOSE on...

     ...the highest floor of the SEARS TOWER, and THROUGH an unlit
     window to see...

     ...a TELESCOPE.  A silhouetted FIGURE looking through it.  SNAP
     to...

     VIEW through the scope's lens.  An amazingly CLOSE detail of the
     Hancock Tower Penthouse.  The scope now PANS DOWN the length of the
     Tower, to...

     The street.  The Thief climbing onto a battered old Lambretta.
     Calm as you please.  And as the scooter glides off...

     We HEAR our unseen voyeur WALK AWAY from our telescope.  A door
     OPENS somewhere, and as CREDITS CONCLUDE, it...

     Closes.  Softly.

     INT. WEBBER ASSURANCE - DAY

     A basement corridor.  Long, bare, dimly lit.  Silent.  We're in the
     bowels of somewhere.  A startling CLANK, like a prison cell
     unlocking.  A FIGURE enters the corridor, coming this way, on the
     hurried side of brisk.

     HECTOR CRUZ is 42, tanned, fit, graying hair swept back in a Pat
     Riley do.  He wears Riley's Armani, too.  Maybe this guy coaches.
     Heels ECHO until he reaches a plain door with discreet lettering...

     NO ADMITTANCE FOR ANY REASON.  There is a dull silver rectangle
     below the words.  He holds his hand up to it...

     Nothing happens.  Shit.  Dries his palm on his perfectly-creased
     slacks.  One more time.  CLICK.  Enters...

     INT. SITUATION ROOM - DAY

     An unexpectedly VAST semi-circular room, the entire inner circum-
     ference made up of a single continuous WALL SCREEN, separated into
     a seamless array of IMAGES...

     Three-dimensional rotating GRAPHICS of every room in the Hancock
     Tower Penthouse, SCHEMATICS of electrical, plumbing, and ventila-
     tion systems.  See-through rotating multicolored models of every
     piece of security EQUIPMENT imaginable, components FLASHING as
     performance simulations are run.  Rapid-fire sequences of indiv-
     idual human PROFILES, complete with photos and bio blurbs.  Screens
     flickering with blizzards of DATA, hurtling past at warp speed.

     The Pentagon and CNN would kill for this room.

     The largest segment of screen, twenty feet square, runs a LIVE FEED
     from the crime scene.  The living room of the Penthouse, crawling
     with slow-moving cops and technicians, doing their slow-moving
     thing.  Surrounding this image are a dozen smaller screens, showing
     this and other rooms from a variety of camera angles.  All live.
     We see the library, the mail chute.  The powder room.  Bozo.

     Cruz skips down three steps to floor level, nine separate CONTROL
     STATIONS, each outfitted with super-tech panels to process the
     avalanche of information.  But today, all stations are empty.

     Except one.

                               CRUZ
                     Baker.  You got it solved?

     And now we see her.  From the rear.  Slouched at her station.
     Looks like a skinny teenager in tousled tawny hair, rumpled
     oversized workshirt, vintage jeans.

                               GIN (O.S., from the rear)
                     Actually.  Yeh.

     Not a kid's voice.  Throaty.  Music and whiskey and sex and
     effortless confidence.  Even the voice turns us on.

                               CRUZ (glances at his watch)
                     What took you so long, Gin?  I
                     called 4:30 this morn...

     And stops.  Because she turns with a look that would freeze anyone
     to stone.

                               GIN
                     I was with someone, all right?

     Now we really see her.  Delicate bones and features, slender body,
     radiating the power of a natural heart-stopping beauty.  GINGER
     BAKER is 32, ethereal and feral at once.  Electric green eyes
     crackle with an intellect and a will that are not to be fucked
     with.

                               CRUZ
                     So?  This is work.

     He is not kidding.  Stainless steel beneath the dapper.  They are a
     matched team.

                               GIN
                     Hector, I hardly know the guy.
                     Why be impolite to strangers?

     And he smiles.  Maybe she's lying.  He likes her.

                               CRUZ
                     Look at those assholes...

     He means the cops on live feed.

                               CRUZ
                     If the Vermeer were lying on that
                     table, they'd toss their doughnuts
                     on it.

                               GIN
                     Yeh, well, they didn't insure it,
                     so they don't have to solve this.
                     To them it's a crime.  To us it's 24
                     mil, less re-insurance, which is...

                               CRUZ (grim)
                     Only thirty percent, Gin.

     Ouch.  Really?

                               CRUZ
                     Which is why you're on this.

     Soft and straight.  You're the best.  I need you.

                               GIN
                     He came in through the window.

                               CRUZ
                     That's not possib...

                               GIN
                     What's not possible is entry through
                     the doors or the vents.  That would
                     have triggered instant alarm.

                               CRUZ
                     The windows are wired, too.

                               GIN
                     Only for trauma.  They used smart
                     glass, where the sensors respond to
                     violation of the panel's integrity.

     He's listening.  He always does with her.

                               GIN
                     I think he scaled the wall, popped
                     the frame.  In one piece.

     She sounds awfully positive.  Then again, she always does.

                               GIN
                     Then, he only had to deal with
                     heat and motion sensors.  They
                     were on 60-second delay, so the
                     owner wouldn't trigger the alarm
                     just be walking arou...

                               CRUZ
                     The pane weighs 200 pounds, the
                     building's 1100 feet high.

                               GIN
                     This particular guy is the best.
                     The best there ever was.

     Almost as if she knows who.  Cruz shakes his head...

                               CRUZ
                     Popping the frame would trigger
                     the alarm.

     She smiles.  First time.  Even at one-tenth power, it is dazzling
     light.  She touches the panel before her...

                               GIN (gently)
                     I wrote a program and ran it, Dumbo.

     The live feed is replaced by a red-outlined rotating three-
     dimensional DIAGRAM of the living room.  The alarm box glows green.
     One window pane glows lavender.  She touches the panel, and the
     window SHATTERS, the alarm instantly emits a PIERCING SCREECH.

     Reset.  As he watches.  This time the window SLIDES AWAY into
     thin air.  No sound.  A stick figure appears, crawls through the
     opening, and the alarm begins the slow BEEP we heard last night.
     Cruz just stares.

                               GIN
                     Here's how I figured it out...

     Live feed replaces the diagram.  Our camera ZOOMS toward a VASE of
     lilies by the window.  All the flowers are tilted in one direction.
     Over the lip of the vase, away from the window.

                               GIN
                     No one arranges flowers like that.
                     It was the draft from the window.

     He turns to her.

                               CRUZ
                     You said.  This particular guy.

     Now she is beaming.  Excited.  And just above a whisper...

                               GIN
                     Andrew MacDougal.

     Delighted at his stupefied reaction.

                               CRUZ
                     Why not Houdini?  Or Pretty Boy
                     Floyd?  Maybe Jesus Christ.

                               GIN
                     Because they couldn't do it.

     His slow smile.  This fucking kid.

                               CRUZ
                     He's been out of the business.
                     For ten years.

                               GIN
                     Maybe not.  No one ever proved,
                     hell, even arrested him, for
                     stealing anything.  But we all
                     know he was numero ichiban for
                     thirty years.  Why not forty?

     She's serious.

                               CRUZ
                     Why?  Because of the Bozo switch?
                     Guys have been copying his pack-
                     rat signature for decades.  Maybe
                     the thief wanted it to look like
                     MacDougal.

     She doesn't even answer.  Just touches her panel, and one of the
     data screens BLOWS UP to huge size.  It is...

                               GIN
                     A list of his private collection.
                     Complete to three acquisitions
                     last Thursday.

     Names SCROLLING up endlessly, next to titles, descriptions,
     estimated retail and black market values.  Turner, Corot, Thomas
     Coles, DeKooning, Klimt, Cezannes, Odilon Redon, Braques, Mary
     Cassatt...

                               CRUZ
                     No Vermeer.  Nothing close.

                               GIN
                     Don't be a putz.  This is his
                     legitimate collection, which he
                     buys.  Presentable for any search
                     warrant surprise party.

     Names keep rolling, Degas, Paul Klee.  Amazing.

                               GIN
                     What he rips off, he fences.  And
                     the money feeds his portfolio of
                     investments, which are daring, savvy,
                     and obscenely succesf...

                               CRUZ
                     Oh, I get it.  He has no interest
                     in Vermeers, so that proves he stole
                     one.  By that logic, he oughta be a
                     suspect most of the time.

     She shakes her head, sadly.

                               GIN
                     You love to embarrass yourself.

     Touches her panel.  The big screen now shows a grainy VIDEOTAPE
     of...

                               GIN
                     The auction.  Where our client
                     bought the painting...

     We see the Great Room of an English Country estate.  Perhaps a
     hundred attend.  Genteel to the max.

                               GIN (O.S.)
                     Ashcroft Hall, Buckinghamshire,
                     four weeks ago.

     The tape PANS five PAINTINGS on the block.  We recognize our
     VERMEER, the city of Delft, the canal, the bridge.  The view PULLS
     BACK to include the crowd, and...

     FREEZES.  One tiny section is circled.  And BLOWS UP twenty feet.
     high, so blurry as to be unrecognizable.  Then, SNAPS to amazing
     resolution.  The image of...

                               GIN (O.S., murmur)
                     Anyone we know?

     ...ANDREW MacDOUGAL, perhaps 60, as charismatic and shamelessly
     virile a face as one can recall.  Etched with character and worldly
     experience, lit by a twinkle behind the razor-keen gaze.  Tall,
     wide shoulders, massive hands.  This guy would be more fun to fuck
     than fight.  By a lot.

                               CRUZ
                     So he was there.

                               GIN
                     Staking it out.  Why bid, when
                     you can mark the buyer, and jack
                     it within the month?

     She leans WAY back in the molded chair.  Lifts her long legs
     up onto the console.  They end in slender bare feet.  The toes
     wriggle.

                               GIN
                     At this moment, he is winging on
                     JAL flight 307 to Narita, ostensibly
                     to attend a prestigious auction at
                     the Hotel Akura, which will include
                     a mixed media collage/oil by Georges
                     Braques, on which he supposedly has
                     his eye.

                               CRUZ
                     But you know better.

                               GIN
                     Bet your ass.  At Vegas odds.

     Touches the panel.  The big screen now holds three faces, three
     names.

                               GIN (O.S.)
                     Research reveals three known fences,
                     still at large, who are believed
                     to have brokered Vermeers to black
                     market buyers.  Sandrine Palmer is
                     hospitalized in Malta with ovarian
                     cancer.

     One face and name disappears.  Two remain.  KOICHI NARUHITO.
     HIROYUKI YAMAJI.

                               GIN
                     The other two.  Live in Tokyo.

     A tiny, dry, adorable, shrug.  Which says, bingo.

                               CRUZ
                     And you did all this since 4:30
                     this morning.

     Grinning small at each other.  She can't help that hers is hot.
     She never can.

                               CRUZ (murmur)
                     Plus.  You were polite to a
                     stranger.

     One of those moments when his attraction to her is too obvious to
     ignore.  Best to defuse by pretending it's a joke...

                               GIN (soft and playful)
                     Sounds like you're sorry you're
                     already a friend.

     Said as banter between pals.  Which doesn't make her wrong.

     INT. HOTEL OKURA, TOKYO - NIGHT

     Auction in progress in the huge traditional LOBBY, where bonsai
     trees, paper lanterns and elaborate painted screens counterpoint
     the sleek, international, big-money crowd.  Everyone milling,
     drinking, schmoozing, networking in a babble of languages, as up
     on the raised platform...

     ...the AUCTIONEER has a new piece on the block, a 6th Century
     temple scroll, from the Asuka period.  It is exquisite, and bidding
     seems to be big time, from the rapidly escalating numbers on the
     overhead DIGITAL DISPLAY, which reveals bidding status in thirty
     currencies simultaneously. As we PAN the hall, we see...

     ...all non-Asians either wearing headphones, or acompanied by
     personal translators at their elbow, to follow the rapid-fire
     auctioneer.

     Except one.

     ANDREW MacDOUGAL stands alone in black tie.  Tall and rugged and
     polished and focused, and, well, pretty gorgeous.  He is bidding on
     the scroll, indicated only by subtle gestures with his program and
     the repeated finger-stabs of the auctioneer in our direction.

                               WOMAN'S VOICE (O.S., subtitled Japanese)
                     Don't do it.

     PULL BACK slightly to reveal Gin, who has stepped to his shoulder.
     She is barely recognizable to us in her satiny slip of a pale
     golden gown that drapes her frame perfectly.  Breathtaking would
     be an insult.

     MacDougal doesn't turn, doesn't seem to even hear her.  Just raises
     his program to up the bid.

                               GIN (softly, subtitled Japanese)
                     You're already over value.  By
                     15 percent.

     And now he turns.  Straight to her eyes.  This is NOT an admiring
     glance at seeing the loveliest woman in the Northern Hemisphere.
     It is a look that says, in the most understated terms, shut up or
     I'll kill you.  She shuts up.

     His glance goes to his obvious bidding RIVAL, a rather butch
     middle-aged Chinese woman in an embroidered version of a Mao suit.
     She indicates her bid by gesturing with a tiny Yorkshire Terrier,
     whom she holds in her stubby hands.  MacDougal raises back.

                               GIN (subtitled Japanese)
                     Will you stop being stubborn
                     for one sec...

     And stops.  Because he has turned.  With the eyes of a lion.  Being
     pulled from an antelope carcass.

                               MAC (quietly, subtitled Japanese)
                     I have a question.

     Rich Scottish voice.  Impeccable Japanese intonation.

                               GIN (brightly, subtitled Japanese)
                     Who the fuck am I?

                               MAC (subtitled Japanese)
                     That is of no interest.

     Oh.  In spite of herself, she looks a little hurt.

                               GIN (subtitled Japanese)
                     What, then?

                               MAC (subtitled Japanese)
                     Why.  Are we speaking.  Japanese?

     Her eyes move across his formidable face.

                              GIN
                     Uh.  I'm showing off.

     His eyes scan the length of her gown.  Her body.

                               MAC
                     Something of a habit?

     She is minus a comeback.

                               MAC
                     You know the alleged value of this
                     piece from some fucking computer,
                     which has no clue of the price I
                     can turn the scroll around for in
                     30 minutes.

     A beat.

                               GIN
                     No, you can't.

     He blinks.  No?

                               GIN (really sorry)
                     It's sold.

     His great head WHIPS around to see Madame Mao KISSING her pooch,
     flushed with victory.  He stares for a long moment, a veneer of
     philosophical almost masking his rage.  When he turns back...

                               MAC
                     Are you a confederate of my
                     adversaries?  Or are you just
                     stupid.

     And walks.  Away.

     HOLD on her.  Feeling like both.

     EXT. HOTEL OKURA - NIGHT

     Mac among the guests awaiting their cars, standing slightly apart.
     From behind him...

     ...a feminine throat clears.  Nervously.  He closes his eyes for a
     beat.  Then, turns.

                               GIN (softly)
                     How about.  If I try humility.

     And presents a business card to him with both hands, Japanese-
     style.  Mac looks in her eyes.  Takes the card with both hands.
     Reads...

                               MAC
                     Virginia Romay...

                               GIN
                     Gin, actually, Gin Romay.  I
                     was named after a card game.

                               MAC
                     Or a cheap cocktail.

     She blinks.  His brows raise...

                               MAC (softly)
                     As in.  I'll have a Gin Romay,
                     please.  With a twist.

     That laser, unsmiling stare.  Beyond sexy.  She gets lost in it for
     a beat.

                               GIN
                     You're supposed to be charming.

                               MAC
                     I'm supposed to be selective.

     Glances back to her card.  Reads...

                               MAC
                     Art and Antiquities Acquisition
                     Advisor, how alliterative...

     Looks up.  Still no smile.

                               MAC
                     And am I the antiquity?

                               GIN
                     In mint condition.

     She sighs.  Achingly lovely.

                               GIN
                     Look, I've studied you, I know...
                     pretty much...everything.

     Do you.

                               GIN
                     Made your first millions selling
                     scrap metal.  Then, gold mining
                     concessions, gems, art, and lately
                     strategic metals for new technologies
                     - platinum, zirconium, titanium...

                               MAC
                     You said.  Everything.

     Huh?  Oh.

                               GIN
                     The cat burglar stories?  Why
                     would anyone...with so much to
                     lose...take those kinds of risks?

     Guileless smile.

                               GIN
                     You'd have to be.  Stupid.

     A held beat.  His glance lifts beyond her shoulder.

                               MAC
                     Excuse me.

     And walks off toward a sleek custom TOURING CAR just pulling up.
     She goes after him.

                               GIN
                     I didn't know Porsche made
                     things like this.

                               MAC
                     Well, they don't...

     Tipping the valet.  Sliding in...

                               MAC
                     ...as a rule.

     Shutting the door.  Through the open window, she hands something
     from her bag.  A plastic rectangle which OPENS into a slide viewer.
     She presses the light ON.  He looks at the slide.

                               GIN
                     Recognize that?

     No reaction.

                               GIN
                     My seller is in Shinjuku, we can
                     go there tonight.

     She leans closer.

                               GIN
                     He wants 4.6 million.  I can
                     get it for three.

     He hands it back.  Looks in her eyes.

                               MAC
                     No, you can't.

     And TAKES OFF.  Her jaw drops slightly, but in one fluid motion...

     She's hailed a cab.

     INT. IMPERIAL HOTEL BAR - LATER

     Graceful, timeless room, designed by Frank Lloyd Wright in the
     '20s.  Burnished.  Elegant.  Way cool.  A place to drink, to deal,
     to dream.  PAN down the polished surface of the bartop, til we
     come to...

     ...a tropical DRINK.  Cute little umbrella, tilted back toward the
     room.  ROTATE ANGLE to see...

     ...INSIDE the umbrella, something small, something mechanical.  A
     woman's HAND ADJUSTS the point of the umbrella ever so slightly,
     and we PAN UP her arm to see...

     ...Gin.  Still in her gown.  She is reading, with half-glasses, and
     one of the bows curls around her ear, which we CLOSE on to hear...

     ...static.  Gin adjusts the drink umbrella, which is a directional
     mike, and hears...

                               MAC (O.S.)
                     ...only it's not bloody football!

     SNAP to Mac's table, well across the room.  Drinking giant beers
     with a large, really fat Japanese guy in a costly; if wrinkled,
     suit.  The hulk listens with stone attention to Mac's rant, as if
     he actually gave a shit.

                               MAC (O.S.)
                     ...it's just that crap Americans
                     call 'football', like you could
                     call your ass a butterscotch scone
                     and have it be one!

     The guy nods seriously.  Maybe he's a Sumo dude.

                               MAC
                     Why you'd want to bring that
                     foolishness to Japan, you're
                     just pissing your investment
                     down a bungee hole.

                               SUMO GUY (major accent)
                     You got Cubano this trip?

     That he does.  Mac pulls out a leather cigar holder, and passes it
     over.  Flat against one side is an ENVELOPE, which Sumo Guy PALMS
     skillfully, slipping it seamlessly INTO his pocket as he withdraws
     a small MATCH BOX.  Takes out one long cigar, lights up...

                               MAC
                     Seriously, put the money into
                     pharmaceuticals or prostitution,
                     something stable.

     The big guy pushes the cigar holder and match box back toward Mac.
     Opening the box, Mac sees one match and a small MICROCHIP fastened
     to the cardboard.  Lights up.  Slides the match box in his pocket.

                               MAC
                     Garbage, perhaps.  Or industrial
                     plastics.

     ANGLE...Gin still engrossed in her reading.  A figure leans down
     next to her.  She startles, slightly.  So surprised to see...

                               MAC
                     My favorite thing in life.
                     Coincidence.

     She gives him the great smile.

                               GIN
                     I'm staying here, what's your
                     excuse?

     And now he smiles.  First time ever.  A little chilling, the way he
     does it.

                               MAC
                     Staying here, as well.  You
                     are in room...?

                               GIN (half a beat)
                     One thirty-eight.

     In one motion, he flags the bartender...

                               MAC
                     Will you send a half-bottle of
                     Chateau d'Yquem '67 to Room 138,
                     please?  And some berries and
                     chocolates for the lady to enjoy
                     it with.

     He presses some currency into the barkeep's hand.  Turning back...

                               MAC
                     Actually, I was just across the
                     room, dickering with a gentleman
                     over the purchase of an interesting
                     Spitzweg.  Until I determined the
                     painting was apparently stolen...

     Oh.   She's shocked.  He agrees...

                               MAC
                     Goes against my grain.  The
                     DeKooning in your slide, the 4.6
                     million you can get for 3.  Can
                     you get it for 2 and a half?

     She looks in his eyes.

                               GIN
                     Sure.

     And as if he believed her...

                               MAC
                     My checkbook is in my safe.  You
                     wait here.

     His smile evaporates.  He is gone before she can say...

                               GIN
                     Okay.  I'll wait here.

     INT. CAR, SHINJUKU DISTRICT - NIGHT

     Mac driving in silence.  Gin stealing glances at him.  Suddenly and
     smoothly, he reaches down, and picks up...

                               GIN
                     That's my purse.

     He opens it.  One eye on the road, he begins to rummage...

                               MAC
                     Just want to see if I'm with the
                     person you say you are.  Can't be
                     too caref...

     She SNATCHES the bag away from him, he GRABS it back, the car
     SWERVES LEFT, and...

     ...CRASHES VIOLENTLY into a parked pure white Bentley.  Metal
     BUCKLES and TEARS, both ALARMS go OFF, a cacophony of horrific
     NOISE.

                               MAC (quietly)
                     Oh, dear.

     People come RUNNING, but our focus is drawn to the refined elderly
     COUPLE who were just returning to their precious Bentley.  Their
     WAILS and ANGUISH would be suitable if all their grandchildren had
     been crushed beneath Mac's wheels.

     Mac and Gin are OUT of the car.  As he exits, Mac has palmed a
     small BLADE, and in a quick unseen motion, RIPPED a jagged tear
     in his left trouser leg.  The old couple RUSH to Mac, SHRIEKING
     their rage and grief in Japanese, Gin is trying to calm them as
     bystanders gather, but Mac cuts through...

                               MAC (subtitled Japanese)
                     We'll go in there, and call
                     the police.

     And HOBBLES off toward the nearest building, a block-square
     30-story skyscraper bearing the name FUJITSU.  The couple, the
     crowd, all race after the limping Mac...

                               GIN
                     Are you all right?

     No answer, he looks dark enough to rain.  INTO the public lobby of
     the huge industrial complex.  Two night GUARDS come hurrying from
     their desk, as the small mob POURS in.  Mac in the lead, a
     commanding presence, tells the guards in a loud, clear voice...

                               MAC (subtitled Japanese)
                     I have damaged the car of these
                     kind people.  Please help them
                     call the police...

     One guard leads the hysterical couple toward a phone.  Mac pulls up
     his trouser leg, and Gin GASPS to see a bloody GASH.  Mac drops the
     trouser back over the wound.  Asks the remaining guard...

                               MAC (subtitled Japanese)
                     May I use a washroom, please.

     The guard nods absently, disoriented by the chaos.  Mac hands his
     billfold to Gin...

                               MAC
                     These are my papers, passport, car
                     registration.  If the police arri...

                               GIN
                     You're going to need stitches,
                     let me get you to a hospital.

     Soft words, genuine concern.  And his eyes flicker.  As if somehow
     seeing her for the first time.  A small spark, but she feels it.
     Softer still...

                               GIN
                     Really, this can all wait.
                     I'll handle it.

     The look holds.

                               MAC
                     That's actually.  Very sweet.

     His first real smile.  It was worth waiting for.

                               MAC (to a guard, subtitled Japanese)
                     Might you have a First Aid kit,
                     of some kind?

     INT. TOILET STALL

     We are inside an empty, closed, Japanese-style toilet stall.
     Porcelain foot rests.  A hole.  The door BURSTS OPEN, and...

     ...Mac enters FAST with the First Aid kit, locking the door,
     hitting the STOPWATCH on his wrist, which begins counting at
     ZERO.  He pulls UP his trouser leg, revealing the bloody gash,
     and simply...

     ...RIPS the entire wound OFF, the rubbery prosthetic wound DANGLES,
     dripping its phony blood.  Mac pulls gauze strips from the kit,
     SOAKS them in bogus gore, expertly WRAPS his leg, then FLUSHES the
     prosthetic DOWN the hole.

     He pulls off the FUJITSU VISITOR badge clipped to his lapel, and
     from a Ziploc bag slides a small sheet of plastic, which he PRESSES
     to the face of the badge, fitting perfectly, turning the badge
     into...

     ...an EMPLOYEE I.D., the name KAWAKUBO, M., the PHOTO of a surly
     Japanese male.  Quickly, Mac takes out the MATCH BOX from the hotel
     bar, and with a fine tweezers gently removes the MICROCHIP, placing
     it INSIDE the badge, activating it with a soft BEEP-BEEP.  He
     reaches now...

     ...behind his back, up UNDER his tux jacket, and RIPS FREE a
     tightly-compressed PACK of what seems white paper or cloth.  He
     SNAPS it loose, revealing it to be...

     ...a baggy CLEAN SUIT, not unlike hospital scrubs and falling to
     the floor...

     ...a white HOOD.  With opaque tinted VISOR.

     INT. SECURITY CORRIDOR

     Mac in his clean suit and opaque-visored hood at an elevator marked
     CLEARED PERSONNEL ONLY in English and Kanji (Japanese characters).
     He holds his badge to the SCANNER, the door PINGS and slides OPEN..

     INT. PREP ROOM ENTRANCE, 29TH FLOOR

     Mac emerging from his elevator at the entrance to an AIR-LOCK with
     sign CLEAN ROOM - CLASS 10.  Holds his badge to the SCANNER, the
     air-lock door lights FLASH froin red to yellow to green.  He
     enters...

     ...the PREP ROOM.  Recorded VOICES purr safety instructions in
     Japanese, while Mac stands, being bombarded by air shower, chemical
     sprayer, blinding UV light.  The next air-lock OPENS.  He enters...

     INT. CLEAN ROOM

     ...a long ASSEMBLY LINE, where ROBOT ARMS work on a stream of black
     SILICON WAFERS, which pass along a clear Lexan CONVEYOR BELT.  The
     wafers move through various airtight CHAMBERS, exposing them to
     multi-colored gasses, cyan, sodium yellow, magenta, etc., as part
     of the microchip manufacturing process.

     More than a dozen TECHNICIANS in their hooded clean suits watch
     over every phase of the work, attached to the walls by grounding
     wires and air hoses, which create a deafening NOISE.  Mac simply
     hooks himself up, and saunters straight THROUGH the area, toward
     the place where the conveyor belt with its newly-processed
     MICROCHIPS...

     ...DISAPPEARS through the wall.  Nearby, a HATCH is built into the
     same wall, and Mac calmly CLANKS it OPEN, squeezing through into...

     ...a dimly-lit MAINTENANCE BAY.  Panels of switches, wires, fuses,
     fans, air cleaners.  Maximum claustrophobia, as Mac CLANGS the
     hatch SHUT behind him, looking instantly to...

     ...an OVERHEAD HATCH with letters in Kanji and English, DANGER
     ARGON GAS.  Mac THROWS back his hood, YANKS out his mini oxygen
     pouch, fits the slender forked breathing tube into his nostrils,
     and slips on thick round infrared GOGGLES that make him look like a
     refugee from 12 MONKEYS.  No time to lose...

     ...up THROUGH the overhead hatch, closing it behind him as he
     enters...

     ...the conveyer TUBE, a horizontal Lexan cylinder three feet in
     diameter, filled with billowing red gas.  Mac stretches out on his
     belly, glancing up to where the clear conveyor belt, with its
     precious cargo of microchips, runs along just above his head in
     eerie red light.  He begins to...

     ...shimmy, crawl, squirm along the length of the tube.  Gas too
     thick to see the end.  He is agile as a commando, hauling ass, when
     suddenly...

     ...the floor beneath his tube FALLS AWAY, and he is crawling in
     space 29 stories above Tokyo, as his tube spans the distance
     between manufacturing and shipping structures.  He goes faster,
     HARDER...

     INT. MICROCHIP VAULT

     A black chamber.  We can scarcely make out the endless rows of
     shelving, the air purifying equipment, the conveyor belt entering
     through its air lock, as machinery folds each priceless microchip
     in foil wrappers, stacks them on shelves.  Through the gasket...

     ...Mac TUMBLES into view, swinging himself neatly DOWN to the
     floor, and in a single motion, he is already FLASHING a neon-green
     pen light along the shelves of microchips.  We see now the wrappers
     are different colors, with different Kanji characters, and Mac is
     definitely looking for something special, until...

     ...he's found it.  A single row, 35 chips, nothing special from
     here, but Mac...

     ...WHIPS out something coiled, SNAPS it to full length, revealing a
     strip of shiny black SATIN CLOTH.  Three feet long, little more
     than an inch wide.  Carefully, Mac lays the strip down directly
     OVER the row of microchips.  And when he lifts it UP again...

     ...the chips have ADHERED to the underside of the cloth.  In one
     deft SNAP of his wrist, he COILS the cloth again, like a yo-yo.
     Turns to leave, and...

     Oh, yeh.

     Tosses a small SACK of something where the chips used to be.  TIM'S
     CASCADE BRAND POTATO CHIPS.  SEA SALT AND VINEGAR FLAVOR.

     INT. CLEAN ROOM

     Mac exiting from the maintenance hatch back into the Clean Room.
     No one sees, no one cares.  Hooking up once again, he ambles toward
     a door clearly marked EXIT ONLY TO EMPLOYEE LOUNGE - RETURN ONLY
     THROUGH SECURITY AREA.

     By the door is an employee notice tacked to the wall.  He pretends
     to scan it.  A stack of flyers.  He takes one.  Exiting into...

     INT. EMPLOYEE LOUNGE

     Past a changing area, vending machines, guys bullshitting.  Mac
     just strolling along, reading his flyer, as...

     A hand.  Touches his shoulder

                               VOICE (subtitled Japanese)
                     Excuse me.

     Mac turns, stares through his opaque VISOR at a well-built SECURITY
     OFFICER.  Dead straight eyes.

                               OFFICER (subtitled Japanese)
                     The company picnic.  Saturday or
                     Sunday?

     His eyes cut to the flyer Mac is 'reading'.  Mac hands it to him,
     and without a trace of Scottish accent...

                               MAC (subtitled Japanese)
                     Better eat first.

     INT. GUEST LOBBY

     Gin is up to her ears in grief.  There are no less than five COPS
     grilling her, taking notes, while the old couple has their second
     wind and are SHRIEKING in top form.  The bystander gallery has
     grown to maybe three dozen, and they're all getting their word in.
     As Gin struggles to cope...

     ...she keeps looking at the clock.  Darting glances toward the
     corridor.  She is freaking out.

     Finally.  She can't stand it.  Hands Mac's billfold to one of the
     cops, pushes her way through the mob, and...

     ...TAKES OFF down the corridor, a security guard in belated
     pursuit, we go...

     ...WITH her DOWN the hallway, WHEEL around a corner, flat-out
     SPRINTING, SKIDS to a stop at the right doorway and BURSTS INTO...

     INT. MEN'S ROOM

     An empty washroom.  She listens.  Nothing.

                               GIN
                     Mr. MacDougal?  Sir?

     No sound.  Uh-oh.

                               GIN
                     Uh.  Mr. Ma...

                               MAC (O.S., from the stall)
                     Just 'Mac'.  And whatever became
                     of a gentleman's privacy?

     The security guard BARGES IN.

                               MAC (O.S.)
                     My God, more females?

     The guard starts railing at Gin a mile a minute.  She calmly takes
     a WAD of bills from her purse.  Hands them to the guy...

                               GIN (subtitled Japanese)
                     Stand outside.  That door.  Two
                     minutes...

     He does.  Alone again.

                               GIN
                     I was worried, it's been twenty...

                               MAC (O.S.)
                     Eighteen, actually.  The leg is
                     fine, but I got sort of...woozy.

                               GIN
                     Woozy.

                               MAC (O.S.)
                     Lost my stomach once or twice.

     CUT INSIDE the stall.  He is just re-taping the folded clean suit
     and hood to the small of his back.

                               MAC
                     I'm an old man.  You probably
                     noticed.

     Awkward silence.  He smiles at that, much amused.  Slips on his
     jacket.

                               MAC
                     You should see me without
                     my teeth.

     UNLOCKS the door.  Remembers...

                               MAC
                     Ah.  Mustn't forget to zip up.

     That's not what he forgot.  He pulls OUT the coiled black satin
     cloth strip, SNAPS it free, microchips snug to the underside.  And
     fits it neatly...

     ...DOWN his trouser leg.  The perfect tuxedo stripe.

     OUT the door.  To meet her gaze.

                               MAC
                     Odd place, this.

     He goes to her.  Offers his arm.

                               MAC
                     What do you suppose they make
                     here?  Video recorders?

     She takes it, wrapping both hers through.

                               GIN
                     Microchips, I think, for computers.

     He opens the door.  Ushers her through...

                               MAC
                     Bad investment.  The best ones
                     are here today...

     Follows her out...

     Closed door.  Quiet.

     INT. CAB, NIHONBASHI DISTRICT - NIGHT

     They sit together in the rear of the taxi, as it makes its way
     through late night traffic.  She is looking around.

                               GIN
                     This isn't the way to my sel...

                               MAC (quietly)
                     I've changed my mind.

     Looking straight ahead.  Contemplative.  She stares at his
     profile...

                               GIN
                     Mind telling me why?

                               MAC
                     You can't get it for me at 2.5,
                     can you?

                               GIN
                     Well, we can tr...

                               MAC
                     You were setting me up.  The correct
                     price is 2.8.  You conspire with the
                     seller to start at 4.6, so I'll be
                     grateful when you 'bargain' him down
                     to three.  Close enough to fool some
                     people.  unfortunately...

     He sighs.  Never looks at her.

                               MAC
                     I'm old.  I know what everything
                     is worth.

     She keeps staring.

                               GIN
                     So where are we g...

                               MAC
                     I am going to the airport.  You
                     are going on to the rest of your
                     life.  Which...

     He thinks.  Admits...

                               MAC
                     ...should be interesting.

     Her turn to think.

                               GIN
                     You forgot your lugg...

                               MAC
                     The hotels deal with that.  The
                     things I need are always waiting
                     at the next one.
                               (afterthought)
                     I don't carry.  Baggage.

     Little twist on that.

                               GIN
                     Sensible.  And you're off to...?

                               MAC
                     Oh, that's highly personal.

     He still stares straight ahead.  The taxi pulls onto a freeway.
     Toward Narita Airport.  Time running out.  And in her dearest, most
     vulnerable, voice...

                               GIN
                     I did so hope to impress you.

     She puts the fingertips of her left hand.  On his chest.  A
     silence.  No reaction.

                               GIN (hopeful)
                     I'm still hoping...

     And he smiles.  Turns to her eyes.

                               MAC
                     Young lady.  I am old enough to
                     be your grandfather.

     She shakes her head.  Uh-uh.

                               GIN (soft)
                     My father.

     Leans her mouth in for the kill.

                               GIN (whisper)
                     That's part of the rush.

     And softly.  Fits her mouth to his.  The green eyes close, as
     she tastes him.  Nothing predatory in this kiss.  It is tender,
     exquisite.  A kiss of deep longing.  Of true love.

     His arms slip around her.  And in less than five seconds...

                               TAXI DRIVER (O.S., racist accent)
                     Still on fo' airport?

     Nobody.  Says.  Nothin'.

     INT. MAC'S SUITE - LATE NIGHT

     A small bottle.  An ornate label.  Chateau d'Yquem '67.  Gin lifts
     it from the table, studies the label.  She wears only a man's
     oversized t-shirt.  Our rotating ANGLE reveals the empty bed,
     tangled sheets.  Gin looks pretty rumpled herself.

     She lifts the bottle, two glasses, a plateful of chocolates and
     strawberries, and goes to the sliding glass door overlooking...

     ...the TERRACE.  Mac sits on a futon at the balcony railing,
     overlooking downtown Tokyo.  He wears a thin Japanese robe called
     a yukata, and is wrapped in half of a huge down COVERLET from the
     bed.  The other half obviously waiting for...

                               GIN
                     Here.  A reward.

     She curls down into the billowing coverlet, just against his body.
     Sets her things beside him.

                               MAC
                     A reward for what?

                               GIN
                     For not being old.  After all.

     It is a lovely smile.  He studies it for a beat.

                               MAC
                     You mean.  Not as old as I look.

     She traces her finger along his cheek.

                               GIN (a whisper)
                     Yeh.

     And kisses him.  It takes awhile.  She seems to enjoy it.  With
     him, it's harder to tell.  When she pulls back...

     ...he picks up a chocolate.  Tears it in half.  Offers her the
     larger piece.

                               GIN
                     Do I deserve a reward?

     No answer.  He puts the chocolate into her mouth.  With great
     tenderness, he traces the line of her lower lip.  As she swallows.

                               GIN
                     It's so hard to find good casual
                     sex, anymore.  I'm probably out
                     of practice.

     But he just looks at her.

                               MAC
                     What's hard to find.  Is someone
                     you truly want to be with.

     And leans closer.  Just above a whisper...

                               MAC
                     Even for awhile.

     He kisses her.  Beautiful and deep, the way he does it.  And
     when he pulls back, she is staring at him.  As if at a loss for
     something to say.

                               GIN
                     It's lucky we stopped by my room,
                     for the wine.

     She swallows.  Because his gaze is unrelenting. As if not
     forgetting that she's changed the subject.

                               GIN
                     Otherwise, we'd never have found
                     my bag was stolen.  Until tomorrow.

                               MAC
                     Would that make it more stolen?

     She smiles.  His face looks kind now, not formidable at all.  Maybe
     she's wondering if she actually likes him.

                               GIN
                     They even got my prescriptions.

                               MAC
                     Something you need? There are
                     all-night chemists...

     He does look concerned.  And therefore sweet.  She kisses his nose.

                               GIN
                     I take Prilosec.  For stomach
                     acid.  And an inhaler.  For asthma.

     She gets her old smile.  The soft, wicked tease.

                               GIN
                     But since I didn't have to work
                     all that hard tonight...

     He stares at her.  Cocks a finger, like a gun, right between her
     eyes.  Pantomimes pulling the trigger.

                               GIN (softly)
                     Ouch.  I had that coming.

     She pivots, and snuggles her back comfortably into his chest.  He
     wraps strong arms around her.  Pulling her close.

                               GIN
                     Why would someone steal my luggage?
                     Every guest in this place must
                     have more than a wannabe art dealer.

                               MAC
                     Ah.  Maybe the thief thought you
                     had something valuable in there.

     Something in the tone.

                               GIN
                     Such as...

                               MAC
                     Well.  Wannabe dealers make
                     excellent fences.

     A flicker.  In her eyes.  And she cuddles back.  As if enjoying the
     humor.

                               GIN
                     He thought I had a stolen
                     painting.  In my bag.

                               MAC
                     I'm joking, of course.

     Kisses the top of her head.

                               MAC
                     The Vermeer wouldn't fit.

     Her eyes widen.  Just a little.

                               GIN
                     Excuse me?

                               MAC
                     Why, did you do something wrong?

     She turns all the way around.  Their faces are inches apart.  Each
     reading the other's eyes.

                               GIN
                     You said.  Vermeer.

                               MAC
                     The most famous painting stolen
                     this week.

     His turn.  To kiss her nose.

                               MAC
                     If you don't keep up on your
                     craft.  You'll miss all the jokes.

     And lowers her gently onto her back.  Still staring in her eyes, he
     winds her legs around him.  Her mouth parts, but...

     ...he fills it with his own.

     This conversation.  Is over.

     INT. MAC'S SUITE - MORNING

     VIEW of the empty terrace, the rumpled, twisted coverlet.  Maybe
     they spent all night.  HEAR the shower running full blast in a
     distant bathroom.  PULL BACK to see...

     Gin, hair wet, wrapped in a plush hotel robe, rapidly and expertly
     going through dresser, night stand, closet, sofa cushions, every
     goddam thing in the room.  She comes to...

     ...Mac's tux.  The jacket, rifles the pockets, pats the lining.
     The pants now...

     ...something peculiar. The right leg has no stripe. Touches the
     cloth.  Slightly sticky where the stripe should be.  Odd.

     ANGLE...the bathroom.  Shower running full BLAST.  But there's no
     one in it.

     ANGLE...a storage closet.  Mac crouching in the smallspace.  We
     see the travel bag.  The luggage tag, VIRGINIA ROMAY, a Darien,
     Connecticut address.  The embossed initials VR.  But there is
     something else in Mac's hand...

     ...a prescription bottle.  Prilosec.  And a name, GINGER BAKER.
     Chicago address.  Mac puts the pills in the pocket of his robe...

     ...exits the closet.  Locks the door.

     ANGLE...Mac ambling into the bedroom, toweling his hair with one
     hand.  Holding his billfold in the other.  Gin is starting a room
     service breakfast.  Eggs, sausage, Belgian waffles.  The girl can
     eat.

                               MAC
                     I'm so glad I didn't leave Tokyo.

     She looks up.  Trademark dry grin...

                               GIN
                     I love a guy who knows how to
                     sweet talk.

     He stands over her.  Smiling.  What he meant was...

                               MAC
                     There was a call.  While you
                     were sleeping.

     A call.

                               MAC
                     An art dealer I know.  He has a
                     Monet.  Minor, but it is Giverny.
                     He'll let me have it for 5.3 million.

     She stares at him.

                               GIN (cautiously)
                     We can maybe beat that.

                               MAC (pulling plastic from his billfold)
                     I agree.  This is a bank debit card.
                     It gives the bearer access to an
                     account containing 4.6 and change.
                     I dislike round numbers.

     And hand. the card to her.  As her eyes move over it...

                               MAC
                     I'd like you to go down there,
                     and pick up the painting.  If
                     that's all right.

     Without looking up...

                               GIN
                     Me.

                               MAC
                     If I'm there, he'll haggle.  You
                     just hand him the debit card, with
                     that...luminous smile.  And say,
                     take it or leave it.

     Now her eyes come up.  She says nothing.  Hesitant.

                               MAC
                     Oh, dear.  I thought you so
                     wanted to make a good impression.

                               GIN
                     Thought I already did th...

                               MAC
                     And along with making an excellent
                     impression.  You will also make 2
                     percent of the purchase price.

     She blinks.

                               MAC
                     That's $92,000.  And change..
                     For two hours work.

     The look holds.  He goes to the desk.  Lifts a cellular phone.
     TOSSES it to her.

                               MAC
                     Any problems.  Just give me
                     a ring.

                               GIN
                     Stolen painting is it?

                               MAC
                     Of course not.

     And on his way out the door...

                               MAC
                     If it was.  I wouldn't pay more
                     than three.

     EXT. WHARF, YOKOHAMA - DAY

     Gin climbing out of a taxi at a scruffy section of Yokohama's Bund.
     Sleazy shops, pachinko parlors, hostess bars, sidewalk noodle
     counters, all built along a tall rickety PIER nearly thirty feet
     above the pounding surf.  The harbor is gigantic.  Every type and
     size of vessel imaginable.

     Gin carries a long neoprene-covered tube with watertight seals and
     a lightweight bright orange foam cover.  She looks at her slip of
     paper.  Then across at the place...KENDO SOUVENIRS, a schlock
     kickback parlor, with a tourist bus parked out front.

     This can't be right.  Pulls out the cellular phone.  Dials.

                               MAC'S RECORDED VOICE (O.S.)

                     of AMD Investments.  And, yes,
                     you are at the right place.

     Fucking great.

                               GIN (into phone, pissed)
                     I like men with a sense of humor.
                     This does not qualify.

     SNAPS the phone shut.  Checks the slip again.  Walks firmly across
     the street, through the mobs of tourists, and into...

     INT. KENDO SOUVENIRS - DAY

     The place is huge, ramshackle, loaded with every piece of tourist
     crap imaginable.  The only paintings on display are renderings of
     big cats on black velvet.  She winds her way through, to a counter
     at the back.  One guy there...

                               GIN (subtitled Japanese)
                     May I please speak with Mr. Okati.

                               OKATI
                     You doin' it.

     The best we can say for the pudgy, balding fellow in the Hawaiian
     shirt and spectacularly baggy trousers, is that he does not seem to
     be the guy who is selling you a Monet.  Even a minor one.

                               GIN
                     I think there's some mista...

                              OKATI
                     You from Mac?

     She stops.  Jesus.  The guy COUGHS horribly.

                               GIN
                     I'm from Mac.

                               OKATI
                     Lemme see card.

     She hesitates.

                               OKATI
                     Four million, six hundred
                     thirteen thousand, five hundred?

     Wow.  He slaps his hand on the table.  Lay it down, toots.

                               GIN
                     You first.

     He shrugs.  Lifts straight up, from beneath the counter...

     ...a brown paper-wrapped rectangle.  Not much larger than two feet
     square.  She can't even believe she's here, doing this.  Gestures
     to him.  Open it up!

     He obliges, COUGHING grossly all the while.  Unwrapped, the
     painting does look like a Monet.  From here.  She stares at it.

                               GIN
                     Now bring me the real one.

     He doesn't blink.

                               OKATI
                     This as real as it gets, lady.

     And from within her pocket.  The cellular RINGS.  She takes it
     out.  Puts it to her ear.

                               MAC (O.S.)
                     You got it?

                               GIN (into phone)
                     Is this an audition, a joke, or
                     a rip-off?  I'm staring at an
                     obvious forgery, here.

                               MAC (O.S.)
                     Turn it over.

     This gives her pause.  Then, cradling the phone against her
     shoulder, she does as she's told.  To see...

                               MAC (O.S.)
                     Is there an envelope?  Taped to
                     the back?  In a Ziploc bag?

     Sure is.

                               GIN (into phone)
                     Uh-huh.

                               MAC (O.S.)
                     Detach the bag.  Read what's
                     in it.  Aloud.

     She does.  Carefully unfolding several sheets of paper, maps...

                               GIN (reading into phone)
                     Shikoku Naru, a freighter, it
                     says, Yokohama to Jakarta...dates,
                     statistics...specs on some kind of
                     machine, diag...

                               MAC (O.S.)
                     Papers back in the envelope,
                     envelope back in the Ziploc, very
                     quickly, without seeming to hurry...

     Her eyes are flickering questions, but she does as she's told,
     cradling the phone with her shoulder.

                               MAC (O.S.)
                     Now take the debit card from your
                     purse, slipping the Ziploc into the
                     purse as you do it, shielding the move
                     from everyone in the room but Okati.

     And she does.  More deftly than we could ever have imagined.  Like
     a pro.

                               MAC (O.S., quietly)
                     Give him the card.

     A beat.

                               GIN (into phone)
                     Mac, the painting's a forg...

                               MAC (O.S., even quieter)
                     This is a test.  Of whether you'll
                     still be alive four minutes from
                     now.  Do you hear me?

     Her face freezes.  In a pleasant smile.

                               GIN (into phone)
                     Yes, Mac, I do.

                               MAC (0.5.)
                     Now.  Hand him the card, and tell
                     him in Japanese to pretend he is
                     checking it by phone.  Tell him to
                     take awhile, as if he's on hold.

     She turns the sweet plastic smile to Okati.  Hands him the card...

                               GIN (subtitled Japanese)
                     Mac says, pretend you're checking
                     this by phone, and take your ti...

                               OKATI (subtitled Japanese)
                     ...like I'm on hold, sure.

     And suddenly, his eyes are keen and quick, and he is no longer some
     schmuck in baggy pants.  He takes the card, stares at it comically,
     picks up the phone.

                               MAC (O.S.)
                     While he's checking, look around
                     the room casually, as if searching
                     for the cheesy handbags...

     She begins to.

                               MAC (O.S.)
                     All the while laughing, as if you
                     are chatting with someone you
                     actually like.

                               GIN (into phone)
                     I'm not that good.

     But she is.  And she laughs, as she strolls over to the cheesy
     handbags.

                               MAC (O.S.)
                     As you're looking around, do you
                     notice any m...

                               GIN (into phone)
                     Three guys, two together, one
                     alone.  Cheap suits, not looking
                     at me in a cop-casual way.

                               MAC (O.S.)
                     Call out cheerily to Okati, in
                     English, 'Where's the toilet?'

                               GIN (into phone)
                     Can I say, 'little girl's room'?

     A beat.

                               MAC (O.S.)
                     Wing it.

                               GIN (calls out, cheerily)
                     WHERE'S THE CRAPPER?

     Okati, absorbed by his make-believe phone call, points around the
     back.

                               MAC (O.S.)
                     Get going.  Now.

                               GIN (into phone, as she saunters)
                     Mac, the painting isn't...

                               MAC (O.S.)
                     You've got what we bought, are
                     you out of their sight?

     She turns the corner.  Filthy corridor.  Restrooms at opposite
     ends.

                               MAC (O.S.)
                     Run into the men's toilet.
                     I know you know how.

     A beat of uncertainty.  She looks both ways.

                               MAC (O.S., ominous)
                     Are you running?

     And she DOES.  SPRINTING down the garbage-strewn hallway, throws
     OPEN the men's room door, BURSTING IN on...

     ...a wispy OLD GUY taking a leak through a HOLE in the floor.

                               GIN (subtitled Japanese)
                     GET THE FUCK OUT OF HERE!

     The panicked little man STARTLES.  Bolts OUT the door.

                               MAC (O.S.)
                     Jump.

     Jump?  HEAR now, from the corridor, footfalls POUNDING.  She looks
     down through the piss hole.  The surf ROILS thirty feet below.

                               GIN (into phone)
                     It's too small.

                               MAC (O.S.)
                     The window, twit!

     Oh.  She hops OVER the disgusting hole, boosts herself UP to the
     small window, footfalls racing CLOSER, HOISTS herself HALFWAY
     through, DROPPING the phone a scary 30 feet to the surf below, as
     behind her, the door...

     ...SLAMS OPEN and she FLIES OUT the window...

                               GIN
                     SHIIIIIIIIIIT...

     WITH her in SLO-MO, kicking and flailing and grasping her shoulder
     bag, and she...

     HITS the ocean like a ton of bricks.  Disappears.  Comes up,
     sputtering in the swirling water, as from out of the shadows of
     the pilings...

     ...an engine ROARS to life, the BLUR of a custom JETSKI, Mac
     reaching to scoop the startled girl OUT of the water, and they...

     ...BLAST OFF, as bullets RAIN helplessly after them.  The AGENTS
     shouting into their cellulars, racing in frustration down the pier,
     which rapidly vanishes behind us, as...

     ...Gin hangs onto Mac for dear life.  This baby is REALLY hauling.
     He wears an orange waterproof slicker with matching trousers.
     Shouts back, against the noise...

                               MAC
                     ARE YOU PISSED OFF?

     She thinks.  Admits, shouting in his ear...

                               GIN
                     ACTUALLY.  IT'S INCREDIBLY COOL!

     He is heading into deep water, a major shipping channel, points to
     one side, and she sees...

     ...a huge HARBOR PATROL vessel FIRE UP in near distance.  The chase
     is ON.  They speed toward the WAKE of a luxury liner, and as she
     realizes...

                               GIN
                     OH NOOOOOO...

     They SLAM INTO the wake HEAD ON, and are AIRBORNE for an amazing
     distance, JOLTING back to the surface, RACING toward...

     ...two gigantic FREIGHTERS which approach each other from opposite
     directions.  The Harbor Patrol in hot pursuit, BLASTING its HORN...

                               GIN
                     WE'RE GONNA DIE, AREN'T WE?

                               MAC
                     JUST AS SOON AS I'M READY!

     As we near the outbound freighter, Mac CUTS his speed.  Now the
     Harbor Patrol is really gaining.

                               GIN
                     FASTER, NOT SLOWER, YOU TWIT!!

                               MAC
                     HAVE TO GIVE THEM A SPORTING
                     CHANCE...

     Cruising STRAIGHT TOWARD the part side of the outbound freighter,
     as the inbound freighter begins to pass it on the far side...

                               MAC
                     ...SOMETHING WE SCOTS LEARNED
                     FROM THE BRITS!

     As the Harbor Patrol is nearly ON them, Mac VEERS suddenly AROUND
     the stern of the outbound freighter, the Harbor patrol WHEELING
     madly to pursue, only to find we are both CAREENING straight AT...

     ...the starboard side of the inbound freighter, Mac CUTS his wheel
     in an adroit nearly right-angle SWERVE, and hears the SCREAMS as
     the Harbor patrol...

     PLOWS INTO the freighter!  Wasting no time, he ACCELERATES into
     maximum BURN, STREAKING toward the immensely crowded harbor and its
     thousand vessels.  Gin can't help but look back at the impressive
     crash site, mouthing a silent WOW.

     Nearing the harbor, Mac CUTS speed completely, drifting between two
     huge ships and...

     ...vanishing from sight.

     EXT. SMALL CHANNEL - DAY

     The tiny Jetski cruises in a quiet channel, crowded with vessels of
     all sizes, tugs, fishing boats, pleasure craft, junks, sampans, all
     larger than we are.  Gin clings close to Mac, although it is no
     necessary.  More like romantic.  She is still flushed with
     the rush.

                               GIN
                     I guess you're gonna explain
                     all this, huh?

     But he says nothing.  Pulls out a water-tight duffle.  Hands it
     back to her, without looking.

                               MAC
                     Dry clothes, you'll need them.
                     In five minutes.

     She takes the bag, confused.

                               GIN
                     I'm supposed to change?  Here??

                               MAC
                     I won't look.  Gentleman's word
                     of hon...

                               GIN
                     There are a million sailors!

                               MAC
                     I've seen you naked.  Give the
                     boys a thrill.

     He means it.

                               MAC
                     You probably won't be dating
                     any of them, so what the hell.

     Gin looks around as they float through the maze of watercraft.  No
     one seems to be paying much attention.  What the hell.  She unzips
     the bag, pulling out...

                               GIN (astonished)
                     These...these are mine!

     He never looks around.

                               MAC
                     Found 'em in your room.  Perhaps
                     the thief wasn't your size.

     She stares at the back of his head.  wondering.  He is stripping
     off his slickers.  A neatly-tailored SUIT beneath.

                               MAC
                     We have a business appointment.
                     In four minutes.

     Okay.  She pulls her dress off OVER her head.

                               GIN
                     Business, huh?

     She ignores some nearby WHISTLES and SHOUTS.  Begins drying herself
     with a fluffy towel from the bag.

                               MAC (never turns)
                     Time has come to tell you.  What
                     business.  I'm actually in.

     Uh-oh.  Paydirt.

                               GIN
                     Uh.  Am I gonna like th...

                               MAC (quietly)
                     I'm a thief.

     She can scarcely believe he's admitting this.

                               MAC
                     And now that I've told you.
                     I'll have to kill you.

     He chuckles a Scottish chuckle.  Cold and warm, at once.

                               MAC
                     Or...

     She slips the dry dress OVER her head.

                               MAC
                     ...you can spend the most
                     interesting three weeks of
                     your life.  Training.

                               GIN
                     Training for wha...

                               MAC
                     ...followed by the most exciting
                     night of your life.  After which,
                     you can walk away with 20 million
                     untraceable dollars...

     She blinks.  He means this.

                               MAC
                     ...which will come in handy.
                     Things being what they are.

     He shrugs.

                               MAC
                     From now on.  You can valet park.

     She begins taking off her wet underwear, underneath the dress.  We
     suspect unseen hordes crestfallen at her modesty.

                               GIN
                     And if I refuse?

                               MAC (very quietly)
                     Don't.  Please.

                               GIN
                     I mean, you won't really kill
                     me, I'm far too adorable.

     He looks around at her.  As if deciding on that.

                               MAC
                     Last night, at Fujitsu, I did
                     some business.  While you thought
                     I was in the toilet.

     Jesus.

                               GIN
                     What could you possibly steal
                     in 18 min...

                               MAC
                     Thirty-five super-microchips.
                     Each worth one million dollars.
                     And change.

     Staring dead at her eyes.

                               GIN
                     You hate round num...

                               MAC
                     I stole your suitcase when I
                     left you at the bar.  I have
                     since sent it on to the States,
                     with three chips, well hidden.

     Are you following?

                               MAC
                     Since you aren't there to claim
                     it, the bag will sit at Customs.
                     Safe.  Unless...

     No smile.  No smile at all.

                               MAC
                     They receive.  An anonymous.  Tip.

     Holy.  Fucking.  Christ.

                               GIN
                     That's entrapment.

                               MAC
                     No, entrapment is what cops do
                     to robbers.

     We can feel her heart pounding from here.

                               MAC
                     Blackmail.  Is what robbers
                     do to schmucks.

     And leans.  To kiss her mouth.

                               MAC (softly)
                     Even adorable ones.

     They have glided up beside the gangway of a gigantic FREIGHTER.  It
     is at water level, the steps they use for their tender.  He points
     up to the name...

                               MAC
                     Pop quiz.

     SHIKOKU MARU.  She nods, slowly.  Pulls the Ziploc bag from her
     purse.  Hands it over.  He removes the sheets of paper.  Begins to
     peruse them...

                               MAC
                     Admit it's a rush.  The best day
                     of your heretofore drab life.

                               GIN
                     Fuck you.

     He glances up.

                               GIN
                     ...accompanied by related foreplay.

     And gives him the smile. What a gal.

     He offers his hand.  She rises, hops lightly to the steps of the
     gangway in her bare feet.  He pulls dry shoes from the duffle.  And
     as she slips them on...

     ...he FLIPS a switch, and the Jetski begins to FILL with water, Mac
     stepping to the gangway beside her.  They watch...

     ...the Jetski rapidly SINK out of sight.

     No evidence.  A thorough guy.

     INT. FREIGHTER HOLD - DAY

     Mac and Gin stand inside a gigantic CARGO BAY, watching massive
     CONTAINERS being loaded by crane from a dock, through the gaping
     HATCH.  The chamber is a vaulted cathedral of steel, painted
     hospital green, and Mac's eye moves over all of it, seeming to
     inspect every plate, every pan head rivet.

                               VOICE (O.S., British cheer)
                     Hullo, there!

     They turn to see a round little man with watering eyes and a very
     wide necktie, skipping-down the iron steps.  Bursting with a
     salesman's bonhomie, he extends a plump hand...

                               MAN
                     Nickerson Carlsby, Mr...
                     MacDuff, yes?

                               MAC
                     Banquo MacDuff.  This is my
                     associate-fiancee, Ms. Duncan.

     The little man pauses.  A tic in the well-oiled smile...

                               CARLSBY
                     That is...fiancee and assoc...

                               GIN (cheery herself)
                     I'm a hyphenate.

     Ah.  Like that makes complete sense.  Fingers the gardenia in his
     lapel...

                               CARLSBY
                     Well, it's a pleasure, in this
                     alien place, to do business with
                     a countryman.

                               MAC
                     I'm a Scot.  It's a different
                     country.  Culturally and historically.

     I see.

                               CARLSBY (looking around)
                     Well.  They've brought you to
                     quite the wrong place, I see.

                               MAC (looking around)
                     Thank God.

     ANGLE...Carlsby leads the way along a narrow catwalk, which ends at
     a steel door.  He presses his thumb to the I.D. panel, and speaks
     into the voice box...

                               CARLSBY (confidential code-voice)
                     In Penny Lane, the barber shaves
                     another customer...

     The door CLANGS open.  They go through it, as a gangway leads
     toward an open five-foot-thick VAULT DOOR, where two ARMED GUARDS
     rise from their seats.  Carlsby ignores them as if they were
     furniture.  THUMPS the door...

                               CARLSBY
                     Five feet thick with hidden rein-
                     forcements, no way to drill through!

                               GIN (authoritative)
                     Impressive.

                               CARLSBY
                     Only the tip of our security
                     iceberg.  See these two Brinks
                     locks...?

     They do.

                               CARLSBY
                     The Captain keeps one key.  The
                     other is continually forwarded:
                     to the Chief of Security at next
                     port.  There is no way to enter
                     during voyage.

                               GIN
                     I like this.

     Carisby glances to Mac.  He is stone.

                               CARLSBY
                     The best armed guard, rotated every
                     six hours.  A redundancy, of course,
                     but we would rather be safe three
                     times over than merely two.

                               GIN
                     Sound mathematics.

                               MAC (very quiet)
                     What if there's a fire?  In the
                     chamber.

     Ah.  Carlsby leads them through the open door, into...

     ...the maximum-security HOLD.  Primo.  The steel coated with sleek,
     matte, black all-grip paint.  Tubby points up...

                               CARLSBY
                     Sprinklers.  New design.  Incredible
                     power.  The entire chamber is water-
                     proof, fireproof, airtight.  If the
                     ship sinks, God forfend, your cargo
                     is secure for salvage.

     No reaction.  Mac does not look convinced.

                               CARLSBY
                     And your cargo is...?

                               MAC
                     Wine.

     Wine.

                               MAC
                     The bloody Japs bought up half
                     the premium clarets in the universe.
                     You may have heard.

     Actually.  He has.

                               MAC
                     I'm in charge of shipping some
                     14,000 bottles, most quite rare,
                     to a number of premium hotels in
                     Hong Kong, Bangkok, Singapore,
                     Phuket, and Penang.

     Carlsby gets the romance of it all.

                               MAC
                     All of which are destinations on
                     your October voyage.  Five months
                     from now.  However...

     And turns to the man.  With laser, disapproving eyes.

                               MAC
                     Wine.  Doesn't prefer.  To be
                     jostled.

     The man beams.  Gestures to a series of PLATFORMS, each SWAYING at
     different heights, in different directions.

                               CARLSBY
                     Our 'delicate treasure' platforms,
                     suspended on gimbals.  Your cargo
                     remains unruffled by roiling seas.
                     Then, on arrival, is plucked...

     Pointing once more...

                               CARLSBY
                     By that forklift, and gently
                     deposited on dock through the
                     cargo hatch...

     ...a huge circular hatch cut into the hull.  Mac's eyes stare
     blankly at it.  A long beat.  He pronounces it all...

                               MAC
                     Adequate.  I suppose.

     And then turns once more.

                               MAC
                     Did we see...a bathing pool.
                     On deck?

                               CARLSBY
                     Oh, yes, sir.  The Shikoku Maru
                     carries sixteen luxury suite pas-
                     senger cabins.  The finest cuisine.
                     For valued clients who prefer to
                     cruise in privacy.

     Mac.  Thinks this over.

                               MAC
                     Mildly.  Interesting.

     INT. PASSENGER DECK - DAY

     Carlsby ushering the couple along a plushly-appointed hallway.  A
     secret oasis of refinement in the heart of the massive freighter.
     He opens a burnished door, into...

     ...an elegant SUITE.  Cherrywood panels, spacious windows with
     views of the harbor.  The finest furnishings.  It is breathtaking.
     Even...

                               MAC
                     Adequate.  I suppose.

                               GIN
                     But dearest, in five months,
                     we'll be in Cape Town.

     Mac pulls from his pocket the folded sheets that had once been
     taped to the back of Okati's Monet.  Peruses them casually.

                               MAC
                     Anything sooner?  That goes
                     perhaps from...say, Sri Lanka?
                     To Jakarta.

     And looks up.  To a man dumbstruck.  By coincidence.

                               CARLSBY
                     Why, yes.  In three weeks.

     INT. CESSNA - DAY

     Looking DOWN on California's San Joaquin Valley from 12,000 feet,
     as air RUSHES past our open door.

                               MAC (O.S.)
                     You seem depressed.

     PULL BACK to see them both in jumping suits.  He's checking her
     gear.  She's eyeing the expansive grid of fields below.

                               GIN
                     At your insistence, I'm leaping
                     to my death, and I don't know why!

     He clips a tether from his harness to hers.

                               MAC
                     Because.  You're a greedy girl.

                               GIN
                     I'm not jumping until you talk
                     about this, it's been two days!

     She folds her arms across her chest.  Rebellious.  He smiles at her
     tenderly.  Nods, okay.

                               GIN
                     Why are we going in three weeks,
                     if the wine is on a different
                     route months lat...

                               MAC
                     There is no wine.  That just bought
                     us a look at their security.

     She stares at him.

                               GIN
                     I knew that.

                               MAC
                     What we want is on the boat in
                     three weeks.  Now can we jump?

                               GIN
                     The machine in those diagrams.  on
                     the back of the painting.

     Maybe.  He's still smiling.

                               GIN
                     What does it do, make gold?

                               MAC
                     We're nearing the targ...

                               GIN
                     Why won't you trust me?

                               MAC
                     How do I know who you are, hmmn?

     Stares in her eyes.

                               MAC
                     For all I know, your name isn't
                     Virginia Romay.  Maybe you're
                     a cop.

     She stares back.  Dead straight.

                               GIN
                     Why would a cop do all th...

                               MAC (softly)
                     Entrapment, remember? What cops
                     do to robbers.

                               GIN (just as softly)
                     Oh.  That.

     His smile is light, affectionate.  Gently, he backs her to the edge
     of the doorway...

                               MAC
                     One...two...

     She THROWS her arms around his neck.  Holds him close.

                               GIN
                     Mac, I'm afraid.

     Vulnerable and touchingly real.  His arms slide around her.

                               GIN
                     Of you.

                               MAC (a murmur)
                     Smart girl.

     And JUMPS, Gin SHRIEKING in his arms, as we...

     FOLLOW them, TUMBLING in FREE FALL, until he releases her, and bot
     EXTEND their arms and legs, as if flying, as if gliding face down,
     her shriek CONTINUING.  He floats at the end of their tether, a few
     feet above her.  And at last...

     ...her SCREAMING STOPS.  We see the pure adrenaline rush.  Shouts
     back...

                               GIN
                     NEXT TIME, I'M ON TOP!

     EXT. HILLTOP, MARIN COUNTY - DAY

     Woods, rolling hills, a dirt path.  Mac stands by a sign at a
     crossroads, names, arrows, STINSON BEACH, BOLINAS, MT. TAMALPAIS,
     MILL VALLEY.  There is a phone booth nearby.  He holds a stopwatch,
     looking down the path, as...

     ...Gin runs into view, steady stride, breathing hard, sheened with
     sweat.  Approaching him, she slows to a stop.  Hands on her knees,
     catching her wind. He CLICKS the watch.

                               MAC
                     Consistent.  And rather impressive.

     She sends a nasty smile, thanks a bunch.  But maybe she likes the
     compliment, after all.

     EXT. MAC'S CABIN, BOLINAS - NIGHT

     Rustic cabin in moonlight.  Ringed by woods.  Middle of nowhere,
     which is where Mac likes it.  As we approach the lit window, we
     hear two oddly-matched sounds.  splashing water.  And the HISS of a
     violent POWER TOOL.  We MOVE THROUGH the window, into...

     INT. BATHROOM - NIGHT

     Two figures stand in the shower, spray SOAKING their shorts and
     tank tops.  Gin is operating a sleek WELDER, trying to perform
     micro-surgery on a DARTBOARD which Mac waves in all directions at
     the end of a short pole.

                               MAC
                     All right, six and seven...

     She blinks the spray from her eyes, and deftly SEARS the wire
     dividing those two numbers on the board.  As Mac keeps waving it,
     she goes off line.  Concentrates.  Gets it right.  The wire PEELS
     away...

                               MAC
                     Three and four...

     EXT. CABIN - DAY

     CLOSE on Gin operating a small steamshovel with a loading
     attachment on the front.  It is mounted with two 2 x 4's, set
     close together, protruding from the loader.  She maneuvers the
     wooden prongs toward a pile of big rocks.  But as she positions
     to scoop one up, her vehicle SWAYS WILDLY, and we PULL BACK to
     see it is...

     ...dangling from a CRANE, operated by Mac.  Gin stays with it,
     concentrates, and on the next pass she glides her boards UNDER a
     huge rock, LIFTING it awkwardly.  Ignoring the bumpy ride, she
     pivots, and deposits her prize in place atop what has become...

     ...a WALL of stones.

                               GIN
                     What the hell are we building?

     He gives this some reflection.

                               MAC
                     A chalet, I think.  Or an outhouse.

     EXT. OCEAN - NIGHT

     Mac and Gin paddle KAYAKS, side by side.  A full moon slams off
     the rolling surface of the sea.  Light chop, enough to bob pretty
     strong once they stop paddling.  His stopwatch GLOWS.  He says
     only...

                               MAC
                     Forty seconds.

     And she FLIPS OVER, submerging her head and torso, and we go...
     ...WITH her underwater, upside-down in the kayak, she STRUGGLES to
     FREE a group of tools which are tethered to her wetsuit.  Fumbling
     to BREAK the seal on a slender TUBE, which BURSTS, sending a GLOW
     of yellow-green LIGHT in all directions.  She fits the flexible
     tube around her head like a headlamp, pulling out...

     ...a small ELECTRIC FAN with side HANDGRIPS of black metal.
     Buffeted by the current, Gin manages to flip a small switch on the
     housing of the fan, and...

     ...nothing happens.  Again.  Nothing.  And again.  SHIT!  With a
     supreme effort, she tries to ROLL herself upright, but...

     ...can't quite make it.  Blind PANIC now, blowing bubbles, FLAILING
     at the kayak, which suddenly...

     ROLLS upright, manipulated by Mac.  She sputters and tries to
     THROW the tethered fan at him, but it snaps back and SLAMS her
     across the shoulder.  She is furious.

                               GIN
                     Get your fucking equipment
                     together, man, this is a
                     professional operation!!

     EXT. WOODS - DAY

     Gin in a clearing, arms at her sides, a determined look.  Mac is
     somewhere just behind us.

                               MAC (O.S.)
                     This time, when you raise your
                     arm.  Don't breathe.

     She nods, got it.  Focused.  suddenly, in the clearing before her,
     a HOSTAGE SILHOUETTE TARGET pops up, the outline of a terrorist
     shielding himself with a hostage, Gin's arm rising with a BLUR
     and...

     ...BLAMM, BLAMM, BLAMM!!!  The paper terrorist is NAILED in the
     head.  Two out of three.  She lets out a thin stream of air.  Proud
     of herself, but too cool to gloat.

                               MAC
                     Very, very nice.  Had a tour
                     with the Mosad, did you?

     She turns slowly.

                               GIN
                     Where does this fit in the
                     game plan?

     His enigmatic, yet fond, smile.

                               MAC
                     Oh, it doesn't.  But one
                     never knows...

     A quiet wink.

                               MAC
                     You might need it with me.

     INT. CABIN - NIGHT

     CLOSE on Gin leaning back at a 45 degree angle.  She is sweating.
     This is hard.  HEAR a SLAM-THWOCK!  And ANOTHER.  PULL BACK to
     reveal...

     She is climbing UP the inside of the angled A-frame CEILING, using
     hand rods with powerful SUCTION cups, and similar suction devices
     on the balls of her feet.  A human spider, inching up the wall with
     everything she's got.  She SLAMS the next hand rod down, and it...

     ...slips.

                               GIN
                     Shit.

     ...as she TUMBLES eighteen feet to...

     DISAPPEAR in an ocean of STYROFOAM packing bubbles, which EXPLODE
     in all directions like popcorn in a nuclear accelerator.

     She has totally VANISHED.  Buried alive.

                               GIN (O.S.)
                     DID I SAY SHIT?

     Mac is wading into the sea of plastic bits, DIGGING her body out
     with his bare hands.  Once more, she comes up sputtering.

                               GIN
                     This one, I will not get!

     He's holding her in his arms.  Leans close.

                               MAC
                     But you will, you'll get it all.
                     You are actually...

     He kisses her.

                               MAC
                     Quite remarkable.

     Something in the way he looks at her.  Her return gaze is naked.
     It looks like love.

                               MAC
                     Take the rest of the evening off.

     And kisses her again.  Her eyes close.

     EXT. FRONT PORCH - MORNING

     Mac sits alone at a table, sipping coffee, reading Barron's.   A
     short-wave radio is playing BBC World Service.  Leaning against an
     open laptop, is...

     ...Mac's stopwatch.  He glances up at it.  What he sees makes him
     reach into a duffle at his feet, withdraw...

     ...a rectangular gun-metal gray DEVICE.  Looks like a cross between
     a remote control clicker and a large cell phone.  Turns it ON.  The
     power display GLOWS green.

     EXT. HILLTOP - MORNING

     Gin running alone.  Up the dirt path we've seen before.  Ahead, the
     crossroads, the sign.  The lonely phone booth.

     EXT. FRONT PORCH

     Mac tuning the device, which is an advance-design SCANNER.  We HEAR
     overlapping CONVERSATIONS through bursts of STATIC...

                               OVERLAPPING VOICES (O.S.)

     INT. PHONE BOOTH

     Gin at the phone.  Inserts her credit card.  Catches her breath.

     EXT. FRONT PORCH

     Mac HEARS a phone RINGING over the scanner.  Punches RECORD, PLUGS
     the scanner INTO his laptop.

                               VOICE (O.S.)
                     Webber Assurance.

                               GIN (O.S.)

                     Go ahead, please.

                     Thank y...

     The line goes DEAD.

     So do Mac's eyes.  Click the scanner OFF.

     INT. PHONE BOOTH

     Gin in her throaty, playful voice...

                               GIN
                     ...no way I'm telling you shit.

                               CRUZ (O.S.)
                     Baker, this is an extremely
                     dangerous g...

                               GIN
                    ...right now, you're more dangerous
                    than he is.

     A pause.  Her voice is smiling.  Not her eyes.

                               CRUZ (O.S.)
                    You want to explain th...

                               GIN
                    If I tell you what this is, and
                    where this is, you'll send back-up,
                    and those morons will blow my cover,
                    and I'll be too dead to accept your
                    apology.

     A longer beat.

                               CRUZ (O.S.)
                     You're fucking him, aren't you?

                               GIN
                     Right to the wall.

     Her eyes are stone cold.  We've never seen her like this.  She
     looks like Mac.

                               CRUZ (O.S.)
                     You're over your head, Baker.

                               GIN
                     Only romantically.  I'll write to
                     him in prison.

     She's pulling out a different piece of plastic.  A drug store phone
     card.

                               CRUZ (O.S.)
                     Okay, it's your funeral.  Next time
                     I see you, I owe you a spanking.

                               GIN
                     Ooooo.  Is that a promise?

     Her cold eyes through his chuckle.

                               CRUZ (O.S.)
                     While you're on secure, do you want
                     a transfer?

                               GIN
                     Nope.  I'm headed back to the hot
                     tub.  I'll call again, if I'm in
                     the mood.

     And hangs up.  Collects her thoughts.  Inserts the phone card.
     Dials from memory.  Fifteen digits.  She must be calling Mars.
     At last...

     ...a man's VOICE.  In a strange sing-song language.

                               GIN (subtitled Mandarin)
                     Is it over?

     SMASH CUT TO...

     EXT. TIENANMEN SQUARE, BEIJING - NIGHT

     Late night, mostly youngsters strolling the unfathomable vastness
     of the square.  At what seems an immeasurable distance, the huge
     illuminated portrait of Mao zedong hangs from the Gate of Heavenly
     Peace.  The scale of this place is unique in all the world.  PAN to
     a nearby parked...

     ...Mercedes.  COL. QIU of the People's Liberation Army, lounges at
     the wheel in full uniform.  Talks into his cellular...

                               QIU (subtitled Mandarin)
                     ...it's not over yet, it hasn't
                     even begun.

     He listens, winces.  We can hear Gin's voice yelling at him in
     Mandarin, dishing out a major piece of her mind.

                               QIU (subtitled Mandarin)
                     ...after Midnight, when his meeting
                     ends.  In Zhongnanhai.

     He doesn't like her attitude.  And there's plenty of it.

                               QIU (subtitled Mandarin)
                     The mask will be ready...

     A phalanx of TROOPS march past.  The Colonel turns his face to
     shadow.  Drops his voice...

                               QIU (subtitled Mandarin)
                     You fucking bring the bones.

     EXT. ZHONGNANKAI, BEIJING - LATE NIGHT

     The walled compound where the Politburo's elite work and live.
     From an open gateway...

     ...the MINISTER OF FINANCE appears, flanked by bodyguards in the
     drab green of PRC police.  They step onto the street and turn into
     a narrow hutong.  Down the alleyway comes a young man walking his
     bicycle through shadow.  Nearing us, he raises his right hand,
     and...

     ...SHOOTS each bodyguard TWICE through the chest, DROPS the bike,
     LURCHES at the Minister with something cylindrical and gleaming,
     and...

     ...SPRAYS the cowering official's FACE with something that makes
     him SCREAM in pain, the assassin RUNNING down the hutong for his
     life, as a fallen guard...

     ...SHOOTS him in the back, and he goes SPRAWLING, SKIDDING, face
     down.  Lifeless.

     INT. OPHTHALMOLOGIST'S OFFICE, BEIJING - NIGHT

     Col. Qiu walks beside a jaunty ophthalmologist, DR. HONGWEI, who
     is turning ON lights in the darkened office as they go.  Behind
     them, two PLA SOLDIERS half-carry the agonized minister.  Into an
     examination room...

     ...the minister gently set into an examining chair.  The doctor
     tilts the face up, shines a light into the minister's eyes, which
     makes him GROAN.  Eye drops now, which make the man YELP in pain.
     HONGWEI now moves the RETINAL SCANNER into position, resting the
     minister's chin on the slot provided.  Turns it ON.  The machine's
     panel FLASHES numbers in red lights.  Hongwei looks into the box
     from the reverse angle, to view...

     ...a red LASER SCAN moving across the pupil vertically, then
     retracing its path horizontally, left to right, right to left,
     up and down, at speed.

     Hongwei moves to a computer monitor with a graphic rendering of
     the retina, clicks the keypad to section off a slice of the
     graphic, and ENLARGES the section 100 times.  Looks like pixels.

     Back to the scanner.  Touch a button, and...

     ...a COMPACT DISC pops out of the disc drive.  He places it in a
     box, telling the minister...

                               HONGWEI (subtitled Mandarin)
                     We send this to the lab for finer
                     analysis.  One piece of advice,
                     huh...?

     The minister squints up, painfully.

                               HONGWEI (subtitled Mandarin)
                     No more red pepper in your eye.
                     Not for awhile.

     The doctor LAUGHS.  The minister seethes.  But Colonel Qiu...

     Has his mind.  On business.

     EXT. GOLDEN GATE BRIDGE, SAN FRANCISCO - LATE NIGHT

     CLOSE on Gin's gloved hand, holding something we can scarcely see,
     as MIST floats up between us.  It is a carabiner with a nylon rope
     attached, and she CLIPS it to a thick wire.

                               GIN (O.S.)
                     I'm freezing my tender parts.

     PULL BACK to see her in climbing harness, scaling a nearly-vertical
     CABLE, three feet in diameter.  Enveloped in fog which reveals,
     then conceals.

                               MAC (O.S.)
                     I'm relieved to hear you have some.

     PULL WAY BACK to see him below her.  The two of them climbing
     the GOLDEN GATE BRIDGE.  They are near the top, more than 700
     feet above the silvery black BAY.  A precarious, dizzying sight.

                               MAC
                     What's amazing, is that only eleven
                     workers died during construction of
                     this thing...

                               GIN (grim)
                     ...thanks for sharing...

                               MAC
                     Of course, the others were saved by
                     a safety net.

     Gin keeps her focus on the small railed PLATFORM just above her.  A
     gutsy gal.

                               MAC (loving it)
                     Now, as for the suicides, they
                     always jump facing the city.  Avoids
                     that tall fence about 50 stories down,
                     see it, there?

     She's at the platform.

                               GIN
                     I never liked you.

     Unclips one last time.  This won't be easy.  Throws her rope
     OVER the railing, and to her surprise, Mac braces himself with
     his legs...

     ...lifts her from the waist with strong hands, boosting her easily
     to the platform.  Grateful, she hates to confess it.

                               GIN
                     One act of fucking human kindness...

                               MAC
                     Call it a lapse.

     And he swings lightly up beside her.  The fog has rolled past.
     There are several million stars.  Transcendent beauty.  She slows
     her breath...

                               GIN
                     And how does this fit into
                     the game pl...

                               MAC
                     Oh, it doesn't.  We came for
                     the view.

     And from his contoured backpack, he pulls a bottle of Cristal.
     Flutes, wrapped in velvet.  He POPS the cork in one motion, and it
     SAILS to its watery doom.  She can't help but watch.

     One more motion to pour both glasses.  Hands one to her.  Toasts...

                               MAC
                     To Ginger Baker.

     He clicks her glass.  She stares straight in his eye.  Shows no
     surprise, no fear...

                               GIN
                     I'm partial to drummers.  If they
                     played with Clapton and Winwood.

     And takes a sip.  Cool as a goose.  Licks her lips.

                               GIN
                     The prescription bottle.  When you
                     stole my suitcase.

     But he's not drinking.  Only staring.  The wind has picked up.

                               GIN
                     Armand Baker was my husband, May 13
                     to October 27, 1982, he played alto
                     sax, I was 17 years old.

     She takes another sip.  Good wine.

                               GIN
                     He named me Ginger.  He likes
                     drummers, too.

                               MAC
                     And you get sentimental for him.
                     Every time you order drugs.

                               GIN
                     I have I.D. in that name.  I use
                     it for various things I don't want
                     traced.  When credit unions turn
                     their computers my way.

                               MAC
                     I could listen to you lie all night.

     She toasts him.

                               GIN (softly)
                     Same here, fella.

     Slowly, he reaches to an inside pocket, watching to see if she
     flinches.  Her eyes do flicker.  And follow.  He withdraws not a
     pistol, but a handful of...

                               MAC
                     Do you like diamonds?

     Nine DIAMONDS, so large, so exquisite, she has to keep her eyes
     from bugging.  Wow.

                               MAC
                     You asked.  Does the machine.
                     Make gold.

     Holy.  Christ.

                               MAC
                     Gold is shit.  It's six thousand
                     dollars a pound.  Worth your weight
                     in gold...?

     His eyes travel her body...

                               MAC
                     That would put you at seven
                     hundred thousand.

                               GIN
                     Would you pay it?

     And he leans.  Looks in her eyes.

                               MAC
                     When the light hits you just
                     right.  I'd pay more.

     She liked that.  Maybe a lot.

                               GIN
                     The machine.  That we are stealing.
                     Makes diamonds?

     No answer.

                               GIN
                     Real ones?

                               MAC
                     Gem quality.  First ever.  God
                     save Japan.

     He toasts Blessed Japan to the East.  Takes a hit.

                               MAC
                     A diamond reactor takes graphite,
                     runs it through a combination of
                     lasers, electron beams, and scanning-
                     tunnel mg microscopes.

     He means this.  She is transfixed.

                               MAC
                     This one uses krypton-fluorine laser,
                     with a new isotope of krypton.

     She looks down at the diamonds in his palm.  His fist CLOSES.

                               MAC
                     The atoms are rearranged.  And
                     the molecule of graphite becoznes
                     a molecule of...

     He turns his fist UPSIDE-DOWN.  And LETS GO!  She GASPS as the
     brilliant stones FALL toward the sea.  Watching, watching, long
     after the moonlit glimmer has evaporated.  A hush.

                               GIN
                     I hate it.  When you make
                     a point.

     INT. SHIKOKU MARU - DAY

     CLOSE on two open PASSPORTS.  The names say BANQUO MACDUFF and
     ISADORA DUNCAN.  The faces are Mac and Gin.

                               STEWARD (O.S.)
                     All right, then.  All set.

     PULL BACK to see Mac and Gin dressed as tropical tourists.  She
     hangs on his arm.

                               STEWARD
                     We will keep your passports in
                     our safe until Jakarta.

                               MAC
                     Of course.

                               STEWARD
                     You are Suite 16...

                               GIN
                     ...and never been kissed.

     The steward doesn't get it.  Gin shrugs, sorry.

                               MAC
                     We had booked Suite 9.

                               STEWARD
                     16 is our Tokugawa Suite, far
                     superior, trust me.

     Mac consents.  A little wary.

                               STEWARD
                     You luggage is in the room, these
                     are your keys, the housekeeper
                     will show you t...

                               GIN (pouting)
                     Oh.  Can't we stroll around the
                     port?  Just a little?

     The steward checks his watch.

                               STEWARD
                     I'd be on board in forty minutes.
                     Just to be safe.

                               GIN (sweet smile)
                     Better safe.  Than sorry.

     EXT. DOCK, COLOMBO, SRI LANKA - DAY

     Mac and Gin stroll down the gangway, to the seedy, dangerous-
     looking wharf.  At the bottom of the gangway...

     ...a wooden board to mark the whereabouts of guests.  Each
     stateroom has a peg, which can be moved to ABOARD or ASHORE.  Mac
     moves the peg for 16...

     ...to the ABOARD position.

     And off they go.

     INT. SMALL PLANE - NIGHT

     Mac in his jump suit piloting the Dehaviland DHC-53 across the
     endless black of the Indian Ocean.  For the moment, he seems alone.
     Then...

                               MAC
                     Down there.  Ten o'clock.

     He means a tiny grouping of LIGHTS.  Way down there, against the
     darkness.  He switches on the AUTOPILOT.  Goes back to...

     ...Gin, waiting in her jump suit, sitting on a large pack of gear
     just beside the window of the jump door.  Next to her, a pack that
     is even larger.  No fear in her eyes tonight.  Pure adrenaline.

                               GIN
                     Are you dumping fuel?

                               MAC
                     Changed my mind.  There's nothing
                     on the instruments downrange.  The
                     longer she flies before she ditches,
                     the less chance they notice on the
                     Bridge.

     As she stands, he begins to strap the huge pack ONTO her body.
     Jesus.  With her chute, and the other gear attached, the load makes
     us uneasy.  Not her.

                               MAC
                     You should lose the oxygen tank
                     at 8000 feet.

                               GIN
                     And how do I judge that?  Babe's
                     intuition?

     He points to an altimeter device on his wrist.  It says 12,000
     feet.  She cuts him a look.

                               GIN
                     So I just ask you on the way down?
                     Or were you planning to e-mail me.

     He pulls out an identical device.  Strapping it to her wrist...

                               MAC
                     I hate a crybaby.

     He straps the even-larger gear pack to himself.  Checks the path of
     the tiny lights far below.  Then, looks in her eyes...

                               MAC (simply)
                     You can do this.

     Not merely reassurance.  Affection.  Something connective between
     them.  You are my partner.  Her eyes send back that personal bond,
     and she nods.  I can do this.  Good girl.

     He pulls on his oxygen mask, goggles.  She does the same.  He OPENS
     the door, air BLASTING in.  One more look down below, and he holds
     up ten fingers.  Counts them down, nine...eight...

     She moves to the edge.  Watching him.  And on zero, she...
     ARCHES out INTO the starry VOID, and we go...

     WITH HER, the incomparable RUSH of freefall, straining to see him
     FOLLOW, skillfully altering his position to gain on her, coming
     close.  She is looking between him and her altimeter, as...

     ...his oxygen tank FALLS AWAY, and she CUTS hers loose, the air
     RUSHING past her, she looks DOWN...

     ...the lights below are beginning to take the shape of the
     freighter.  Back up to Mac, as he...

     PULLS his CHUTE, it is black and square, and JOLTS him to what
     seems like a full STOP far above her, and she YANKS her cord,
     but...

     ...nothing.  It doesn't open.  She is ROCKETING down, looking back
     up to see Mac make an exaggerated CUTTING sign across his body, and
     she closes her eyes, PULLS her secondary chute, which...

     POPS open, JARRING her violently, and she GASPS with the shock.  He
     is well above her now, she isoff course, frantically trying to
     manipulate her trajectory, seeing him swooping closer, the
     freighter LOOMS in distance, she looks down and suddenly...

     ...the sea is RUSHING at her, she FIGHTS her braking mechanism,
     SHOUTING at herself...

                               GIN
                     FLARE, FLARE...

     ...and SLAMS INTO the water, PLUNGING down, twisting, disoriented
     CUTTING her chute loose, struggling not to get tangled, in a panic
     to BREAK her light tube, which...

     ...GLOWS yellow-green, illuminating the freezing depths, she FITS
     it around her head, fights now to pull out the small ELECTRIC FAN
     we've seen before, KICKING herself toward the surface, fighting
     against the weight of her gear pack, she...

     ...flips the switch, and the fan becomes a PROPELLER which ROCKETS
     her upward, but she loses her hold on one handgrip, tries
     desperately to hang on with one hand, but it...

     ...PULLS FREE, goes SHOOTING off into the blackness without her,
     one instant of TERROR in her eyes, and...

     Mac is THERE, diving at her with his propeller, she GRASPS his legs
     in a death grip, and suddenly, they are...

     AT the surface, Gin GASPING for air, and he CUTS his propeller,
     CRADLES her body with one strong arm, murmuring in her ear...

                               MAC
                     It's over, it's over...

     Her eyes are wild.

                               MAC
                     Catch your breath, quickly.
                     Hang on for the wake.

     She sees the FREIGHTER now, a black mountain CUTTING the sea, a
     huge WAKE pluming from its bow.  She grabs his waist with all
     she's got.

                               GIN
                     DO IT! GO!

     And he KICKS the propeller to LIFE, they ZOOM off, straight AT the
     towering wake and burst THROUGH it, RACING to the freighter's
     looming hull, speeding alongside, Mac looking up to find...

     ...a series of metal RUNGS, which begin twelve feet above the water
     line, climbing the dizzying height to the freighter's deck, far
     above.  Mac has a Kevlar rope with a GRAPPLING HOOK, and as he
     reaches the rungs, he...

     ...THROWS it high, one of the pronged hooks CATCHING on a rung
     twenty feet above them...

                               MAC
                     HOLD TIGHT!

                               GIN
                     IF YOU FUCKING INSIST!

     And he LETS GO of the propeller, PULLING both of them, laden with
     gear, OUT of the water with sheer brute strength.  PLANTING his
     feet against the outward curve of the hull, he CLIMBS with all his
     strength, hand over hand, until he finally...

     ...GRASPS the bottom rung.  He PULLS them up, until she can GRAB
     ON.  They hold tight to their rung for a beat.  He attaches them
     both with metal carabiner clips.

                               MAC
                     If I were you, I'd watch
                     the desserts.

                               GIN
                     Boy, I'll bet you were in
                     shape before you got old.

                               MAC
                     Too long ago to remember.

     And pulls himself up to the second rung, so that he is standing an
     the first.  Offers her his hand...

                               GIN
                     I can take it from here, thanks.

     Suit yourself.  They begin to climb up the rungs, like a tilted
     backwards ladder, re-attaching their clips as they go.

                               GIN
                     If you'd packed my primary chute
                     right, I wouldn't ha...

                               MAC
                     Yes, you would.  You're a girl.

     Up, up.  And stop.  They are nearly halfway to the top.  Looking
     across the curved hull to...

     ...a large circular HATCH.  Thirty feet away.  The goal.  Mac
     pulls from his pack...

     ...their SUCTION CUP gear.  With practiced speed, they fasten cups
     to the balls of their feet, take hold of the hand rods with cups
     attached, and Mac takes the lead as they begin to...

     ...move LATERALLY across the hull's surface toward the hatch.  Mac
     is amazingly agile at the arduous process, scuttling sideways like
     a crab across the precariously tilted-back hull.  Gin is deter-
     mined, but falls well behind, intent on making every suction seal
     solid one.  Dark water RACES by beneath her.,  By the time she looks
     up at the hatch...

     He is gone.

                               MAC (O.S.)
                     Anytime you're ready.

     She looks UP sharply.  He is ABOVE the hatch, attached to the hull
     by the balls of his feet, hanging down like a bat.  Noting her
     astonishment...

                               MAC
                     Better angle.

     That it is.  He has pulled a thick cylinder from his pack.  It's a
     battery-operated AIR WRENCH, and with a menacing WHIRR, only
     partially masked by the ship's wake, he begins to swiftly POP all
     the rivets around the hatch.

     Gin has pulled out the slender WELDING TOOL we saw in the shower,
     and begins CUTTING through the metal seals around the hatch's rim.

     At thecrucial moment...

                               MAC
                     You might want to move aside...

     Which she BARELY does, as the hatch door PLUMMETS past her to the
     sea.  BIG splash.  Gone.  When she turns back, Mac is already
     THROUGH the opening and she follows, their yellow-green headlamps
     partially revealing...

     ...the maximum-security HOLD.  We've seen this with Carlsby.  The
     fork lift.  The shadowy multitude of PLATFORMS on their gimbals,
     all SWAYING, in different directions with the plunging of the ship.
     Gin just stands, staring everywhere, like she's broken into Fort
     Knox.  The ROAR of the engines is louder here, and he moves close
     to her to speak beneath it...

                               MAC
                     May I trouble you for the torch?
                     Or would you rather just dance.

     Oh.  Slightly embarrassed at her lack of split-second efficiency,
     she tries to find the thing in her gear.  After watching her fumble
     for a bit...

                               GIN
                     I know I packed it.

     ...he just reaches in and pulls it out.  A small LANTERN which he
     FLICKS on, brilliantly ILLUMINATING the entire hold.  Scans the
     platforms...polnts to a CRATE wrapped in 4-ply heavy duty plastic
     membrane.

                               MAC
                     Coal into diamonds.  A wealth
                     machine.

                               GIN
                     How do you know that's it?

                               MAC (as if stating the obvious)
                     It's 12 by 9 by 7 feet.  And it's
                     the only thing worth waterproofing,
                     in case the ship sinks.

                               GIN (softly)
                     ...you twit.

                               MAC
                     Hmmn?

                               GIN
                     I'm just finishing your sentence.
                     Can't you answer a question with-
                     out making me feel stupid?

     He's heading toward the swaying platforms...

                               MAC
                     Why would I bother?

     He is climbing onto a lower platform, easily vaulting up to the
     magic crate.  She follows, but it isn't as easy as he's made it
     look.  She has to scramble, almost falling.  He's already pulled
     from his gear...

     ...six rubber POUCHES.  She hands him her welding tool, and he
     begins attaching the pouches to the top and sides of the crate.

     The plunging ship has the platform really rocking.

                               GIN (concerned)
                     They don't look like flotation
                     bags...

                               MAC (working fast)
                     Shit.  Well then, let's forget
                     the whole thing.

     She stares at him.

                               GIN
                     Okay, it was a dumb ques...

     His eyes come UP.  So fast that her breath stops.  He looks plenty
     angry.

                               MAC
                     Let's get one thing straight.  I
                     don't work with partners much,
                     because basically, I find most
                     people to be idiots.

     She swallows.  Hard.

                               MAC
                     You, in contrast, are first-rate.

     He watches the effect of that play across her eyes.

                               MAC
                     And if I think so.  Maybe you
                     should start thinking the same.
                     Now move your ass.

     And goes back to work.  She pauses a beat.  Then pulls out two
     lengths of Kevlar rope.  Begins securing their platform to the one
     above, to minimize the amount of sway.  As she struggles with this,
     she sees him finish by welding a very small gray BOX to the top of
     the crate.

     When he glances up, he sees her staring at the box.

                               MAC
                     GPS transponder.  Sends a scrambled
                     signal by satellite...

     He touches the device.  It BEEPS.  A light glows RED.

                               MAC
                     Precise coordinates.  You could
                     find a golf ball in the Gobi Desert.

     He rises.  JUMPS down to the floor.

                               GIN
                     Where you g...

                               MAC (walking away)
                     Fork lift.

                               GIN
                     That's my assignm...

                               MAC (turning back)
                     Unless you've got the keys,
                     someone has to hot wire it.

     Oh.

                               MAC
                     Finish up on the floaters.

     And heads off toward the fork lift.  Finish up?  She looks at
     the rubber pouches.  They seem finished to her.  Tugs at a couple.
     On pretty firmly.  Across the way, we HEAR the fork lift turn its
     engine OVER.

                               GIN
                     Won't they hear it?

                               MAC (O.S.)
                     Over these engines?  Through five
                     feet of steel?

     She hurriedly secures the last of her Kevlar lines.

                               MAC (O.S.)
                     Hell, if they do, they don't have
                     the second key to get in.

     He is driving up in the rickety fork lift.  Weaving around crates
     and equipment.

                               MAC
                     Thank God for redundant security.

     He hops lightly from the fork lift, reaches up, and she jumps down
     INTO his arms.  Quickly, the switch places, Gin climbing into the
     idling fork lift, as Mac clambers up to UNBOLT the crate's pallet
     with his air wrench...

     Gin moves the fork lift into position.  Mac bracing his legs
     against neighboring cargo, using all his strength to hold our
     crate steady.  He is really straining.

                               GIN
                     How many tries do I get?

                               MAC (with effort)
                     One, before I beat you senseless,
                     dump you over the side, and donate
                     your share to charity.

     She brings the fork UP.  The crate sways slightly.  She lines up
     her prongs against the pallet's receiving holes...

                               GIN
                     You gotta work on that impatient
                     streak.

     ...and slips them straight IN.  First try.

                               GIN (amazed)
                     How professional.

     She LIFTS the crate, but the boat LURCHES, and she nearly LOSES it
     off the fork.

     But she doesn't.  SWINGS her load around now.  Heading for the open
     hatchway, the roiling sea racing by.  Picking up SPEED, slightly...

                               GIN
                     Uh.  Thing on the left is
                     the brakes?

                               MAC (laconic)
                     Or the thing on the right.

     By now she is really ROLLING toward the wide open spaces...

                               GIN
                     MAC, IT'S JAMMED!

     He POUNCES off the platform, FLYING after the lift as it
     ACCELERATES THROUGH the opening...

                               MAC
                     JUMP, for God's sa...

     ...TIPPING at the hatchway lip, the crate sliding OFF the prongs,
     our forklift TUMBLING OUT the hatch to the sea, just as Mac...

     ...SNATCHES Gin by her HAIR, pulling her FREE of the falling
     forklift, CATCHING the rim of the hatchway with his free hand, Gin
     SCREAMING in fright and pain, BLINDLY grabbing his arm to be...

     ...jerked BACK to safety.

     Clutching Mac, she watches the sea behind them.  Where the crate
     and the forklift disappeared.

                               MAC
                     You did activate the floaters.

     Her head WHIPS around.  Aghast.

                               GIN
                     Activa...

                               MAC
                     I did say, 'Finish up on the
                     floaters'.  Surely, you heard me.

     Her life.  Flashes before her eyes.  As behind the ship...

     ...the crate BOBS to the surface.  We can see the tiny red light on
     the transponder from here.

                               MAC (softly)
                     Oh.  Guess I did it m'self.

     She WHIPS back, and starts POUNDING at him with her fists.  He is
     laughing so hard, he takes a few good shots before he can GRASP her
     wrists.  She SPITS in his face.  He strikes back by...

     ...kissing her hard.  She struggles for a beat.

     And then she lets him.

     When they finish, he reaches to UNZIP her jumping suit.  All the
     way.  Pulls it down gently, revealing...

     ...her evening gown.  A wrinkle-free material which slips down
     across her legs from where it had been bunched across her hips.
     He is unzipping his outfit as well, revealing formal wear of his
     own.  He stuffs the suits into his gear pack, removing only...

     ...her evening bag and shoes.  Then lifting both packs, he...

                               GIN
                     Um...

     ...FLINGS them into the black ocean.  Gone.

                               GIN
                     ...I wouldn't do that.

     So he turns.  She looks really stunned.  And scared.

                               MAC
                     Excuse me?

                               GIN
                     Well...I saw our suction things.
                     Lying...over...there?

     She points.  To where no suction things are lying.

                               GIN (a mouse)
                     ...so I put 'em in my pack?

     His eyes WIDEN.

                               GIN
                     Or maybe.  I put 'em there.

     And points.  To where they are.

     She tilts her head.  Gives him a great smile.  Is he enraged?  His
     dry grin says, not hardly.

                               MAC
                     I like a quick study.

     Then again.  You can never tell.

     EXT. FREIGHTER DECK - NIGHT

     Expansive barely-lit deck under a canopy of stars.  A silver-haired
     couple in immaculate evening attire stroll alone, he is humming to
     barely-audible dance music from a distant lounge.  She clings to
     his arm, it is romantic.  Until they reach the railing where he
     turns, and says something quietly in German...

     She stiffens.  Pulls her arm away from his.  She sneers coldly,
     calls him a name in German, and he UNLOADS on her, a barrage of
     German-language INVECTIVE that would melt a tank.  She absorbs the
     abuse without flinching, turns toward the rail, HAWKS and...

     ...SPITS over the side.  Strides away from him.  He watches her go.
     Then...

     ...SPITS over the side himself.  And follows her.

     Half a beat.

     Mac's head APPEARS above the rail.  Just where they spit.  Not a
     mark on him.

     INT. BALLROOM - NIGHT

     Our old German couple are DANCING wonderfully in each other's arms
     Inspiring.  PAN a dozen really old couples dancing to the three-
     piece Filipino ensemble, until we come to...

     Gin and Mac spinning slowly, flawlessly, their eyes telling the
     surrounding geezers that they are very much in love.  We CLOSE to
     hear their sweet murmurings...

                               MAC
                     ...no matter how many stones we
                     make, the diamonds are just an
                     appetizer.

                               GIN (dreamily)
                     And the meal...?

                               MAC
                     My contract.  With DeBeers.

     She blinks.  Hit by a ton of bricks.

                               GIN
                     Oh my G...

                               MAC
                     Sensible folks, DeBeers.  A world
                     monopoly in diamonds based on one
                     simple principle...something's only
                     priceless if it's scarce.

     He WHIRLS her in a tight spin.  The geriatic Germans can only watch
     and envy.

                               MAC
                     These guys dig up all the diamonds
                     on the planet, just to keep them out
                     of circulation.  Otherwise, you could
                     buy 'em at the Five and Dime...

                               GIN
                     Watch the old guy stuff, they don't
                     have dimestores anym...

                               MAC
                     Imagine the chaos we could cause.

     She is imagining.

                               GIN
                     You said 'contract'...

                               MAC
                     We're sort of bounty hunters.

     Gin likes the ring of that.  Green eyes dance with delight.

                               MAC
                     Our machine is worth far more
                     dead.  Than alive.

                               VOICE (O.S.)
                     Glad to see you're both alive.

     They look over.  The officious STEWARD from this afternoon.  Now in
     black tie.

                               STEWARD
                     When you missed cocktails.  And
                     supper.  I thought of knocking
                     on your door...

     Mac turns Gin so that she can send the boob a lazy smile...

                               GIN
                     Oh, I wish you had.  We love having
                     strangers join us!  Maybe later...?

     Mac turns her once more, so that he faces the flummoxed steward
     across her bare shoulder...

                               MAC
                     Promise you an interesting time...

     Trademark smile.

                               MAC
                     Or my name's not Banquo MacDuff.

     You twit.

     INT. CORRIDOR - NIGHT

     Our couple moving down the softly-lit hallway, past the burnished
     doors of luxury suites.  Her arms wrapped around one of his, their
     bodies close together.

                               MAC
                     ...well, I would ask what you're
                     doing with the rest of your life.
                     But that's your own bloody affair,
                     isn't it?

     She sighs.

                               GIN
                     Yeh.  Anyway, before you get too
                     choked up on the farewell.  I feel
                     I owe you a confession.

     He glances down.  Really?  Really.

                               GIN
                     Time has come to tell you.  What
                     business.  I'm actually in.

     He thinks about this.  And then...

                               MAC
                     Not here.

     EXT. DECK - NIGHT

     Mac leads her along the empty moonlit deck to...

     ...the BOWSPRIT, a long, narrow platform, ringed by a flimsy rail,
     it juts far out above a churning sea.  The whipping of the wind
     makes it seem all the more precarious.

                               MAC
                     It only looks dangerous...

     Holds out his hand.  She hesitates.

                               MAC
                     You couldn't fall off.  Unless
                     someone threw you over.

     Gives her the smile.  She puts her hand in his, and they hop
     UP to the platform.  Walk its length to the very end.  He turns
     now, leans casually against the fragile railing.  They are inches
     apart.

                               MAC
                     More intimate.  For a confession.

     Gin looks down at the plume of wake leaping off the bow.

                               MAC
                     What business.  You are actually.
                     In.

     She looks up.  To his eyes.  Into them.

                               GIN
                     Yeh.  I'm not an art dealer.

                               MAC
                     Of course not.  You're a cop.

     And tilts his head.  Just to one side.

                               MAC
                     An insurance investigator for
                     Webber Assurance, your boss is
                     an idiot named Hector Cruz, you've
                     been there four years and ten
                     months, you're quite the rising star.

                               GIN (evenly)
                     Nope.

     His head tilts.  Just a little farther.

                               MAC (very softly)
                     Nope?

                               GIN
                     I'm a thief, Mac.

     Holds the look.

                               GIN
                     For five years, I've used the
                     database of every client Webber
                     has to plan my jobs.  Museums,
                     banks, jewelers, rich people, I
                     have floor plans, alarm codes,
                     passwords, the works.

     His face absolutely neutral.  Unreadable.

                               GIN
                     I've made a fortune.  It's not
                     enough.

                               MAC
                     Why n...

                               GIN
                     Why wasn't it enough for you?

     He falls silent.

                               GIN
                     The Vermeer that was stolen from
                     Hancock Tower?  That was my job.
                     I scaled the building with
                     electromagnets, and parachuted
                     down an air vent...

     No smile at her lips.  Strictly business.

                               GIN
                     ...after mailing the painting.  To
                     where we're going next, actua...

                               MAC (quietly)
                     We.

     She looks him up and down.

                               GIN
                     Yeh, we.  You passed the audition.

     Now he smiles.  First time.

                               MAC (a murmur)
                     Imagine my relief.

                               GIN
                     I need a partner.  For the biggest,
                     smartest, job.  Ever.  The one you
                     retire off of, because nothing else
                     could ever compare with the rush.

                               MAC
                     Ever.  Is such a long time.

                               GIN
                     This is a job that can only be done
                     in one place, in one split-second
                     in human history.  If we miss that
                     instant.  We lose.

                               MAC
                     And it's worth...?

                               GIN
                     Eight billion dollars.  That's
                     eight thousand million.

                               MAC
                     How much in shillings?

                               GIN
                     You're not a real trusting guy.

                               MAC
                     And I tried so hard to hide that.

                               GIN
                     It's two jobs.  The first steals
                     something priceless from the National
                     Palace Museum in Taipei.  We don't
                     keep that.  We trade it in for our
                     ticket to the show.

                               MAC
                     One moment in time, you s...

                               GIN
                     Midnight, July 1, 1997.  Eight
                     days from now.  The moment that
                     Hong Kong is annexed by china.

     And now.  She has his interest.  She can see that.

                               GIN
                     80-20 split.

                               MAC
                     Don't be so hard on yourself.  It's
                     your plan, you should take at least
                     thirty perc...

                               GIN
                     My 80, your 20.  Asshole.

     He thinks this over.

                               MAC
                     50-50.  Or you can swim to Taipei.

     She is not impressed.  Or afraid.  He grins...

                               MAC
                     What are you gonna do with six
                     billion dollars that you can't do
                     with four?

                               GIN
                     Hold the record.  Alone.

     This.  He likes.  So much that he leans to kiss her, with
     surprising tenderness.

                               MAC
                     Your share is 50%.  And one dollar.

     Her hard stare.  And then, she smiles.  Just barely.  Still in his
     arms...

                               GIN
                     I like what you left.  In the hold.

                               MAC
                     You didn't even see wha...

                               GIN
                     A lump of coal.  A pair of pliers.
                     A note that said, 'Squeeze hard'.

     This is the most taken with her that he has ever looked.  She leans
     up and kisses him.  Whispers...

                               GIN
                     Squeeze hard.

     EXT. STREET, SHIHLIN DISTRICT, TAIPEI - LATE NIGHT

     Ugly section of an ugly town.  Unmarked warehouses, alleyways
     teeming with food stalls.  HEAR a motorcycle approach, and see...

     ...Gin driving, Mac sits behind her.  Going real fast, maybe she's
     showing off, we FOLLOW them DOWN a blind alley, as she smoothly
     WHEELS them into...

     ...an open FREIGHT ELEVATOR.  She climbs off, he doesn't.  As Gin
     goes to work the controls, Mac sees a cat curled in the corner,
     mewing softly.

                               GIN
                     That's Madame Chiang Kaishek, she's
                     my bud.  An evil streak a mile wide.

     The elevator JOLTS to life.

                               MAC
                     No surprise.

     They CLANG upward.  Mac seems utterly relaxed.  Gin paces a little,
     hugging herself.  Her features tense.

                               MAC (gently)
                     Tired?

     She blinks up.  He is straddling the bike.  Smiling at her.

                               GIN
                     I have a lot on my mind.

     Ah.  Well...

                               MAC
                     You look beautiful doing it.

     He seems to mean that.  And it seems to melt her a little.  She
     sags against the wall, closing her eyes, as...

     ...they JOLT to a stop.  She PULLS the heavy LEVER, and the door
     SLIDES noisily open, to reveal...

     ...a gigantic LOFT.  She flicks on a dim light, but we see only
     part of the cavernous space.  She strolls, Madame Chiang trotting
     along behind.  Mac follows, looking around, then down to see...

     ...a pile of MAIL, cables, packages.  The unopened MAILING TUBE we
     saw in the Hancock Tower penthouse.  He crouches, lifts the tube in
     his hands...

                                    GIN (O.S.)
                     You wanna buy a Vermeer?

                                    MAC
                     Rather steal it.

                                    GIN (O.S.)
                     Been there, done that.

     He nods to himself.  Guess so.  He rises to see her framed against
     the gaping starlit opening of a huge LOADING DOOR.  The twinkling
     island lies below.  But here, Gin stares down at...

     ...an elaborate architectural MODEL.  Fifteen feet across, it
     features an imposing yellow, pagoda-roofed BUILDING, built into
     the side of a model MOUNTAIN.  Formal gardens, fountains, tiny
     Kuomintang flags.  Stretching away from the building, a large
     portion of the CITY, with shops and alleyways elaborately detailed.
     As Mac joins her...

                               GIN
                     National Palace Museum, Taipei,
                     Taiwan.  Repository of four
                     thousand years of Chinese culture...

     He bends to lift UP the detachable roof.  All the rooms are
     detailed within, down to exhibit cases.

                               GIN
                     Works of gold, bronze, jade, onyx,
                     pots and scrolls, paintings and
                     porcelains and lacquer work.  Every
                     treasure the Kuomintang could loot
                     before the Reds took over.
                               (beat)
                     Ever rob the place?

                               MAC
                     No.  If memory serves.

     She takes him by the hand, and leads him toward the gaping doorway,
     walking straight toward it...

                               GIN
                     You need to eat something, or
                     are you ready for sex?

     And just at the edge of it...

                               MAC (torn)
                     The options seem so limited.

     They jump THROUGH the opening.  And VANISH.

     Our ANGLE closes on the doorway, to see OUT now, sitting like a
     jewel against the hillside...

     ...the NATIONAL PALACE MUSEUM, looking exactly like the model.  The
     town spread out beyond.  Just as in the model.  And now we TILT
     sharply DOWN to see...

     ...a loading PLATFORM, suspended above the island, only a few feet
     below our opening.  Like a balcony without a railing.  Mac and Gin
     already sinking down onto a waiting futon.

     Looks like he's made his pick.  Among limited options.

     INT. LOFT - SUNRISE

     CLOSE on the MODEL MUSEUM in early light.  Propped against it, the
     unrolled Vermeer.  Pinned to the painting, a note we can't read.  In
     the B.G., HEAR what sounds like the rattling of a SUBWAY TRAIN,
     which runs a short distance and STOPS.  We TILT ANGLE now, to
     see...

     ...through the sunlit opening of the loading door.  Mac's head
     APPEARS, peeking up over the lip.

                               MAC
                     Ginny...?

     LOST in another brief subway rumble.  He lightly VAULTS up through
     the doorway.  Looks around, no Gin.  Goes to the model.  Lifts the
     note pinned to the Vermeer...

                               MAC (reads)
                     This lovely parting gift can be
                     yours.  If the price is right.

     Stumped.  Not in his cultural database.  He looks at the model, to
     see that the stretch of city between museum and mountain has been
     lifted away, revealing...

     ...an underground RAILWAY TUNNEL between the two.  Mac examines the
     tiny train, the tracks, the winding route.  From the side walls,
     well above the tracks, huge VENTILATION PIPES open onto the tunnel.
     Starting at the museum end, they are labeled VENT #1, and so on.
     There are five.  The last one shortly before...

     ...the mountain.  Where a cavernous opening is labeled BARRACKS.
     Tiny toy soldiers kneel on a landing, rifles in position to shoot
     at the oncoming train.  And as Mac studies this curiously...

     ...the nearby SUBWAY RATTLES the walls once more.  Sounds like it's
     in the room, somehow.  Mac rises.  Saunters across the loft, and we
     see for the first time the enormity of this space.  Suddenly, the
     floor ends, and we are looking down nearly thirty feet onto...

     ...a spacious HANGAR, outfitted with 150 feet of RAILWAY TRACK, at
     the far end of which sits a full-sited TRAIN CAR, exactly like the
     one in the model.  And just below us...

     ...Gin crouches on a concave platform of corrugated metal, eighteen
     feet above the track.  She holds a remote control device, which she
     uses to REV the train's engine, far down the line.  She looks
     really tense.

                               MAC
                     Good morning.

     She startles slightly.  Shuts OFF the train's engine.  As she looks
     up to him now, the silence is noticeable.  He crouches down, only a
     foot or so above her...

                               MAC
                     Quite a parting gift.  I would
                     have settled for roses.

                               GIN
                     It's a joke.  You know, a joke?
                     People who have a sense of humor
                     make them?

     He's clueless.  But smiling.

                               GIN
                     You're rich, go buy an American,
                     have him fill you in on the culture.

                               MAC
                     Ah.  American culture.  Well,
                     that is a joke.

     He leans down.  Strokes her hair very gently.

                               MAC (murmurs)
                     Relax.  It's only eight billion
                     dollars.

     She looks up into his eyes.  But she can't smile.

                               MAC (softly)
                     Your Vermeer?  I like this View Of
                     Delft better than the larger one.
                     The sky is more emotionally rendered.

     Staring in his eyes.  And just as softly back...

                               GIN
                     Nice.  When a sky is that.

     He holds the look.  Very strong and very gentle...

                               MAC
                     Is it easier now? Not pretending.

     Is it?

                               MAC
                     Not pretending you're an innocent.
                     Not pretending you...like me.

     No answer.  Effortlessly, he hops down to join her.  Never losing
     eye contact.

                               MAC
                     Here's a tip from an old-timer.
                     Never forget who you are...

     Settles next to her.  Bodies touching.

                               MAC
                     It gives you someone to be.  When
                     you stop pretending.

     Okay?  She nods, slowly.  Her eyes moving over his face.  Maybe
     more feelings going through her than she can sort out.

                               MAC (still soft)
                     So.  Our train runs from the museum,
                     through an underground tunnel.  To
                     a mountain.

                               GIN
                     Because the museum displays 10,000
                     relics at any given moment.  But
                     there are 60 times that many, stored
                     in the mountain.

     This overwhelms.  Even Mac.

                               GIN
                     Which is why it's guarded.  By an
                     army.

     She is unfastening the small pack at her feet...

                               GIN
                     The train shuttles relics to and
                     from storage.  It looks exactly
                     like that.

     So Mac looks down the line.  At the train car.

                               GIN
                     I've been down the air ducts four
                     times.  The train always has two
                     armed guards.  Always travels between
                     32 and 36 miles per hour.  Relics
                     don't like to be jostled too much.

                               MAC (all business now)
                     Your model has five vents.

                               GIN
                     We go down the first.  Back up the
                     third, if you're lucky.  If not, we
                     have to get out by the fourth.

                               MAC (simply)
                     Then we will.

     She pulls from the pack four thick DISCS, each about eight inches
     in diameter, each with a toggle switch and a wrist loop.  She
     starts to put two of them on...

                               GIN
                     Electromagnets, incredibly powerful.
                     This switch is on-off.

     He gestures at the train, the track, the hangar...

                               MAC
                     Seems like overkill.  For one
                     simple jump.

                               GIN
                     Well, it's an eight billion
                     dollar jump.  You miss the
                     train...you've missed the train.

     Flicks ON her remote.  Down the track the engine REVS.  Like crazy.

                               GIN
                     We've got five days to grab the
                     Bones, trade them for the Scan, and
                     pull our 8 billion out of Hong Kong.
                     Once midnight passes on July 1st...

                               MAC
                     ...we've missed the train, yeh.
                     The Bones?  The Scan?

                               GIN
                     Oh.  Have I neglected to fill
                     in the details?

                               MAC
                     An oversight.

                               GIN
                     Which I learned from the master.
                     Hey.  Wish me luck...

     CLICKS the remote, the train LEAP5 forward, 36 MPH never seemed so
     fast!  She has a split-second to LEAP down, the train SAILS beneath
     her, Gin's feet GRAZE the back end of the platform at the rear of
     the car, she SWIPES DESPERATELY with the magnets, can't connect,
     and is THROWN into a ROLL along the side of the tracks.

     She's UP on her knees, watching the train SLAM into the massive
     blue PADS at the end of the track.  She is bruised, shaken, but
     most of all, really worried and really pissed.

                               MAC (quietly)
                     Jump sooner.

     She pulls out the remote...

                               GIN
                     Be my fucking guest.

     The train ROCKETS backward, straight PAST where she kneels, to
     BRAKE at the start of the track once more.  She nods up to Mac,
     who is strapping on his magnets.  He crouches, nods, ready.  And
     the train...

     ...BLASTS toward him, he counts, JUMPS, and SLAMS ONTO the ROOF of
     the train, which PLOWS into the heavy padding, FLINGING him twenty
     feet like a rag doll to land in a HEAP.

     He lies still.  Then blinks, surprised he's alive.  HEARS a rich
     whiskey LAUGHTER down the track.

                               MAC
                     I'm too old for this shit!

     And as he pulls himself up.  She is staring at him, from her
     knees...

                               GIN
                     Know a dude named Wiley Coyote?

     ...with what can only be described as love.

                               GIN (softly)
                     Forget it.

     EXT. NATIONAL PALACE MUSEUM, TAIPEI - DAY

     AERIAL VIEW down toward the sweeping pagoda roofs of the MUSEUM,
     the formal gardens, the fountains, the tree-lined driveway.  CLOSE
     now, as a cab pulls up, a couple emerges...

     She is first.  Chanel suit with an extremely short skirt, revealing
     endless legs.  She helps him from the taxi, a white-haired geezer
     who seems well past 90, fumbling with his walking stick, and making
     quick, erratic, bird-like glances in every direction.

     She takes his arm for support.  Murmurs in his ear...

                               GIN
                     Isn't it easier now?  Not pretending?

     Gives him a full-tongue KISS in the ear, which has bystanders
     noticing.  Starts to help him up the stairs, still whispering
     close...

                               GIN
                     Five years, you won't need
                     make-up.

     In answer he GRABS her ass, and she YELPS with delight, attract-
     ing attention all around.  His turn to whisper, as he massages
     her backside...

                               MAC
                     We agreed.  No underwear.

                               GIN
                     Overkill.  I can do it with legs.

     He stops.  Gives the long legs a dubious twice-over.

                               MAC
                     I'd lose the underwear.

     INT. MUSEUM - DAY

     Mac leaning on her arm, as they pass case after case.  Bronzes,
     jades, lacquer work.  Every object exquisite, priceless.

                               GIN
                     The Oracle Bones date back to the
                     Shang Dynasty, 3500 years ago.
                     They are writings...carved into
                     ox bones, tortoise shells...

     She cuddles close to him.  They approach a tour group, the female
     guide speaking in four European languages.  Really loud.

                               GIN
                     The oldest Chinese writing any-
                     where, the first proof of Chinese
                     civilization.

                               MAC
                     What makes this one so valuable?

     He stops, drowned out by the tour guide, rhapsodizing over an urn.
     Butts into her rap...

                               MAC (subtitled Italian)
                     Except it's Chien-lung, mimicking
                     Sung Period.  The color is far too
                     delicate.

     The woman gets real insulted.  Apparently, he's right.

                               MAC (subtitled German)
                     It's all right, you have a nice
                     body.

     And walks on.  Confides to Gin...

                               MAC
                     When you're old, you can do
                     anything

     GRABS her bottom once more, altering her voice slightly on...

                               GIN
                     There we are.

     A separate display room.  A single steel pedestal.  Under the
     smart-glass security case, one single object.  It is a fragile,
     yellowed fragment of bone.  The shoulder blade of an ox.  Covered
     with tiny script.

                               GIN
                     Last year, ancient artifacts were
                     discovered in the Gulf of Mexico.
                     An Olmec civilization, 3200 years old.

     No tourists in the display room.  A velvet rope is up.  Three
     GUARDS mill at the entrance.  This exhibit is off-limits.

                               GIN
                     Amazingly, markings on these
                     Olmec figures were identified
                     as Shang Dynasty writing...

     A sign explains, SORROWFUL TO INFORM ORACAL BONE CLOSE FOR TRAVEL
     EXIBITION UNTIL IS NOVEMBER.

                               GIN
                     This particular Bone is price-
                     less, because it is the one that
                     establishes the link.  Proves that
                     American civilizations descend from
                     Chinese ancestors.

     She is pulling out her coin purse, as they stand by the rope.
     Unzipping it slowly...

                               GIN
                     Exactly the kind of propaganda
                     shit they eat up in Beijing.  The
                     mainland would pay anything to get
                     its paws on th...

     As her shaking 'elderly' companion SPASMS, knocking the purse OUT
     of her hand, it CLATTERS to the floor, sending a hundred coins
     ROLLING in all directions.  Some under the rope.

                               MAC (old guy voice)
                     SHIT!  BLOODY HELL!!!

     And collapses to the hardwood floor in search of the coins, HOWLING
     as he BANGS his knees.  Some bystanders hurry to help.  And one of
     the guards.  As Mac tries to crawl under the rope to pursue
     coins...

     ...the guard STOPS him with a firm hand, pointing at the pidgen-
     English sign.  Meanwhile, calmly, very slowly...

     ...Gin crouches down to retrieve coins, the short skirt riding
     recklessly high on her upper thighs.  The two remaining guards
     hurry to help her.  Mac's guard, bystanders, all transfixed by the
     marginal preservation of her modesty.  Noticing the eye-lines all
     around, she confides to the nearest guard...

                               GIN (in Mandarin, helpful)
                     Those are the coins.  These
                     are my legs.

     Unnoticed, Mac is BANGING his wristwatch, which seems to have
     broken.  CLOSE on him now, manipulating a glide point DEVICE on
     the side of the watch, and we RACK FOCUS to see...

     ...one coin.  Inside the rope.  Move.

     As Mac checks to see all eyes are elsewhere, he guides the coin's
     slide slowly, inexorably, to...

     ...ATTACH itself magnetically.  To the steel pedestal.  Beneath the
     Bone's case.  As it does, Mac's watch BEEPS slightly, as we CLOSE
     on it to see...

     ...DATA flickering across its face.

                               MAC (old guy voice)
                     Amanda!  Time for my pills!

     INT. NOODLE SHOP, TAIPEI - DAY

     Gin and Mac at a long communal table, ignored, by Taiwanese couples,
     families, businessmen, chattering loudly all around them.  Gin
     looking down at her bowl, she's barely touched her meal...

                               GIN
                     ...no, I don't think that way.

     Glances up.  Mac is eating heartily, happily.

                               GIN
                     ...and I suppose you do?

                               MAC
                     Get lonely?  Sure, all the time.
                     It's healthy.

     Stuffs his mouth full.  Talking around it...

                               MAC
                     What's unhealthy.  Is denial.

     She's studying him as he eats.  Since he's not looking at her,
     Gin's eyes are thoughtful, appraising.

                               GIN
                     Be real.  you could never see
                     yourself...you know, quitting the
                     game.  Settling...down.

     And he looks up.  Direct to her eyes.  A dead straight, heart-
     stopping look.  Before the wonderful smile.

                               MAC
                     Why, Ginger.  This is so sudden.

     She cuts him a hard look.  Not funny.

     INT. MUSEUM - DAY

     Late afternoon, the place has closed.  Four armed GUARDS,
     accompanied by a museum OFFICIAL, push a large DOLLY across the
     hardwood floor, heels clicking, wheels rumbling softly, into...

     ...the room we've seen.  The dolly stops by the display case of the
     priceless oracle Bone.  The four guards position themselves around
     the triple-paned bulletproof case.  It will be a bitch to lift.

     The official has a key.  He inserts this into the lock of the
     titanium frame which holds the case to the steel pedestal.  And
     as it CLICKS, we...

     SMASH CUT TO...

     INT. NOODLE SHOP - DAY

     Mac's arm rising with noodle-laden chopsticks, the wristwatch
     BEEPING softly.  He drops the chopsticks, rising in one fluid
     motion as Gin does the same, throwing some bills on the table,
     he leads her...

     ...OUT the door, INTO the street, step OFF the curb, turn, DROP
     flat on his back, SLIDE DOWN the gutter, Gin following a split-
     second behind...

     INT. TUNNEL LOADING DOCK

     A train car stands, pulled up to a loading dock.  Two SOLDIERS with
     assault rifles on the train's rear platform, waiting.  Along one
     side of the tracks, a gravel roadway.  An open air Jeep-type
     military vehicle stands empty.  One of our soldiers speaks into a
     walkie-talkie, watching a huge steel DOOR at the entrance to the
     loading dock, which...

     ...OPENS now.  Through it come the four armed museum guards,
     surrounding the dolly which carries the Bone's massive bulletproof
     display case.  The official is with them, and hands paperwork to
     one of the waiting soldiers, as the museum guards LIFT the case,
     and carry it onto the train.

     INT. TUNNEL SHAFT

     An empty stretch of dimly-lit track, somewhere down the line.
     Silent.  PAN up, way up, to...

     ...the shadows of a huge air vent.  Must be vent #1, because two
     FIGURES are crouched there, as close as lovers.  Even we can barely
     make them out, until we CLOSE to hear the hushed...

                               GIN (strapping on a backpack)
                     ...way we can use those in here.
                     I thought I was in charge of
                     this operat...

                               MAC
                     You're in charge of ego and worrying.
                     I'm in charge of keeping you alive.

     He is holding something dull gray and small.  It looks like a trun-
     cated nerf football with one end pointed and the other cut blunt.

                               MAC
                     These are plasma jet.  All the
                     force is directed forward, instead
                     of dissipating in a sphere like a
                     grenade.

     He has four of these.  Gives her three.

                               GIN
                     I don't need th...

                               MAC (whispers)
                     Shut up.

     He reaches out, gently...

                               MAC
                     You don't trust me, you won't get
                     through this.

     Touches her face.

                               MAC
                     Try to adjust to that for three
                     more days.  After July 1...

     Stares in her eyes.

                               MAC
                     ...you'll never have to trust again.

     And smiles.  One more whisper...

                               MAC
                     Something.  To look forward to.

     INT. TUNNEL LOADING DOCK

     The museum guards are back on the landing with the official.  Our
     two soldiers stand facing them from the rear platform of the train
     car, as...

     The train RUMBLES to life.  Ready to go.

     INT. MUSEUM

     Two guards arrive with a hand truck to carry off the empty
     pedestal, which once supported the Bone's case.  One tilts the top
     of the pedestal back, supporting its weight, as the other stoops to
     lift the base, and...

     ...stops.  He sees the coin.  Oddly flat against the pedestal's
     shaft.  He kneels, tries to lift the coin, but the magnet HOLDS it
     fast.  He looks up to his companion.  Then...

     ...PEELS the coin free, the other guard reaches for it, the first
     guard YANKS it away, and it FLIES from his hand, INTO the wall, and
     drops.  As the guards go to look, the coin's back has come away.
     Revealing...

     ...electronics.

     INT. TUNNEL LOADING DOCK

     An ALARM SHRIEKS at a deafening level.  Five museum GUARDS BURST
     through the doorway, LEAP from the landing, pile into the Jeep, and
     BLAST OFF down the gravel roadway after the departed train.

     INT. BARRACKS ENTRANCE

     A much larger landing at the other end of the tunnel, facing back
     the opposite way.  The ALARM SCREAMS here, too, and massive steel
     doors CLANG open, as 25 SOLDIERS with assault rifles SWARM out onto
     the landing, taking up sharpshooter positions, weapons pointing
     back up the track.

     INT. AIR VENT #1

     Mac and Gin crouched in the vent, high above the track, gas masks
     dangle around their necks, magnet paddles from their wrists,
     various objects from their belt loops.  The alarm ECHOES,
     absolutely EAR-SPLITTING.  She leans to shout in his ear...

                               GIN
                     WE HAVE TO ABORT!

     Above the siren, we can now hear the TRAIN coming...

                               MAC
                     HOW DO YOU EXPECT TO MAKE A CAREER
                     OF THIS, IF YOU CAN'T TAKE A LITTLE
                     INCONVENIENCE?

     The train LOUDER, closer, the alarm BLARING...

                               GIN
                     THEY'VE GOT AN ARMY DOWN TH...

                               MAC
                     I can do this.

     Quietly.  Straight in her eyes.  The train ROARS into view, FLASHES
     beneath them, as he GRABS her wrist and...

     ...JUMPS, HURTLING DOWN, both STRIKING the empty rear platform,
     Gin slipping off, but he HOLDS her fast, SWIPING with his magnet
     which...

     ...CLANKS hard, LOCKS solid.  He PULLS her onto the platform,
     she looks dazed, clinging to him, he tugs her gas mask into place,
     slips on his own, and...

     ...FITS a magnetic DEVICE from his belt loop ONTO the door
     lock, SPINS a dial on the device, which POPS the lack OPEN,
     Mac BURSTING...

     ...THROUGH the door, lobbing a GAS GRENADE at the startled guards,
     who try to whirl and FIRE through the fog of red smoke, two wild
     SHOTS above the rolling Mac, and they are felled by the gas where
     they stand.  Gin races in, falling on her butt, as the car ROCKS
     along the track.  Points OUT the window...

                               GIN (through mask)
                     THERE'S THE NUMBER TWO VENT, ONLY
                     45 SECONDS TO THE THIRD!

     Scrambling to her feet, Mac wheeling toward the Bone.

                               GIN (through mask)
                     TEST THE CASE!

     He THROWS a handful of coins at the glass case, and purple UV BEAMS
     ARC from the glass to FRY the coins in midair.  Mac pulls a dull
     rectangle the size of a cigar box from Gin's backpack, as we
     SMASH CUT to...

     INT. TUNNEL

     The Jeep BLASTING after the train at crazy speed, the four non-
     drivers with weapons at the ready...

     INT. BARRACKS LANDING

     TROOPS FILL the platform, and have spilled onto the tracks, enough
     weapons to dust Butch and Sundance.

     INT. TRAIN

     Mac operating the cigar box which is actually a customized
     OSCILLOSCOPE, with countless KNOBS and a SCREEN which displays
     WAVE PATTERNS.  The machine is emitting SHRILL whistling TONES
     that cut through even the siren.

                               GIN (through mask)
                     TAKE IT TO 30 AND CLIMB!

     Mac SPINS the dials and two overhead light bulbs BLOW.  The glass
     case housing a fire ax SHATTERS.  The Bone's case is untouched.

     SMASH CUT to...

     INT. TUNNEL

     WITH the Jeep, BOMBING around a curve to SEE the train at last.  WE
     OPEN FIRE, accelerating after the train with everything we've got,
     gravel FLYING like shrapnel, and up ahead...

     ...the train's windows BLOW OUT, the tunnel SHOWERED with glass
     fragments.  SMASH CUT...

     INT. TRAIN

     Mac JUICING the box, the deafening TONE competing with the sirens,
     the gunshots, Gin SHRIEKING as she points through a blasted-out
     window...

                               GIN (through mask)
                     THIRD VENT GONE!

     And the Bone's case EXPLODES, Gin WHIRLING away to protect her
     face, as we SMASH CUT to...

     INT. TUNNEL

     The Jeep now ALONGSIDE the rear platform of the train.  The driver
     fighting to hold it steady, as...

     ...the guards begin to CLAMBER over the side, GRASPING for the
     platform's rails, one goes DOWN screaming onto the tracks, but two
     MAKE IT, then a third, they BURST...

     ...INTO the train to see...

     Nothing.  Two groggy, half-conscious soldiers.  Discarded gas
     masks, oscilloscope.  No Mac.  No Gin.  And inside the shattered
     case...

     A chicken bone.  The pack-rat strikes again.

     INT. TUNNEL

     Mac and Gin FLATTENED to the side of the train above the window
     line, held fast by their magnets.  We are on the opposite side from
     the gravel path, so the train screens us from the jeep.  SHOUTING
     above the din...

                               GIN
                     THERE'S THE FOURTH!

     Up ahead an AIR VENT looms, we are HURTLING toward it.  Mac and Gin
     each free one hand, reach into their backpacks for...

                               GIN
                     OUR LAST CHANCE, THE FIFTH IS
                     AT THE BARRACKS!

     ...twin GRAPNEL GUNS, which look like big 9mm pistols, but with a
     blunt, round end.  As we STREAK toward the VENT, Gin lifts her gun,
     SHOOTS at it, a cable-attached PROJECTILE EXPLODING toward the
     target, OPENING in mid-flight to a three-pronged HOOK, which...

     ...FALLS just SHORT, the hook tumbling to CLANG on the tracks, as
     Mac...

     ...FIRES his, the projectile EXPLODING, the hook OPENING and...

     ...BITES into the wall, only four feet from the vent, its cable
     stretching back to the gun in Mac's hand, we're almost there, and
     Mac slips the pistol...

     ...INTO Gin's free hand.

                               GIN
                     WHAT ABOUT YOU?

                               MAC
                     ALLOW US A MOMENT OF CHIVALRY.

     Their eyes meet.  He sees her hesitate to abandon him.

                               MAC
                     FIRST RULE.  SAVE NUMBER ONE.

     They FLASH PAST the vent, Mac RELEASES her magnet, Gin's freed hand
     GRASPING to join the other at the pistol, as she...

     ...ROCKETS up, CATAPULTED back toward the vent by the retractable
     cable, as a RIFLE APPEARS from a window beneath us, taking aim at
     Gin, and Mac...

     KICKS it off line, the shot BOOMING, the guard almost dropping
     the weapon, then SWINGING it back UP, slamming the muzzle directly
     INTO Mac's GROIN, as Mac...

     ...GRASPS the barrel, YANKING it up, SLIPS the shot SCREAMING past
     his head, PULLING the guard half out the window to KICK his face,
     sending him DOWN to the tracks, as we CAREEN around a curve, seeing
     in distance now...

     ...the END of the line, the massive BARRACKS LANDING, the phalanx
     of TROOPS, the fifth and final AIR VENT midway between us.  Mac's
     free hand pulls out...

     ...the lone PLASMA GRENADE he kept for himself, and as we CAREEN
     toward the troops, Mac HEAVES the grenade uptrack, and it...

     ...EXPLODES in a horrifying FIREBALL, which RIPS UP the train
     tracks, COLLAPSING a section of tunnel wall ONTO the gravel path, a
     choking CLOUD of yellow SMOKE filling the tunnel, obscuring
     everything, our train ROCKETING...

     ...TOWARD the flames, nearly AT the metal SUPPORT BEAM which runs
     vertically up to the final air vent, and as the train FLASHES PAST
     it, Mac...

     LUNGES out, SLAMMING both magnets ONTO the support beam, the
     momentum FLATTENING his body fully horizontal like a flag on a
     pole, the train PLUNGING ON without him, as guards shoot blindly
     back from the windows, the jeep PLOWING full tilt INTO the rubble
     of tunnel wall, the train...

     ...DERAILING in a terrifying CRUSH of twisted metal, screams,
     shouts, the smoke and flame everywhere, and we SNAP TO...

     REVERSE ANGLE...the soldiers' POV from the landing, SCATTERING as
     the derailed train HURTLES AT them, INTO them, chaos, until at last
     they see...

     ...above the clearing smoke, near the tunnel ceiling...

     ...Mac CLIMBING deftly up the support beam, magnets CLANKING, hand
     over hand, nearly at the vent, and the shouting troops...

     ...OPEN FIRE, bullets CHEWING UP the tunnel wall, as we SMASH CUT
     TO...

     INT. STORAGE ROOM - DAY

     Silence.  Cluttered, dimly-lit storage room.  Boxes of SHOES reach
     to the ceiling, Gucci, Bruno Magli, the good stuff.  Footsteps
     precede...

     ...a young SALESMAN, tailored, attractive.  He goes right to the
     shelf he needs.  Opens a box.  Takes it and two others.  As his
     steps recede, we PAN UP to...

     ...the ceiling.  The mesh grating, which soundlessly...

     ...slides away.  Gin DROPS lightly, twelve feet to the floor.
     Filthy from her adventure, she quickly unzips her backpack to
     remove...

     ...a sleek Halliburton case.  Opens it.  The Oracle Bone undamaged
     in its cushioned setting.  Steps returning, she is...

     ...OUT of her jumpsuit in a heartbeat, revealing a costly slip of a
     dress, kicks the jump suit under the bottom shelf, as...

     ...the young salesman APPEARS to find her peeking into a shoe box.
     He is startled.  She scowls at him, rubbing the grime from her
     face...

                               GIN (subtitled Mandarin)
                     There you are!  Do you know how
                     filthy this place is?

     Shows her dirty fingers as proof.

                               SALESMAN (subtitled Mandarin)
                     Madam, no one is supp...

                               GIN (subtitled Mandarin)
                     I'm looking for dress pumps, I'll
                     need eight pairs.

     Oh.

                               GIN (subtitled Mandarin)
                     Unless you're too busy to help me.

                               SALESMAN (subtitled Mandarin)
                     Well, no, I...

                               GIN (subtitled Mandarin)
                     Come to think of it, I need some
                     dresses for evening...

     Lifts the Halliburton case, slings her pack over her shoulder,
     strides to the doorway.  See the crowded upscale boutique...

                               GIN (subtitled Mandarin)
                     Are you coming?

     Out she goes.  And he follows.  Maybe he's on commission.

     INT. VENT - DAY

     Mac, very much alive, somewhat the worse for wear, crawling through
     a darkened pipe on his belly, toward...

     ...a grating.  Light filters through.  Reaching the screen, he
     squints through it.  Can't see shit.  Listens.  Nothing that rises
     above an ambient wooshing of air in the duct.  He grasps the wires,
     pushes, and...

     ...FALLS straight THROUGH, tumbling ten feet to CRASH LAND in a
     heap.  HEAR feminine SCREAMS before we look up to...

     ...three young WOMEN trying on lingerie, being attended by an older
     SALESWOMAN.  The girls are half-naked and as Mac rises, one THROWS
     a red lace TEDDY in his face.  He peels it off, and still holding
     the garment, calmly tells the saleswoman...

                               MAC (subtitled Mandarin)
                     It's all right, the security cameras
                     behind the mirrors are working again.

     At which the customers SHRIEK, cover themselves all the more, and
     begin screaming at the poor saleswoman.  During which...

                               MAC (subtitled Mandarin)
                     Well.  If everything is in order...

     All four women.  Look at him.

     EXT. LINGERIE SHOP, SHIN KONG MALL - SUNSET

     CLOSE on an entrance, just as Mac comes...

     ...FLYING THROUGH, propelled by two sizeable SECURITY GUARDS, once
     again landing in pieces.  It's a long day.  As Mac clears his head,
     they stand at the doorway with folded arms.  Hoping he wants some
     more.

                               MAC
                     WHAT KIND OF A COUNTRY IS THIS?  IN
                     BRITAIN, A MAN CAN TRY ON LINGERIE
                     WITHOUT COMPROMISING HIS DIGNITY!

     The bruisers look at each other.  No habla Espanol.

     EXT. KAOHSHING HARBOR, TAIWAN - DUSK

     A super TUGBOAT, engines RUMBLING, ready to pull out.  A woman
     paces the deck.  Every time we see her, she seems more tightly
     wrapped.  At last...

     ...here he comes, stepping briskly from the taxi, striding up the
     gangway, pulling from inside his coat...

     ...the red lace teddy.  He drapes it over her face, and she pulls
     it away, steps into his arms...

     ...her kiss is urgent.  Real.  HOLD on the look in her eyes.  What
     is she thinking?

     He strokes her hair, gently.  Then, goes to look into the
     Halliburton case, which stands by the rail.  As he crouches.  As he
     looks at the Bone...

     She is watching him.  An intensity to her gaze.  More feeling than
     she is comfortable with, which...

     ...disappears completely, as he turns to her.  And when he mimes
     FLINGING the case into the sea...

     She laughs.

     EXT. STATUE SQUARE, HONG KONG - DAY

     CLOSE on a British Petroleum BILLBOARD with a huge DIGITAL CLOCK,
     counting down by seconds...JUNE 29, 1997, 11:32 A.M. - 1 DAY, 12
     HOURS, 27 MINUTES, 48 SECONDS TO:  REUNION WITH CHINA!

     PAN to an AERIAL VIEW of...

     Hong Kong's bustling STATUE SQUARE, the hub of countless feeder
     streets and alleyways, as we ROAM to a SERIES OF SHOTS...

     ...billboards everywhere.  Western businesses that announce WE'LL
     STILL BE HERE FOR YOU.  Others, primarily British, sending
     farewells, gratitude for past patronage.  China-sponsored
     depictions of happy Hong Kong and Chinese citizens, proclaim ONE
     COUNTRY, TWO SYSTEMS.

     ...moving vans, people pushing carts of belongings, shop signs
     advertising blowout inventory clearance sales.  Traffic beyond
     gridlock.  The human ant colony.

     ...incredibly long queues in front of post offices, American
     Express, the imposing glass and steel skyscraper called the HONG
     KONG AND SHANGHAI BANK BUILDING.

     ...large groups of uniformed CHINESE SOLDIERS in the streets.  More
     orderly DEMONSTRATION by anti-China PROTESTERS, their signs say
     MORE DEMOCRACY and FREE HONG KONG, their numbers watched by Chinese
     soldiers, who in turn are watched by British soldiers.

     CLOSE on the square now.  A couple at a sidewalk vendor.  Mac is
     purchasing a t-shirt.  Gin dutifully lifts her arms, and Mac slips
     the garment over her head.  It says CHINA GOT HONG KONG, AND ALL I
     GOT WAS THIS LOUSY T-SHIRT.

     He regards her thoughtfully, and she turns, modeling for him as if
     wearing a Givenchy original.  He approves, lifts the Halliburton
     case, and they move on, strolling, chatting until Mac...

     ...bumps HARD into a Chinese SOLDIER, both men REELING with the
     impact.  The soldier carries an identical HALLIBURTON CASE, and the
     two men set their cases down side by side, as Mac steps forward...

                               MAC (subtitled Mandarin)
                     FUCKING HELL!  WATCH WHERE
                     YOU'RE GOING, MAN!

     No one notices, no one cares.  Gin tugs on Mac's arm, don't get
     involved, dear.  Mac reluctantly steps back.  The soldier glares at
     him.  Then, bends and picks up...

     ...Mac's case.  A parting epithet in Mandarin, and the soldier
     starts off.  Watching him, Mac unobtrusively fingers a concealed...

     ...PISTOL, ready for action.  But keeps watching, as within a few
     yards, the soldier...

     ...stops.  Opens the case.  Checks out the Oracle Bone, right there
     in the middle of the square.  Mac and Gin watching across the
     distance, with hair-trigger keenness.  At last the soldier CLOSES
     the case...

     ...walks back to us.

                               SOLDIER (subtitled Mandarin)
                     I believe I took your case.

     Handing it to Mac, he leans forward, and in low, aecented
     English...

                               SOLDIER
                     21 Old Peak Road.  In 45 minutes.

     Picks up his own case.  And is gone.

     EXT. MANSION, VICTORIA PEAK - DAY

     A vintage Aston Martin pulls up to a spectacular gated MANSION.
     Sparkling white, it is a blend of Edwardian and Regency.  Gin is
     driving, speaks into the voice box, and the gate swings open.  As
     they pull up the crushed rock driveway...

     ...a BUTLER appears, as British as the architecture.  Climbing from
     the car, Mac has the Halliburton case.

                               BUTLER
                     Will you please come this way?

     And leads them around the side of the house.  They walk slowly, a
     distance behind the butler, taking everything in.

                               MAC
                     I like this.

     His voice is strong, calm.  No hint of a smile.

                               GIN
                     You like wha...

                               MAC
                     Not being told what the fuck
                     we're doing.

     She looks equally serious.  Just more tense.

                               GIN
                     You're on a 'need to know' basis.
                     You'll get each step in time to
                     execute, I thought you agreed to
                     those condit...

                               MAC (quietly)
                     I like your not trusting me.
                     Because it frees me to do
                     the same.

     They come upon the spacious GROUNDS behind the mansion.  A
     breathtaking view down the slope of Victoria Peak to Hong Kong and
     the harbor.  Kowloon across the water.

                               GIN
                     I trust you.  I only need to...

                               MAC
                     ...remain in control.

     They pass a towering row of perfect ROSEBUSHES.  Mac SNAPS OFF a
     giant blossom.

                               MAC
                     Which is a sign of weakness.

     And hands it to her.  Their eyes meet.

                               MAC
                     I like that, too.

     At the edge of the garden, above the commanding view, a luncheon
     TABLE has been set.  Spread with delcacies.  Two SERVANTS attend,
     also British.

     Only the host is seated.  He does not rise.

                               GIN
                     Colonel

     Col. Qiu glances up from his meal.  Green PLA uniform, absurdly
     decorated, wraparound Gautier sunglasses.  We recognize him as the
     man who took Gin's call in his Mercedes in Tienanmen Square.  The
     man who accompanied the poor Minister of Finance to the ophthal-
     mologist.

                               QIU
                     You look lovely, Ginger.  Is
                     the rose for me?

                               GIN
                     Of course.

     And leans prettily.  To fasten it in the buttonhole of his lapel.

                               GIN
                     Col. Qiu Lai Chuen, this is
                     Andrew MacDougal.

     Hearing his real name, Mac cuts her a look.

                               GIN
                     Real names here, darling.  The
                     Colonel and I have every incentive
                     to keep each other's secrets.

     And she sits.  Close to Qiu.  Mac looks around at the property,
     the view.

                               QIU
                     Like the place, Andy?

                               MAC
                     Please.  Mr. MacDougal will do.

     The Colonel smiles.  First time.  Like an alligator.  Mac notices
     that the tablecloth is actually...

     ...a Union Jack.  He fingers the flag.

                               QIU
                     This way.  Doesn't matter if we
                     spill.

                               MAC
                     My sentiments exactly.

     He sits.

                               QIU
                     This place was a gift.  From
                     its former owner.  A Brit whose
                     business will now happily continue
                     to function.  Perhaps...even expand.

                               MAC (spreading his napkin)
                     Planning to spend much time here?

                               QIU
                     Tho it has required many sacrifices.

                               GIN
                     The Colonel has divorced his
                     wife.  To facilitate the necessary
                     entertaining of Western women.

                               QIU
                     Tho some are more entertaining
                     than others.

     And runs the back of his knuckles up the length of Gin's bare arm.

                               MAC
                     Colonel.  You are touching the woman
                     I love...

     Which brings Qiu's eyes over.  Really?

                               MAC
                     From time to time.

     And pulls up the Halliburton case.  Handing it across the table.
     As Qiu takes the case in his lap, opens it...

                               QIU
                     You're a Scot.  Would you like
                     some 25-year-old Macallan?

                               MAC
                     Sure, I'll take a case.

     Qiu glances across the lawn to the butler, who stands behind the
     bar trolley.  As the drinks are prepared, the Colonel studies the
     Bone.

                               GIN
                     The Colonel told his Minister
                     of Culture that he could mount
                     a surgical raid to liberate this
                     treasure from Taiwan.

                               MAC
                     Ah.  How much was the Minister
                     told the raid would cost?

                               QIU (not looking up)
                     Counting equipment, personnel,
                     bribes, an even fifty million
                     American.  All in.

                               MAC
                     Which you can now keep.

     The drinks arrive.

                               QIU
                     He would have paid twice that.
                     But my needs are modest.

     And lifts from beneath the table, a leather POUCH.

                               QIU
                     Unlike.  The woman you love.
                     From time to time.

     Drops it into Gin's lap.  She opens the pouch to reveal...

     ...goggles.  Like one would wear in a tanning salon.  Only these
     are flesh-colored with one small hole in the center of each lens.
     Slightly larger than the size of a pupil.

     She slips them on.  A bright smile.

                               GIN
                     How do I look, honey?

     And Mac smiles.  In return.

                               MAC
                     Like a woman.  Of mystery.

     INT. SUITE, PENINSULA HOTEL - LATE NIGHT

     Glass doors open WIDE to a terrace which overlooks Kowloon, the
     harbor, Hong Kong Island beyond.  More lights than stars in heaven.
     And speaking of heaven...

     ...the SOUNDS of lovemaking are fierce, feral, an urgent rhythm,
     part comic, part wondrous, and mostly, arousing enough to make us
     PAN TO...

     ...lovemaking in silhouette.  This is the lovemaking of tigers,
     mesmerizing to watch, ferocious enough to inspire envy, and
     somehow...

     ...tender enough.  To suggest real love.

     LATER...Mac and Gin sit before the open terrace.  There is wine and
     food and abandoned clothing all around them.  She has her pack
     drawn near.  And Qiu's leather pouch.  She removes the goggles...

     This is the moment.

                               GIN
                     In the Hong Kong and Shanghai
                     Bank Building.  Is a room with
                     two computers.  One for you.
                     And one for me.

                               MAC
                     Glad I have a function, here.

                               GIN
                     The room is a vault on the 14th
                     floor.  Access codes to that room
                     are changed daily, computer pass-
                     words on the hour, but...

     But.  She is electric, more alive than he's ever seen her.

                               GIN
                     Four men in the world.  Don't need
                     codes.  Their retinas will scan to
                     unlock everything.  One of these is
                     China's Minister of Finance.

     She lifts the goggles...

                               MAC
                     And his retinal plate is in there.

     Yep.

                               MAC
                     Our trade for the great train
                     robbery.  All right, let's say
                     we're in the door.  Now what?

     From her pack, she pulls a slender black rectangle.  Opens it to
     reveal a shiny metallic DISC.

                               GIN
                     Hong Kong has a huge portion of its
                     holdings invested in foreign banks.
                     In hundreds of separate accounts...

     Holds up the metallic disc.

                               GIN
                     This CD ROM is programmed to send,
                     instantaneously, thousands of instruc-
                     tions, with all necessary confirmation
                     codes, to transfer reasonably modest
                     sums out of those accounts....

                               MAC
                     Modest.

                               GIN
                     Two or three million at a crack,
                     in odd numbers.  Total, eight
                     billion.  And change.

                               MAC
                     And you've set up a laundry.

                               GIN
                     Every wire transfer gets rocketed
                     through a series of multiple switches,
                     Austria, Uruguay, Antigua, The Channel
                     Islands, the Caymans...

                               MAC (quietly)
                     Seychelles?

                               GIN (beat)
                     I left that out.

                               MAC
                     You're forgiven.

                               GIN
                     Thank you.  As soon as each deposit
                     lands somewhere, it's shot somewhere
                     else, til the Mafia couldn't find it.

                               MAC
                     But those first instructions,
                     transferring the 8 billion dollars.
                     They're recorded in the main computer.

     She waggles the disc.

                               GIN
                     Nope.  The CD instructs the computer
                     to erase the real transactions.
                     And replace them in its memory
                     with an innocuous loan coded XJ6.
                     Little homage to Limeyland, there.

                               MAC
                     Dearest.  The accounts won't
                     reconcile.

     She waggles the disc.  Again.

                               GIN
                     Wrong.  The CD instructs the computer
                     to over-report all account totals
                     forever, in the exact amounts we've
                     lifted.  So the Chinese think the
                     money's still there.

     On this one.  He has to smile.

                               MAC
                     The money.  Is still.  Missing.

                               GIN
                     Sure, the foreign banks know
                     they sent out some money.  But
                     they think Hong Kong knows it,
                     too.  And since we're leaving
                     plenty in every account...

                               MAC
                     The shit doesn't splatter.  Until
                     the first account runs dry.

     Exactly.

                               GIN
                     And then.  Comes the really
                     brilliant part of the whole
                     thing!

                               MAC
                     I was hoping there'd be one.

     He settles back.  Looks at her.

                               GIN
                     Admit it, so far you're
                     blown away.

     Well...

                               MAC
                     It does sound like the beginning
                     of a beautiful friendship.

     And his fingers reach out...

                               MAC
                     Pity it will be over.  In
                     21 hours.

     Touch her hair.  Her face.  She swallows.  A raw moment.  A
     hoarse...

                               GIN
                     Bet you say that.  To all the
                     one-night-stands.

     But he's just staring in her eyes.  The look pins her.  She can't
     wriggle off.  A murmured...

                               MAC
                     No, ma'am...

     He leans to her...

                               MAC
                     Only the best of them.

     They kiss.

     EXT. STATUE SQUARE - ROUND MIDNIGHT

     CLOSE on the British Petroleum billboard, where the countdown CLOCK
     says...JUNE 30, 1997, 11:41 P.M., 0 DAYS, 0 HOURS, 18 MINUTES, 51
     SECONDS TO:  REUNION WITH CHINA!

     The square is beyond BEDLAM.  Times Square looks deserted New
     Year's Eve compared to this carnival CRUSH of humanity, rock and
     rolling as if reunion with China was the doorway to Paradise.

     Singing, chanting, screaming, dancing, music and booze everywhere,
     firecrackers exploding, soldiers and civilians, tycoons and
     hookers, tourists and peddlers and Party members and homeless,
     going absolutely nuts.

     Who knows.  Could be the last party.  Ever.

     WHIP PAN to the crowded plaza in front of the towering glass-and-
     steel headquarters of the HONG KONG AND SHANGHAI BANK.

     ZOOM to focus on our smashing couple in evening wear, Gin with a
     large beaded shoulder bag.  Mac presents an invitation to a PLA
     soldier, who admits them into...

     INT. PUBLIC LOBBY, HONG KONG AND SHANGHAI BANK

     ...a VIP party going full blast in the lobby of this truly
     breathtaking structure.  A central ATRIUM rises 47 floors, creating
     a soaring clear core, around which the offices and working spaces
     are ringed.  The view straight up is interrupted only at three
     well-spaced levels, where thick CANOPIES of glass, stitched
     together with spidery skeletons of steel, SPAN the open core.
     Mac looks up...

     ...at the balcony railings surrounding the atrium, the revelers
     have been granted access to the lower five floors.  Above these,
     all is empty.

                               MAC
                     Nice of the Colonel to provide an
                     invitation...

     She is guiding him toward one of the multiple hors d'oeuvre
     stations.  Half the celebrants seem to be armed PLA soldiers, many
     with rifles slung boldly across their shoulders.

                               GIN
                     Well, I promised him a bonus.
                     Five million.  Comes out of
                     your share.

                               MAC
                     ...long as I don't have to have
                     sex with him.

     Mac loads up on six hors d'oeuvres, piling them on a napkin, as
     she takes two flutes of champagne.  They step away from the mob
     toward a potted plant near the wall, and Mac...

     ...drops his snacks with a SPLAT.  Shit.  Bending to clean the
     mess, he slips from his waistband a flat CIRCUIT BOARD with a
     bank logo and a three-pronged plug.  In a single motion, he plugs
     it INTO a socket concealed by the pot, scoops up his canapes,
     and we CUT TO...

     INT. SURVEILLANCE ROOM

     Three SECURITY OFFICERS blink, as ALL FIFTY monitor screens go
     HAYWIRE at once.  The images compressed to a blur of lines between
     a series of diagonal SLACK BARS that slash across the screens.  The
     way your TV acts when the horizontal hold goes out.  They can't
     believe it.

     Stumped, they start slamming buttons, flipping switches, jabbering
     to each other.  Now the images begin to ROLL vertically, as if in
     response to their attempts at adjustment.

     Welcome to the world of high tech.

     INT. ELEVATOR BANK

     Mac and Gin wait with a party of older Brits, who've had plenty
     to drink and are carrying more.  Two armed soldiers flank the
     elevators.  A car arrives.  As the Brits enter...

                               MAC (politely)
                     We'll take the next one.

     Waiting, calmly.  Mac smiles at a soldier.

                               MAC (subtitled Mandarin)
                     What time tomorrow do the tanks
                     roll in?

     The guy LAUGHS.  An elevator arrives.  Gin sipping champagne as
     they enter.

     The doors CLOSE.  They are alone.  The panel has floors 1 through
     5 lit.  The other numbers, 6-10 and 16-47, are dark.  There are NO
     numbers 11-15.

     Mac pulls from his pocket a small flat DEVICE, not much thicker
     than a credit card, with a window and a series of LED lights
     on its face.  He fits it into a SLOT beside a black glass PLATE
     on the elevator panel.  Immediately, the LEDs scramble, all RED,
     numbers FLASH across the card's window, as the device begins
     to lock on the elevator code.  In sequence, the LEDs turn GREEN,
     and...

     ...the glass plate LIGHTS, announcing in Kanji and English...ACCES
     GRANTED TO FLOORS 11, 12, 14, 15.  Mac presses the lit number 14.

     The elevator RISES.  He looks over at her.  She is tight enough
     to snap.  We can feel her heart racing from here.

                               MAC
                     So all that time, sitting at your
                     computers.  All the research, the
                     access codes your job allowed you
                     to steal, floor plans, schematics...
                     setting up all your bank accounts...

     She looks irritated.  He is smiling, gently.

                               MAC
                     Years of work, comes down to....
                               (checks his watch)
                     ...six minutes.  Don't be
                     nervous.  Easy come, easy go.

     She looks away.  The elevator stops.

                               MAC
                     Your share prob'ly works out
                     to, what?  Dollar and a quarter
                     an hour?

     Me laughs.  The door opens.  She is pissed off.

                               GIN
                     What's your point?

                               MAC (very real)
                     That I like you, Ginger.

     Now they're staring at each other.  An open elevator door.  An
     empty dim hallway.  They see only each other.

                               MAC
                     The dedication, the skill,
                     the guts...

     He holds out the crook of his arm.  As a gentleman escorts a lady.

                               MAC
                     I'm going to see you get
                     everything you deserve.

     Her eyes flicker on that.  So he grins...

                               MAC
                     Woman.  If you can't have
                     fun, right now.  You're in
                     the wrong business.

     She looks in his eyes.  Her body seems to relax, just a little.
     She takes his arm.

     INT. 14TH FLOOR

     CLOSE on a KEYPAD.  Next to it, a mirrored PLATE with two
     APERTURES, set apart the distance of human eyes.  Gin's goggled
     face DROPS into frame, reflected in the mirrored surface.  She
     fits her eyes to the apertures...

                               GIN (whispers)
                     Open.  Sesame.

     A red scanning light APPEARS.  Tracks vertically.  BEEPS.  Tracks
     horizontally.  And from somewhere...

     ...a soft CLICK.  PULL BACK now, to see...

     They stand at what seems the door to a BANK VAULT.  Round,
     gigantic, heavy steel.  Bolts eyerywhere.  Mac reaches to GRASP
     the handle, and...

     CLANG.  The door swings OPEN.  They stare at the inner sanctum...

     ...a windowless ROOM.  Dim, eerie fluorescence.  A blast of white
     noise from the elaborate air-cooling system.  Two large MAINFRAME
     COMPUTERS face each other from opposite walls, desks and work
     stations with PC monitors filling the space between.  As Mac closes
     the vault door behind them...

     ...Gin goes quickly to the smaller mainframe.  Pulls the high-
     resolution monitor around on its adjustable arm.  The screensaver
     displays Guernsey cows swimming among tropical fish.  She hits a
     key.  The screen saver replaced by, WELCOME.  AUTHORIZATION MODE
     PLEASE.  Two boxes for PASSWORD and SCAN.  She hits SCAN.  A
     plastic shield RISES, revealing...

     ...the mirrored PLATE, the tiny APERTURES.  Gin leans to fit her
     goggled eyes in place.  The red scanning light.  Vertical track.
     BEEP.  Horizontal track.  And the monitor announces...WELCOME
     MINISTER FEIHONG.  Gin takes off the goggles, and...

     ...THROWS them across the room to Mac at the larger mainframe.  As
     he repeats the scanning process, Gin is loading the precious CD-ROM
     into her mainframe's driver.  Watches the screen...

                               GIN
                     Uploading.  And you've got...
                     two minutes, fifty seconds.

     WITH Mac now.  Typing the words CONTROL PANEL.  The screen now
     shows icons for time setting, and he clicks his mouse to create a
     CLOCK in the center of the screen, labeled LOCAL TIME, and reading
     11:57:19, changing with each second that passes...

                               MAC
                     So let's see.  Across town at
                     the British Consulate...

     INTERCUT...frenzied activity in a large war room filled with
     computers, wall screens, every worker functioning at top speed...
     CONTINUE to hear Mac over this...

                               MAC (V.O.)
                     ...everyone is working frantically
                     to complete transactions before
                     they go off-line at midnight.

     CUT BACK to Mac in the vault.  He clicks his mouse to create a
     clock at the LEFT of the screen, labeled BRITISH TERMINAL TIME.
     It is, of course, showing the same time as the local clock.

                               MAC
                     ...then, deep in the high-tech
                     bowels of the Bank of China
                     Building, just across the square...

     INTERCUT...an even larger war room, even better staffed and
     equipped.  Everyone...doing...nothing.  Staring at blank monitors
     and wall screens.

                               MAC (V.O.)
                     ...the Chinese are sitting on
                     their thumbs, waiting to come
                     on-line at midnight.

     CUT BACK to Mac in the vault.  He clicks his mouse to create
     another clock at the RIGHT of the screen, labeled CHINA TERMINAL
     TIME.  Shows the same time as the other clocks.  11:58:22.

                               MAC
                     I feel for these boys.  Let's
                     give them a breather, hmmn?

     CLICKS the mouse, and the BRITISH TERMINAL TIME begins FLASHING.

                               MAC
                     We'll let the Brits go off-line
                     4 seconds early.

     As the flashing clock reaches 11:58:30, and Mac HITS the key four
     times, advancing the British clock to 34 seconds, four seconds
     later than the others.

                               MAC
                     And we'll give our new Chinese
                     overlords 4 extra seconds of rest
                     before they have to go on-line.

     As the local and Chinese clocks reach 40 seconds, Mac HITS the key
     four times, regressing the Chinese clock back to 36 seconds.

     We watch all three clocks, clicking down the last moments of
     British rule.  The British clock is 4 seconds FAST, the Chinese
     clock 4 seconds SLOW.

                               MAC
                     Playing God here, Ginger.  We've
                     created 8 seconds that do not
                     exist, anywhere but in this room.

     LOCAL TIME...11:59:00.  One minute to midnight.

                               MAC
                     8 seconds, where no one is on-line
                     but your little CD-Rom.

     He turns around.  Her eyes are waiting.  Across the room.

                               MAC
                     And when, eventually, everyone
                     discovers what transaction XJ6
                     was really about...

                               GIN
                     China will think it happened
                     before midnight.  Britain will
                     swear it happened after midnight...

                               MAC
                     They'll each be positive.  The
                     other guy.  Did it.

     Mac sighs.  This is a sad thing.

                               MAC
                     Liable to be an ugly international
                     incident.

     She squints across at his clock.

                               GIN
                     Britain off-line in 18 seconds.
                     We're bulletproof.

     His smile returns.  Bittersweet and real...

                               MAC
                     Baby girl.  Nothing.  Is
                     bulletproof.  Ever.

     The look holds.  He turns back to his screen.  She lingers on him
     for an instant.  Then, back to the mainframe, finger poised above
     her ENTER key...

                               MAC
                     Britain goes bye-bye in 6...
                     5...4...3.

     INTERCUT...The British Consulate.  All screens go DARK.  A logo
     APPEARS of a POPPING Champagne BOTTLE, whose spray forms a Union
     Jack twined with a PRC flag, everyone SHOUTS, cheers or curses, and
     we SMASH CUT...

     BACK to Gin...striking ENTER, the screen flashing TRANSACTIONS XJ6
     PROCESSING.

                               GIN (softly)
                     Jesus God, it's going through.

                               MAC (watching his clocks)
                     Hong Kong midnight, happy new year.
                     Except at China Bank.

                               GIN (to her screen)
                     C'mon, c'mon...

     Her screen flashes TRANSACTIONS XJ6 COMPLETED, hear her SHRIEK of
     ecstasy, as we...

     INTERCUT...Bank of China where dark screens suddenly LIGHT with the
     same stupid PARTY LOGO.  Only nobody cheers.  They just get to
     work.

     BACK TO the vault...

                               MAC
                     Feel like a nightcap?

     But across the way, Gin is JAMMING a button.  Again.  Again.

                               GIN
                     The CD won't come out of
                     the driver.

     Houston.  We have a problem.

                               MAC
                     Relax, don't jam it...

                               GIN (jamming it)
                     FUCKING THING!!

     He crosses the room.  She's rummaging on a nearby desk, finds a
     LETTER OPENER.

                               MAC
                     Don't panic, now, there's no rush...

                               GIN
                     We can't leave it IN THERE, it's
                     got all our accounts, everything
                     that can NAIL us to a goddam CROSS!!

     She's fitting the letter opener INTO the narrow slot above the lid
     of the driver.

                               MAC
                     Easy with that, there's no ru...

     WHOOP!  WHOOP!  WHOOP!  WHOOP!  Every SIREN in the skyscraper is
     SHRIEKING, lights are FLASHING CRIMSON, Gin's screen says SECURITY
     BREACH in a selection of languages.

     Gin just staring at it.

                               GIN
                     There's a rush.

     The sirens are EAR-SPLITTING.  We know that elsewhere in this
     building, all hell must be breaking loose.  Gin is YANKING Mac's
     arm out of the socket...

                               GIN
                     LET'S MOVE IT, WHAT ARE YOU
                     WAITING F...

                               MAC
                     The disc.  Is still in there.

     Yeh.  She stares at it.  Really scared.

                               GIN
                     We can't help it, we...we've
                     gotta...

     He stares at her.  In one motion, he SNATCHES a stapler from the
     desk and SMASHES the driver with all his strength.

     It pops open.  Calmly, he plucks her CD from the tray.  She mouths
     a barely audible...

                               GIN
                     What a guy.

     But just as she's about to bolt...he holds up one hand.  Slips
     another CD from his pocket.  We see the words KENNY G.

                               MAC
                     Was wondering where to leave
                     this...

     Pops it IN the drive.  SLAMS it shut.

                               MAC (quietly)
                     Time to go.

     INT. CORRIDOR

     Mac and Gin RUNNING full tilt through the siren BLARE, turning a
     corner to see ahead...

     ...the balcony railing, the building's empty central CORE.  Mac
     BOLTS straight TOWARD it, Gin sprinting to follow, lungs pounding,
     they reach the railing, looking DOWN to see...

     Hysteria, unimaginable chaos.  Soldiers, black-tie partygoers,
     SCRAMBLING in all directions, looking to his left Mac sees...

     ...the bank of ELEVATORS, soldiers POURING in, some cars already
     RISING, fourth floor, fifth.  Now he looks directly BELOW, where...

     ...soldiers are POUNDING up the metal service staircase, the front
     rank almost at the third floor.  In the lobby, some faces look up
     to see us, but no one is shooting.

                               GIN
                     They don't know we're the
                     bad guys.

     He PLUNGES his hand into her shoulder bag...

                               MAC
                     Time they find out.

     Pulls OUT two PLASMA GRENADES, and FLINGS one toward the elevator
     cables three floors down and it...

     ...EXPLODES in a horrifying FIREBALL, causing PANDEMONIUM in the
     lobby below, the elevator cables BLOWN AWAY, cars PLUNGING, the
     yellow smoke momentarily screening us from the soldiers far below,
     and Mac HURLS the second grenade...

     ...STRAIGHT DOWN and the fireball WIPES OUT the staircase, a huge
     section of ninth floor landing RAINING down on the lobby.

                               GIN
                     Okay.  How do we get down?

                               MAC
                     Down?  I never liked down.

     Grabs her hand and they RACE to the staircase, as smoke BILLOWS
     everywhere below.  UP they go, two stairs at a time, the lowest
     glass-and-spiderweb-steel CANOPY is three floors above us, the
     cacophany of SHOUTS below is like an amplified insane asylum.

     He is dragging her now, up, up, BULLETS are flying blind through
     the smoke, CHEWING up metal and glass all around us, up, up, and
     as the smoke at last clears, they have reached...

     ...the canopy floor.  They can see the army down below.  Clutching
     her hand, Mac leads her OVER the railing, ONTO the canopy itself,
     and together they RUN...

     ...straight ACROSS the heavy glass toward the far side of the
     building, like space-walking above the throng 150 feet below,
     BULLETS now TRACING their path from beneath, SLAMMING OFF the
     underside of the bulletproof canopy, Gin SHRIEKING with fright
     as they go.  We see ahead...

     ...three EXECUTIVE ELEVATORS beginning to climb the far wall.
     These are glass-enclosed tubes, all filled with soldiers, the car
     in the lead already at the tenth floor.  Mac keeps running straight
     TOWARD them.

                               GIN (out of breath)
                     WE'VE GOT ONE MORE GRENADE!

                               MAC (not)
                     SAVE IT FOR A RAINY DAY!

     They make it to the edge of the canopy, the lead elevator only two
     floors below them.  We can see the soldiers through the glass.  Mac
     GRASPS her hand, and as the car nears our level...

                               MAC
                     You can do this.

     They LEAP across five feet of open air to...

     ...LAND squarely on the car's metal roof, Mac WRAPPING his free arm
     AROUND the cable, and UP we go.  The ant colony below us receding
     fast.

     Gin is hanging onto the cable, petrified.  Mac is looking up toward
     the roof.

                               GIN
                     Okay, now what?

                               MAC (absently)
                     Shut up.  You're on a 'need-to-
                     know' basis.

                               GIN
                     Mac, I'm sorry.

     He looks at her.  Just now, she seems more miserable than afraid.

                               GIN
                     Turns out, I'm a screw-up.

     He doesn't smile.  Passing the third canopy.

                               MAC
                     Well.  Something to be said for
                     being self-aware.

     Looks back up.  Forty-first floor.  Six to go.

                               MAC
                     May I have the last grenade, dear.
                     It's about to rain.

     She blinks.  Huh?  So he reaches into her bag, pulls out the
     grenade, and THROWS it...

     ...STRAIGHT up.  The roof above them EXPLODES in a FIREBALL, and
     SHIELDS her body against the wall of their shaft, as a huge SECTION
     of roof comes RAINING down.  We watch as it...

     ...CRASHES through the upper canopy, TONS of roof and glass
     PLUNGING to...

     ...BLAST through the middle canopy, everyone below SCRAMBLING for
     shelter, as the whole shebang...

     ...EXPLODES through the lowest canopy.  Gin can only GAPE at the
     incredible display.  Mouthing a silent WOW.

     They've passed the second canopy, thirty-sixth floor.  Still
     climbing.  The other two elevators maybe five floors below us.

                               MAC
                     You see, banking will be more
                     democratic under China.

     She looks to him.

                               MAC
                     Well.  No more glass ceiling.

     The elevator car has STOPPED.  We are at the roof.  The soldiers
     are in the car beneath our feet, nowhere to get out.  Above our
     heads.

     ...the last few feet of elevator cable.  And starry sky, where our
     patch of roof used to be.

                               MAC
                     How refreshing.  The night air.

     He begins to shimmy up the few feet of cable.  At the top, he
     reaches out with one hand toward the lip of the remaining roof,
     GRABS it, LUNGES with his free hand, and...

     ...DANGLING 47 floors, he pulls himself UP, swings ONTO the roof.
     Reaches back down.  She is only twelve feet below him.  Frozen with
     fear.

                               GIN
                     I can't do this.

                               MAC
                     You can.  If I say so.

     She stares up at his eyes.  He smiles.

                               MAC
                     If you stay.  You'll have to pay
                     for the damage...

     She looks down at the mess below.

     And starts to climb the cable.  Not so easy in a ball gown, but the
     adrenaline is pumping.  Gets to the top.  Here's the hard part.
     One hand reaches out...

     ...GRABS his.  She lets GO.  And she is DANGLING in space.

                               MAC
                     Now that split.  Did we say
                     60-40?

     And with all his strength, hauls her up onto...

     ...the roof.  Two-thirds of it remain.  At the far edge, a gigantic
     MAINTENANCE CRANE, itself two stories high.  But between here and
     the crane...

     ...a HELICOPTER.  Big and beautifUl and empty.  She looks like
     she's seen God.  Mac starts to jog toward it, she runs to follow
     but sees him go...

     ...straight PAST the chopper.

                               GIN
                     HEY!

     He turns back.

     She points to the copter.  It's over here.

                               MAC
                     Got the keys?

     Oh.

                               GIN
                     I thought you could...hot-wire
                     stuff?

     Guess not.

                               MAC
                     They fix those things so you
                     can't steal them...

     And keeps walking.  Toward the monster CRANE.

                               MAC
                     These, they're not so worried.

     Moving fast, he points off to his right.  Her eyes follow a
     long CABLE, leading from the arm of the crane, across the roof,
     attaching by a huge HOOK to a massive WRECKING BALL.

                               MAC
                     Go grab that hook.

     He reaches the crane's cab.  Turns back to see she hasn't moved.

                               MAC
                     Let me rephrase that.  Run
                     and grab that hook.  Or die...

     Got it?  She takes off running.  He hops IN the cab.  PUSHES the
     start button.  It rumbles to life.  Tests some levers...

                               GIN (O.S.)
                     SHIT!  DON'T DO THAT!

     He turns to see that he's tightened the cable, pulling her ball six
     feet in the AIR.  She clings to the hook with a true death grip.
     He lowers her ball to the roof.  Getting the hang of it.

                               MAC
                     This only works if you shut
                     your eyes.

     Which makes her eyes BUG OUT.

                               GIN
                     You're not gonna lower me over
                     the side.

                               MAC
                     Of course not.  Now close baby
                     eyes...
                               (she won't)
                     Suit yourself.

     He THROWS a lever and the crane's arm begins to SWING in a circle,
     finally taking the ball WITH it, and as she SCREAMS, Mac...

     ...POUNCES out of the cab, RACING along the edge of the roof, NOT
     toward the ball which is sweeping the hysterical Gin in a widening
     ARC, but toward the point where he thinks the ball will clear the
     edge, and JUST as it does, he...

     ...LEAPS aboard, throwing one arm around the hook, the other around
     her, and they go...

     ...OVER the side, WHOOSHING DOWN in a gigantic, every-increasing
     LOOP, as the endless steel cable UNWINDS from its huge drum like a
     fishing reel hooked onto a killer whale.

                               GIN
                     OH NOOOOOOOOOO....

     The ride no theme park could insure, SWOOPING out ACROSS the
     skyline, DROPPING like an anvil, as the cable UNSPOOLS hundreds of
     feet, nothing but NOTHING for miles below them, Gin grabbing a
     breath to SHRIEK her guts out, as the monstrous pendulum reaches
     its max, begins to slow toward that one nauseating motionless
     instant...

                               MAC
                     Let go NOW!!

     He YANKS her loose, and they drop...

     ...four feet.  The ball SWINGS OFF lnto space to some unknown
     mayhem.  Clutching Mac, Gin looks WAY down to the street, and
     realizes they are standing on...

     ...a rooftop.  Quiet, safe.  Alone.

                               MAC
                     Planning.

     She WHIPS around, GLARING death at his eyes.

                               MAC
                     And dumb luck.

     She COLLAPSES in his arms, every muscle trembling in spasm,
     sobbing...

                               GIN
                     God, I hate you.

     He holds her tenderly.  Kisses the top of her head.

                               MAC (softly)
                     Good.  I hate you, too.

     EXT. NATHAN ROAD - EARLY MORNING

     WITH Gin in a soft brunette wig, walking briskly, light carry-all
     across her shoulder.  Very early, even the busiest street in the
     world is less than that at this hour.  Up ahead...

     ...Tsimshatsui Station, a tall man with a tourist shopping bag,
     leaning casually against a pole.  Talking into a cellular.

     As she approaches, Mac doesn't seem to notice, but she can now hear
     his conversation...

                               MAC (into phone)
                     ...if I can't have my usual
                     suite, I'll take my business
                     to the Bristol, simple as that.

     He sees her now.  Smiles small.

                               MAC (into phone)
                     ...why indeed should I be more
                     loyal to you than you've been to
                     me?  Think it over.

     SNAPS the phone shut.

                               MAC
                     You ran your calls.

     She did.  She is frankly exhilarated.

                               GIN
                     All the transactions, all the
                     transfers.  It's a miracle.

                               MAC
                     Why?  The CD erased the trans-
                     actions, all accounts seem in
                     order.  It looks like the thieves
                     were stopped in time.

     She sighs.  It is a miracle.

                               GIN
                     The Colonel says police have
                     nothing.  A man in black-tie, a
                     blonde in a gown.  The elevator
                     guards saw faces, but no mug shots
                     to ID.  I think it's over.

     Mac's smile.  Bittersweet affection.

                               MAC
                     Except it never is, really.
                     Quite.  Over.

     She smiles.  It is easy, but dazzling.  Atypically soft.

                               GIN
                     Well, one hopes not.  The Bristol,
                     huh?  In...Paris?

     Ah.

                               MAC
                     You're not going back to Mr. Cruz,
                     and the nine-to-five?

                               GIN
                     Not hardly.  I've arranged to be
                     killed in a car crash.  On Taipei.
                     Amazing how little it costs.

                               MAC
                     Well.  You want to watch those
                     pennies.

     She takes a breath.  Scared, in an excited way...

                               GIN
                     I could arrange for two.  In that
                     crash.

     His smile back.

     He looks at his watch.  Takes her hand.  Leads her to the subway
     steps.

                               MAC
                     You know, for a bitch.  You can
                     be awfully sweet.

                               GIN
                     Woman of mystery.  What do you say?
                     I like the Bristol, just fine.
                     mean, it's not the Ritz...

                               MAC
                     You know, all night I've been
                     wrestling with something...

                               GIN
                     Not the most flattering way to
                     put it.

     He takes his big tourist shopping bag.  Puts it in her hand.

                               MAC
                     I've changed your travel plans.

     They are descending now.  Into the vast underground train station.

                               GIN
                     Mine.

                               MAC
                     Instead of taking the subway to
                     the airport, you change at Jordan
                     Station for Kowloon Tong.  Got that?

     Got that?

                               MAC
                     Jordan is only 90 seconds up the
                     line.  Like a wire transfer, you're
                     gone.  Vanished.

     He holds up a silencing finger.  Listen to me.

                               MAC
                     In this bag are passports,
                     tickets, papers.  An amber wig, a
                     good one.  A dress you can slip on
                     in five seconds.

     Her eyes moving over his face.  What is this?

                               MAC
                     You're on a tight connection to
                     the Trans-Siberian Express, be in
                     Europe in a week.

                               GIN
                     Mac, wh...

                               MAC
                     Shhh.  You always talk too much.

     They're at the booth.  He pays their fare.  Through the turnstiles,
     now.

                               MAC
                     Time has come to return the favor.
                     One last time.

     Smiles at her.  As they enter a tunnel.

                               MAC
                     Tell you.  What business.  I'm
                     actually in.

     And in an instant of blind panicked clarity.  She gets the whole
     thing.

                               GIN (hushed)
                     My God.  You're a cop.

                               MAC (very softly)
                     That's my girl.

     Keep walking.  People are everywhere.  But they are alone in the
     world.

                               MAC
                     See, my profession was cover,
                     too.  A notorious thief has access
                     to colleagues, their plans...

     He sighs.

                               MAC
                     I've turned in...well, couple
                     hundred.  over forty years.
                     Scotland Yard, Interpol, FBI...

     Looking around the tunnel.

                               MAC
                     Thought I might retire.  After you.

                               GIN
                     And all the...microchips, the
                     diamond machine...

                               MAC
                     Well, the chips were returned.
                     The machine was just a box, did
                     you actually think it was real?

     Glances at her.

                               GIN
                     I thought...everything was real.
                     Stupid girl.

     End of the tunnel in sight now.  It leads to a massive, endless
     quai.  Trains in transit.

                               GIN
                     Those were your jobs, so I could
                     have claimed entrapment.  You had
                     to wait.  For mine.

     Nearly there.  He says nothing.  Looks pretty grim.

                               GIN
                     The Oracle Bone...

                               MAC
                     Well, the State Department liked
                     that one.  They have more fish to
                     fry with Beijing than Taiwan.

     He sighs.

                               MAC
                     So they're taking credit for
                     letting it go through.  Tho I'm
                     afraid your Colonel may be in for
                     a career disappointment.

     She stops walking.  She has to know...

                               GIN
                     And the 5 billion.

     Ah.  That.

                               MAC
                     I haven't told them.

     Gently, takes her arm.  Leads her onto the endless train platform.
     Walking slower now.

                               MAC
                     I said you hadn't revealed the
                     job.  That it wouldn't take place
                     until after the changeover.

     Down the platform they stroll.  As her eyes wander...

                               MAC
                     Don't look, they're there.

     Her breath catches.  Her eyes go down.

                               GIN
                     And my tickets.  In the shopping bag?

                               MAC
                     Well.  Kept my options open.  If
                     I give you up, they don't matter,
                     do they?

     Her heart pounding through her chest.

                               GIN
                     If.

                               MAC
                     Had lots of crazy thoughts.  One
                     was retirement.  With four billion
                     dollars.  After all, I know some
                     places where life could be private...

                               GIN
                     But you couldn't do that, huh?

     They've stopped.  Just two travellers in a strange land.  waiting
     for a train.

                               GIN
                     Otherwise.  They wouldn't be here.

     He nods.  Smiling pleasantly.

                               MAC
                     Creature of habit.  I suppose.

     We feel her adrenaline racing.

                               GIN
                     Lots.  Of thoughts, you s...

                               MAC
                     Keep smiling.  They won't move,
                     until I raise my left arm.

     And so she smiles.  As prettily as she can manage.

                               MAC
                     I thought.  Well, I've got the CD.
                     I could contact the banks, reverse
                     all the transactions...

     A train is COMING.  We HEAR it.

                               MAC
                     ...except maybe.  Leave you with...
                     oh, a hundred million, say.  To
                     tide you over.

     SEE the train.  Slowing.  Pulling in.

                               MAC
                     Then, I thought, nah.  Not my style.

     With a SHRIEK of metal.  The train PULLS toward us.

                               MAC
                     I figured.  What the hell?

     What the hell?

                               MAC
                     Let her keep the lot.

     The train STOPS.  The doors OPEN.  People come out, people go in.
     Pouring around them.  They are alone again.  The subway doors stand
     open.  Two feet away.  She looks at them...

                               MAC
                     No rush.  The doors won't close for
                     60 seconds.

     Sixty seconds.  And still smiling...

                               MAC
                     There's a pistol in the bag.  Reach
                     in slowly.  Take it out fast.  Point
                     it at my temple.

     She freezes to stone.

                               MAC
                     You can do it.  If I say you can.

     And she...DOES IT.  A blinding MOVE, the gun straight at his head,
     Mac miming fear, raising his hands to chill the agents we...

     WHIP PAN to see.  Half a dozen, everywhere, but none too close.
     They REACT, pull their weapons, but it's a stand-off.  BACK TO...
         
     Two people. Alone in the universe.

                               MAC
                     Step onto the car, keep the
                     pistol trained on my face.

     She hesitates.  Does as he says.  Passengers are screaming,
     cringing, bolting for other cars.  Our world is FROZEN.  His hands
     raised...

                               MAC
                     Seems I was wrong.

     Gentle smile.

                               MAC
                     Entrapment.  Is what robbers.
                     Do to cops, huh?

     Her eyes are flooding.  The gun is trembling.

                               MAC
                     Twenty seconds.  Shoot me in the
                     shoulder, it'll slow them down.

     Her pistol is shaking like she has palsy.  Tears are on her cheeks.

                               GIN
                     Oughta shoot you in the face.

                               MAC
                     Come on, you can do it, if I sa...

                               GIN
                     No way.  Not anymore.

     She sobs.  She can't stand this.

                               MAC
                     Ten seconds, hold on.

                               GIN
                     When do I see you?

     There is no answer.  There are no words.

     The doors HISS SHUT.  She stares, training her pistol on him
     through the glass, his hands reaching back to hold off the agents,
     and the train...

     PULLS away.  An instant to pick up speed, and it ROARS into a
     tunnel.  Gone.

     Mac stands motionless as ALL HELL breaks loose around him, AGENTS
     rushing to his side, Mac shaking his head, calmly...
         
     Still staring after the train.

                               MAC
                     Airport.  Changing at Mongkok
                     Station, we can cut her off.

     Walkie-talkies WHIP out.  These guys are the same the world over.
     We begin to CRANE UP...

                               MAC
                     She might lose the wig, be looking
                     brunette or blonde, navy pants suit...

                               AGENT
                     I think Yaumatei changes for the
                     airport, and it's closer.

     Keep PULLING UP, an AERIAL VIEW now, too high to see their faces...

                               MAC (O.S.)
                     I think you're wrong, but cover it.
                     You got maybe four minutes.

     HIGHER still, the mob below an ant colony...

                               MAC (O.S., calmly)
                     No problem.  She's trapped.

     But as the crowd parts.  We can make out one lone man...

     Staring after.  What has gone.

                                                         March 2008
                         

                         

                         BEGIN CREDITS:

          EXT. REYNOLD'S EXTRACT BUILDING - DAY

          An idyllic American factory. There's a huge, long lawn in
          front. A Reynolds Extract sign in brick with
          flowers/landscaping around it, sits near the entrance. We
          see from the number of cars in the parking lot that it's a
          company of about 50 - 75 employees.

          INT. REYNOLD'S EXTRACT BUILDING - DAY

          We are in a manufacturing area of an assembly-line
          production. It's a big room full of intricate machines, huge
          vats of different colored extract and other food flavoring
          products, conveyor belts, bottling machines, etc. It has a
          high ceiling with offices on the second floor that have big
          windows overlooking this manufacturing area.
          We PAN up to the main office.

          INSIDE THE OFFICE
          JOEL REYNOLDS, head of the company, mid-thirties, is on the
          phone with his friend DEAN.
          DEAN (v.o.)
          You should come by tonight. Half
          price well drinks while the game's
          going.

                         JOEL
          You always give me free drinks
          though.
          DEAN (v.o.)
          Oh yeah. Well come by anyway.

                         JOEL
          Yeah?... Might as well. No action
          going on at my house, that's for
          sure.
          DEAN (v.o.)
          Really? The wife out of town?

                         JOEL
          No... I just haven't been laid in
          a month.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          2.
          DEAN (v.o.)
          You guys having problems or
          something?

                         JOEL
          No. This is pretty much normal
          these days...
          As CREDITS continue, camera PULLS OUT, back down to the
          manufacturing area, past a big vat of orange extract, down
          through various stages of assembly line production, then
          follows several bottles of orange extract moving past
          HECTOR, a Mexican immigrant employee in his thirties. The
          camera stops on him. Talking to Hector is STEP, a short,
          beady-eyed Charles-Manson-looking guy with a beard and
          mustache. Step is in his forties. He makes everything he
          says sound as macho and important as possible.

                         STEP
          You get this job through Manpower?

                         HECTOR
          Yeah.

                         STEP
          I started here with Manpower too.
          Started out on the line just like
          you.

                         (DEAD-SERIOUS)
           Only I did better... 40 crates a
          day. 
          Beat. Hector is not quite sure what he's talking about.
          STEP continues telling his tale in such a way that the only
          polite reaction would be one of total amazement.

                         STEP (CONT'D)
          I'm the best sorter in here.
          That's why they made me full time
          with benefits. I'll probably be
          floor manager this year.
          A FEW FEET AWAY we see RORY, a stocky indie-rock geek, with
          too many tatoos, hair shaved on the side with a ponytail,
          lots of bad piercings, wearing baggy shorts with lots of
          pockets and some kind of gothy T-shirt -- a look that ought
          to be out of style by now.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          3.
          Rory is putting stickers on boxes with a sticker gun. He
          flips the sticker gun around unnecessarily between each
          application, adding a few unnecessary moves/motions, slapping
          each box when he's done, generally making the activity look
          like more of a skill than it actually is. He approaches Step
          and Hector, pulling out some fliers from his many pockets.

                         RORY
          (hands them each a flier)
          My band's playing this Friday, come
          check us out.
          Hector looks down at the flier. It's xeroxed with fifties
          clip-art, cut out letters and the name of the band, "God's
          Cock". Hector just looks at it confused, not knowing much
          English, not sure what he's supposed to be doing with the
          flier.
          AT THE END OF THE LINE, where boxes are loaded onto pallets,
          sits MARY, 58 years old, wearing a 15-year-old pair of acid-
          wash jeans, and an oversized tweety-bird T-shirt, fanny pack,
          and dayglow yellow triangle-shaped earrings. She's pear-
          shaped with short hair. She's bitter and bossy, always
          shaking her head at everyone. She sits on a stool with a
          clipboard, looks over her glasses at Hector, shaking her
          head. She talks to Gabriella, a Hispanic woman in her
          forties.

                         MARY
          You see that... That new guy.
          He's holding us up. It's not my
          job to tell them to hold the line
          either.

                         GABRIELLA
          And then Joel's gonna come yell at
          us, cuz he's not doing his job.

                         MARY
          (folds her arms, fed up)
          I'm just gonna sit here.

                         GABRIELLA
          You're not gonna shut it off?

                         MARY
          I'm not gonna hold the line. If
          they're not gonna do their job, why
          should I do mine.
          Mary sits there, arms folded, lips pursed, refusing to pause
          the conveyor belt.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          4.

          INT. JOEL'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

          Joel is still on the phone with Dean.

                         JOEL
          If I don't get home before about
          8:00, she puts on the sweatpants
          and once the sweatpants are on,
          it's over -- I get nothing.
          (notices something down

                         BELOW)
          Shit. I'm gonna have to call you
          back.
          Joel hangs up and runs downstairs.

          ON THE MANUFACTURING FLOOR:
          Boxes start to accumulate and fall off the end of the line.
          Step sees this, runs to shut off the line, yelling at Mary.

                         STEP
          What are you doing?!

                         MARY
          What are YOU doing?!
          (pointing at Hector)
          What is he doing?
          A YELLING/BICKERING MATCH breaks out between Mary, Step, Rory
          and Gabriella. Joel runs over, shuts off the conveyor belt.

                         JOEL (CONT'D)
          All right. Now, what's the
          problem?
          They all erupt in more BICKERING AND FINGER POINTING.

                         JOEL (CONT'D)
          Okay! Okay, everyone settle down.
          Now Mary. Hector here is new okay?
          It's gonna take him a couple of
          days, maybe his English isn't so
          good. You gotta be patient.

                         STEP
          That's what I was tryin' to say.

                         JOEL
          And Step, if you wanna be Floor
          Manager, this is the kind of thing
          you're going to have to deal with.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          5.

                         STEP

                         (KISS-ASS)
          Exactly.

                         JOEL
          Okay, now Step, Rory, Hector, let's
          get this cleaned up, and get
          rolling again. We can't afford to
          fall behind today.
          Joel walks away. People resume their posts. Mary starts
          right back up with Gabriella.

                         MARY
          You see that? We always get the
          blame.

          INT. JOEL'S OFFICE - A LITTLE LATER

          Joel sits in his swivel chair, looking down at the production
          floor, shaking his head. BRIAN, Joel's second in command,
          walks in. He's a little older than Joel, neatly trimmed
          beard, aviator glasses, and a bit of a gut. He wears a
          Reynold's Extract golf shirt and Khaki pants. He walks over
          to the window, joins Joel, looking down at the employees.

                         JOEL 
          Jesus... They're like a bunch of 
          goddamned children. 

                         BRIAN
          Tell me about it. Sorry I missed
          the drama; I was showing boy-genius
          down there how to back up a
          forklift.
          ANGLE ON Rory, driving the forklift, handing out a flier as 
          he passes someone. 

                         BRIAN (CONT'D)
          That's his whole career, driving
          that damn forklift. You'd think
          he'd wanna learn how.

                         JOEL 
          Well, I guess he's got that band 
          he's in too... 

                         BRIAN
          (disgust at the word

                         "BAND")
          "Band", ugh...

                         (MORE)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          6.

                         BRIAN (CONT'D)
          I'll bet dollars to donuts he sucks
          at that too. Then you got ah...
          (tries to remember her
          name but can't)
          Dinkus down there...

                          JOEL 
          Who, Mary? 

                          BRIAN
          No, the other one -- what's-her-
          face -- she asked me -- or rather
          "axed" me -- for more personal
          days. Just like that. I told her
          maybe if she figures out how to
          fill out the time sheets correctly
          I'll give her more personal days...
          (Off Joel's look)
          Don't worry, she will never fill
          out her time sheets correctly.
          Joel looks down at the production floor. Joel's POV: 
           ANGLE ON: Mary and Step bickering. Step walks off. Mary and 
           Gabrielle shaking their heads and yapping like a couple of 
          old hens. 

          JOEL (O.S.)
          Look at 'em... I am so sick of baby
          sitting these assholes.
          (looks at his watch)
          I better get going...
          Joel leaves in a hurry, mumbling something about 
          "sweatpants." 

          INT. JOEL'S CAR - LATE AFTERNOON

          Joel drives home, in a hurry, checking his dashboard clock.
          It's an upscale neighborhood of McMansions in a town like
          Lincoln Nebraska. He turns a corner, slows down suddenly
          when he sees something.

                         JOEL'S POV:
          NATHAN, a middle-aged, overweight, annoying guy is going out
          to the street to get his mail.

                         JOEL
          (to himself, praying)
          Please go back inside... Please
          just turn around.. .Come on...don't
          notice me...

                         

                         

                         

                         

          7.
          It's too late. Nathan turns, sees Joel's car and waves, then
          crosses the street to Joel's driveway and waits to talk to
          him.

                         JOEL

                         (TO HIMSELF)
          Shit!
          Joel pulls into his driveway as Nathan flags him down. Joel
          begrudgingly rolls down the passenger side window so Nathan
          can talk to him.

                         NATHAN
          Hi there Joel! Glad I caught ya...
          Nathan settles in like he's going to be there a while,
          leaning with his arms folded, hanging inside the car,
          trapping Joel.

                         NATHAN
          How've ya been? I left you a
          message last week. I don't know if
          you got it or not.

                         JOEL
          Yeah, actually Nathan, I'm kind of
          in a hurry here.

                         NATHAN
          Oh yeah? You been busy?

                         JOEL
          Yeah, in fact...
          (checks his watch)
          I should go right now actually. I
          gotta call the office before they
          leave.

                         NATHAN
          Well, real quick while I got ya
          here -- what're you guys doing
          November 17th?

                         JOEL
          Ah, I don't ah...
          (realizes his should fake

                         IT)
          Actually we're going to be out of
          town that weekend.

                         NATHAN
          Oh yeah? Where you going?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          8.

                         JOEL
          Ah...

                         NATHAN
          Oh, wait a minute -- I'm sorry, I
          meant the 7th. Yeah, November 7th.
          You'll be in town then right?

                         JOEL

                         (DEFEATED)
          Ah...Yeah.

                         NATHAN
          Great. There's this dinner Leslie
          and I are going to. It's an annual
          thing -- we do it every year with
          the Rotary Club -- it's for
          charity. It's just a whole lot of
          fun, and we wanted to invite you
          and Suzie to be our guests at our
          table. It's--

                         JOEL
          I'm sorry, I ah... I just don't
          think that's something we're gonna
          want to do.

                         NATHAN
          Really? Why not? It's a lot of
          fun.

                         JOEL
          Oh, I don't know. Suzie doesn't
          really like going to stuff like

                         THAT--

                         NATHAN
          Why not?

                         JOEL
          Well, we wouldn't know anybody
          there. She get's kind of
          uncomfortable.

                         NATHAN
          Oh no -- It's not like that. She
          won't be uncomfortable. I
          guarantee it. No, it's not like
          that at all. It's not formal or
          anything. Trust me. It's just a
          real loose bunch.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          9.

                         JOEL
          I just don't...

                         NATHAN
          I tell you what. Why don't we do
          this -- I'll go ahead and get
          tickets, since they're gonna sell
          out fast. You talk to Suzie. See
          what she says. Like I say, she
          won't be uncomfortable at all.
          Maybe I'll have Leslie give her a
          call -- you know how it is when the
          wives talk, heh heh--
          Joel is about to snap.

                         JOEL
          Um, why don't we talk about this
          later.
          (looks at his watch)
          I gotta make this call before they
          leave.
          Joel pulls away, forcing Nathan to raise off the window sill.

                         JOEL (CONT'D)

                         (CALLING BACK)
          Sorry... I just gotta make this
          call!

          INT. JOEL'S GARAGE - CONTINUOUS

          Joel pulls the car in, steps out and is shocked to see Nathan
          right there in his garage.

                         NATHAN
          Sorry, I almost forgot -- the
          tickets are forty dollars a plate.
          I know that's a little steep, but
          the food is fantastic and it's for
          a good cause. So that'd be eighty
          dollars total. There's no tax or
          anything.

                         JOEL
          Ah, look Nathan, I really gotta get
          inside and make this call. Let's
          talk about this another time.
          Joel has his finger on the button to shut the garage door,
          waiting for Nathan to get out. Nathan stops, just inside.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          10.

                         NATHAN
          Oh, and if you need us to look out
          for the house or anything when you
          go out of town --
          Joel's finger still on the garage door button.

                         NATHAN
          Well, just let us know. Where you
          guys going anyway?

                         JOEL

                         (BULLSHITTING)
          Ah, just sort of a vacation. Look,
          I gotta run.
          Joel hits the button and the door starts going down.

                         NATHAN
          Alright then. We'll see ya.
          Nathan finally steps out of the garage. Joel breaths a huge
          sigh of relief. Then,

          ANGLE ON THE GARAGE DOOR:
          As it gets halfway down, we see Nathan's legs, heading back
          towards the door. Nathan leans down into frame as the door
          goes down.

                         NATHAN
          Oh, Joel one more thing--
          Joel lets the door shut on him, and bolts into the house.

          INT. JOEL'S HOUSE - EVENING

          Joel walks into the living room just as his wife, SUZIE,
          enters from the bedroom pulling on her SWEATPANTS. A look of
          disappointment on Joel's face. Suzie is a decent looking
          woman, about Joel's age.

                         JOEL
          Man, that Nathan won't shut up.

                         SUZIE
          Yeah, what an asshole. I don't
          even go into the front yard
          anymore. That wife of his is even
          worse.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          11.
          Suzie plops down on the couch looking tired and pissed off.
          Joel sits down next to her.

                         SUZIE (CONT'D)
          We gotta get a new pool cleaner.I
          don't think that asshole checked
          the chlorine levels again like I
          asked him too...
          Joel puts his arm around her, caresses her shoulder. She
          doesn't seem to notice as he starts getting fresh.

                         SUZIE (CONT'D)
          .and every time he is here, he
          goes on and on about some problem
          with the goddamn filter, and I have
          no idea what he's talking about...
           Delayed reaction -- she notices Joel is getting frisky. He 
          gets closer, starts kissing her neck.

                          SUZIE (CONT'D)

                         (UNCOMFORTABLE)
          Ah,...Joel?

                         JOEL
          What?

                         SUZIE
          I'm sorry. It's just... I'm a
          little tired, and, I don't know,
          it's the middle of the week...

                         JOEL
          It's not the middle of the week.
          It's Monday. Why can't--

                         SUZIE
          Monday?
          (Freezes, suddenly

                         REALIZING SOMETHING)
          Oh shit!

                         JOEL

                         (WORRIED)
          What?!

                         SUZIE
          Idol!
          Suzie jumps up with newfound energy, runs for the remote and
          turns on the TV. Joel just sits there.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          12.
          Suzie plops down in a Barcalounger.

                         SUZIE (CONT'D)
          Sorry honey. Maybe this weekend.
          Joel leaves the room.

          INT. JOEL'S BATHROOM -- LATER

          [Quick scene of Joel trying to masturbate (off screen of
          course), but he's too distracted by the sounds of a bad out-
          of-tune Idol audition blaring through the wall.] 

          EXT. SCOREBOARDS SPORTS BAR -- NIGHT

          Establishing shot. A sports bar that's part of a Holiday
          Inn.

          INT. SCOREBOARDS -- CONTINUOUS

          Joel sits at the bar. DEAN, the owner of the bar, late
          forties, and an old friend of Joel's, sits behind the bar on
          a stool.

                         JOEL
          I gotta get a house with a bathroom
          that's doesn't share a wall with
          the TV.

                         DEAN
          Why don't you do that in another
          bathroom. You've got three of 'em.

                         JOEL
          It would look suspicious. We never
          use those other bathrooms... Maybe
          if I had some insulation put in...

                         DEAN
          Insulation?... All I know is, you
          shouldn't move man; you've got a
          nice house. I mean you've got the
          American dream really -- you own
          your own company. I can't believe
          you used to bar back for me here,
          and now you've got all that.

                         JOEL
          But what do I have really? It's a
          big pain in the ass.

                         (MORE)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          13.

                         JOEL (CONT'D)
          I'm always working; can't stop or
          the whole place will fall apart.
          And what good does it do me anyway?
          I don't get laid. That stock guy
          with the shitty band that works for
          me probably gets laid more than I
          do.

                         DEAN
          (trying to help)
          Yeah, but he probably lives in a
          crappy apartment.

                         JOEL
          Hell, I'd move into a crappy
          apartment if the bathroom wasn't
          right next to the TV.

          INT. MUSIC STORE - DAY

          CINDY, a girl in her early twenties, is at the counter
          looking at a new Gibson hollow-body electric guitar -- one of
          the really nice ones. The price tag says $3,950. She's
          beautiful and sexy and all that, but there's something
          vulnerable and sweet about her as well.
          Two SALESMEN, typical music store employees -- long-haired,
          goateed, nerdy cocky guitar-hacks are giving her way too much
          attention. It's clear that they don't usually have women
          this hot in their store. They practically stumble over each
          other trying to help her.

                         SALESMAN #1
          Yeah, it's expensive but it's
          sweet... Are you familiar with the
          Gibson humbucking pickups?

                         CINDY
          No, sorry. I don't play. It's for
          my Dad actually -- for his
          fiftieth birthday. My sisters and
          I are all pitching in.

                         SALESMAN #2
          Ah, that's nice... Your Dad would
          love these humbuckings. They
          really kick ass.
          An annoyed MALE CUSTOMER has been waiting behind Cindy,
          trying to get some help, but he might as well be invisible.
          He tries to address Salesman #2, off to the side.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          14.

                         MALE CUSTOMER
          Excuse me... I just have a quick
          question...
          Salesman #2 is oblivious, never takes his eyes off Cindy.

                         SALESMAN #2

                         (OBLIVIOUS)
          So, what kind of music did he play?
          Both Salesmen's eyes are glued to Cindy as Male Customer
          finally gets sick of waiting and storms off into the keyboard
          room.

                         CINDY
          I think he played like, jazz or
          something. I'm not sure.

                         SALESMAN #2
          Well this is an excellent jazz
          guitar. It's what Pat Metheny
          plays.

                         SALESMAN #1
          Is your Dad into Metheny at all?

                         CINDY
          Oh, I don't know who that is.
          Sorry.

                         SALESMAN #2
          He's like, a totally kickass fusion
          guitarist. Are you into fusion?

                         CINDY
          I don't really know much about
          it...

                         SALESMAN #2
          I play fusion guitar so... Just
          curious.

                         CINDY
          Um, do they come in any other
          colors?

                         SALESMAN #1
          You mean different finishes?
          There's a sunburst finish we might
          have in stock.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          15.

                         SALESMAN #2
          Yeah, do you wanna see it? I'll go
          get it.

                         SALESMAN #1
          Or I could go. Whatever.

                         CINDY
          Are you sure?

                         SALESMAN #1/SALESMAN #2
          Oh totally./ No prob!/ I'll show
          you the case it comes with too.
          The salesmen practically trip over each other, going into the
          back to find the other guitar.
          Cindy stands there alone for a beat. She looks around. Then
          casually picks up the four-thousand dollar guitar and walks
          out the front door with it.

          EXT. MUSIC STORE - CONTINUOUS ACTION

           Cindy walks a few yards over to her car, a ' 92 Tercel, puts
           the guitar in the trunk, gets in and takes off.

          INT. MUSIC STORE - CONTINUOUS ACTION

          The two Salesmen return -- one carrying the sunburst-finish
          guitar and the other with the hard-shell case. They look
          around, notice she's gone. They stand there for a beat,
          disappointed, before they realize what just happened.

                         SALESMAN #1
          Oh shit!...

                         (FRANTICALLY LOOKING

                         AROUND)

          THE GIBSON!
          They run out the front door, but Cindy is long gone.

          INT. JOEL'S OFFICE - DAY

          Joel is at his desk. Brian comes in, excited.

                         BRIAN
          You're not gonna believe this.
          Remember the guy from General Mills
          that called a while back? Talking
          like he wanted to buy us out?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          16.

                         JOEL
          I thought you said he wasn't
          serious; he was just sniffing
          around.

                         BRIAN
          Yeah, well he's serious now. He
          just made an offer -- I mean a real
          offer this time.

                         JOEL
          You're kidding.

                         BRIAN
          No. It must be part of some bigger
          strategic move, because it's over
          market value I think.

                         JOEL
          Wow...
          Joel lets it sink in. He walks over to the window, looking
          down on the production floor.

                         JOEL
          I could unload all this... I could
          probably retire...

                         BRIAN
          I mean, yeah, there's a lot of
          details to work out, but this could
          be great. They'll be calling back
          next week, what should I tell them?
          Joel looks down, sees Mary sitting with her arms folded,
          shaking her head.

                         JOEL
          Tell 'em hell yes.

          INT. MANUFACTURING FLOOR - CONTINUOUS

          Mary sits with her arms folded, refusing to hold the line.

                         MARY
          I already warned him. This is the
          last time. I'm just gonna sit
          here.
          In SLOW MOTION, we see:

                         

                         

                         

                         

          17.
          - The first box falls off the end of the assembly line,
          bottles shatter.
          - Rory, carrying some boxes slips on the broken bottles of
          goopey extract, falls and slides into an aisle.
          - A forklift stops suddenly to avoid hitting Rory, causing a
          huge stack of pallets to fall off.
          - Quick shot of Mary shaking her head in slow-motion.
          - Just as Step rounds a corner to see what's going on, the
          pallets land on a bunch of pipes and high-pressure valves
          which burst open sending a piece of shrapnel flying across
          the room heading straight for
          - STEP'S CROTCH. The shrapnel heads straight for his
          genitalia, as we

                         CUT TO:

          EXT. REYNOLD'S EXTRACT BUILDING - DAY

          Step is on a stretcher being loaded into a MEDIVAC helicopter
          by a couple of EMS guys. Step moans in pain as Joel tries to
          comfort him. A small crowd of employees watch.
          ANGLE ON Mary in the crowd, shaking her head.

                         MARY
          I knew it. That's what happens
          when you don't pay attention.

          INT. SCOREBOARDS -- LATER

          Joel sits at the bar, on a cell phone. Dean sits behind the
          bar on a stool.

                         JOEL
          (to the person on the

                         PHONE)
          Uh-huh... Alright. Let me know if
          you hear anything else.
          He hangs up, talks to Dean.

                         JOEL (CONT'D)
          Well, he's definitely lost one of
          'em. They think they might be able
          to re-attach the other one, but
          they're not sure.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          18.

                         DEAN
          (shaking his head)
          Wow...

                         JOEL
          Yeah... I'm not sure how it
          happened, but we have a great
          safety record and we comply with
          all the safety codes so... it was
          just a freak accident. There'll be
          an investigation of some kind I'm
          sure.

                         DEAN
          Well, you have insurance for that
          kind of thing, right?

                         JOEL
          Oh yeah. Of course. In fact,
          he'll probably get a huge
          settlement.

                         DEAN
          Yeah. I would think so. I mean,
          it's your balls...
          Beat, as they contemplate the profundity of it.

                         JOEL
          Boy it really makes you stop and
          think about how fragile we are --
          especially our balls. They're just
          hanging there in a little sack
          between our legs. At any moment
          they could be cut off forever.

                         DEAN
          Yeah. And your balls are really
          important man. Your balls are
          everything. What kind of life would
          you have with no testicles? Can you
          imagine that shit?

                         JOEL
          Yeah...
          Beat.

                         JOEL (CONT'D)
          You know Dean, my life wouldn't be
          much different than it is now
          actually.

                         (MORE)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          19.

                         JOEL (CONT'D)
          Except for once every three months
          when I have sex with my wife. In
          fact, I might even be better off...

                         DEAN
          Wait. Three months? I thought you
          said it was once a month.

                         JOEL
          I did? I must've been lying. I
          don't know... Maybe things'll get
          better when I sell the company.
          I'll be around more...

                         DEAN
          Well, I hope so. That would
          suck... I get laid all the time.
          (off Joel's reaction)
          Sorry.

                         JOEL
          Ah, it's all right...

                         (THINKS)
          Actually, it sucks.

                         DEAN
          Yeah, sexual frustration is bad
          news... You know what you oughtta
          do?

                         JOEL
          What?

                         DEAN
          Get some Xanax.

                         JOEL
          Xanax? Isn't that for anxiety?

                         DEAN
          Yeah it is, but I find it's good
          for just about any phsychological
          problem. I mean, basically it just
          makes you feel good, so it sort of
          works for anything. I even take it
          when I have a cold. It's probably
          great for sexual frustration. Want
          me to get you some?

                         JOEL
          No.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          20.

                         DEAN
          You know what else is good?
          Codeine cough syrup.

                         JOEL
          For what?

                         DEAN
          It's just good.
          Joel looks at Dean for a beat.

                         JOEL (CONT'D)
          Are you on something now?

                         DEAN
          No... Well, I guess I took some
          Vicodin this morning. But that was
          just 'cause I was hung-over.

          EXT. PAWN SHOP - DAY

          Establishing shot, a pawn shop in a strip mall. Cindy's car
          parked out in front.

          INT. PAWN SHOP - CONTINUOUS

          Cindy is at the counter, the Gibson guitar we saw earlier is
          in front of her. A PAWN SHOP GUY is counting out money. He
          pauses, looks around, then speaks sympathetically to her.

          PAWN SHOP GUY
          Um, you know, I'm really not
          supposed to say this... but since
          this belonged to your father, and
          since he passed away and all...

                         (QUIETLY)
          You could probably get a better
          deal at a music store.

                         CINDY
          Oh, that's okay. Thanks. But I
          just kind of wanna get it over
          with, you know? It's kind of hard
          for me.

          PAWN SHOP GUY
          I understand.
          He looks around to see if his boss is watching, then counts
          off a FEW MORE TWENTIES, feeling sorry for her.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          21.
           PAWN SHOP GUY (cont'd)
          Here.

          INT. CINDY'S CAR - MOMENTS LATER

          Cindy puts the money in her wallet, along with a driver's
          license.

          CLOSE ON THE WALLET.
          Cindy shuffles through three or four different driver's
          licenses. On one, her name says MISTY PATTERSON. It's a
          Kansas license. She takes another one out from Colorado,
          with the name CINDY METZLER on it and puts that in front,
          then puts the wallet away.
          A newspaper sits on the front seat. Something grabs her
          attention.

          ANGLE ON THE NEWSPAPER:
          We see an article about Step's accident. There's a picture
          of Step being taken away on the stretcher.
          Cindy starts reading the article, with growing interest.

                         CINDY'S POV:
          She scans the article, zeroing in on certain words,
          ".. .potentially big settlement..." "...no testicles..."
          "several million dollars" then back to "no testicles" then
          quickly back and forth several times -- "million dollars" "no
          testicles" "million dollars" "no testicles"
          ON CINDY'S FACE - A look of determination. She looks one
          more time at the name under the picture -- Don "Step"
          Wilkenson, then zeroes in on the words "Reynold's Extract."
          She starts the car and speeds away.

          INT. REYNOLD'S EXTRACT BUILDING - CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

          Joel sits with Brian. Brian has a clipboard, going over the 
          day's business. 

                         BRIAN
          So obviously Step's not coming back
          anytime soon. I had to hire a
          couple temps. Is that okay?

                         JOEL 
          Yeah, sure. How is Step? 

                         

                         

                         

                         

          22.

                         BRIAN
          Better. They say he's going home
          in a couple of days. Speaking of
          which, the guys at General Mills
          heard about this whole Step thing.
          They're worried. If Step decides
          to sue us -- beyond the insurance
          settlement -- it could be a serious
          liability. They don't want to make
          an offer until this thing has
          settled.

                         JOEL 
          Really? They think it's that big 
          of a liability? 

                         BRIAN
          Well yeah. Don't you? I mean,
          think about it. Imagine if you
          asked a bunch of jurors how much
          you'd have to pay 'em to cut their
          balls off? I mean, I wouldn't let
          someone cut my balls off for a
          billion dollars. Seriously --
          unless there were some kind of
          really expensive operation that
          could give you artificial balls or
          something. Would you?

                         JOEL 
          No, I guess not. 

                         BRIAN
          Anyway, I wouldn't worry. He says
          he's not going to sue us. Says he

                         (CRUDE IMITATION)
          "don't want somethin' fer nothin "'
          and "What's right is right." If we
          can just get him to sign something
          to that effect we should be fine.

                         JOEL 
          Boy, Step sure is being mellow 
          about all this. 

                         BRIAN
          Yeah, well I think when you lose
          your balls it mellows you out. You
          don't get as pissed off and
          aggressive about things. I know
          it's true for horses, and bulls.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          23.

                         JOEL
          Boy, it sure does make you think.. 

                         BRIAN 
          Oh, by the way, guess who asked for 
          a raise today? 

                         JOEL 
          Who? 

                         BRIAN

                         (GESTURES INDISCRIMINATELY
          to someone downstairs)
          Dinkus. Can you believe that?

                         JOEL
          Brian, you call everyone here
          "Dinkus." I don't know who you're
          talking about.

                         BRIAN 
          You know, Forklift-Dinkus? 

                         JOEL 
          Oh... I thought you call him "boy- 
          genius." 

                         BRIAN
          Yeah, well boy-genius asked for a
          raise. I said, "are you kidding?
          You nearly got someone killed last
          week," and then he blamed it on
          Dinkus over there.

                         JOEL 
          You know Brian, you really ought to 
          learn the employees' names. 

                         BRIAN
          Well, I was thinking about that,
          but hey, if this deal goes through
          next week, I won't have to. It's
          not like I'm gonna be inviting
          Dinkus and Boy-Genius over for
          dinner.

          INT. JOEL'S OFFICE - NEXT DAY

          Joel stands on one side of his office looking down through a
          long window overlooking the manufacturing area. Dean comes
          in, walks over to the window, looks down at the production
          floor with Joel.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          24.

                         DEAN
          Hey man. What's goin' o-- Whoa!
           DEAN'S POV: It's CINDY, now working down on the floor, on
          the assembley line.

                          DEAN (CONT'D)
          Damn! Who's she? Is she new?

                         JOEL
          Yeah. She's a temp.

                         DEAN
          She's a tramp?

                         JOEL
          No a temp. Quit staring.

                         DEAN
          Damn, she's hot! Way to go.

                         JOEL
          Hey, I didn't hire her. She came
          here through Manpower, like
          everybody else. They just sent her
          over.

                         DEAN
          Manpower, huh? Maybe I should give
          them a call. You don't usually
          have girls anywhere near that hot
          working here. What's the deal?

                         JOEL
          Yeah, I know. I guess it makes
          sense though if you think about it.
          Hot girls need a job just as much
          as anyone else.

                         DEAN
          (thinks for a second)
          Do they really?... Huh... You just
          don't see 'em here. Usually your
          temps look like winos. And they're
          guys.

                         JOEL
          You wanna hear something really
          weird?

                         DEAN
          What?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          25.

                         JOEL
          She came on to me.

                         DEAN
          No way! Really?

                         JOEL
          Yeah. I mean, I'm pretty sure. I
          could be wrong, but...

                         DEAN
          Hey, I'm sure she did. Are you
          kidding? You could have any girl
          down there.

                         JOEL
          I don't know about that.

                         DEAN
          I'm serious. Dude, you're the big
          shot here. You're the king of...
          What do you call that shit you make
          here again?

                         JOEL
          Extract. And spray-dried
          flavoring, and we're branching out

                         INTO--

                         DEAN
          Yeah, you're the Extract King man.
          You could have any girl here. I
          mean, I wouldn't want most of 'em,
          but her... Way to go Joel.
          Dean looks down at manufacturing area, taking it all in.

                          DEAN (CONT'D)
          So how did she come on to you?

                         JOEL
          Well, first she started asking me
          about what happened to Step and all
          that stuff -- you know, just sort
          of making conversation?

                         DEAN
          Yeah.

                         JOEL
          But it really seemed like she was
          flirting with me, you know?

                         (MORE)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          26.

                         JOEL (CONT'D)
          Then, she just sort of asked me
          out... I think.

                         DEAN
          Really? How?

                         JOEL
          Well, you see that guy down there
          by the fork lift?
          ANGLE ON Rory, the indi-rock guy with tattoos, etc.

                          JOEL (CONT'D)
          His band is playing somewhere, at
          some party this weekend, and she
          asked me if I wanted to go with
          her.

                         DEAN
          Wow. So, you gonna do anything
          about it?

                         JOEL
          What? No. No way. I couldn't
          live with myself if I cheated on
          Suzie... It'd be nice if I got
          laid at home once in a while
          though...

                         DEAN
          (still staring at her)
          Man, she is fine. You mind if I
          hit that then?
          Beat.

                         JOEL
          Yeah, I do sort of...
          We see a COMMOTION down on the floor. Mary runs out of the
           Women's locker room SCREAMING AND YELLING.

                         ACTION
          Mary runs over to where Hector is working, hysterical.

                         MARY
          My purse is stolen! It's gone!
          (pointing at Hector)
          He did it! He stole my purse!

          Brian runs over and stands between them, trying to calm Mary
          down, but she keeps ranting. Hector looks confused and
          worried.

                         BRIAN
          Now hold on--

                         MARY
          I won't hold on! I'll call the
          cops!

          What? I don'... No comprende...

          Espera un momento Hector. Tu sabes
          donde esta su... uh, purse?
          ANGLE ON CINDY, watching the whole thing-- completely
          unfazed.Joel rushes in.

                         JOEL
          Now wait a second. Calm down Mary.
          How do you know it was stolen?

                         MARY
          It's gone! That's how.

                         JOEL
          Well, what did it look like.

                         MARY
          It was black with a fur, leopard
          style border...

          INT. CINDY'S CAR - AFTERNOON

          Cindy sits in her parked car, going through the purse Mary
          just described. She takes some cash, puts it in her pocket,
          then finds what she's looking for -- the address book.

          ANGLE ON ADDRESS BOOK.
          Cindy turns to the Ws and finds Step Wilkenson. She notes
          his address. She starts the car and takes off.

          EXT. STREET IN FRONT OF STEP'S HOUSE - A LITTLE LATER

          Cindy sits and waits, listening to the radio. It's a very
          blue-collar neighborhood. She's about three houses away from
          Step's house, keeping an eye on it.
          After a beat, Step limps out of the house, walks over to his
          pickup truck, painfully gets in, and leaves. Cindy starts
          the car and follows from a distance.

          INT. GROCERY STORE - A LITTLE LATER

          Step wheels his shopping cart into one of the checkout lines.
          He uses the cart as a crutch to help him walk. Cindy gets in
          line behind him. She only has one item, a bottle of
          Reynold's Orange Extract. Step notices her.

                         STEP
          You can go ahead of me if that's
          all you have.

                         (SWEETLY)
          Thank you so much.
          (holds up extract bottle)
          I can't believe I'm buying this
          stuff -- I work at the factory.

                         STEP
          Really? I work there too. Or, ah,
          I used to.

                         CINDY
          Really? You're kidding! I just
          started there. What's your name?

                         STEP
          I go by Step. Yeah, I'm the
          fastest sorter there...

          Joel enters the living room. He first sees the sweatpants,
          then sees Suzie is sound asleep on the couch. He sighs, then
          turns and leaves.

          INT. SCOREBOARDS SPORTS BAR -- NIGHT

          Joel sits at the bar talking to Dean. Joel is drinking some
          kind of hard liquor, getting a buzz.

                         JOEL
          I'm sick of it Dean. I'm sick of
          being turned down in my own house
          by my own wife. We're turning into
          one of those brother-sister
          couples.

                         DEAN
          Huh...Now that you mention it, you
          guys kind of look alike too.

                         JOEL

                         (GROSSED OUT)
          No we don't!

                         DEAN
          Okay.

                         JOEL
          (takes a drink)
          Maybe things will be better after I
          sell the company... Or maybe it's
          just going to mean more time to sit
          around and contemplate not getting
          laid.
          Dean nods sympathetically.

                         DEAN
          What about that girl at work? She
          still into you?

                         JOEL
          Yeah... she was really coming on to
          me. She gave me her phone number
          and everything. Told me to call
          her if I wanted to go to that
          party. Can you believe that? And
          there's nothing I can do about it,
          but just be sexually frustrated.

                         DEAN
          I've got some Xanax if you want it.
          Like I say, that always works for
          me.

                         JOEL
          No thanks...

                         DEAN
          Well maybe you should call that
          girl.

                         JOEL
          No, I can't. I can't cheat on
          Suzie. I just gotta power through
          it until I'm so old that I can't
          get it up anymore.

                         DEAN
          What about if Suzie cheated on you?

                         JOEL
          Hmm... I hadn't even thought of
          that...

                         (BEAT)
          I wish she would.

                         DEAN
          You wish she would cheat on you?
          Wouldn't that bother you?
          Joel thinks about it.

                         JOEL
          No. I don't think it would
          actually.
          (occuring to him)
          I guess that's weird huh?

                         DEAN
          Yeah, it's a little weird. Sort
          of.

                         JOEL
          But see, then I could do something
          about all this sexual frustration,
          without feeling guilty about it.

                         DEAN
          Do you think she would cheat on
          you?

                         JOEL
          Nah...

                         DEAN
          You sure?

                         (CONSIDERS IT)
          Well, I don't know. Hmm... Maybe
          if she were really tempted she
          would. Like if some really studly
          guy came on to her.

                         DEAN
          So you're saying she would probably
          cheat on you if she was put in
          temptation's way?

                         JOEL
          Yeah, maybe.

                         DEAN
          You know what you oughtta do?

                         JOEL

                         (WEARY)
          I don't wanna do any drugs Dean.

                         DEAN
          No, no. Check this out -- If you
          really wish your wife would cheat
          on you, it's not that hard to make
          it happen.

                         JOEL
          How?

                         DEAN
          Hire a gigolo to have an affair
          with your wife.

                         JOEL
          What?

                         DEAN
          I'm serious. I know a guy.

                         JOEL

                         (INCREDULOUS)
          You know a gigolo?

                         DEAN
          Yeah.

                         JOEL
          How do you know a gigolo?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          32.

                         DEAN
          This guy Brad. He comes in here
          all the time. He's a friend of
          Vic's. You could hire him to have
          an affair with Suzie.

                         JOEL
          Come on Dean.

                         DEAN
          Why not? You said you wouldn't
          care if she cheated on you. Then
          you'd be free to go out with that
          Cindy chick and get your ya-yas out
          -- with no guilt. Problem solved.
          (proud of himself)
          Man, what a great idea.
          Joel just shakes his head at the whole thing.

                         JOEL
          You know, maybe I will try some of
          that Xanax.
          Dean reaches down under the cash register and whips out a
          little box and pulls out a pill.

          EXT. LAKE -- SAME TIME

          Step's truck is parked out at a lake in the country. He and
          Cindy sit next to each other on the tailgate, looking at the
          stars, talking.

                         STEP
          I just believe that what's
          right is right.

                         CINDY
          That's right Step, and what's right
          is for you to send a message.

                         STEP
          A message?

                         CINDY
          You need to send a message so that
          a horrible accident like this never
          happens to anyone else ever again.
          That's what's right. And the way
          you do that is to take them to
          court.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          33.

                         STEP
          You think?

                         CINDY
          Yes Step... That's why I called a
          lawyer for you -- that guy on all
          the bus stop benches.

                         STEP
          Joe Adler?

                         (TOUCHED)
          You did that for me?

                         CINDY
          Mmm hmm... I just want you to do
          what's right Step.
          They start cuddling, kissing. Cindy pulls away.

                         CINDY
          I'm sorry Step, your doctor said
          you shouldn't get aroused.

                         STEP
          No he didn't.

                         CINDY
          Maybe it was your lawyer, but he
          talked to your doctor. And your
          doctor said it's very important not
          to get aroused until after the
          trial... I'm sorry.

                         STEP
          That's okay... You're so good to me
          Cindy.
          They start cuddling again.

                         CINDY
          Look Step, you're getting me turned
          on, I'm getting you turned on... I
          better just go.

          INT. SCOREBOARDS SPORTS BAR -- LATER

          Joel is starting to look really tweaked as the drug-alcohol
          combination begins to kick in.
          Dean is examining a pill under the cash register light,
          trying to read the small print. He looks concerned.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          34.

                         DEAN
          Shit... Do you remember what color
          that pill I gave you was?

                         JOEL
          Huh?

                         DEAN
          Damn. I don't think it was Xanax.
          I think that might've been
          Ritalin... Or "Special K."

                         JOEL
          (feeling the buzz)
          Ah, who cares?

                         DEAN
          It's just that, ah, Special K is a
          horse tranquilizer, kinda has a
          weird effect when people take it
          but... well, don't worry about
          it... You might not want to drink
          too much more though.

                         JOEL
          (beginning to slur his

                         SPEECH)
          You know that thing you were
          talking about? About the gigolo?

                         DEAN
          Yeah?

                         JOEL
          Do you think it would be wrong to
          do that? I mean morally wrong?

                         DEAN
          (with full authority)
          Oh nooo. Definitely not. What
          could be morally wrong about it?

                         JOEL
          I don't know...

                         DEAN
          Look, if she doesn't want to go for
          it, she doesn't have to. And if
          she does, then she's the one who
          sinned, and then it's perfectly
          morally right for you to go out and
          boff whoever you want.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          35.

                         JOEL

                         (SLURRED SPEECH)
          Yeah, I guess you're right. I
          can't think of anything morally
          wrong about it either.
          Beat.

                         JOEL
          And this guy, he's a friend of
          yours? What's his name?

                         DEAN
          Brad. You want me to give him a
          call?

                         JOEL
          I don't know. It's kinda weird
          even talking about it.

                         DEAN
          Look, this is no big deal Joel.
          I'm serious.

                         JOEL
          Really?

                         DEAN
          Yeah. I mean, you can't lose. Just
          say you're hiring him to come clean
          the pool or something. See what
          happens. If she doesn't go for it,
          then at least you know you're doing
          the right thing by being faithful.

                         JOEL
          Yeah, I guess you're right... I
          don't know. It's crazy.
          Dean pours Joel another drink.

                         DEAN
          Look. Have another drink. Think
          about it... You know what? Why
          don't I just call Brad and see what
          he has to say?

                         JOEL
          Alright. What the hell.
          Joel takes a big swig of liquor.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          36.

           INT. SCOREBOARDS SPORTS BAR - BACK OFFICE -- NIGHT

           Dean and Joel are talking with BRAD, the gigolo. He's young,
           blonde, super good-looking, but clearly a complete airhead.
          Joel looks really messed up now.

                         JOEL
          So it's two-hundred dollars then?

                         BRAD
          Yeah, two-hundred.

                         DEAN
          Well yeah, but don't forget, I'm
          getting ten percent.

                         JOEL
          What, so you're a pimp now?

                         DEAN

                         (CONDESCENDING CHUCKLE)
          I don't think they're called
          "pimps" when it's with male
          prostitutes, okay. There's some
          other word for it -- it's not a
          "john," but it's something like
          that. Besides, I'm the one who
          hooked all this up. And don't worry
          'cuz it's coming out of Brad's
          money anyway.

                         JOEL
          Alright, alright.

                         (TO BRAD)
          So it's two-hundred dollars then?

                         DEAN
          Two-hundred and twenty.

                         JOEL
          Wait a minute--

                         BRAD
          Um, I have a question?

                         JOEL
          Yeah?
          Brad looks at Joel, deeply concerned.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          37.

                         BRAD
          So like, are you gonna, like, watch
          or something?

                         JOEL
          No no no. God no! It's not like
          that. I won't even be there. I'll
          be at work. Remember? We already
          talked about this.
          Brad looks blank, like he's not getting it.

                         JOEL
          What you'll do, is come to my house
          pretending to be the new pool
          cleaner. Then you simply try to
          seduce my wife. Okay? If she
          doesn't respond, you simply clean
          the pool and leave. That's all.
          It's that simple.
          Hold on Brad for a long beat.

                         BRAD
          So, uh, you're not gonna touch my
          ass or anything...?

                         JOEL
          NO! Try to pay attention okay? I
          will not be there. I will be at
          work. You come over to my house
          while I'm not there, posing as the
          new pool cleaner and then try to
          seduce her...
          Brad finally makes a breakthrough.

                         BRAD
          Oooh, I see. Sorry man. Yeah,
          yeah. I get it now. You're not
          even gonna be there...

                         JOEL
          Yeah, that's right.

                         BRAD
          Yeah... cool. No problem. This is
          gonna be great!

                         JOEL
          Remember, she might not go for it--
          Brad starts to get a little too excited.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          38.

                         BRAD
          Yeah, this is gonna be cool! I can
          hardly wait! Awesome. Hey man, if
          you know anyone else who needs --
          you know -- what I do, like you
          know, lonely housewives and shit,
          maybe you could tell 'em about me,
          you know...
          Joel looks on with growing concern as Brad can't seem to stop
          talking.

                         BRAD
          Cuz like, I figure if I did a
          few jobs and I was, like, really
          good? Then maybe they'd tell their
          friends, you know, and they'd give
          me a... what do you call those
          things?

                         DEAN
          Referrals.

                         BRAD
          Yeah yeah, those things. Then
          those women could tell more women
          and then it'd be like I was, like,
          uh... branching or..

                         DEAN
          Networking.

                         BRAD
          Yeah, networking! Totally. Then
          if I got enough of 'em, maybe I
          could quit my landscaping job and
          do this full time. That would be
          awesome! Cause I hate landscaping.
          I like getting laid a lot better,
          and my boss is a total dick...

          EXT. SCOREBOARDS' PARKING LOT -- NIGHT

          Joel and Dean are at Dean's car, trying to say goodbye to
          Brad, who still won't shut up.

                         BRAD
          Like I say, if your wife has any
          housewife friends who might--
          Dean finally puts his foot down.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          39.

                         DEAN
          Okay, you've said that a few times
          now Brad. Go on to your car.
          Okay?

                         BRAD
          Alright. Cool. Like I say--

                         DEAN
          Goodnight Brad.

                         BRAD
          Okay. See you later.
          Brad finally leaves.

                         DEAN
          Let me drive you home. You're in
          no condition to drive.
          Joel stumbles into Dean's car.

                         JOEL
          Are you sure about this guy Dean?
          He acts like he's never done this
          before.

                         DEAN
          Oh no. He does it all the time.
          Don't worry. He just gets a little
          excited sometimes. He's cool.

                         JOEL
          I don't know. He sure doesn't seem
          too bright.

                         DEAN
          Yeah well, what do you excpect?
          He's a whore.

                          DISSOLVE TO:

          INT. REYNOLDS EXTRACT - EMPLOYEE BREAK ROOM - NEXT MORNING

          A break room with a kitchen. Joel is badly hungover. He
          looks like he's about to throw up as he reaches into the
          cupboard above the sink, downs a couple of aspirin, then
          drops some alka-seltzer in to a glass of water. Cindy comes
          in.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          40.

                         CINDY
          Looks like you had one of those
          nights.

                         (FLIRTATIOUS)
          Where was I?
          Joel nods, tries to grin and look cool as he takes a sip of
          his alkaseltzer. Then his eyes go wide, he almost does a
          spit-take as something suddenly dawns on him...

                         JOEL
          Oh shit!
          He runs out of the room.

                         CUT TO:

          INT. JOEL'S OFFICE

          Joel grabs the phone and dials frantically. Dean answers.

                          JOEL
           Dean?

           DEAN (V.0.)

                         (WAKING UP)
          Oh, hey Joel.

                         JOEL
          Thank God you're home. Ah,... did
          that really happen last night? I
          mean, did we go through with it --
          with that gigolo stuff?

                         DEAN
          Ah, yeah. As far as I know.

                         JOEL
          Shit! What was I thinking?! We
          gotta call it off. Right now. Can
          you call that guy, Brad?

                         DEAN
          Okay...

                         JOEL
          Tell him I'll pay him anyway,
          whatever, just don't come over.
          God, what was I thinking?!

                         

                         

                         

                         

          41.

                         DEAN
          Sure, I'll call him. No problem...
          Oh wait a second. I don't think I
          have his number.

                         JOEL
          What? I thought you called him
          last night.

                         DEAN
          Yeah, but I got his number from
          Vic.

                         JOEL
          Well get it from him again.

                         DEAN
          Vic doesn't have a phone right now.

                         JOEL
          Shit! I'll try information.
          What's Brad's last name?
          Pause.

                         DEAN
          Hmm... it's something like,... I
          think it's a Mexican name.

                         JOEL

                         (LOSING PATIENCE)
          Mexican?! The guy's got blonde
          hair and blue eyes!

                         DEAN
          Yeah, I thought it was weird too --
          a guy like that with a Mexican last
          name... It's like Lopez, or Sanchez
          or something.
          Joel looks at his watch. It's 11:15.

                         JOEL
          Shit!
          Joel hangs up the phone, and rushes out the door.

          INT. RECEPTIONIST DESK IN FRONT OF JOEL'S OFFICE --


                         CONTINUOUS ACTION
          Brian walks in.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          42.

                         BRIAN

                         (CONCERNED)
          Joel, we gotta talk.

                         JOEL
          Not now Brian.

                         BRIAN
          Ah yeah, it's kind of important --
          kind of really important. It's

                         ABOUT STEP-
          Joel rushes past him.

                         JOEL
          Not now!
          We FOLLOW Joel as he rushes past his SECRETARY.

                         SECRETARY
          Excuse me Joel? There's a Brad
          Chavez on line one for you.

                         JOEL
          I can't, I--
          Joel stops suddenly.

                         JOEL
          Who?

                         SECRETARY
          Brad Chavez. He said he's done
          with the job you guys talked about
          at your house? Do you want me to
          take a message?
          Joel looks pale.

                          JOEL
           Um, no... He's the ah, pool
           cleaner. I better take that.
          Joel goes back in his office. HOLD on Brian, confused.

          INT. JOEL'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

          Joel stares at the phone for a beat then picks it up.

                         JOEL
          Hello?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          43.

          BRAD (V.0.)
          Hey, is this Joel?

                         JOEL
          Yes.

          BRAD (V.0.)
          Hey, it's Brad. Mission
          accomplished dude.

                         JOEL
          What do you mean?

          BRAD (V.0.)
          I mean it worked. She totally went
          for it.

                         JOEL
          What? What're you...?
          (looks at his watch)
          You weren't even supposed to be
          there for another 45 minutes.

          BRAD (V.0.)
          Oh really? I forgot what time you
          guys said, and I was so excited
          about it, I just went over there.
          Joel sits down, freaked out.

                         JOEL
          (reality setting in)
          So you mean she actually ah... you
          guys...?

          BRAD (V.0.)
          Yup. It was easy.

                         JOEL

                         (AGITATED)
          Easy? What do you mean "easy"?

          BRAD (V.0.)
          Oh, I don't mean easy like she was
          easy -- like she was a slut or
          anything. I just mean it wasn't
          hard to get her to... Never mind.

                         JOEL
          No. Tell me. Tell me how it
          happened.

                         (BRACES HIMSELF)
          I wanna hear everything.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          44.

                         BRAD
          You sure?

                         JOEL
          Yeah.

          BRAD (V.0.)
          Okay. Well, she let me in, so I
          went back like I was cleaning the
          pool...

          EXT. JOEL'S HOUSE - POOL -- DAY

           As Brad's dopey narration continues, we see the story he's
           telling. It plays out like a bad soft-porn flick on Cinemax.
           We see Brad wiping the side of the pool with a rag.

           BRAD (V.0.)
           .I don't know anything about pool
           cleaning, so I was just faking it.
           She was in her bathing suit...
          Suzie comes out and lies on one of the reclining chairs.

           BRAD (V.0.)
          .So I struck up a conversation...

                         BRAD
          This is a really nice house.

                         SUZIE
          Thanks.

                         BRAD
          Is it your Dad's house?

                         SUZIE
          No. It's ours.

                         BRAD
          Wow, you look so young to be living
          in a house this nice.

                         SUZIE
          Oh, thanks.
          Beat.

                         BRAD
          Do you have any sunscreen? I
          forgot mine.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          45.
          Brad's dopey narration comes back in...

          BRAD (V.0.)
          I thought that was pretty smart
          of me -- to ask her to borrow
          sunscreen. See, 'cuz that way,
          once she gave me some, I could ask
          her if she wanted some too, and rub
          some on her back, instead of just
          coming out and asking her to rub
          some on her. Pretty smooth huh?...
          We see Brad rubbing lotion on Suzie's back as she lies face-
          down on the chair.

          BRAD (V.0.)
          Once I was rubbing the sunscreen on
          her, the rest was easy...
          We see Brad's hands working their way down Suzie's back.
          Just as they start to move down towards her butt, Joel
          interrupts, YANKING US OUT OF THE FLASHBACK.

                         JOEL
          Okay that's enough! Stop!

          INT. JOEL'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS


                         JOEL
          I don't need to hear anymore.

          BRAD (V.0.)
          Okay, cool. Hey, like I say, if
          you know of anyone else, or if you
          ever need me to do it again--

                         JOEL
          NO! No. Look, I gotta go. Bye.
          Joel hangs up the phone and falls back into his chair, in a
          state of shock.

                         JOEL
          (quietly, to himself)
          Holy shit.

          INT. JOEL'S CAR - LATE AFTERNOON

          Joel drives home from work. He still looks freaked out. He
          notices something ahead, and suddenly SLAMS ON THE BREAKS.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          46.

                         JOEL
          Dammit !
          JOEL'S POV: Nathan, the guy across the street is in his front
          yard, puttering around with the mail.

                         JOEL

                         (TO HIMSELF)
          No... not today...
           Joel puts the car in reverse, starts to pull behind a parked
           car in an attempt to hide, but Nathan notices him, waves and
           crosses the street. Joel reluctantly pulls ahead to his
          driveway.

                         NATHAN
          How's it goin'?

                         JOEL
          Oh, I'm kind of busy actually.

                         NATHAN
          Yeah. Well I won't keep you. I
          just wanted to let you know, I got
          those tickets to that dinner we
          talked about on the 7th. I think I
          told you they were forty dollars a
          piece, but it turns out it's a tad
          more this year -- fifty-five -- so
          if I could go ahead and just get a
          check from you guys...

                         JOEL
          Look, ah, we can't go. Remember?

                         NATHAN
          No, this is the 7th. You said
          you're going out of town on the
          17th.

                         JOEL
          Yeah, but remember, I told you we
          didn't really want to go to this
          thing.
          Nathan looks dumbfounded. Joel is about to snap.

                         NATHAN
          But I already bought the tickets.
          I know you said something about her
          feeling uncomfortable, but, like I
          say, she won't feel uncomfortable
          at all -- I guarantee it.

                         (MORE)

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         47

                         NATHAN (CONT'D)
          It's just a whole lot of fun. You
          guys'll have a great time.

                         JOEL
          Look, I gotta get going.

                         NATHAN
          Alright then...
          Joel starts to pull away.

                         NATHAN (CONT'D)
          Oh, one more thing --
          Joel just keeps driving, almost knocking Nathan over.

          INT. JOEL'S HOUSE - EVENING

          Joel and Suzie are eating dinner. Suzie has a glow about
          her, looking better than ever -- relaxed, satisfied, etc.
          Joel's has a quietly pissed off demeanor. They eat in
          silence for a beat.

                         SUZIE
          So... How's work?

                         JOEL
          It sucks.

                         SUZIE
          Really? What's wrong?

                         JOEL
          Nothing.
          Suzie looks a little puzzled. They keep eating in silence
          for a beat.

                         JOEL
          I don't feel well. I'm going to
          bed.

          INT. REYNOLD'S EXTRACT BUILDING - JOEL'S OFFICE - DAY

          From the window in his office, Joel watches Cindy working
          down on the production floor. Cindy looks up, they make eye
          contact for a brief moment. She gives him a flirtacious wave.
          Joel waves back. Then Rory comes by, starts talking to
          Cindy.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          48.

          INT. REYNOLD'S EXTRACT /MANUFACTURING AREA - CONTINOUS


                         CINDY
          So you're in a band?

                         RORY
          .Actually, I'm in five bands
          right now. But Godscock is
          basically the same four guys as
          Fighthead, but Fighthead's more of
          a thrash/skatepunk thing. Godscock
          is more melodic stuff.
          Cindy nods politely. Rory thinks she's interested.

                         RORY (CONT'D)
          So you comin' Friday?

                         CINDY
          Yeah, definitely.
          (looks at her watch)
          Ooh, I gotta go. Dentist
          appointment.

                         RORY
          Cool.
          Cindy leaves.
          ANGLE ON Mary, on the other side of the room, watching them.
          She talks to Gabriella.

                         MARY
          See, there he goes again, slowing
          us down.

                         (RE: CINDY)
          Now she's a good sorter. They need
          to hire more people like her.

                         GABRIELLA
          She's so nice too.
          Hector walks by. Mary just shakes her head.

                         MARY
          I can't believe he's still working
          here. You know Silvia can't find
          her wallet. Thinks it was stolen.
          And guess who was in the locker
          room last? Hector.
          They both look at Hector and shake their heads in disgust.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          49.

                         MARY
          You know, I could get a job at
          Southwest Airlines. My Niece works
          there. I'd get better benefits
          than we get here too.

                         GABRIELLE
          Mmm hmm. I could get a job at
          Gemco. You think they would put up
          with this stuff at Gemco? Mmm mmn.
          They run a tight ship.

                         MARY
          That's right.

          INT. JOEL'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

          Joel's POV of Mary and Gabrielle, yacking self-righteously.
          Joel looks on with disgust...

                         JOEL

                         (TO HIMSELF)
          Good riddance...
          Brian steps in, taps on the door.

                         BRIAN
          You got a second? I think we might
          have a big problem here. I'm not
          sure what happened, but all of the
          sudden Step says he doesn't want to
          settle anymore. I think he
          might've talked to a lawyer.
          Joel goes to his desk, sits down.

                         BRIAN
          Like I say, General Mills isn't
          going to make their offer official
          until this settles.
          Joel considers this.

                         JOEL
          I think Step is just chest-beating.
          He does this all the time. He gets
          all wound up, talks big, then he
          always backs down. And that's with
          his balls.

          INT. PAROLE OFFICE - AFTERNOON

          It's a bleak looking office with rows of cubicles. We PAN
          past several cubicles where hardass parole officers meet with
          their parolees -- various gang-bangers, drug dealers,
          junkies, a hideous transvestite prostitute, etc. As we pan,
          each officer is giving them nothing -- "this is your last
          chance," "You expect me to believe that?", etc. We continue
          past officers giving them nothing, giving them nothing,
          ending on a cubicle with Cindy, where a PAROLE OFFICER is
          giving Cindy everything -- almost apologetic.

                         PAROLE OFFICER
          I'm sorry to even bring this up,
          but you're not living with the drug
          dealer anymore are you?
          Cindy's parole officer is a sad schlub of a guy, about 50
          with bushy grey hair and a mustache, he has a badge and a gun
          on his belt.

                         CINDY
          Nope. I'm staying at Extended Stay
          until I can find a place...
          She smiles, flirtatiously waves her key/card.

                         CINDY (CONT'D)
          See?

                         (SINCERE)
          I really feel like I've turned my
          life around. Thanks in large part
          to you.

                         PAROLE OFFICER

                         (ALMOST BLUSHING)
          It's okay. I'm just glad to see
          you're doing so well... Ah, one
          more thing I just need to ask you:
          We had a little incident up in
          Templeton a couple weeks back where
          someone stole an expensive guitar
          from a music store? Someone who
          fit your description. You know
          anything about that?

                         CINDY
          Huh? No... I was probably at work
          that day.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          51.

                         PAROLE OFFICER
          Look Cindy, you realize you can't
          screw up anymore right? I mean,
          even something minor, and you could
          go back to jail for a while this
          time. I'd hate to see that happen.

                         CINDY
          Well yeah, but why would I steal a
          guitar? I've got no musical
          talent. I'm tone deaf.
          They both laugh.

                         PAROLE OFFICER
          Heh heh, So am I. I can't carry a
          tune to save my life.

                         CINDY
          Really? Wow...
          Cindy acts fascinated by Parole Officer's lack of musical
          talent. He happily goes on about it, forgetting about the
          guitar...

                         PAROLE OFFICER
          Yeah, I could barely sing the Star
          Spangled Banner in school...

                         DISSOLVE TO:

          EXT. REYNOLD'S EXTRACT BUILDING - PARKING LOT - DAY

          It's the end of the workday. People walk to their cars.
          Joel turns a corner and finds Cindy right in front of him.

                         CINDY
          Hey Mr. Reynolds.

                         JOEL
          Oh, hey Cindy. You can just call
          me Joel.

                         CINDY

                         (FLIRTATIOUS)
          Okay Joel. So you going to the
          party tonight?

                         JOEL
          Oh yeah. Right, that's tonight...

                         (AWKWARD)

                         (MORE)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          52.

          JOEL (CON T - D )
          Yeah, I was thinking about it. Are
          you going?

                         CINDY
          Yeah, definitely. Maybe I'll see
          you there?

                         JOEL
          Yeah, I think I'll probably go.

                         CINDY
          Do you have the directions?

                         JOEL
          I'm not sure...

                         CINDY
          Here, I'll write it down just in

                         CASE
          Cindy opens her purse. We see at least FIVE WALLETS, SEVERAL
          WATCHES, JEWELRY, etc. She takes out a pen and a piece of
          pink, girly stationary and starts writing.

                         CINDY (CONT'D)
          I'll also put my number on here.
          In case you want to call me some
          time -- if you want.
          Joel blushes awkwardly, like a junior high school kid.

                         JOEL
          Um... Okay. Sure.

          EXT. JOEL'S HOUSE - EVENING

          Joel pulls into the driveway and is STARTLED as he
          practically runs over Nathan, flagging him down.
          Joel MUTTERS obscenities as he reluctantly stops and rolls
          down the window.

                         NATHAN
          Hi there. Almost missed ya.

                         JOEL
          Hi. I can't talk right now--

                         NATHAN
          Hey, I noticed you guys got a new
          pool cleaner today. How is he?
          We're thinking of changing
          services.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          53.

                         JOEL
          Look Nathan, I gotta... Wait, you
          mean yesterday, don't you?

                         NATHAN
          Huh?

                         JOEL
          The new pool cleaner. You saw him
          yesterday right? Not today.

                         NATHAN
          No. It was today. The new guy.

                         JOEL
          What'd he look like?

                         NATHAN
          Blonde haired kid, about this high,
          good looking. Real good looking.

                         IN FACT--

                         JOEL
          You sure it was today? Not
          yesterday?

                         NATHAN
          Yeah.

                         JOEL
          You're absolutely sure?

                         NATHAN
          Yeah. I know it was today, because
          I came home for lunch. I was gone
          all day yesterday. Anyway, you
          think I could go ahead and get that
           check from ya? Like I say, it's 55
           dollars a plate, so that'd be 110
           total. There's no tax...
          Nathan leans up to scratch his back. Joel seizes the
           opportunity and pulls away, burning a little rubber.

          INT. JOEL'S HOUSE - BEDROOM -- MOMENTS LATER

          Joel is on his cell phone, yelling in hushed tones at Brad.
          He has the door shut so Suzie won't hear him.

                         JOEL
          What the hell were you doing at my
          house today?!

                         

                         

                         

                         

          54.

          BRAD (V.0.)
          Oh, umm... nothing.

                         JOEL
          Bullshit!

          BRAD (V.0.)
          Look, don't worry about it bro'. I
          won't charge you for this one.

                         JOEL
          Won't charge me for...? You had
          sex with my wife again?!

          BRAD (V.0.)
          Well, I figured we already did it
          once, so what's the big deal? I
          mean, she said to stop by if I was
          in the neighborhood, so... Besides,
          I'm not gonna charge you--

                         JOEL
          Not gonna charge...? God damn you!
          Yes you are gonna charge me! I'm
          gonna pay you! You're not having
          sex with my wife for free! And I
          better not ever catch you anywhere
          near my house ever again!
          Joel slams down the phone. Then realizes it's a cell phone,
          picks it back up and hits the "End" button.

          INT. JOEL'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT

          Suzie is asleep on the couch in her sweatpants. Joel walks
          through, mumbles something about going to a party.

          INT. JOEL'S CAR -- NIGHT

          Joel pulls up to the house where the party is going on. He
          stays in the car, checking it out.
          Scanning Joel's POV, we see the band, Godscock, playing in
          the backyard, with Rory on bass. They are set up on the
          patio of this small two-bedroom suburban house. Most of the
          people at the party are crowded around the keg, which is on
          the other side of the backyard, ignoring the band. The band
          sounds awful -- loud as hell, unmusical, uninspired. The
          lead singer sings in that awful Eddie Vedder style, but even
          more loud and overly dramatic. Rory acts all intense, in
          stark contrast to the non-intensity of the music.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          55.
          They all have that baggy-shorts tattooed mid-nineties look.
          It's downright pathetic.
          There's one drunk guy off to the side banging his head,
          playing air-guitar and stumbling into the bushes.
          Joel spots Cindy over by the keg, drinking, mingling. He
          watches her for a beat, then shakes his head and drives away.

                          CUT TO:

          INT. SCOREBOARDS SPORTS BAR -- NIGHT

          Joel sits at the bar talking to Dean, drinking a beer.

                         JOEL
          I can't believe my wife slept with
          that guy.

                         DEAN
          Well... I thought you said it
          wouldn't bother you.

                         JOEL
          I guess I didn't really think about
          it long enough... I just wish it
          hadn't been so easy for him.

                         DEAN
          Yeah, I'm tellin' ya, chicks really
          go wild for that Brad...
          (Off Joel's look)
          Sorry.

                         JOEL
          No, you're right. He may be a
          stupid, dull-witted moron, but he
          can get any girl he wants. Me, I
          had to work for it. I had to work
          hard, get a career going, take
          Suzie out a bunch of times, marry
          her. But not Brad. He gets to
          waltz into my house and have sex
          with my wife just like that. Oh,
          and by the way? That little prick
          was at my house again today.

                         DEAN
          No shit? What was he doing?

                         JOEL
          Take a wild guess.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          56.

                         DEAN
          Wow... You pay a guy to do a job,
          then he comes back and does it for
          free.

                         JOEL
          I'm not going to let him do it for
          free. No way. I'm paying him.

                         DEAN
          Really? How much?

                         JOEL
          Oh, I don't know. The same, I
          guess. Why?

                         DEAN
          Hmm... So should I get my twenty
          dollars from Brad then or...
          Joel shoots Dean an angry look.

                          DEAN (CONT'D)
          We can worry about that later...
          Look at the bright side, now you
          can call Cindy.

                         JOEL
          I don't know... I feel weird about
          it. Besides, she's at the party,
          she probably won't be home 'til
          late.

                         DEAN
          You know what you need to do?

                         JOEL
          (rolling his eyes)
          I don't wanna do drugs Dean.

                         DEAN
          Look, I know I joke around a lot,
          but this time I'm serious.
          (like a doctor)
          You should try smoking a little
          pot. It's just an herb, it heals.
          Stress can kill you, and--

                         JOEL
          I get paranoid when I smoke pot.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          57.

                         DEAN
          Not when you just smoke a little.
          Come on. You ever meet my friend
          Willie? Great guy. Really great
          guy.
          (as if it's a positive)
          He's the guy I got that horse
          tranquilizer from.

                         JOEL
          Oh, wonderful.

          INT. WILLIE'S APARTMENT -- NIGHT

          WILLIE loads up some kind of giant three-foot tall bong and
          inhales a massive bong-load. He's a burly ex-football player
          type who looks like he might have an extra y-chromosome or
          two. Joel watches Willie, feeling a little uneasy. Dean
          pontificates.

                         DEAN
          I've been reading about it --
          they're making technological
          advances now, coming up with great
          drugs that can make you happy and
          won't leave you with a hangover or
          nothin'.

                         WILLIE
          (holding in bong-hit)
          Right on.
          Willie finally exhales. The exhale seems to go on way longer
          than humanly possible, endless amounts of pot-smoke billowing
          out (accomplished with special FX). He finally hands the
          bong and lighter to Joel.

                         JOEL
          Oh, I don't know... I'm kind of a
          light weight. I think that's too
          much for me--

                         WILLIE
          (still holding out the
          bong and lighter)
          Bullshit.

                         DEAN
          Come on Joel. Don't worry, this
          stuff isn't that strong.
          (to Willie, re: Joel)

                         (MORE)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          58.

          DEAN (CON T-D)
          He gets paranoid when he gets too
          stoned.
          Joel looks at Willie then at Dean, then takes the bong,
          partly out of being intimidated by Willie.

                         JOEL
          Ah, what the hell.
          Willie instructs Joel on the bong usage in the same
          condescending way a weight-lifting instructor would.

                         WILLIE
          Okay, now this is a gravity bong.
          Have you ever used one before?

                         JOEL
          Umm, I think... no.

                         WILLIE
          Okay, pay attention. Put your
          thumb right here on the carburetor.
          When I pull the plunger up and say,
          "let go" I want you to let go and
          inhale hard.
          Joel's POV: Looking down the barrel of the three-foot bong
          with macho-man Willie holding the lighter at the bowl.

                         WILLIE (CONT'D)
          Okay exhale!

                         JOEL
          You know, maybe I should just let

                         YOU GUYS--

                         WILLIE
          (starting to get scary)
          Bullshit! EXHALE HARD!
          Mostly out of fear, Joel exhales. Willie puts the bong up to
          Joel's face, lights it and starts lifting the plunger. Then
          pushes it down.

                         WILLIE (CONT'D)
          Let go! Inhale! NOW!
          Joel lets go of the carburator, inhales.

                         WILLIE (CONT'D)

                         (INSANE)

          GO! GO! HARDER!!!

                         

                         

                         

                         

          59.
          Joel inhales with all his might, sucking up massive amounts
          of thick pot smoke as Willie pushes down the plunger.

                         STONER-RIPPLE

                         DISSOLVE TO:

          WILLIE'S APARTMENT -- NIGHT
          Willie, Dean and Joel sitting around, completely baked --
          especially Joel. (We play most of the scene from Joel's
          stoned, paranoid POV.)
          Dean makes some kind of barely audible mumble -- or did he?

                         JOEL
          What?
          Long pause.

                         DEAN
          Huh?
          Joel's POV: looking from Dean to Willie. Willie sits there
          with red eyes barely open. Willie turns slowly to Joel.

                         WILLIE
          Huh?

                         JOEL
          Oh, I thought somebody said
          something.
          Willie looks at Joel, stone-faced, adding even further to
          Joel's paranoia. He stares at Joel for a long beat. Then,
          in an instant, he's right up in Joel's face.

                         WILLIE

          BWAAAAAAAAAAAH!!!
          Joel jumps back, scared shitless. Willie starts laughing his
          ass off.

                         WILLIE
          Haaaah ha... The look on your face!

                         (INSANE CACKLE)
          Man you really do get paranoid when
          you get stoned.

                         JOEL
          (fake, timid laugh)
          Yeah, heh heh...

                         

                         

                         

                         

          60.

                         DEAN
          Hey Joel, why don't you call that
          chick now?

                         JOEL
          What time is it?

                         WILLIE
          Time for you to call her and
          finally get laid man!
          (handing him the phone)
          Come on!

                         DEAN
          It's twelve thirty. She might be
          back by now.

                         JOEL
          Alright.
          Joel gets the phone number out of his pocket.

                         WILLIE
          So what's this chick look like?

                         JOEL
          Oh, she's got brown hair. Pretty
          hot. Kind of working-class
          looking...

                         WILLIE
          What do you mean by that?
           Willie stares at Joel for a beat. Joel can't tell if he's
          offended Willie or not.

                         JOEL
          Umm... Oh you know,...

                         WILLIE
          Is she kind of slutty lookin'?

                         JOEL
          Yeah...
          Beat. Joel's not sure if that was the right answer either.

                         WILLIE
          Alright! That's how I like 'em.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          61.

                         JOEL
          Yeah...

                         (UNCOMFORTABLE LAUGH)
          Kinda nasty, heh heh...
          Joel starts dialing the number.

                          JOEL (CONT'D)
          I hope I don't wake her up...

                         (LISTENS)
          It's busy.

                         DEAN
          Alright. At least you know she's
          home.

                         JOEL
          Yeah.

                         WILLIE
          Try her again. Come on.
          Joel hits redial.

                         JOEL
          Still busy... Man, what kind of
          person doesn't have call-waiting.

                         WILLIE
          I don't have call-waiting. I hate
          call-waiting. Every time I hear
          that goddamn clicking sound, I
          wanna put my fist through someone's
          head.
          Beat. Once again, Joel doesn't know whether to shit or wind
          his watch. Willie stares at him, then

                         WILLIE
          Haaa ha! Man you really do get
          paranoid when you're stoned...
          Seriously though, I fuckin' hate
          call-waiting.

                         JOEL

                         (NERVOUS CHUCKLE)
          Yeah...
          Willie grabs the phone.

                         WILLIE
          Here let me dial. You're too
          stoned.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          62.
          Willie grabs the piece of paper with Cindy's number. He
          looks at it, starts to dial, then pauses, realizing
          something.
          Willie looks up at Joel, with slowly building rage, then
          hangs up the phone.

                         WILLIE
          I'll tell you why you're getting a
          busy signal. This is my number.

                         JOEL
          Huh? But...
          Beat.

                         JOEL
          Oh... You're joking right? Trying
          to make me paranoid?
          Joel waits for Willie to start cracking up. He doesn't. He
          just continues glaring at Joel. We hear the FRONT DOOR
          UNLOCK. Everyone looks.
          CINDY enters.

                         CINDY
          Hi. Sorry I'm late, I...

                         (NOTICING JOEL)
          Joel? What are you doing here...?
          Willie stands up and walks over to Joel's chair. Dean
          suddenly stands up.

                         DEAN
          Well, it looks like you guys got a
          lot to talk about here so I think
          I'm just gonna go ahead and take
          off. Later guys.
          Dean bolts. Willie moves in closer on Joel. Joel starts to
          leave, but Willie blocks him.

                         WILLIE
          Kinda slutty?
          Willie grabs Joel and throws him against the wall. Joel
          tries to make a break for the door, but Willie hauls off and
          punches him across the face. The ass-kicking begins as we

                         CUT TO:

                         

                         

                         

                         

          63.

          INT. JOEL'S HOUSE -- NIGHT

           Joel limps into the house, his face bruised black and blue
           from the ass-kicking. He looks awful.
           As he limps into the bedroom as quietly as possible, he trips
           on something, waking up Suzie. She turns on a light and sees
          Joel.

                         SUZIE
          Oh my God Joel, are you alright?
          What happened?

                         JOEL
          I'm fine. I'm fine. I just ah...
          got my ass kicked. Go back to
          sleep.

                         SUZIE
          What? By who? What happened?

                         JOEL
          It was just... some guy over at
          Scoreboards.

                         SUZIE
          Let me drive you to the hospital.
          You need to get checked out.

                         JOEL
          No. I'll be fine. I just want to
          sleep right now, okay?

                         SUZIE
          You sure you're okay? It looks
          like your nose is broken, and your

                         EYE--

                         JOEL

                         (AGITATED)
          Don't worry about it! People get
          their asses kicked all the time!
          It's no big deal. Go back to
          sleep.

          INT. REYNOLD'S EXTRACT BUILDING - MORNING

          Joel walks past his Secretary.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          64.

                         SECRETARY
          Hi Joel. Brian wanted to see you--

                         (NOTICING)
          Oh my God, what happened?
          Joel keeps walking, MUMBLES something about falling down some
          stairs, goes into his office and shuts the door.

          INT. JOEL'S OFFICE -- CONTINUOUS ACTION

          Joel walks over to the window overlooking the production
          area. He looks down and sees Cindy working, with her back
          turned. Shakes his head.
          Brian KNOCKS on the door and enters, looking worried.

                         BRIAN
          Hi... Did you talk to Step yet?

                         JOEL
          He isn't returning my calls.

                         BRIAN
          Shit... We've got problems. He did
          hire a lawyer -- Joe Adler -- he's
          that personal injury lawyer you see
          on all the bus-stop benches. You
          oughtta see this guy. He's a real
          piece of shi--
          (noticing Joel's face)
          Oh man, what happened to you?

                         JOEL
          Oh, I fell down some stairs.

                         BRIAN
          Damn... Well anyway, I hate to say
          this, but I think we're screwed.
          There's no way this Adler guy is
          gonna settle for anything less then
          bankrupting us. Says he'll sue us
          into the stone age.

                         JOEL
          (clutches his head

                         MISERABLE)
          Shit... I gotta talk to Step.
          Brian looks at Joel's bruised face.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          65.

                         BRIAN
          Man, everyone's getting hurt.
          Cindy came in with a black eye
          today. You hear how she got it?

                         JOEL
          Ah... no.

                         BRIAN
          Step did it. Can you believe that?

                         JOEL
          No he--!

                         (CATCHES HIMSELF)
          What? Where did you hear that?

                         BRIAN
          That's what she told Mary.

                         JOEL
          But... Step? Does he even know
          her?

                         BRIAN
          Apparently they've been going out.

                         JOEL
          What?!

                         BRIAN
          I know, it's weird. They didn't
          even meet here. They met at a
          grocery store or something. Just a
          total coincidence.
          Joel looks down at Cindy on the production floor, his mind
          reeling.

                         BRIAN
          Anyway, we're gonna have to hire a
          couple of new people because

                         CINDY'S QUITTING--

                         JOEL
          Really?

                         BRIAN
          Yep. And if it's okay with you,
          I'd like to go ahead and fire
          Hector.

                         JOEL
          Fire Hector? What for?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          66.

                         BRIAN
          You know, Mary's purse? Sylvia's
          wallet? It's gotta be him. Who
          else could it be?
          Joel looks down at Cindy with growing suspicion.

                         JOEL
          No. Don't fire him. Just trust me
          on this. Give him another week.
          If anything else is stolen, then
          you can fire him.

                         BRIAN

                         (PUZZLED)
          Alright. If you say so.
          Brian looks Joel over.

                         BRIAN (CONT'D)
          Man, are you okay? Have you seen a
          doctor?
          Joel's Secretary BEEPS in.

          SECRATARY (V.0.)
          Joel, Dean is on line one for you.

                         JOEL
          Okay, thanks.

                         (TO BRIAN)
          I better get this.
          Brian leaves.

                         JOEL (CONT'D)
          Hello.

                         DEAN
          Hey man. Sorry I bailed on you
          like that last night. It's just
          that I don't like to get involved
          in other people's personal shit,
          you know what I mean?

                         JOEL
          Uh-huh.

                         DEAN
          I didn't even know Willie had a
          girlfriend. She must be new. Man,
          Willie looked pissed.

                         (CHUCKLES)

                         (MORE)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          67.

          DEAN (CON T'D)
          I thought he was gonna take a swing
          at you there for a second.

                         JOEL
          He did take a swing at me Dean.
          Several swings. In fact, he beat
          the living shit out of me.

                         DEAN
          Whoa, really?

                         JOEL
          Yes.

                         DEAN
          Wow. Man, that really goes to show
          you -- this town is smaller than
          you think. You really gotta be
          careful.
          Joel hangs up and walks out of his office, past his
          Secretary.

                         JOEL
          I'm not feeling well. I'm going to
          go home early.

          INT. JOEL'S CAR -- DAY

          Joel turns the corner to his house and does a double-take as
          he sees BRAD'S TRUCK going the opposite direction.

                         JOEL
          Shit!
          Joel slams on the brakes, turns around, chases Brad's truck
          down and cuts him off, forcing him to stop. They both get out
          of their vehicles. Joel is livid.

                         JOEL
          What the hell were you doing on my
          street again?!

                         BRAD
          Dude, you weren't supposed to be
          home for another four hours--
          Whoa, what happened to your face?

                         JOEL
          (trying to improvise a
          tough, snappy comeback,
          but can't quite make it

                         WORK)

                         (MORE)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          68.

                         JOEL (CONT'D)
          The same thing that's gonna
          happen.. Your face is gonna look
          worse if... GOD DAMMIT! If I ever
          catch you anywhere near my house or
          my wife again, I'll have you
          arrested.

                         BRAD
          For what? Suzie let me in.
          Joel is stumped -- Brad actually has a point.

                         JOEL
          What the hell is wrong with you
          anyway? Do you do this with all
          your clients -- just keep coming
          back and hanging around?

                         BRAD
          I don't know. This is my first
          one.

                         JOEL
          What?! I thought you were a
          professional!

                         BRAD
          Look man, I know she's your wife
          an' shit, but you might as well
          know -- I think we're in love.

                         JOEL
          In love?!

                         (COMING UNGLUED)
          HA! Man are you stupid. You are
          so goddamn dumb. You think she
          loves you? You're nothing but a
          piece of ass to her. That's all.

                         BRAD
          I don't think so dude.

                         JOEL
          Oh, you don't think so "dude?"
          Well did you ever think about this:
          she doesn't even know that I paid
          you to have sex with her -- did
          that cross your small mind?

                         BRAD
          Uuh..

                         

                         

                         

                         

          69.

                         JOEL
          How about I go home right now and
          tell her? Tell her you did it for
          the money. How about that loverboy?
          Brad suddenly looks worried. This really freaks him out.

                         BRAD
          You wouldn't do that.

                         JOEL
          You don't think so? Watch me.

                         BRAD
          (realizing he's serious)
           No... Dude, please don't. Please?
          Joel starts back to his car.

                         BRAD
          Look man, we really have a special
          thing going on. Please don't mess
          it up...
          Joel stops.

                         JOEL
          Don't mess it up?! You're talking
          about my wife! My house! Stupid-
          ass!
          Joel gets in his car and starts it.

                         BRAD
          (calls out to him)
          Dude, you can't do this to me.

                         JOEL
          Oh yes I can...
          Joel peels out, drives half a block and turns into his
          driveway.

          INT. JOEL'S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

          Joel walks in, still pissed off. Suzie is sitting on the
          couch, a little surprised to see him.

                         SUZIE
          Oh hi. You're home early.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          70.

                         JOEL

                         (COLD)
          Hi.
          Joel walks over to the sliding glass door, looks outside at
          the pool. It's filthy.

                         JOEL
          So how was that new pool cleaner?
           Suzie is caught off guard -- wonders if she's busted -- but
          she plays it cool.

                         SUZIE
          Um... What do you mean?

                         JOEL
          What do you think I mean?... Did
          he do a good job cleaning the pool?

                         SUZIE
          Ah... well--

                         JOEL
          Did he get all the... leaves? It
          doesn't really look that clean. I
          mean I'm looking at it, and I'd say
          it's pretty goddamn filthy. Did the
          guy even clean it at all? It sure
          doesn't look like it.

                         SUZIE

                         (NERVOUS)
          Well yeah, I guess he didn't do a
          very good job.

                         JOEL
          I think he did a horrible job. I
          don't think we should use him
          anymore.

                         SUZIE
          Okay.

                         JOEL
          Okay.
          Suzie watches Joel leave, a slight look of guilt on her face.

                         SUZIE
          Are you all right, Joel? You want
          an aspirin or anything?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          71.

                         JOEL
          No.

          INT. JOEL'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Quick shot of Joel staring up at the ceiling shaking his
          head, can't believe all this.

          EXT. STEP'S HOUSE -- NEXT DAY

           In a WIDE SHOT we see Joel's car is parked on the street. He
           walks up and rings the doorbell. We see Step answer, talk to
          him and then invite him in.

          INT. STEP'S HOUSE -- CONTINUOUS

          Step and Joel enter. Step's 300 POUND HALF-BROTHER sits on a
          ratty couch watching TV, drinking a huge plastic bottle of
          Pepsi. He looks like he's been sitting there for years. The
          TV is deafeningly loud.

                         STEP
          Wow, I don't think you've ever been
          to my house before. Have you?

                         JOEL
          (talking above the TV)
          Yeah, I don't think so. I would've
          remembered...

                         STEP
          This is my half brother Phil.
          Joel starts to motion "don't get up," then realizes that's
          not happening anyway. Phil nods.

                         JOEL
          Hi... Hey Step, can we talk in
          another room.

                         STEP
          Sure, let's go out back.

          EXT. STEP'S HOUSE - BACK YARD -- A LITTLE LATER

          Joel and Step sit at a picnic table.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          72.

                         STEP
          You know, my lawyer told me not to
          talk to you.

                         (BEAT)
          You're not here to try to talk me
          out of suing are you?

                         JOEL
          Oh, no... No, I'm just kind of
          curious about... ah... So you've
          been going out with Cindy, huh?

                         STEP
          Yes sir. She's my girlfriend. We
          might even get married after all
          this lawsuit-settlement stuff gets
          worked out.

                         JOEL
          .so some of the guys at work are
          saying you gave Cindy that black
          eye.

                         STEP
          What? That ain't true at all.

                         JOEL
          Yeah, I know it's not.

                         STEP
          She got it from falling down some
          stairs.

                         JOEL
          Hmm... Look, you might wanna be
          careful with Cindy.

                         STEP

                         (DEFENSIVE)
          What do you mean?

                         JOEL
          Well, I'm not sure how to put this,
          but... You know, you got a lot of
          money coming your way with this
          settlement. You might wanna be

                         CAREFUL--

                         STEP
          Oh no. No, she didn't even know
          about that 'til after we started
          going out.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          73.

                         JOEL
          You sure about that?

                         STEP
          Oh yeah. I didn't tell her about
          it for a while 'cuz I was kind of
          embarrassed, you know? You don't
          tell a girl you just met that you
          lost one of your balls. Especially
          a girl as hot as Cindy.

                         JOEL
          Yeah...

                         (DELICATELY)
          You know she lives with this guy
          Willie right?

                         STEP
          That's her ex. She broke up with
          him. She's gonna move out. She
          just needs to get all her stuff
          outta there.

                         JOEL
          You sure about that?

                         STEP
          Oh yeah. She's moving in with me.

                         JOEL
          Oh. Hmm...

                         STEP
          Look, I know Cindy's got some
          problems, but she means well.
          She's the best thing that ever
          happened to me.

                         JOEL
          Well, okay... If you say so.
          Another thing -- you just might
          want to watch your back. Some of
          the guys at work who think you gave
          Cindy the black eye were talking
          about paying you a visit -- you
          know, getting even.

                         STEP
          Oh. Well I'm not worried about
          that.
          (dead-serious, proud)
          I could kick anyone's ass at that
          whole company.

          INT. JOEL'S HOUSE - DAY

           Brad and Suzie are by the pool which is filthy. Brad starts
          coming on to Suzie. She pushes him away.

                         SUZIE
          No Brad, we can't. I'm sorry, but
          we have to stop doing this.

                         BRAD
          Why?

                         SUZIE
          It's not right. I feel horrible.
          Besides, I think Joel's getting
          suspicious. And you gotta start
          cleaning the pool too.

                         BRAD
          But I've never felt this way about
          anyone before. And I've been with
          a lot of chicks.

                         SUZIE

                         (TURNED OFF)
          Uh-huh... Look Brad, the truth is
          I love my husband. I really do.
          This was all a big mistake. I'm
          sorry. I don't know what got into
          me, but we have to stop this. I
          want to make my marriage work
          again. I'm going to tell Joel
          about the whole thing and just hope
          he forgives me. And even if he
          doesn't, at least I won't be
          carrying around this horrible
          feeling. I just can't stand that
          he doesn't know.

                         BRAD
          Uh... This doesn't mean we can't
          still see each other though, right?

                         SUZIE
          Ah, yes it does.

                         BRAD
          Why?

                         SUZIE
          Because of all the things I just
          said.

                         (MORE)

                         SUZIE (CONT'D)

                         (PATIENTLY)
          Do you need me to say them again?

                         BRAD
          Can I see you tomorrow?

                         SUZIE
          No.

                         BRAD

                         (PLEADING)
          How about next week?

                         SUZIE
          No. Look, you gotta go Brad. Joel
          could be home any second.

                         BRAD
          I'll call you tomorrow.

                         SUZIE
          (just trying to get rid of

                         HIM)
          Okay. Okay, just go and we'll talk
          later.
          Brad leans to kiss her, she pushed him away and he finally
          leaves.

                         SUZIE

                         (TO HERSELF)
          God, what a moron.

          INT. JOEL'S OFFICE - DAY

          Joel sits deep in his chair, bummed out, staring down at the
          manufacturing area. Brian walks in.

                         BRIAN
          So... you ready?

                         JOEL
          Huh?

                         BRIAN
          The meeting with Step's lawyer. Or
          lawyers I should say. It's today
          remember?

                         JOEL
          Oh shit... Alright.
          Joel drags himself out of the chair.

          INT. REYNOLDS EXTRACT - CONFRENCE ROOM - DAY

          JOE ADLER, is holding court with the various lawyers and
          paralegals waiting for the meeting to start. As promised, he
          is awful. He looks like Henry Winkler with an extra Y
          chromosome and a lot of steroids. (Maybe cast Gene Simmons
          with his hair pulled back in a pony tail.)

                         ADLER
          .You see, if both his balls had
          been knocked clean off, he would be
          a good case, but not a great case:
          A man with no balls is no man at
          all. He's a freak. He's barely
          human. He's gross. And a jury will
          never feel like they can walk in
          the shoes of a ball-less, neutered,
          he/she freak. But Step. He's
          still got one ball - barely. He's
          still a man. A man who's very
          manhood has been jeopardized, but
          still a man. And that manhood,
          that very sense of what you are as
          a human being is hanging by a
          thread. Jesus, you can't get more
          dramatic than that. That brave
          ball, hanging on for dear life,
          hanging on for justice, is going to
          be the hero of this trial. I'm
          tellin' ya this Step guy is the
          fuckin' Holy Grail, the Powerball
          Jackpot. And you all laughed at me
          when I bought those bus bench ads.
          But I knew the asses of those poor
          slobs that sit on those benches and
          ride those sweaty, stinking, cattle
          cars are our future. And I --
          Joel and Brian walk in.

                         ADLER
          Oh, hello. I'm Joe Adler...
          Everybody starts introducing each other.

          INT. REYNOLDS EXTRACT - EMPLOYEE BREAK ROOM - DAY

          A bunch of employees including Mary, Garielle, and Rory are
          talking, getting worked up.

                         RORY
          .And when they sell the company,
          Joel and Brian are gonna be the
          one's who get rich, and--

                         MARY
          And we're the ones doing all the
          work.

                         GABRIELLE
          That's right.

                         RORY
          It's bullshit man. We should get a
          piece of it. I work my ass off.

                         MARY
          Gabrielle and I work harder than
          anybody. I should be making what
          Brian makes. If you add up all the
          crates I move, I lift 10,000 pounds
          a day. Minimum.

                         GABRIELLE
          That's right. Here he's gonna make
          a million dollars, and we're the
          ones who do everything. I went to
          college. For three years.

                         MARY
          If we quit, this place couldn't
          run. They wouldn't be able to sell
          this place for anything.
          JIM, a tall skinny 50-something guy with a ridiculously big
          mustache and a little paunch, chimes in.

                         JIM
          That's why what we should do is, is
          we should all go on strike --
          demand stock in the company before
          it sells. If General Mills knew
          we were on strike, they wouldn't
          buy this place until the strike was
          over. That way they'd have to give
          us stock.
          Jim points to his head, gives everyone a "how's that" nod.
          It starts to build steam.

                         RORY
          That's right man. We should do it.
          We should strike.

                         MARY
          That's right. I could get a job at
          Gemco like that. At Gemco, all the
          employees are owners -- even says
          so on the name tags.

                         GABRIELLE
          Mmm hmm. I could get a job at
          Southwest Airlines...

          INT. REYNOLDS EXTRACT - CONFRENCE ROOM - DAY

          The meeting is already in progress. On Adler's side of the
          table are two other lawyers and a couple of paralegals. On
          Joel's side it's just he, Brian and Joel's secretary. Maybe
          one lawyer who doesn't say much.
          Everybody has in front of them a small stack of documents.
          The confrence room, like Joel's office, has a full length
          window facing the manufacturing area.

                         ADLER
          Ok gentlemen. We've gone through
          everything and the only way we
          would even begin to consider a
          settlement would be to the tune of
          the number you see on the bottom of
          page 18. Does everyone have this?
           Joel and the rest of them find page 18. Joel is stunned by
          the number.

                         JOEL
          What!!!?
          (so pissed he can barely
          get the words out)
          We don't have this much money! Not
          even close!

                         ADLER
          Not in cash you don't. Of course
          not. But if you were to sell off
          your assets: the property lease,
          the equipment, the--

                         JOEL
          What the ff-- Are you shitting
          me!? That would bankrupt us!

                         BRIAN
          This is what I've been trying to
          tell you Joel...

                         

                         

                         

                         

          79.

                         JOEL
          If you think I'm just going to give
          up this entire company that I built
          from the ground up--
          Adler jumps up, dripping with phoney, forced indignation.

                         ADLER
          How about what my client gave up!?
          His testicles! How about that!?
          He walks over to the door...

                         ADLER
          In fact, I'll make a deal with you -
          - we will drop this case right now
          if you come over here and put your
          testicles right here
          (indicates the space
          between the door and the

                         HINGES)
          and let me slam this door like
          this...
          Adler SLAMS the door ridiculously hard.

                         ADLER
          Go ahead. We can settle this right
          now -- call it even. I will drop
          this case right now if you let me
          slam your balls in this door,

          BECAUSE THAT IS WHAT HAPPENED TO MY

          CLIENT!

                         JOEL
          It was an accident!

                         ADLER
          Not according to our investigation.
          We believe that, in fact, there was
          gross negligence...

          The employees, same ones in the breakroom, are milling
          around, talking, the idea of the strike gaining momentum.
          Rory points up to the confrence room.

                         RORY
          I heard those guys up there are the
          guys from General Mills.

                         JIM
          See, now they're probably up there
          negotiating right now -- cuttin' up
          the pie that we baked. That's what
          it looks like to me.
          The employees all nod in agreement.
          Employees POV: Adler pointing at his balls, pointing to the
          door again, about to slam it. One of his lawyers stops him.

                         RORY
          We gotta act fast. They could be
          about to close the deal.

                         JIM
          Yeah, and leave us out in the cold.

                         RORY
          Yeah, then it's too late. If
          they've already sold it we can't
          get a piece of it. We gotta act
          fast. We need to do one of those
          walk outs.

                         JIM
          Well, we better do it now.

                         RORY
          Okay, who's in? We need a show of
          force. Come on, it's now or
          never...
          We PAN around the employees as the idea builds momentum,
          ending on HECTOR, who looks completely confused by it all.

          down on that price -- I'll come all
          the way down to zero and drop this
          case -- if you go over there right
          now and slam your testicles in that
          door! Because--

                         JOEL
          I don't wanna slam my testicles in
          the door! I want you to be

          one penny! Come on!

          me?
          Brian puts his hand on Joel, motions him to calm down.

          Joel walks down the stairs. The group of employees see him
          and ready themselves for the big confrontation. Joel notices
          them all looking at him and stops.

                         JOEL
          Yeah?... What?
          But they are ill-prepared. No one knows who should talk
          first. It's incredibly awkward. They all look at each other
          and mutter things like, "go ahead" "you first". Finally...

          idea of ah...

                         RORY
          Well, we just think that we should
          maybe get a piece of it, you know
          cuz we do all the work... And if we
          don't... um...
          Joel's in no mood for this. He goes off on them.

                         JOEL
          You know what? Fine. Fine.
          You're all in charge -- all of you.
          (gestures to all the

                         EMPLOYEES)
          As of now. You run the goddamn
          place. Go ahead. In fact, you can
          go up there right now and meet with
          Adler. He may slam your balls in
          the door, but woohoo! You're the
          boss!
          Joel storms out, leaving the employees standing there.
          A BICKERING MATCH erupts over who was supposed to do the
          talking, who said they would say what, who backed down first,
          etc. "I was gonna say something but you interrupted," "You
          didn't say anything when he was leaving, so I thought you
          were quitting. I would've stood up to him."
          As the argument dies down, one by one they all go back to
          their posts, muttering.

          INT. JOEL'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY

          Joel is sitting at the table, picking at some food, looking
          miserable. Suzie comes over, gathers up her nerve.

                         SUZIE
          Listen Joel, there's something I
          have to tell you. I think we need
          to be honest with each other.
          Suzie sits down.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          83.

                         SUZIE (CONT'D)
          I'm not sure how to say this, but --
          well, you've been so caught up in
          you're work lately, and I'm here
          alone all day and sometimes I just--

                         JOEL
          You banged the pool cleaner.

                         SUZIE
          Wha...
          Suzie is stunned.

                         JOEL
          That's what you're trying to tell
          me right? You had sex with Brad?

                         SUZIE
          You knew?

                         JOEL
          Yes I knew. I hired him.

                         SUZIE
          Well I know you hired him, but how
          did you know about--

                         JOEL
          I don't mean I hired him to clean
          the pool, I mean I hired him to
          have sex with you.

                         SUZIE
          What?

                         JOEL
          He's a gigolo Suzie.
          Suzie is stupefied.

                         SUZIE
          But... what... Why?
          Joel is so fed up, he just tells her everything.

                         JOEL
          I hired him to have an affair with
          you so that I could have an affair
          without feeling guilty. I was
          really drunk and on some kind of
          horse tranquilizer and--

                         

                         

                         

                         

          84.

                         SUZIE
          Brad was getting paid?...
          (disbelief, hurt)
          So you've been paying Brad this
          whole time? All fifteen times?!

                         JOEL
          FIFTEEN TIMES?! Jesus Christ
          Suzie!
          Joel sinks into his chair, shaking his head.

                         JOEL (CONT'D)
          I only paid him once -- well,
          twice. The rest was on the house.
          Long beat as Suzie tries to let it all sink in.

                         SUZIE
          You wanted to have an affair with
          another woman?

                         JOEL
          Yes. But I didn't.
          Suzie paces around for a moment, reeling, processing all
          this. Then, decisively,

                         SUZIE
          You asshole.

                         JOEL
          Oh, I'm the asshole?

                         SUZIE
          Yes! How could you?

                         JOEL

                         (LAUGHS)
          How could I? How could you?!!!
          You didn't have to have sex with
          him. You could've simply said "No
          thanks. Just clean the pool," but
          you didn't, did you?! No, you took
          him up on his little offer and had
          sex with him -- fifteen times!

                         SUZIE
          None of this would've happened if
          you hadn't hired him.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          85.

                         JOEL
          Okay. I'll admit, I made a big
          mistake. I was drunk, on drugs,
          stressed, sexually frustrated and I
          shouldn't have hired a male
          prostitute to seduce you. But if
          you had simply been faithful, none
          of this would've happened.
          Suzie just looks at him for a beat.

                         SUZIE
          You're sick, you know that?
          Beat. Joel can't really argue this point.

                         JOEL
          What do you see in Brad anyway?
          He's borderline retarded. You
          probably could've been arrested for
          having sex with a guy that dumb.

                         SUZIE
          That's it. I'm leaving.
          Suzie heads for the door. Joel follows after her.

                         JOEL
          No. You're not leaving me. I'm
          leaving you!

                         SUZIE
          Fine.
          Joel opens the door, about to storm out, only to find
          NATHAN, standing right there about to ring the doorbell.

                         NATHAN
          Oh, hey guys. Glad I caught ya.
          You guys hardly ever answer the
          door. Heh heh.
          They are both so flustered, they can barely talk.

                         SUZIE
          Now's not a good time Nathan.
          Joel turns around, storms off back into the house.

                         NATHAN
          Oh, you guys goin' somewhere?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          86.

                         SUZIE
          No. Look, we can't talk right now.

                         NATHAN
          Well, you think I could go ahead
          and get that check from ya then?
          I'm just trying to balance my
          checkbook here...

                         SUZIE
          Now's not a good time.

                         NATHAN
          When would be a good time, you
          think?

                         SUZIE
          I don't know.

                         NATHAN
          See the thing is--

                         SUZIE
          Okay tomorrow.

                         NATHAN
          Great, what time?

                         SUZIE
          I don't know. Just come by
          tomorrow. I can't talk now.

                         NATHAN
          Okay great. And if you could just
          go ahead and have that check,
          that'd be great. It's a hundred
          and ten. That's two plates at

                         FIFTY-FIVE--

                         SUZIE
          Yeah, Okay...
          Suzie shuts the door, cutting him off.

           EXT. EXTENDED STAY AMERICA SUITES -- DAY

           Joel checks into an Extended Stay America hotel.(a chain of
          hotels that rent by the week.)
          Quick shot of Joel sitting alone in the room. He drops his
          suitcase and glumly sits down on the bed, grabs the remote.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          87.
          He turns on Spectravision and surfs the Adult titles, decides
          he's not into it and switches back to regular TV only to find
          American Idol is on. He stares at it for a beat, then flops
          down on the bed and stares at the ceiling.

          INT. SCOREBOARDS SPORTS BAR -- NIGHT

          Joel sits at the bar, drowning his sorrows. Dean is over by
          the cash register, tending to some business. Brad enters,
          walks over to Joel. Joel looks the other way.

                         BRAD
          Hey man... I know you probably
          want to kick my ass, but--

                         JOEL
          I couldn't kick your ass if I
          wanted to. You're a good 10 years
          younger than me, and I'm a pussy.
          So why don't you just leave me
          alone.

                         BRAD
          I just wanted to tell you, I'm not
          gonna see Suzie anymore. You don't
          have to worry.
          Joel keeps drinking his beer, stares straight ahead.

                         BRAD
          The last time I was over there, she
          broke it off; told me to quit
          coming over... She said she was
          gonna tell you everything -- you
          know, about us. She's really into
          you dude. I guess that's why she
          married you an' shit... You're a
          lucky guy... Sorry if I messed shit
          up.
          Beat. Joel takes another swig.

                         JOEL
          Why'd you have to get hung up on
          Suzie? You could have any girl you
          want.

                         BRAD
          Yeah, but I want Suzie. And I
          can't have her.

                         JOEL
          You had her fifteen times.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          88.

                         BRAD
          Yeah, but she doesn't love me dude.
          It's just not the same... Anyway,
          just wanted to tell you that.

                         JOEL
          Well... You told me.

                         BRAD
          Alright, later...
          Brad starts to leave. Then he stops, turns around.

                         BRAD
          Oh, one more thing... I quit my
          landscaping job... And I don't
          think I'm really cut out to be a
          gigolo. So I was wondering if you
          had any openings over there at your
          extract place?

                         JOEL

                         (EXASPERATED SIGH)
          Brad, you had sex with my wife.
          I'm not gonna give you a job, okay?

                         BRAD
          Okay... Sorry man.
          Brad walks away. Joel stares at his beer for a beat,
          thinking. He calls out to Brad.

                         JOEL
          Hey Brad?...
          Brad stops.

                         BRAD
          Yeah?

                         JOEL
          I don't know... Maybe come by the
          office tomorrow. Fill out an
          application. I'll see what I can
          do.

                         BRAD
          Cool. Thanks man.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          89.

          INT. JOEL'S OFFICE - NEXT DAY

          Brian sits with Joel. They both look pretty miserable.
          Brian looks down at some papers, shaking his head.

                         BRIAN
          We're screwed. General Mills has
          pretty much withdrawn the offer
          pending a really favorable
          settlement with Step.
          (shaking his head)
          Not only do we not sell the
          company, we could wind up bankrupt.

                         JOEL
          (muttering to himself)
          So I don't sell the company, don't
          get the money, I'm bankrupt, I
          don't get Cindy, I paid a guy to
          have sex with my wife, and she
          actually did it...

                         BRIAN
          Excuse me?

                         JOEL
          Nothing.

          EXT. JOEL'S HOUSE - POOL -- DAY

          Suzie is trying to clean the pool herself, struggling with
          the long pole with the net at the end. She looks miserable.

          NATHAN (O.S.)
          Hello?
          Nathan enters through the back gate.

                         SUZIE

                         (MUTTERS)
          Shit...
          Nathan walks over to Suzie. She's in no mood for this. She
          acts as unfriendly as possible.

                         NATHAN
          Why are you cleaning the pool
          yourself? That new guy didn't work
          out?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          90.

                         SUZIE
          Yeah, didn't work out.

                         NATHAN
          Boy, you just can't get good help,
          eh?

                         SUZIE
          Yeah.

                         NATHAN
          So, did you get a chance to write
          that check?

                         SUZIE
          Look Nathan, Joel and I aren't
          going to that dinner okay?
          Nathan acts deeply disappointed.

                         NATHAN
          Well gee, I wish you would've told
          me that before I went and bought
          the tickets.

                         SUZIE
          Joel never agreed to this Nathan,
          and neither did I.

                         NATHAN
          Well, it sure sounded like you guys
          were going. Leslie was gonna talk
          to you about it, but you didn't
          return our calls. I mean, I
          already bought these tickets.
          They're nonrefundable. I really
          wish you guys had been a little
          more clear with me...
          It's the last straw. Suzie has had enough. She unleashes
          all her pent-up aggression on Nathan.

                         SUZIE
          Okay, let me be really clear with
          you then. When we say "I don't
          think so," or even "I'm not sure,"
          that means "no." Why can't you
          understand that?

                         NATHAN
          Well, I just--

                         

                         

                         

                         

          91.

                         SUZIE
          Shut up! In fact, let me be even
          more clear with you. We don't like
          you! Is that clear enough? You're
          dull, you never shut up, you never
          listen, and we don't want anything
          to do with you ever again!
          Nathan freezes, in some kind of state of shock. He starts to
          shake a little. Suzie just keeps going -- it feels too good
          to stop.

                         SUZIE
          Is that clear enough for you
          Nathan?! Is that...?
          Nathan starts to go into some kind of seizure.

                         SUZIE

                         (WORRIED)
          Nathan?
          Nathan's eyes roll back into his head, and he collapses.
          Suzie SCREAMS.

          EXT. EXTENDED STAY AMERICA SUITES -- NIGHT

          Joel pulls into the parking lot. He looks surprised, seeing
          something on the other side of the lot that gets his
          attention.

                         JOEL

                         (TO HIMSELF)
          No way...
          From JOEL'S POV, we see Cindy pull up and get out of her car.
          Joel watches as she gets out with a grocery bag and heads up
          the stairs. Joel gets out and watches her from a distance.
          He sees her go into a room and shut the door.
          He stares up at the door for a beat. Then, with a look of
          determination, Joel walks up the stairs and knocks on her
          door.

          INT. CINDY'S ROOM -- CONTINUOUS ACTION

          Cindy opens the door, a little startled to see Joel, but
          pleasant to him.

                         CINDY
          Oh... Joel. I ah,...

                         

                         

                         

                         

          92.

                         JOEL
          Hi.

                         CINDY
          What're you...? What's up? How'd
          you know I was here?

                         JOEL
          Ah, actually, I'm staying here too.
          Down on the first floor, around the
          back. I thought I saw you so I
          ah...

                         CINDY
          Well, come in.
          Joel enters, stands in the living room. Cindy heads in to
          the kitchen.

          CINDY (O.S.)
          Do you want something to drink? I
          think all I have is Diet Coke.
          Joel notices MARY'S PURSE lying on the coffee table. He
          stares at it.

                         JOEL
          No thanks.
          Cindy comes back in with a Diet Coke.

                         CINDY
          Have a seat.
          Joel remains standing, looking at the purse.

                         JOEL
          That's Mary's purse... Isn't it?

                         CINDY
          What?

                         JOEL
          Right there. That's Mary's purse.

                         CINDY
          Oh that? No, that's mine... So
          how are things at work?

                         JOEL
          That's Mary's purse. You stole it,
          didn't you?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          93.
           Cindy acts like he's being silly. There's nothing about her
          demeanor that would make anybody think she's lying.

                         CINDY
          No. It probably just looks like
          it. There's a lot of those.

                         JOEL
          I've never seen another one. You
          probably have Sylvia's wallet in
          here somewhere too, don't you? And
          everything else that's been stolen
          from my employees.

                         CINDY
          Joel, are you okay?

                         JOEL
          No, I'm not. That's Mary's purse
          Goddammit! Okay? Everyone blamed
          Hector. He almost got fired.
          Doesn't that bother you?

                         CINDY
          (innocent, sweet)
          Joel, I don't know what you're--

                         JOEL
          Hector! Hard working guy, never
          did anything wrong. And what are
          you doing with Step? You're trying
          to screw him out of his settlement
          money aren't you?

                         CINDY
          I have no idea what you're talking
          about.

                         JOEL
          Yes you do! You're the only reason
          he's suing us aren't you? You know
          how much work it took for me to
          build up that company? You just
          don't care about anybody do you?
          What are you, some kind of
          sociopath?
          Cindy looks like Joel might be getting to her.

                          JOEL (CONT'D)
          You can't even admit that you stole
          this purse can you? You just can't
          do it.

                         (MORE)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          94.

                         JOEL (CONT'D)
          In fact, you probably can't tell
          the truth about much of anything,
          can you?...
          Cindy turns away from him, looking down at the floor.

                         JOEL
          I bet Cindy's not even your real
          name is it? Who are you? Where
          the hell are you from?
          Cindy, still looking away, doesn't answer.

                         JOEL (CONT'D)
          You can't answer can you? Because
          if you said one true thing, you'd
          have to tell the truth about
          something else and then it would
          all unravel wouldn't it? Then
          you'd have to admit that you stole
          this purse and God knows what else.
          Beat. Cindy still looking away, down at the floor. We see
          her eyes well up, about to cry, but Joel doesn't notice.

                         JOEL

                         (COMPOSES HIMSELF)
          Well, I'm leaving now.
          Joel picks up the purse.

                         JOEL
          And I'm taking this purse with me.
          If it really is yours, you can call
          the police and tell 'em I stole
          it... In fact, I'm gonna call the
          police and report it...
          Joel walks towards the door. Then Cindy slumps down on the
          couch, mutters something, still looking down at the floor,
          her voice cracking slightly.

                         CINDY
          Please don't...
          Joel stops.

                         JOEL
          What?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          95.

                         CINDY
          (still looking down)
          Please don't report it to the
          police. I'm on probation. I'll go
          to jail. For a long time.

                         JOEL
          Well... Maybe you should've thought
          about that before you started
          ripping off my employees.
          Joel starts to open the door.

                         CINDY
          Joel? Please? I'll leave Step
          alone. I promise. He'll drop the
          lawsuit.
          Joel considers this.

                         JOEL
          How do I know that?

                         CINDY
          You can keep the purse. If I don't
          leave him alone; if he doesn't drop
          the lawsuit, then you can report
          me. Please?
          Beat.

                         JOEL
          Hmm... I guess that ah... Do you
          have Sylvia's wallet, and Jim's
          watch? Can I get those too?
          Beat. Cindy nods, still looking down. Joel considers it.

                         JOEL
          Well... Okay then. I guess that
          works.

                         (REALIZING)
          And I guess you just admitted that
          you stole the purse. That's good,
          I guess... A step in the right
          direction...
          Joel sits down on the couch also. With her head still down,
          Cindy is weeping quietly. Joel doesn't notice, looking
          straight ahead.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          96.

                         JOEL
          So what's your deal anyway?... I
          mean, how did you end up like this?
          Joel finally looks over, notices that she's crying. He's
          caught off guard.

                         JOEL
          .Ah... Cindy?
          Cindy breaks down and starts bawling.

                         JOEL (CONT'D)
          Okay, now you see... that's what
          I'm talking about. You're trying
          to manipulate me now, and I'm not
          gonna fall for it...
          Cindy starts bawling even harder.

                         JOEL (CONT'D)
          I really hope you're not faking
          this right now, because I'm feeling
          really bad. Are you faking it?
          Cindy shakes her head "no."

                         JOEL
          I'm sorry, I was just curious, you
          know, how a person ends up like...
          this...
          Cindy suddenly starts BAWLING hysterically.
          Joel stands there awkwardly, not sure if he should hug her or
          comfort her in any way.

                         JOEL
          Never mind. I'm sorry...
          Joel tentatively puts a comforting arm around her and she
          leans in to him, crying on his chest.
          He puts his other arm around her and she snuggles in even
          closer. As her crying gradually subsides she snuggles in
          even more. Finally, she lifts her head and they start
          kissing. As they get hot and heavy we

                         DISSOLVE TO:

                         

                         

                         

                         

          97.

          EXT. EXTENDED STAY AMERICA SUITES -- MORNING

          Wide shot of the Hotel. It's a beautiful morning.

          INT. CINDY'S ROOM - DAY

          Joel wakes up, looking more relaxed than we've ever seen him.
          We PULL OUT to reveal that he's alone in Cindy's bed. He
          sits up, yawns. He has a big satisfied smile on his face.

                         JOEL
          Cindy?
          He looks around, realizes he's alone. Then suddenly looks
          worried.

                         JOEL (CONT'D)
          Oh shit!
          He scrambles for his pants, then looks relieved as he
          realizes his wallet is still there. He sets down the pants,
          then after a beat, picks them up again, checks inside the
          wallet and sees there's still cash and credit cards. Then he
          looks up at the chest of drawers and sees: Mary's purse,
          Sylvia's wallet, and a watch, placed side by side.
          He lies back in bed, and shuts his eyes, grinning again.

          INT. REYNOLD'S EXTRACT /MANUFACTURING AREA -- MORNING

          Extract bottles moving along the assembly line full steam.
          Mary and Gabriella gossiping.

                         MARY
          (looks at her watch)
          Joel hasn't been in all morning.
          can you believe that?

                         GABRIELLE
          If we come in late, we get fired.
          And here we're working our tails
          off, and he's gonna get rich.
          Joel walks in, bright-eyed and cheery, greeting people. He
          walks over to Mary carrying her PURSE.

                         JOEL
          Here you go Mary.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          98.
          Joel hands her the purse. Mary looks at it, not quite sure
          how to react, not ever wanting to appear grateful for
          anything -- not in her nature.

                         JOEL (CONT'D)
          And by the way, Hector didn't take
          it. Cindy did.
          Joel walks off. Mary just shakes her head at him. She
          whispers to Gabriella.

                         MARY
          Can you believe that? Blaming
          Cindy just to protect Hector.

          INT. JOEL'S OFFICE - DAY

          Joel is at his desk. Brian comes in.

                         BRIAN
          Step's here to see you.

                         JOEL
          Really? Bring him in.

                         BRIAN
          No, he's outside. At the loading
          dock. Wants to talk to you alone
          back there for some reason.

                         (CRUDE IMMITATION)
          "Man to man."

          EXT. REYNOLDS EXTRACT - LOADING DOCK

          Step is pacing around, waiting. Joel comes out.

                         JOEL
          Hi Step...

                         STEP
          Hey.

                         JOEL
          How you doin'? How's your, ah...

                         STEP
          (looking down at his

                         CROTCH)
          Oh it's okay. Some days it still
          hurts, but they've got me on some
          pills. It's not too bad I guess...

                         

                         

                         

                         

          99.

                         JOEL
          Well... that's good.
          They both sit down on the edge of the dock.

                         STEP
          Look, ah... Cindy left me.
          Joel's nods, not surprised, but sympathetic.

                         JOEL
          Wow... Bummer...

                         STEP
          Yeah, it is a bummer... You know, I
          thought the worst part was having
          my balls knocked off, but you know
          what the worse part is? Dealin'
          with all this bullshit... I'm sick
          of that Adler guy tellin' me what
          to do. He's a real dick.

                         JOEL
          Yeah, he sure is.

                         STEP
          The truth is, I just want to have
          my old life back -- I just want to
          go back to work. I'm a workin'
          man; that's what I do.

                         JOEL
          Yeah... I'm beginning to think I
          might be the same way... I'm a
          little worried about what I'd do
          with too much time on my hands.

                         STEP
          I just lay around and watch TV all
          day.

                         JOEL
          Yeah,... I think I do a lot worse.

                         STEP
          The problem is, if I bankrupt the
          company, there won't be a job to go
          back to.

                         JOEL
          You don't have to bankrupt the
          company.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          100.

                         STEP
          Yeah, but then if I drop the
          lawsuit, you'll sell the company,
          and the new company might not hire
          me.

                         JOEL
          Well, maybe I don't have to sell
          the company... You know I've been
          thinking; all these years I've been
          building this company, dreaming
          about the day I could sell it and
          retire, but what would I really do
          if I retired? It's like that old
          saying -- it's not about the
          destination, it's about the
          journey?
          Step just stares at him blankly, he lost him.

                         JOEL
          I guess what I'm saying is, too
          much free time might not be such a
          good thing -- like that old saying,
          idle hands are the Devil's
          playground?
          Step's never heard that one either.

                         STEP
          I'm sorry, I don't do much book
          readin'.

                         JOEL
          What I'm saying is, I'm thinking
          maybe I won't sell the company...

                         STEP
          Really?

                         JOEL
          that is, if you dropped the
          lawsuit. -- and remember, you'll
          still get that insurance money --
          probably a couple hundred thousand.
          What do you think?

                         STEP
          Hmm. That sounds fair... But
          under one condition...

                         JOEL
          What's that?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          101.

                         STEP
          You make me floor manager.

                         JOEL
          Deal.
          They shake hands.

          INT. REYNOLDS EXTRACT - MANUFACTURING AREA

          Joel walks in with Step at his side. Addresses the
          employees.

                         JOEL
          Hold the line!
          Mary shuts off the conveyer belt.

                         JOEL
          Okay, listen up everybody.
          (Waits for them to settle)
          I've decided not to sell the
          company...
          Gasps and murmurs among the employees.

                         JOEL
          And I'm making Step the new Floor
          Manager.
          More gasps and murmurs.

                         JOEL
          And if anyone doesn't like it, I
          hear they're hiring over at
          Gemco... But just remember, at
          Gemco, the owner doesn't know your
          names; you never even meet him,
          he's at an office up in Chicago
          somewhere and you get an auto-
          response if you try to email him to
          complain about anything. Here, you
          can come up to my office any time
          you have a problem. Thanks.
          Joel walks off. Brian catches up with him.

                         BRIAN
          Huh? You're not selling?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          102.

                         JOEL
          It's about the journey Brian. The
          journey.
          ANGLE on Mary. She and Gabrielle start right back up.

                         MARY
          You know, if Joel's going to put
          him in charge, we should go on
          strike. You know, at Gemco, the
          union handles the strikes and you
          don't even have to--
          PULL OUT as Step cuts her off.

                         STEP
          Quit yapping and get back to work
          or you're fired.
          Step walks off -- maybe pops a testosterone pill. Mary and
          Gabrielle keep muttering and shaking their heads.
          LONG PULL OUT as things get back to normal at the factory.

          INT. CHAPEL - DAY

          We are CLOSE ON NATHAN, in a coffin, embalmed. We PULL OUT
          to see mourners lined up, taking a last look at the body.
          Joel is among them. He looks down at Nathan for a moment and
          then continues to his seat. A few rows back, we see SUZIE,
          sitting by herself, dressed in black.

          EXT. CEMETERY - DAY

          Quick shot of Nathan's casket being lowered into the ground
          as the priest says the last few words.

          EXT. CEMETERY - A LITTLE LATER

          People hug and console each other. Joel sees Suzie, walks
          over to her.

                         JOEL
          Hi... You doing okay?

                         SUZIE
          Yeah, I'm okay.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          103.

                         JOEL
          I heard you were right there when
          it happened. That must've been
          rough.

                         SUZIE
          It was horrible Joel. He came over
          to ask for that check, and I
          just...
          Suzie breaks down, starts CRYING.

                         SUZIE (CONT'D)
          .I just lost it. I started
          yelling at him. I said horrible
          things. He had an aneurism and I
          probably caused it.

                         (CRYING UNCONTROLLABLY)
          I think the last thing I said to
          him was "shut up." Those were the
          last words he heard.
          Joel hugs her, consoling.

                         JOEL
          It's okay, it's not your fault...
          It's not your fault.
          Suzie's crying subsides a little.

                         SUZIE
          It could happen to any of us Joel.
          Any of us could have an aneurism.
          We could die at any moment.

                         JOEL
          Yeah, I know... I know... But we
          probably won't. It'll be alright.
          Suzie starts to regain her composure.
          They stand there for a beat.

                         JOEL
          You wanna go get something to
          eat... or something?
          Beat. Suzie still sniffling a little.

                         SUZIE
          Yeah, okay. Sure.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          104.
          They walk off towards the cemetery gates. After a while,
          Joel hands Suzie a Kleenex.

                         JOEL
          Here...

                         SUZIE
          Thanks.
          They walk a little further. Joel looks at the Chapel nearby.

                         JOEL
          Maybe we should've been married in
          a Church like that one. Instead of
          the Botanical Gardens.

                         SUZIE
          I thought you liked the Botanical
          Gardens?

                         JOEL
          Yeah, but... a church just seems
          more -- I don't know -- official.

                         SUZIE
          You think it would've made a
          difference?

                         JOEL
          I don't know... So, are we still
          married?

                         SUZIE
          Well, legally yes.

                         JOEL
          I mean otherwise.

                         SUZIE
          Hmmm... We can talk about it I
          suppose.

                         JOEL
          Alright.
          They walk for a beat.

                         JOEL
          You know, this is really bad,
          but... Oh never mind.

                         SUZIE
          What?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          105.

                         JOEL
          Well, as I was looking down at
          Nathan there, I was thinking...
          That's the longest I've ever seen
          him with his mouth shut.
          Suzie LAUGHS in spite of herself.

                         SUZIE
          Joel!
          They walk off into the distance as we

          FADE OUT.



                        THE END
